k490sn,3,2020-11-30,A really bad therapist.,SecretSmooth,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/k490sn/a_really_bad_therapist/,"I suffer from servere bipolar disorder. When I first went to centerstone Bloomington, Indiana. I was given an intern to talk to for about year. She was alright,but didn't know what she was doing.My mental health went downhill. I seriously was do psychotherapy in conference room where people constantly went in and out.Then I had the A.C.T team lead as a therapist. She was awful. I seen her for just seven months. She would no call no show. She did this five times. I was driving 60miles round trip. I lost my first job I held i down in 15 years due to this. I would have a series of panic attacks , wondering if she was going to show up. I would sleep in my vehicle because I had no money to get home. Once I said to her that since you no-call no showed you should give me gas money. She lectures me on ethics and tells me I should grab a gas jug and beg for fuel. They was making me come in every week. I was court ordered. Her excuses for no-call no showed was once an ankle sprain,which was a lie. One time she said she had chrones disease. In she said this to make me feel really bad. That was a lie.I believe one time she was meth? She had meth mosquito bites on face. Can't confirm that.Really can't. That therapist would laugh at my mental health symptoms would refer to me as the weirdo. She would over step her boundries. Once she talked the whole session on how mad she was that her exboy fond a new girl. This really confused me? Oce we talked about beer. I didn't know if she was trying to be my friend. I have suicidal ideations everyday. She was so bad I would call my mother so she could talk me out of suicide after every session. My mother wanted to talk to her. I ask if I could sign a release she says ,I don't talk to mothers.One day I was having a bad day. She calls the police on me after we had a verbal contract that the police would never be called. She drunkenly calls the police on me at 1130pm. She calls me to tell me this . I hang up on her. I knew my life would get difficult. I get kicked out the commune I lived in. I was shunned.I lost all my friends,they was like family for me. They really wanted to see the best of me. Six state troopers do a welfare check ,than proceed to totally mess up my house looking for drugs that weren't there. Luckily I wasn't home.That devastated me. I knew my life was destroyed. I had a nervous breakdown. I was literally walking around Bloomington crying,and yelling and screaming at nobody. I call this therapist to tell her what's going on. I'm literally 24 hrs from a complete breakdown. She laughs. And tells me how I scare people. I'm homeless now. I sit with her for another appointment. She lies to me about a govt program that didn't exist. She countinued to laugh at me. She litteraly told me that if I wasn't a weirdo I wouldn't be homeless. That was really humiliating. She quit the next day without a notice. She quit before she got fired. Another thing almost monthly I would asked her for a new provider. She would manipulate me and tell me that she cared. She could fix me. She fixed me alright. I now and still sleep in my vehicle. It's cold now. The director Greg may tells my probation that I'm no longer a client at centerstone in December 2019. I was going to appointments up untill the middle of February. I was due to get off probation in January of 2020.They was charging my Medicaid. I go to jail for two months. The alful thing about is when I had that bad therapist I continued to ask management at centerstone for change of a therapist when she skipped out on the first appointment. They did nothing. Centerstone and that therapist makes people homeless. My life is a nightmare thanks to centerstone and that therapist. There are now no solutions to any of my problems now. Yes centerstone you are correct, you do deliver care that changes lives."
k499fr,23,2020-11-30,So I asked my manager for resignation from my crappy toxic job,[deleted],antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/k499fr/so_i_asked_my_manager_for_resignation_from_my/,"I'm a new member and I saw a lot of posts about people sharing their experiences, so I decided to share a bit of mine too.

I work as a software developer for a local company, I started as an intern and became a full-time employee. Since my intern times, I was already the main maintainer of the company's most important system, they just threw loads of work on me and forced me to work overtime even this being literally illegal for interns.

In those 2 years working for this company I had lots of breakdowns and overwhelming sensation of tiredness. Worked my bones off for a salary below the average for IT professionals where I live, having to deal with a chaotic work place with toxic people and incompetent superiors. That one time, they forced us to work 8 am to 11 pm from Mondays to Sundays for 3 weeks because they thought it was a good idea to start an enterprise-level project 3 weeks before the deadline.

I snapped this weekend and decided to quit, now I still have to work the next 2 weeks because the law protect the company, forbidding me from quitting whenever I desire to without previous warnings, but I'm already a lot better than before, my gastritis and anxiety are under control, I'm not so stressed anymore.

My boomer parents are already bothering me, they are shocked, saying I'm complete ""p\*ssy"" for quitting, an idiot for choosing being unemployed in times like that and I need to find another job right now, without even letting me have time to recover from chronic stress (ps. I don't even live with my parents in years!).

Anyway, I'm also worried about the future, I don't know if I'm going to find a job anytime soon, but it's liberating at the same time, I hope I can get some rest after all of this.

Thanks for reading."

My wife and I would really like to experience living overseas. She did a year abroad in Germany and we have some close friends there but it depends on where we can get jobs (She is a communication major that does social media and marketing for a nonprofit). I am currently \~18 months from graduating CLU with a computer science degree and I am also currently going through The Odin Project. I have a few questions I would love feedback on.

1. Is it worth it to try and get a job before we move? Even if that means I'm only there for a year?
2. I've read a lot about getting jobs after graduating in the US, what does that look like in the EU? I'm assuming I still need to focus on internships and personal projects?
3. Where should we be looking that we both can be employed?
4. Is there a subreddit that helps with moving abroad?
5. Is there anything I'm not taking into account?

EDIT: Thank you all for the responses. I wanted to clarify a few things and summarize what I've taken away. First, this was never meant to ask if we should move, that is something we are already planning on doing. Also, our move is mainly motivated by a desire to travel and experience new things. It's not really about healthcare or looking for better opportunities. We are also not currently planning on permanently relocating although I believe once we are settled in that could be a real possibility. /r/IWantOut seems like it is going to be a very useful sub but I will have to be careful as I would like to avoid the mindset that I am escaping my life here in the states, we will actually be leaving a really good community behind. My biggest takeaway is that the cs job market in the EU is not as ripe as it is in the US, with some exceptions. I am going to try and get some cs work experience before we move, hopefully at a company that has an EU branch. If not I think we are going to focus our job hunt on the Netherlands (market seems a little riper for expats), Switzerland (higher pay and my wife's closest friend in Germany lives in Konstanz), and London (not the EU anymore I guess but no professional language barriers). I appreciate everyone's input and I'll post again when I have an update."

Here is the fortieth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

k4clgt,19,2020-11-30,"My experience in M&amp;A Tax, PA in general and my background - looking for similar experiences/advice",SignificantTip3443,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/k4clgt/my_experience_in_ma_tax_pa_in_general_and_my/,"I recently joined the M&amp;A tax team at a Big Four firm in a large US market. I know the team's work is comprised of tax structuring projects, modeling of various tax elections/limitations and their consequences, and Sub K work but the large majority of the work seems to be performing buy-side tax due diligence. This process involves getting initial info about the Target company, using that info to identify initial thoughts of complexities/exposures of the deal, creating an SoW/scope of services, request list and estimate of fees based off the complexity of the deal to agree with Client expectations. Depending on any initial red flags and our respective level of fees to perform diligence, the Client may revisit their investment/acquisition plan or not, and the waiting period to receive the ""green light"" from the client to begin diligence has ranged from days to months in my experience. Once you do receive sign off to begin, the process begins with waiting for and receiving relevant detailed financial/tax info from the Target company, performing your analysis/identifying exposures/creating further questions and requests to send to Target. Eventually you will have a call with Target mgmt, tax advisors, etc. to address any outstanding requests/concerns to continue to move the diligence process along in a timely manner. This process of receiving info, analyzing, forming questions/concerns, talking with Target &amp; possibly Client, and repeat continues until proper conclusions on tax exposures of the deal can be reached (while also staying in line with the expected level of diligence and our fee estimates). This is where we will generate a tax diligence report basically summarizing everything we agreed to do, what we were able to do based off the info we received, any recommendations we have, and quantifications of anything material that we can reasonably quantify. Generally, the main point of contact with the Client is the Transaction Services team who is doing the most comprehensive (expensive) part of the due diligence, since tax is just one subcategory of many diligences being performed in an acquisition. This means our report and findings (along with the reports/findings of other subcategories) gets incorporated into the TS due diligence final deliverable report to the Client. Clients may be PE firms or Corporate companies that use the reports in the acquisition process for many reasons such as determining overall viability and strategic alignment of the deal with their objectives, or negotiating purchase price for various exposures identified. It seems to essentially be a watered-down audit of certain areas to give a basis for executing the deal or not.

The group is comprised of &gt;50% JD or JD/LLM backgrounds, with some CPA backgrounds scattered throughout (for the most part, a few lower level staff that began in M&amp;A and then some Managers and above that transferred in from other tax groups after 5-10 years). In a group that uses very technical understanding of tax, it makes sense that a majority of the team would come from law backgrounds or are experienced in specialized areas of tax.

I am a CPA background with only undergraduate degrees and not even a masters in taxation. Through my years in undergrad, I was pushed heavily towards public accounting as most people are. I am a very detail-oriented, structured person. This fact and horror stories of traveling every week, working 80 hours a week in small rooms with audit teams or warehouses performing year-end inventory counts strongly pushed me away from assurance, so I gravitated towards tax. In college, I had a part-time tax internship at a small agricultural based financial services company while taking classes where I mostly prepared individual tax returns.  I then completed a summer internship with a regional firm in a growing ""risk-assurance"" type group (I mostly received this internship out of ""luck"" - they hadn't filled the spot late in the recruiting process and I was just applying for leadership conferences, but the recruiter liked me and got me in). For both of these internships, I hadn't taken enough business/accounting courses to understand hardly anything that was going on, and for the ""risk assurance"" role, the fact that it was a small, somewhat disorganized, piecemeal group led to me not getting much work and overall not having a good learning experience. I completed more accounting/business coursework and learned more what I was doing, then completed a summer internship at my Big Four in a tax compliance based group that was very partnership-based and outside the scope of my 1 undergraduate level tax course. With it being a summer tax internship, the work was insanely light and I knew this going in based off other's testimonials of summer tax internships, but again it led to me feeling underutilized and not feeling like I got a good learning experience. Finally, I went back and graduated with my 150, then worked at a small local firm through a part-time internship doing a little of both audit and tax work while completing the CPA exams. I felt that I was learning the most through this internship because they were pushing me to do audit work I had never done and complete partnership tax returns that I had never done, but the job was just to make extra cash and it was cut short due to the pandemic. I had delayed my start date with the Big Four firm in order to complete the CPA exams before starting and was just using this part-time local firm internship as a way to earn some cash in the meantime.

This all brings me to now, with my reflection on what made me choose to study accounting, my path through internships along the way, and ultimately my final destination in this very tax-technical area of M&amp;A tax that is dominated by people trained through 4+ additional years of law and tax law than what I have.

1. My choice to study accounting

I always enjoyed the idea of studying finance (cash flows and cash management, ratio analysis, projections, capex decisions, etc) more than accounting, but I was told it was more lucrative to study accounting and get your CPA to open doors in both finance and accounting fields, which I still believe was a good decision (also, my school did not allow double majors in business degrees, so I had to choose one or the other - I added on a second bachelors of science in economics which was about the best I could do). I completed both my undergrad degrees in 4.5 years with a 4.0 accounting GPA, 3.89 econ GPA with advanced micro and advanced econometrics courses, 4.0 GPA in all math courses, and overall graduated with honors. While I only attended a state university, I went on to complete all 4 CPA exams on the first attempt with an average in the low-mid 90s. I do not mean to portray any of this in a cocky way as I know many of you have much stronger accomplishments than this, but I hope to demonstrate that I don't believe I am dumb or incapable of being successful in the fields of business/accounting/finance.

Obviously, assurance is the more obvious path in public accounting that deals with financial analysis, but as I previously mentioned, the lifestyle of the typical Big Four auditor wasn't what I wanted (I wish I did because I know it's a fantastic long-term career choice). I figured I could still satisfy this desire with a career in tax because of the old phrase ""every business decision has a tax consequence"", and the fact that tax is a huge factor in cash flow analysis. These are things that come into play when you're making business decisions from a corporate strategy perspective, weighing the tax consequences as an added effect to the decision. However, in practice I've found that public accounting tax and 90% of tax in general is either compliance based, plugging away at returns, or something that requires a law degree or 5+ years of experience to learn the small little complexities of even just one unique area of tax (not to mention that tax laws are guaranteed to change drastically over time). I know any and all challenging and rewarding career paths with potential to make much money require you to learn details that change over time, but I really struggle finding the will to personally study and make a career out of ever-changing tax policy that continually changes based off political influences. I think tax and tax law is INTERESTING and very important for a business to understand and plan for, but I didn't go to law school or intend to become a tax lawyer for a reason, and that's because having a super in-depth understanding of complex lawyer-level technical tax knowledge isn't what I set out to do by studying accounting. All the more power to any tax attorneys out there who are very clearly smarter than me in that regard, you will always make more money than I will because you can do things that I cannot. Tax is a fantastic path for many and I am not speaking down on it in any way, but it's my realization that I doubled down on a career in tax when it did not align with what I wanted to do or what I ultimately chose to study with accounting and econ. I know in any job you can't expect to be an expert right away and I certainly don't feel that I should be, but it is clear this is a situation with a difference in desired responsibility/role on a fundamental level.

2. My path through internships

I have interned at several local firms, a regional firm, and a Big Four firm that I now work full-time for, performing roles and tasks in various areas of tax, audit, and risk assurance. Most of these experiences had me performing mundane work, as you would expect at an intern level. I know an internship cannot be judged as an accurate depiction of a full-time job and that it's impossible to take on meaningful tasks as an intern or any entry-level staff for the most part, but what really has gotten me has been my underutilization. Really only the local firms utilized me at more than a 40% capacity which could also be expected, but it is also crazy to me that bigger firms can't effectively push down work a lot of the time. In my current full-time role in M&amp;A tax, my utilization is lowest of any of the jobs I have had. I was told to expect this early on, since the nature of M&amp;A activity is very up and down and there has been a lot of uncertainty given the pandemic and election, however, it doesn't make the slow periods any less painful. Others have said it took them a full 6 months to be utilized once joining the group. It's a constant balancing act of wanting to get more work and experience and not feel like my time is being wasted, vs my appreciation to be getting paid the same to not do much work while I see others getting slammed with work (I reach out to them to help but I can't help with more than one-off tasks based off how they staff and allocate hours for these M&amp;A deals) and my quickly-developing realization that this group is not a good fit and tax in general doesn't seem to be the right fit. It's like, yes eventually I'll get more work (a lot more work probably), but if it's just stuff I'm not interested in and I don't want to do long term, why would I ask for it and why am I in this? At my level, especially as a CPA background, it seems like almost all the tasks we do are centered around data summarization and admin work. I take notes on initial Target company info and summarize key info/anything that I think seems important (at my level with no law background and minimal experience, I'm relying off just basic intuition and business knowledge to try to identify things that may be important from a tax exposure perspective - yes for financials and tax returns I understand what is presented, but I don't know how it all applies to various areas of the IRC and how it will affect the deal all the time). I prepare draft SoW's and request lists. When the EL is eventually executed, I draft the budget and open up the WBS code. As the deal progresses, I create fee summaries to monitor our fees vs budget and send to my manager. I monitor the data room where Target uploads our requests, summarize that info as best I can and inform our team, manage the Google drive repository for this received info, update request lists, and send to my manager. I prepare internal and external agendas for diligence calls, take detailed notes on diligence calls with Target and tax advisors, clean up and consolidate everyone's notes, and send to my manager. Finally, I'll help draft some sections of the diligence report. Essentially, my job is to make my senior/manager's life above me easier and to do a lot of the mundane work so they can do some of the higher level work to keep us under budget because of our absurd rates. I know this is how all teams work and that the progression is do this and learn slowly through being a senior, and then be able to do that higher level work once you reach the point where you can make manager. But if the reward of progressing through senior is just having more responsibility with these same tasks and then the reward of progressing to manager is becoming more client facing and managing budgets, those are far from rewards for me. And I'm pretty sure that's how I know that this group, but even further, public accounting doesn't seem to be for me - any group I've ever heard of works this way and in general these firms work that way. It just especially seems like in this group, the CPA background staff are used specifically to do this lower level work, which makes sense because they aren't as knowledgeable about the tax technical concepts as a JD/LLM or tax manager with 5-10 years of experience. I am fully aware I am another cog in the machine and I am positive we are cheaper as CPA backgrounds than a JD/LLM background. It's frustrating because I actually fought to be in this group expecting I would have no chance to get it because of my education, and because I didn't want to do compliance and anything with ""M&amp;A"" in the title sounds like it would have to be more interesting, right? Which it probably is more interesting, but it almost seems to me that there shouldn't be many or any solely CPA backgrounds hired straight into the group with no experience. Either way, it has pretty much solidified my belief that tax and probably all of PA isn't the right fit for me.

At this point, I think part of my issue is with client work in general. I feel so much of the work seems to be ""a mile wide and an inch deep"", where I touch a lot of small items and tasks and maybe get a chance to revisit and analyze/learn from it after the fact, but most of the time it's ""push it out the door and get onto the next client/deal"". Again, I know this is how all work is in general - you won't touch meaningful stuff for awhile as an entry level. And PA firms do great things for tons of companies, they're run by all you smart people  that solve complex problems for society. But for me I don't get the same satisfaction out of fixing a problem for someone else's business as I think I would by being a part of the operational and financial analysis of the company, where I can be on the inside feeling like a part of their success (or failure) through financial success, but also by impact on the local community, new product launches, strategic initiatives, etc. Just seems to be another reason why maybe I should have put more thought into PA before riding the bandwagon and diving in headfirst, but who knows. Again, please don't take offense to what I'm saying because PA is a great path and I think you're all better off than me in that you can handle it and learn more than I can.

3. Where I am now

I'm at a point where I believe I led myself down a professional path that didn't align with what I truly wanted out of my educational path. I never really enjoyed any of my public accounting work experiences and never had anything that told me I would be a good fit for tax, I simply chose it because the audit lifestyle didn't sound appealing and I believed I had to go into public accounting, without question. I know I don't want to do tax compliance which eliminates most other tax groups for me to try to switch to, and the group I'm currently in is so niche and specific to complex areas of tax law that I don't feel I'm gaining valuable skills that I could take to another area in finance or accounting. There is a reason that companies hire out due diligence work - most companies don't have enough M&amp;A activity to justify having any or many in-house M&amp;A specialists (general counsel, executives, etc all have the individual pieces of expertise, but they don't specialize in M&amp;A due diligence and the point is to get a third-party perspective). The only way it makes sense to make a profit off it is by centralizing it in a public accounting firm and scaling up the work for many companies, exactly as groups like mine do (and they're good at it or they wouldn't exist). In hindsight, I probably should have just chosen assurance because even if I hated what I was doing, I would know that the experience is relevant to tons of exit opps, but I know there are other paths to go where I don't have to spend that time hating my job for years just looking to the future. To me, those paths seem like taking an entry level job in corporate (not sure what size I'd like to work for as of now, probably large to start). While it wasn't intentional, the lack of transparency in what each team does within tax or even in public accounting in general makes it impossible to make an informed decision, and I feel misled in a way. Yes, the general process of performing some high level analysis, teamwork &amp; collaboration, general project management and process flow, and even picking up some technical tax knowledge could be useful for other jobs I may move onto. But it's all either very general skills or things typically not related to anything that regular finance or accounting roles do. I feel that staying in this specific role for too long will make it hard for me to make the move into an entry level career in finance/accounting since my lack of relevant experience would basically result in me starting my career from scratch again like I had just graduated (I'm thinking entry level financial analyst, credit analyst, treasury analyst, risk management roles primarily). Because of the time I spent finishing the CPA exams after graduating followed by a postponed start date due to the pandemic, I only have a few months of work experience when I graduated almost a year ago now. For many entry-level FADP programs that I believe would have been a great start for what I'm looking for, they only like to hire people that graduated within the last 6 months, which automatically disqualifies me from consideration (but if you counted CPA exams as a continuation of school, I only ""graduated"" 4 months ago). This is part of the reason I'm looking into more specific roles like credit analysis/commercial underwriting or treasury analysis - which I think actually sound quite interesting and could be something I'd excel in given my education and background/interests.

I am applying to other jobs like the ones I mentioned above to get a feel for what is out there and who is interested in me. Even jobs in financial accounting &amp; reporting seem like something that would align better with my interests, but it seems hard to get an entry level job in these areas that doesn't require 2+ years of experience or that isn't a $15k pay decrease. I'm conflicted between wanting to stay a reasonable amount of time and not give up on a job so early, but all the while really disliking 90% of what this job is at its core and knowing that I don't want to do it for a career, AND worrying that the longer I wait to leave, the less attractive I will be for employers since I won't have any more relevant job experience than a brand new entry-level graduate. I know I'm still young and it seems like with my education and CPA that I should be a qualified candidate for a lot of jobs, but it seems like so many ""entry-level"" jobs are requiring 1-3 years of experience and my experience is not relevant to what they want. I'm not going to leave this job without having another one locked up in something that I'm actually more interested in and think I'd enjoy, and I guess if I absolutely had to then I would request to move to assurance for awhile to gain relevant experience to get better exit opps for what I'm interested in, but that would definitely not be preferable.

Just curious for any feedback on my story in general, any similarities to your lives, what you think about my experience, etc. I'm curious if you think my thought process on jobs I may like more and do well at based off my education/interests is framed in a good way or if you think I'm still totally off. I feel that I have enough of an understanding of myself and my story that I could explain how realizing I wanted to leave my first full-time job so early on could be framed as a good thing (that I discovered what my true passions were or at least narrowed down what they weren't). Curious how you feel about my take on tax and my inexperienced take on assurance as well. Please let me know what you think I should do, and if you think my thought process about it all is just totally wrong in any ways - I am just here reflecting and looking for any input/advice I can get.

If nothing else, hopefully somebody reads this novel and gets a better understanding of what M&amp;A tax is in practice instead of just what you're led to believe on the firm's websites - this is exactly what I tried unsuccessfully to find when I was trying to make a choice of tax vs audit and then what specific tax group to try to join. Also maybe it will make someone think twice about what they want to do vs what they're told they should do or what sounds like the right thing to do, and you'll be in a better position than I currently am. Hope somebody enjoys my ranting and self reflection."
k4cq0s,10,2020-11-30,Salary Competitiveness,deathbycoconuts,PwC,https://www.reddit.com/r/PwC/comments/k4cq0s/salary_competitiveness/,"I recently had some friends tell me that their full-time offer at PwC got drastically cut this past summer after their internship (in audit and risk in particular). Let's just say that we are going into an extremely HCOL city in the US and their salary was cut down $6k from the original estimated... The concerning thing is that every other Big 4 did NOT cut their full-time starting salaries in my region for the intern class this past summer and now I'm worried that my full-time offer (if I even get one) at the end of next summer is going to be drastically different from my peers at other big 4. 

My bet is that there's a chance that it will affect my offer letter as well at the end of next summer but PwC has to know that this looks extremely unfavorable for them right? This could seriously screw over the firm's reputation at different schools in the long run and we all know that the firm doesn't want that. 

TL;DR: the interns this past summer had their full-time offers revised downward. Do you think it'll affect my class at the end of next summer?"

I suspect it stems from several things. Starting when I graduated from university. I am a business graduate with a double degree in international business and business administration from a somewhat reputable university. I have multiple internship experiences both domestic and international, so I suspect that I would get a job easily after I graduate. 

Turns out I am in for a surprise. I was applying here and there for multiple entry-level positions with none of the companies I applied for contacting back. After that, I also applied for an internship position which I eventually got. I took the internship program, with hope that would turn me into a full-time employee but after 3 months working there my supervisor and the HR department said that if there’s a vacant position I will be notified. I was waiting for another but there was no information regarding the vacant position, so I decided to resign and back to job hunting. It was January when I resigned from the company. 

Fast forward to May, I got interviewed for a full-time position in an advertising agency. I passed the first interview and then when the second interview came, the HR department told me that I was underqualified and offered me an internship position to which I declined. 

Finally in August I was called by a company in which I applied for an internship position and I was told that I got accepted. I took the offer because most of the people who intern at this company turned into full-time employees. I was treated as a full-time employee which is great and everything is going fine, until my dad told me to apply for another company in which he was a commissioner. We argued and fought over the telephone discussing whether I should resign or not. Long story short I resigned and applied and got accepted and worked for that said company. Was the work fulfilling as the previous company? Hell fucking no. The environment is dogshit, most of the colleagues are above my age group (not that it’s wrong) and hold a very different view with me. The experience of working for that company is driving me insane, I quitted after my contract with said company ended. 

After I quit, I enrolled in a full-course digital marketing (like Lambda School where they will connect you with their hiring partner) and paid $2000 for that. But the pandemic came and until now I still don’t have a job. Which is fucking sucks. I thought of attempting suicide a couple but I am a fucking pussy and don’t have the guts to do it. 

Now, I am feeling like I am a burden for my family which is probably true. I also mutually decided to break up with my girlfriend of 4 years. Anyway, she just graduated and instantly got a job (not gonna lie, this makes me feel like I am just a waste of space. I am happy for her though). I don’t know what to do anymore. My daily routine is just applying for jobs and receiving rejection letters.  I don’t know how long I can hold on."

* I'm an international student
* I will graduate soon in December 2020 (Local state college).
* 1 Internship at a Mid-size company
* Decent at behavior interview and not too awkward at talking or explaining.

During the last month, I have tried to solve about 3-5 leetcode problems every day, so that I can get used to the technical interview. I'm wondering when should I start to apply for a full-time job since I want to apply for all of the big tech companies (FANG...) first before I start to apply for mid-size companies. I believe that I will a full-time offer at some mid-size company if I start to apply and get some interviews with them. 

However, I just don't want to miss out on a chance of working at some of the big tech companies because If I start to apply for some of the mid-size companies and get an offer. I can't keep making them wait until I know the result from those big tech companies.

My biggest problem right now is that I don't feel that I'm good enough or ready for the technical interview at those big companies. I also don't want to wait too long to apply for jobs in general since my OPT will around the end of January, and I will only have 90 days left after that to find a full-time job. 

I wonder what I should do at this moment. Base on what I know or hear from people

1. December is not a good time to apply for jobs since companies don't really look at applications during this time.  Is it true?  If I start to apply for a job now or next week, will I lower my chance of getting a job?
2. People also said that January and February is the time that companies start to hire people the most, so should I just keep leetcode until the end of this year, and start to apply for a job at big companies first and then mid-size after that around January and February?"

Y1 CS student here. I'm wondering what are the potential consequences for not getting a grade of A- and above for CS1101S, which is an important core module for cs students? As this module is not curved, the majority of the cohort will get A- and above as the median score is getting higher every year. As such, getting a B+ and below would mean that you're bottom x% of the cohort and will not appear very positive in your transcript.

Therefore, I'm worried that potential employers may look out for this module in our transcript when applying for internships or full-time jobs, which then affect our chances of securing interview(s) and offer(s) from companies.

Furthermore,  suppose that I scored B+ and below, should I S/U this module to maintain 5.0 CAP if I achieve an A grade for other modules? What are the consequences of doing so as well?

everytime i feel overwhelmed about how much i havent done, i try to look for links online for internships but the prerequisites scare me off as i dont have the knowledge they need me to have. further when i convince myself that i have to learn new things and find courses on links from yt to do them,. i lose motivation pretty easily and the fact that its all online really doesnt help much either. additionally i also have to prepare for entrance examinations and college applications this year in a very hectic 10-6 schedule of the current semester classes.

browsing on linkedin makes me so uneasy bc all peers are doing lots of things while im just stuck in a rut. also i have a habit of starting from scratch and investing myself completely in the beginning and start losing motivation to finish it (which is technically the part people actually would like me to know). and yes i do get stuck in tutorial hell sometimes but i cant make myself move past it. 

i feel like i need more time learning new languages or softwares than it takes other people and the fact that im already so behind while my peers have projects with faculties and internships under their sleeve while i literally dont even think i could do one if given the opportunity is making me more stressed and uninterested in actually finishing anything.

basically im just. really overwhelmed by how much i have to achieve and finish in the near future and messing that up could basically ruin all my dreams and i dont know where and how to start fixing any of this. it would be helpful if any of you could share advice on what i should do or share similar experiences (if any). that would be appreciated alot"

Had been in an internship with a good culture and people for 2 years, and continued working there. There was only one problem with the job - I was only making 60k.  Despite this I was happy and complacent, not really looking for anything.

So I hear from a recruiter on LinkedIn who says they saw me because of one of my connections (who used to work at the only job I've had in CS, pretty crazy). They said they have an opportunity with a new company that is owned by a larger, secure company and it sounded pretty interesting. I decided to look into it and interview not really expecting anything to come of it.

The interview went really smooth and I liked the sound of the company a lot. Even more they offered me 98k salary to work remote indefinitely from my low COL area!

For me this is really crazy. I'm about a year out of school and getting a 40k raise that will put me way above average family income for my area, something I thought was not possible with what companies around here pay.

Take advantage of the growing remote opportunities, don't settle, you can make more. If recruiters reach out to you tell them you are only interested if it's full time remote, don't worry about ""missing opportunities"" there are plenty. I told a ton of recruiters who contacted me before this I wasn't interested in their positions because they weren't remote, or because they were consulting or ""talent agency"" type gigs which we all know are terrible for work life balance.

EDIT: If you are looking for a first job in CS take whatever will get you experience, with the above paragraph I'm talking more about moving on from that in low COL but first you need experience.

I graduated back in May with a math BS, no internships and the intent that I would refresh some programming concepts from classes I had taken and learn those that I didn’t get the chance to take. On top of the typical math reqs, I took intro to CS that used Java, C programming, and discreet math. I really loved each class and did well, but didn’t switch to CS as I was being pressured to finish up and graduate. My goal after graduation was to learn data structures + algorithms, work on some projects and aim for a junior dev position at less competitive companies – as I don’t really want to live in a big city/tech hub.  

With it now being December and having made no real progress, I’m very much considering going to revature or something similar. I have ADHD and thought I could manage the less structured environment outside of school with medicine, but that obviously hasn’t gone well. I’ve tried studying using online resources like coursera or freecodecamp, but it felt like I wasn’t actually making progress so my consistency hasn’t been the best. It feels like I get overwhelmed with picking the ‘best’ way to learn and practice and would do better if I had some guidance. Additionally, my living situation isn’t the best and I’m growing desperate to simply get out – wherever that may be.  

I’ve read about revature, but as I continue to grow desperate I find it more tempting despite the drawbacks. For me, it seems that structure of their “training” (however mediocre it may be) and two years of experience might not be too bad of a starting point. I’m okay with the salary range, though also aware it could be terribly low depending on what location I potentially get if I go through with this. I’m really just after getting out of my situation and getting a start to my career.  

If anyone has been in a similar position or just has some advice, I’d greatly appreciate it! I think I’ll give myself until the end of the year to make a decision."

Hi everyone:)

I am a penultimate (year 3) student in Computer Science, hoping to land software engineering internships at my dream companies.  I am not sure what to include/exclude in my resume and I have just recently switched to a completely new format. I am concerned regarding the last point from my latest internship (the one regarding the increase in revenue), should I exclude it? Should I move my student president section to the ""Experience"" section instead, and elaborate more?

Any further tips/advice for my resume would be very much appreciated! Stay safe everyone!

P.S. Regarding the revenue point, I was in charge for developing the backend, microservices, and database for a light radar web application (project A), which was sold together with a light radar analytics software (project B) for US$2.6 million dollars. Is it okay for me to put this point in my resume, in the way that I did?  


Edit: Typo in resume"

I would like to take the job as I like the company and I have no other leads on employment post-graduation. However, I am hesitant as I have heard it is hard to get out of Help Desk once you enter and it is not my ultimate career goal.

I’m going to apply next Fall semester to the program, but I’m incredibly nervous because I’ve seen threads on here about the admissions process.

I graduated with a 2.6 GPA in CS from a private university- one of the benefits of getting accepted is that you get a tuition scholarship + get to work in a field designated to your major.

I have about 7 years worth of IT experience (currently the IT Director for a high school) and about 4 years worth of programming - specifically Python and some Java. Reviewing my transcripts, some of my core classes I graduated with a C or higher. 

However, I was on the Activities Board for my college, I worked part-time, I actually did an internship / paid research with my college during the summer; I come from a super poor community and actually created some really unique things for them - like a database that tracks community voter registration, etc.

However, I have this gut feeling I’m going to get rejected, so what are some options I can take if that does happen? Can I beef up my application somehow by retaking courses? To those that did get rejected, how many times did you reapply before you got accepted?

Any advice helps, thanks guys!"

Hello, I’m a 20 year old college student who is struggling at the moment (Nothing special lol), but lately I’ve been feeling like my life is going nowhere and that I’ll go nowhere. Idk what to do anymore.

My problem: I literally cannot do things that I need to, I don’t know how to explain it. With the current online classes I, for some frustrating reason, cannot focus on them and I can’t focus on the work and I just simply have no will or motivation to do anything. I’ve tried to force myself to sit and focus and sit and do the work but I just can’t. My brain goes blank and my mind just wonders ( I call it mind surfacing lol, it feels like When your web surfing or watching tv and changing channels) I can’t remember to do things, I always ALWAYS leave something important in my room and have to go back and get it (my mom loathes this) and I forget important due dates. I feel like I’m not actually here, like I’m living in my brain and that my body and life is just moving on it’s own. I feel like I’m watching a movie and I already know how it’s ends. Idk how to talk to people or how to ignite the process of getting help (I.e I can’t afford “therapy” and my insurance is crappy so idk even know what I’m eligible for, or if I really even need help) time is flying by and atp I can’t even tell the difference between days.

As I previously stated im a junior in college who happens to be a stem major, I haven’t had any internships yet and I’m not close to any professors and I feel like I’m going to graduate (if I graduate because at the moment I might lose my scholarship due to me not doing well in the online classes) and just have a degree and no career. I feel like I’m losing a down hill battle and that everyone else is way ahead of me. That no matter what I do and how good I do I’m going to fail at life.

sometimes I feel like maybe I don’t need help and that I’m just overreacting and that if I try to seek help everyone will just dismiss me and my problems (yes I am a black woman and yes it has happened before, not with this issue tho a separate issue)

Maybe I’m just a serial procrastinator who deep down wants to be nothing in life. I feel like the inevitable is just me wasting away and being nothing or no one and alone. 

Idk how this works but I’m looking for advice on how I can work to solve this issue. I don’t want to end up struggling all my life and dying with immense regret, I want to be happy and proud of myself. Is there still hope for me? Can I still be productive? Even if no one responds it feels good that I can put my thoughts here."

I'm in my second year of college studying Computer Science. I have an income of \~13k a year (working part time jobs and internships). My expenses can be summed up by housing (\~250$/month), food(\~150$/month) and ""fun money"" (50$/month). I do not own a car. I also do not have any student loan debt nor credit card/high-interest debt. I do use credit cards (while also paying them in full on-time).

Since I turned 18, I've accumulated 20k worth of investments in my TFSA split between ETFs and one of my bank's investment portfolios. 1.5k of that 20k is invested in a few EV stocks (just for fun). I carry 10k in my checking account, but 6k will be reinvested in my TFSA when 2021 comes around. Should I just buy more ETFs?

I'm thinking of getting into real estate/buying rental properties once I graduate college, but I'm not completely convinced it's the best move. I've also considered building a start-up/side business, but I'm not ready for that quite yet. I've always been on the more frugal side when it comes to money. What other options do I have to maximize long term profits/investment? How can I use my degree to my advantage? Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

# Little backgroud info:

 I graduated in 2014 with an Electrical Engineering degree and a Computer Engineering degree.  I felt kind of burnt out and didn't really apply for jobs and then started a part-time job at my local grocery store to make some money while i was suppose to be job hunting. My little break turned into a few years and i quit that job to re-focus on getting a ""real"" job but i never really applied or did much. Got distracted by various things and before you know it its been 4 years since working so now i have a 4yr job gap and almost 7 years from gradating with no real engineering job experience.

I have done various things over the last few years to get some money; did like ""beermoney"" type things for a year+ (surveys, tasks on mturk, focus groups, etc) and then did some day-trading, sold some designs on Redbubble, did various tech-support stuff for family/friends, etc... mostly just kept getting distracted by the wrong things and jumping into that to make essentially less than minimal wage instead of getting an actual job.  Fell in and out of depression which didn't help my motivation in making job progress but have been getting help with that this year.  I know i am a smart/reliable worker once i get in there but i just need to get my foot in the door so i can let me skills shine

# Target job: 

I would like to someday get into some sort of project manager/engineer type role so am looking for entry level jobs that lead towards that. Am mainly focusing on my electrical engineering degree when looking for jobs. Looking at entry level electrical engineer, entry project engineer, or general entry engineering jobs that can at least get me some meaningful experience.

# Resume:

GPA is below 3.0 so not on it. tried to highlight the FE exam  + my degrees as that's the few things i feel i have that show any of my real abilities.

Computer experience was something added yer ago but not sure how much of it is needed, things like Microsoft office suite to me seems pointless but i see ppl list it still (can do pretty much anything in the suite, not sure which ones to highlight \[maybe change powerpoint for access?\]). In general i'm a fast learner with pretty much any software.

First job is an internship i had back in school which is the only somewhat engineering experience so listed it first then my part-time grocery store job then the hardware job i worked in high school/college. Not sure how to really highlight any experience as most of my jobs seems pretty basic.

The leadership part describes mostly the parts of my senior project that i was responsible for/did. Used to list other things here like team captain for relay for life but i haven't done that in the last 5 years so removed it but not sure what to add in its place if anything.

References: i see most people say its not really needed to add these days, guess need to figure out someway of showing i'm not just a lazy unemployed bum and that i am want and am capable of doing the job.

* Great benefits, really great reviews (4.6/5 on Glassdoor) 
* Rotational program, 3 rotations of 6 months each, take your pick of team at the end
* 15% discount on company stock with a 6-month look-back period

Company B (return offer from internship): 

* 86k base, 10k sign-on, 10% annual bonus 
* Great benefits, decent reviews (3.6/5) 
* Mostly front-end work

&amp;#x200B;

Company B seems like the much better option, but front-end is just something I don't really want to do, and I'm willing to take a decent pay cut for it.

&amp;#x200B;

Both are in the Chicago area, but company A provides a permanent WFH option (they did so before COVID as well). The extra \~13k in compensation from Company B is tempting (extra \~20k for the first year), but I think I’ll learn more, have more fun, and have more work life balance at Company A.

Am I making a mistake by not leaning towards the higher offer here?"

I looked through [r/compsci](https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/) for suggestions (there were a lot of great ones) for projects to add to a resume, but none were really in the real I'm looking for.

I am a Junior in Computer Science with 3 years of Java/Python/SQL experience (mostly on LeetCode) and recently took an Intro to Artificial Intelligence and a Database Concepts class. I noticed many internships that list what those 2 courses cover as preferred experience but they don't expect anything specific.

My question is: What would any of you fine, Ladies and Gentlemen of r/cscareerquestions , consider great projects to merry AI and Databases and add to resume?

In my Intro to AI class, we covered: Alpha-beta pruning, techniques for developing heuristic functions, iterative deepening (I guess this is really just a search algorithm), Naïve Bayes, KNN, Linear Regression, unification of FOL statements (I think this was supposed to be a segueway into ProLOG/DataLOG but it never happened) to a good extant.

In the Database course, we covered: SQL, OR databases and programming them with Postgres SQL, Query Optimization techniques using relational algebra, Map/Reduce and it's use in distributed computing.

I hope this post serves as an answer for people with the same question."
k54s0m,7,2020-12-02,I can't figure out what is wrong with me,Throwawayacccounts,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/k54s0m/i_cant_figure_out_what_is_wrong_with_me/,"So I'm between the age of 30-35. I am high functioning autistic. Before the virus hit I finished my last degree, and now I have a total of 4 degrees. (long story short, I gotten an aerospace degree but the job market collapse. During this time I tried working a number of jobs, but I kept getting fired or was so depressed from working and getting harassed at work I've became suicidal. So instead of doing nothing I went back to school for a general computer degree. This was an AS since I couldn't afford to go directly for a BS. While I was there a teacher mentioned to me that I was only a handful of classes from a networking degree. One of the 2 was a 2x2 into my last degree which is a industrial degree with a focus on cyber security.) The first degree I almost didn't get due to my grades and I was having a hard time in school. For the rest of the degrees I was taken at max 2 classes at a time since that was all I could handle. In fact, at several points I tried working while doing this and I couldn't even handle that. The most I was able to deal with is what I do now. Selling stuff on Etsy using my 3D printer, making YouTube videos once in a while, and a few small things to make some money (like $100-$200 a month total).

Anyways, during my AS I notice when I was able to get something that could get me into something down the road like being an intern. I flaked out on it. Like I did things like made applications for my school and stuff like that. But those were 1 off things.

After getting into my BS I found everything was going good and my grades were good enough. I did at one point try more than 2 classes on my technical side and my grades dropped to the point where I almost gotten kicked. But as long as I kept it down to 2 classes, my mental state seemed to be at least to the point I could keep up with the test (it should be noted even with this I had to cheat in a number of classes even when taking 2 classes at a time). The reason why I'm bringing this up is towards the end of my degree I had to take a lot of stupid classes like one on weather, another in microeconomics, and a few others. Because I spent so many years in school and I just wanted it over I did a full 4 classes back to back for 2 semesters. This 10000% burnt me out, and I literally had to beg my teachers to pass me. If it wasn't for a mixture of cheating and begging to pass, I know I wouldn't of made it.

Shortly after I gotten out I found out even with a degree no one still wanted me. I tried using my contacts a few times, and found many companies flaked out during meeting me or when they found out I'm autistic. Even with applying to higher end jobs than the manufacturing jobs I applied for in the past. I found in some interviews I was harassed for how I talk and think. Like flat out picking on me and laughing about it. In some jobs they kept lying about oh we are looking for x (coder, network, etc) and the people trying to help me said I can do x y z. And then they would interview me for 100% different job.

Around this time I tried to enact my backup plan which was to go into the military. I found out the military literally has policies from autistic people from joining. My dad looked into it since he had connections to major generals, and more than less the policy was put in after a few autistic people were harassed to the point some offed themselves and some were hurt so badly that there is an investigation on it still today. So it's more to protect us than anything else. And it was made in such a way that even if you did get in, you have to get it OK with every commanding officer, and pretty much anyone in the unit can make a stink about it which would end up getting the person kicked out. Like it's better for that than the person getting hurt or dying.

After this I started looking into things because it didn't make sense to me. I did everything that was asked of me. I stayed away from drugs, crime, etc. I actually went through college even when my teachers in HS said I shouldn't be able to graduate HS. I stuck out what jobs I could and only quit 1 job, but that was by force. And while I did get fired from many, I went out of my way to show I knew how to code and what not. Anyways, I came across studies saying people who are autistic and have degrees are 85% likely to be unemployed or underemployed. And I found studies on how the UK looked into how much of the homeless is autistic, and they found around some of the cities it was 65% or more. Then I found it was highly common for autistic people to be abused in work places and other places.

I brought a lot of this up to my parents because it was looking like I simply am not going to get anything that will put a real dent in my life. Like beyond the fast food/retail industry. They agreed I can stay with them as long as need, but we made a plan. Where they would buy a farm and have things contracted out. That I would help them get it up and running, and keep things up. And I can be the farm manager. While this does make me happy, it should be noted that it's estimated that it will take close to 10 years before I would get a livable wage. Just harvesting the crops it will take 7 years for much of it to mature to that point.

Anyways, what brings me here is I'm having a hard time figuring out what is wrong with me. The other day I found a basic help desk job on indeed that I could get if I put in for it and it wasn't already taken down (maybe, some of these they hire people with multiple years of experience because the job market in my area is so poor). My anxiety shot up to the roof and I was extremely suicidal. And this was simply for seeing there was a job I realistically could get. And this that happens isn't anything new.

So my anxiety is always up because I know if my parents get tired of me or want to just because. There isn't a single thing I could do to prevent myself from being homeless since I don't have the money/income to support myself. And then when it comes down to looking for any job and seeing there is one I could work (even part time), if I had a gun next to me I wouldn't be talking to you now.

**What is wrong with me? And don't give me the crap that there isn't anything wrong with me. This isn't normal.**

Note, there is a number of other things going on and a bit of info I didn't talk about since I don't think it relates. Like how even today I'm trying to work on doing independent product development and a number of other things (but none of it has made me anything). I mean something that might relate is how my entire family outside of my dad's parents, my parents, and maybe 2 or 3 others 1000% hates my parents and I. I believe it is due to my sister lying about us. And the only thing I ever wanted in my life since I was a kid is a stable family and stable life. But the details going beyond that, I doubt it relates."

(Senior),PM_ME_KRABBYPATTIES,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/k56jcr/finally_got_an_internship_senior/,"Hello fellow csmajors, this post may be a little bit different than most on the sub. I am currently a senior in cs and I finally received my first internship at a small AI research lab. As I said, I am a senior. I transferred into CS as a sophomore at my college and am still graduating on time, however with the lack of major classes and honestly a lack of passion I never tried to apply for any internships until discovering this subreddit this past summer. Over the last 2 years, throughout my classes and the people i've met I've grown to love CS and couldn't imagine trying to get into any other field. 

After reading the subreddit for awhile, I took my chances and started applying my junior year summer. I got a couple of final round interviews but hadn't prepared enough on leetcode and didn't get an offer and I was severely discouraged. Move on a week or two and I started to continue applying, then when school started I started my newgrad applications and have been doing that ever since. Well about a month ago I applied for an AI lab that I thought would be a great fit for me and lo and behold, I got the position and I start in a few weeks. 

I just wanted to shoot a thank you here to everyone, although times are hard, your guys' passion and motivation has kept me going and I was finally able to land something, although not a new grad position,  that I really am thankful for. 


And to the younger guys out there, life is coming fast and it's always great to prepare but please remember that your mental health and well-being should be your top priority! You got this!"

And more than half of the time, they are far ""better"" than me. And then I feel sort of bad.

Then I go to more positive subreddits (like this one) and people here talk about how all those stats are definitely fake and those who are real are doing so to gain praise. I also see a lot of people discussing how toxic those subreddits can be.

And then I fell good. I feel like I might have a teeny, tiny chance of getting in my dream uni. But then a part of my brain says, ""What if all these people are jealous of all those high achieving people on the other sub? Don't listen to them. These peope with 1600 SAT score, perfect GPA and 20+ research projects and internships are real and you are not getting in, bish.""

So I just go back to sipping my tea and doing math work.

It's just weird and makes you feel stupid.

k58j0i,3,2020-12-02,What are sophomores meant to be doing?,Bootlicker21,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/k58j0i/what_are_sophomores_meant_to_be_doing/,"What on earth are sophomores meant to be doing right now? The internet seems to bombard me about all the cool internships people are getting, all the amazing clubs people are joining and all the crazy contests people are participating in. And well, im starting to feel like a worthless pile of trash. 
Looking around me, what my university offers and what my peers are doing I don't seem to be doing anything wrong. But it nevertheless feels like I am missing on so many opportunities and that before I know it I will turn into an unemployable disgrace to humankind.

Im seeing a couple of possibilites:

• Becoming a TA - Feels very boring and unauthentic to do this just to put it on my CV.

• Taking extra courses - Makes me nauseous to even think of having more exams. Not that I do not like learning but I prefer self-learning.

• Internships - This one sounds fun but I have no clue whether I am meant to do this as a Sophomore since all emails I get about internships from my university specify that I should be in the last year of my degree.

• ACM-ICPC - I am kind of bored of competitive programming. I realized solving puzzles for the sake of solving puzzles is not my cup of tea anymore. I find creating real software much more interesting.

• Clubs - Basically non-existent in my university.

The thing is I am not even a bad student at all. My grades are pretty high, I am an IOI medalist, I've been programming since I am 12 and I love it, I'm always working on some pretty cool side projects that I keep to myself, I was once football captain at my school so I am also quite outgoing. So I'm a pretty decent programmer and I still feel inadequate. I imagine more people are feeling this way? I am studying in Europe by the way. Maybe what I see in the internet is mainly what happens in the US. I think I could have gotten into a better university if I wanted to but I just picked the one I picked because I wanted to learn the language in that country, it is still a pretty good university.

I have always been reluctant of doing things just to put them on my CV but I am starting to feel that just being myself won't get me anywhere. Maybe I'm just immature and I should grow up and just start licking boots and assholes, and start putting together a cookie cutter CV just like the internet tells me I should. Participating in all those fancy activities that sound good in a resume, but that in reality are just a bunch of kids pressured to impress future employers. And of course a very tiny minority that genuinely enjoys it.

But yeah basically that I feel I have quite some talent but I'm wasting it by working on side projects by myself instead of doing stuff to put on my resume. What are we sophomores meant to do so that we aren't left behind?"

But before he does he wanted me to know the fundamentals and certain things. He gave me some scenarios and I was wondering if someone could tell me how they would approach it and answer it. I already did research on google and YouTube but I thought I would ask here just in case I missed anything. 

1. What would I do if a user comes to me with a laptop, it doesn’t work and wants me to help? 
2. How would you save files if a computer won’t boot
3. If there’s a virus then how would you clean it

As I’ve said I’ve researched and saw how to fix these but just wanted to see if anyone else could add more and say something that I’ve maybe missed."
k5a8b4,1,2020-12-02,Best way to spend the summer for an international incoming CS grad student,throwaway-1234567892,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/k5a8b4/best_way_to_spend_the_summer_for_an_international/,"Hello, hope you all are doing well! 
I am an international OMSCS student transferring to the MSCS Atlanta campus from Spring 2021. I have 3.5 years of experience, with 2 years working as a software engineer in a start-up.

Since I'll be in F-1 status starting from Spring 2021, I won't be able to do any off-campus internship in Summer 2021. This is a sad thing for me since one of the big reasons for my switch to MSCS on-campus is to secure a software engineer role at a big tech firm after graduating.

So I've been wondering how to best utilize my time in summer which can boost my chances to get a good job after graduating. 

1. I've looked into the summer classes, but I couldn't find many systems courses offered in the Summer (I'm interested in specializing in Computing Systems), and also it would be very hard to secure a GTA role for me in the summer due to less number of classes which means I need to pay tuition.

2. I have already secured a GTA for Spring, but my professor doesn't take courses in Summer - so maybe I can ask him to consider me for a GRA in summer if we're on very good terms and I'm ready to work on some of his projects? I am not sure how likely that is. Has anyone done this?

3. Go to my home country and relax. I don't think it's a good idea with the current pandemic situation affecting flights, and this might be waste of time. But this would save me the cost of living on-campus.

4. Apply for some internships in my home country. I am considering this option. Also, I'm considering applying for GSoC while at home. Has anyone tried this?

Please let me know if you guys have more ideas, or you tried out some things while at Tech which I'm unaware of (like working for startups in Tech, ...). I'm ready to bear the cost of living on-campus if it can really help my job prospects.

Thank you very much for your help!

My original plan was to not try to get an internship this summer but the following after(junior going into senior year). But now I’m wondering if it’s still possible to apply to internships next year(like March or April) and secure one for this summer? I feel as having 1 internship on my belt would make it a lot easier to get another one in my junior year. My goal is to have a few projects up on my resume early next year. Perhaps not an internship from big tech companies like google but from smaller ones.

Recent college grad (22 y/o) currently in entry level tech sales, looking to make a career switch to SWE.

I have a BS degree in Economics from a US top 3 public university. I took the intro coding class (C++) during my junior year, and just started learning Python from the beginning right now. To keep it simple you can just say I am starting from zero.

I do not want to stop working while studying... I am looking to explore my options and want some help on what would be best going forward and if anybody had some anecdotal experience to share.

1. Self study entirely: I am a bit confused on how this would play out. I have heard that if you can learn Python and answer Leetcode you can get a job, but I have also heard that knowing Python alone going into your first role may not be enough—what is the reality? How long would this path realistically take? 
2. OSU CS Post-Bacc: It’s a 60 credit program where you graduate with a BS in CS—the recommended track takes 2 years. I could probably finish the core CS classes (intro, intermediate, data structures+algos, discrete) in 9-12 months. That much would at least run me 7-9k in tuition—would that be worth it or enough to start applying for full time roles or at least internships?
3. A coding bootcamp: Have heard opinions on both ends of the spectrum, from it being useless to it being a life changer. Some also have interesting payment plans where they take a percentage of your starting salary post bootcamp... Problem is that it is (usually) a full time commitment...

Thanks!"

So I am starting my new position this January with a cool big credit card company with great compensation. (I graduate this December from undergrad CS).

My concern is I'm in the process of team placement. And I feel like in my experience, I have exclusively done low level coding. I never really learned/used the MongoDBs, .NETS, any of the SQL's, or Docker stuff. In all my internships I just kinda implemented APIs and coded in C++, C, and sometimes Python. All in a unique codebase the companies made. But i just worked on already established stuff. Im good at learning quickly but I just don't know the lingo that's thrown around sometimes. I know jack about front end too, never touched JS,CSS,etc.

I just feel weird not knowing these technologies at all. So I am trying to write a elevator pitch to the teams but its weird just saying, ""Hi I'm... and I've coded a lot in C++ C and Python."" without mentioning any frameworks they have listed. I just know how to code. 

TL;DR: Got a job at big company. I know how to code, I guess I'm backend. Never used any big name frameworks or technologies other than just pure coding languages. How do I pitch myself to the teams in my job I'm starting soon?"

This December marks 1 year and 2 months of job searching (roughly 600+ applications), and while I understand this is likely due to Covid, ultimately it still means I am unemployed. 

I am considering getting a postbacc in CS. Wondering what opinions are out there considering my situation. Listed out some pros and cons I thought of, but would love to hear other perspectives.

Pros:

* Ability to network with people through coursework/internships
* Better CS fundamentals
* More Defined Goal/Direction
* Suggested by my parents (financial support)
* Potential internship opportunities otherwise unavailable to me
* Opens up more job types I can apply to (outside of JS/React + whatever I learned this year on my own)

Cons:

* More money on loans 
* Another 1-2 years of school
* Alma Matter Doesn't accept postbacc apps, would have to search for other programs
* No guarantee job search will improve after completion
* Being dirt poor for another 1-2 years"

Sure, I know what C++ is and what data structures are, but it ends there. I have no idea how to start with hackathons, I have no idea how the heck u learn and apply things like SQL, nor do I know anything about things like MongoDB except that it sounds like a Mango.

And, I have no idea how the CS internship recruitment process really works; I have no idea where to start with even getting prepared.

I’m just really lost on where to start my journey, as I have no idea how to even get started on a side project. Additionally, I have no real knowledge of how to start the process of getting a CS internship.

But I’m really passionate and I want to genuinely start my journey.

Decent. Definitely carried my application.

**Other Schools:** MIT &amp; Stanford (both deferred)

I’m a college freshman, as you can see, and I am in need of some guidance. One internship recruiter said that there is not a great job market for electrical engineers focusing on hardware and suggested that I should focus on software and look for a controls engineer internship. I would love to do this but what I was wondering is if I decided to minor in computer science but focus on cyber security, would this decrease my chances of landing any sort of Electrical engineering or controls engineering internship/job? It may sound like a dumb question, but I have a chance to land an internship in Electrical Engineering this summer and a chance of a Cyber Security internship later on and I wanted to get some opinions"
k5less,3,2020-12-02,i am at the lowest point of my life. im unsure what to do,potscotch,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/k5less/i_am_at_the_lowest_point_of_my_life_im_unsure/,"i cannot think for a single minute without thinking of something stupid i've done in the past. it was always pretty bad, but after i started working (1 year ago) it's become so hard that i cant bear to stay alive anymore. like i legit want to die i cant see a way out. ive developed a tic about 8 months ago that still has not gone away where its triggered when i think of something cringey i did (which is always so im always going around looking like a heroin user) its honestly awful. i wouldnt wish this on anyone. since i cant think of my past without it hurting i never do, and as a result i have horrible memory. i cant remember anything once it goes after 3 days. all the days are blurring together as a result. its taking over my life to the point where i cant work (im typing this when i should be working) or draw, i force myself to sleep using benadryl.

i fucked up so much during my first job, i still work at the same place. (not counting internship) my job is animation related. its been a year since i started. right now we work at home due to covid. i look back and i cant even imagine how i did those things. its awful. ive dozed off in meetings (as an intern), and as the very person whose work was being critiqued. ive been late to my job multiple times when i was working there in person. im also bad at my job but they still keep me around bc the union forbids them from just randomly firing people. ive changed the script i was working on without permission then was rebuked for it. ive cried in my office just to realize later that the door was very not soundproof. i told my partner once i worked overnight then she told the leader and he rebuked me for doing that. i dressed like shit to work a lot bc i was so fucking depressed. they had a lot of expectations for me when they hired me but ive done so many stupid things just so many things. i wasnt rude or anything but thats the minimum. the more i write the more i realize im just a giant ass child who still needs help wiping their own ass.

during march i took a month break from company bc my mental health was so fucking bad i coudlnt even work. it was awful it was really the lowest ive ever been. i didnt even let them know in advance. i dont even want to elaborate on it it was so painful. my grandfather committed suicide that month but i couldnt even concentrate on that bc i was too busy thinking about my job and shit like that. 

i was able to get help during the month off because my work insurance finally kicked in. i got therapy which didnt help at all so i quit after about 6 sessions. i received meds which worked, by basically castrating my emotions. it felt nice because i didnt feel anything, i just felt like a robot, which wasnt too bad for me. but after that the meds effect wore off. it gets me out of bed and makes me less tired, but that's it. ive tried lots of other meds but this med is the one that works best for me. the doctor tried increasing the dosage but it made me so tired that i decided it wasnt worth it.

i somehow didnt get fired and i still work at the same place to this day (now we work at home due to covid). i still suck at it, and i dont think the higher ups like me at all. they just put up with me. theyre never rude to me in person and even compliment me sometimes but i know for a fact that they have really high expectations and rank people based by how well they work. i know that i'm definitely the worst or maybe the second worst with some padding. 

this is the biggest thing- i worked on the first episode of an animation reboot basically by myself, right after i started. this was my first art job in a studio. they gave me the very first episode of the show to work on. im not sure why, they knew i came straight out of college. i failed. i really did. it was horrible. after i turned it in the leader fixed it by himself, he spent a week on it fixing it. then he lost all his work, because of a mistake he made. due to that, the episode, that was ruined by me, then had to be sent the way it was to an overseas company to be animated. its been a year since then. i heard that the animated piece has come back from the overseas company two days ago. no one has spoken about it on the team discord. i imagine that it was so bad, that the leader didnt even bother to let people know bc he didnt want them to see it. just awful all around.

everyones going to look at the reboot because its a reboot of a popular show. people will hate it because its a reboot, and especially because of the awful first episode. the first episode script was already kind of bad to begin with, and then i made it even worse. people will spend weeks online bashing on it and making youtube videos about how much the reboot sucks. probably with screenshots of the stuff i personally drew. 

i hate myself so much all i can think of always is just how much i hate myself and want to die. i feel like theres no way out. i feel that i should quit my job, but im so scared, and also the show im working on feels too personal to me because people there were so fucking patient and kind with me and taught me a lot of stuff, also its my first job, and its a very new show (even though its a reboot) so i was basically working on it throughout its inception till now. i feel like i cant deattach myself. even if i do i feel like i would be semi blacklisted in the industry just bc how fucking incompetent i am. i sure wouldnt be able to ask for a rec letter with a straight face. i feel like i ruined my life already. ive made so many bad choices. im having a lot of trouble working from home because of my ADHD. ive been turning in incomplete work. just so much fucking shit going on. i could literally off myself today, but i worry that my parents will kill themselves or something, so i dont. i feel so stuck like if i was pregnant or something and couldnt get an abortion. i feel stuck here with my life. i dont know how to move from here. none of my friends respond to me anymore when i say that i want to kill myself. i dont blame them theyre probably just tired too. i just wish i would die in my sleep or something im atheist but i pray that i will die before going to sleep im so pathetic that i just want all of this to be over.

i gave up everything to be better at my job, i threw my switch away, i stopped gaming, i stopped talking to my friends, i study but i can never get better. other people do it so effortlessly though and i feel so stupid and worthless. i daydream about giving my money and stuff away to people who need it before i kill myself. if i were to do that many people would be really happy with their new stuff, and that would be more worthy than any worth my life has ever had up to this point."

I need help choosing an internship between Mongo and FB. I’m not looking at TC/compensation at all or new grad opportunity/TC as well since I plan to go full time at another company I’m interning at next fall.

I really want a fun and impactful internship where I can learn a lot while contributing a ton of code and ppl say the experience at MongoDB is amazing for interns in that regard. Its also in NYC which I wanna try out for a short time.

However, I really want to try to work in AR/VR and I think working at Facebook Oculus would be amazing. I also think that working at Instagram for stories or the feed would be great too and would love to try out iOS dev as well. But at the same time, I dont want to get unlucky and get placed on a boring team at FB like ads or internal tools. 

What should I go with?

While i am interested in the realm of data science, i do not know which aspect of data science i prefer. I do not have much experience in both fields, and while i know both are different, i do not know where do the differences lie. This led me to ponder about the positions, and their future prospects, with regards to the learning and career. These are the job responsibilities for both roles:

Analytics Intern under a research team in university:
• To support on labelling and processing of various industry-related data 
• To organise various datasets to specified requirements for use as input to predictive machine learning
• To contribute and feedback on insights regarding accuracy, completeness and organisation of datasets

Data Engineer Intern in a SME (some are points taken from the interview):
• Maintain our data inventories, collect and clean the data we have gathered from various sources to make sure of the integrity, completeness and usefulness of our data.
• Building data pipeline from different data sources
• Web crawling or scraping in python

While both positions sounds similar, I am not sure about the learning outcome. I want to pursue a career in the data industry but I am not sure of the difference in both roles. I am also aiming to apply for a Machine Learning Engineer Intern in an AI startup firm after this internship, and hope what I will learn now will help me build up experience. Can someone enlighten me please? I would like to know the difference between a data engineer and analyst, their career prospects and what they do on a daily basis at work. Thank you in advance!"

Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:

The grant is for 600,but I can go under and spent the rest on accessories, or go over up to 800, maybe even 900 with my own money. USA and USD

Are you open to refurbs/used?

Nope, tried it once and it sucked

How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?

Form factor, probably 14 inches or less and not a thick laptop
Build quality- needs to not be crap, better is nice
Performance-very important, gpu needs to be good enough for a engineering and cs student, not to game on

How important is weight and thinness to you?

Its nice to be thin and light, and I'd pay a little more, but not a huge amount

Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.

14 or less, maybe 15

Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.

CAD, Coding, I used selenium for an internship this summer and it killed my laptop, so at least 16gb of ram and a good cpu

If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?


Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?

Decent keyboard, 16gb of ram, 256gb ssd, but 512 would be nicer

I am about to finish my last semester with enough accounting credits to sit for the CPA exams, but I'm taking an advanced tax class that's driving me insane. It's just been that final straw on the camel's back that made me realize that I really don't think accounting is for me. I've had doubts for a long time but I figured it was the safe route to go while I figured out what I really wanted in life.

But at this point, I've done two internships in public accounting and I don't know how to pivot. I have a FT offer for a B4 office starting next summer, and my original plan was to get my CPA exams out of the way before I start my FT job, but now I'm wondering if I should instead try to apply for other types of jobs/internships so I can change career trajectories. Hell, or even go back to school for a master's.

Is it possible for me to still pivot at this point, and how would I market myself to non-accounting role employers as someone with primarily an accounting background? I'll be getting a bachelor's degree in business administration, so I know something of the other aspects of business, but accounting was my focus.

Or should I suck it up and get a year done in accounting to get some experience before pivoting out of there?

I’m really starting to regret choosing computer engineering. It feels like the only job I have a chance at getting is as a software engineer despite also taking classes in computer architecture, digital signal processing, computer vision, data communication systems, circuits, electronics, and embedded microcontrollers. It’s not that I dislike software engineering, but I feel like I wasted a lot of time becoming so well-rounded for nothing. From what I’ve found online all these other options either require higher education or have no entry level positions posted. At this point I’ve been looking into ethical hacking online as a career path because studying for the CeH is the only form of flexibility available to me.

I have applied to so many jobs on LinkedIn it hurts. Only two have been for embedded systems, whereas everything else has been software engineering. Covid is killing my motivation. I remember last year looking at so many interesting entry level positions and being excited and now there are so much less. I’m limiting myself to jobs in Illinois (primarily Chicago) for personal reasons so I understand that there will be less positions available to me but still. 

I don’t think my qualifications are a problem. I have a 3.9 GPA, am in two honor societies (tau beta pi and eta kappa Nu), and had a software engineering internship with the U.S. department of energy. My boss gave me a glowing referral and certificate of achievement and posted them on my LinkedIn profile. 

It feels like I’ve worked so hard for nothing. Why did I spend so much time learning these other subjects when software engineering is the only one available to me? My current plan is to stay in industry for a few years then go get my masters in computer vision or architecture because those are the subjects that interest me the most. 

If anyone could answer some of the questions I have posted below I would greatly appreciate it. Should I try to do a solo project as a further resume booster during the break? When applying for jobs what keywords should I use for my experience level? LinkedIn’s entry-level filter is borderline useless. When I see jobs with the label “new grads”it seems that they’re talking about people who have already graduated (I still apply just in case). Should I look into startups? They sound interesting but risky. Am I overreacting because more jobs will come in the spring for upcoming graduates? Is cyber-security interesting? I understand it’s an umbrella term but I’m open to anything at this point. If anyone has any other advice I would really appreciate it!"

I have a final stage interview somewhere next week, but I also have late-stage interviews at other companies later on in the next month. If I were to get the job offer next week, which I think is likely since someone on the inside has been helping me with very specific prep so far, would there be any consequences to decline this offer in a months time if I get an offer somewhere else?

The company I have an interview at next week is in my top 6 places I want to work at and they'd offer me the highest net salary but that's not my concern at the moment. There is one other place that would expose me to more technologies which I would really love to be a part of but they're interviewing me at a later date.

Curious to hear thoughts about this from more experienced devs. And I know someone will probably say that I haven't got any of the offers yet so I shouldn't worry about it, but in the hypothetical situation that I get both offers, what would you suggest? Thank you."

I actually think my essays were really strong! I used one essay (what do you want to major in and why) for a few schools, as that question kinda only really had one answer.

My personal statement was about growing up somewhat detached from my racial and ethnic identities, reconnecting with them, and how that impacted me.

My UChicago essays were great imo, I was really specific in my Why UChicago essay, applied it to my life and what I want to do in the future. My Uncommon essay was unconventional, which was my goal, but related back to me and a part of my application that I didn't explain in detail elsewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

k608qu,1,2020-12-03,I need some advices about interships (research vs industry),poiremasquee,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/k608qu/i_need_some_advices_about_interships_research_vs/,"Good morning everybody ! To start with, I am currently enrolled in a **Computer Engineering** bachelor in Canada, but I thought that since this subreddit is more active than the CE one, I might ask for advices here, plus both fields are not that different.

**English is not my native language, I apologize in advance.**

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently in my second year, the whole bachelor takes 4 years of studies. I am really interested about Computer Architecture, SoC's and I really loved my FPGA design course this semester. I am currently in an ""intership"" with a Prof. from my university.

By ""intership"" I mean that I am involved in a small project with one of my teacher : use a high level programming language in order to do some RTL description, instead of using Verilog/VHDL. The main objective is to find out if using high level programming language has more advantages than what we may think, and I am implementing an architecture from my teacher's paper.

&amp;#x200B;

**I am not really interested about** having a career in **Software Engineering**, for different reasons. I really want to work in a hardware related field, maybe Embedded System ?

&amp;#x200B;

So now my dilemma : the teacher that I am working with offered me a research internship for next Summer (4 months internship), as part of  **NSERC** (Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada) program. The internship will be paid, not that much (kinda like research in general eh?). Its not something that is common for undergrads to be part of a research internship so it might be nice on my Curriculum, especially since I am planning to go and get into graduate studies after my bachelor, in a top-university (in Canada, such as uToronto or McGill or in US).

The research internship will be about the same project that we are currently working on. The teacher is quite pleased with my work and he would like me to write a paper with his assistance.

On the other hand, I am thinking about getting an internship in the industry this summer, companies including Intel, AMD, Nvidia, Xilinx, Microchip might be suitable. But since I am only a second year student, I might not be capable enough to get an internship at those places.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Should I get into a research summer intership in order to gain some experience about system design and research as a second year student, or should I get an industry internship in order to gain experience about the industry ? Considering the fact that I am planning to continue my studies after my bachelor. My main concern is that if it might be harder for me to get an intership in the industry next year if I have no prior industry experience and ""just"" research.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your advices."

I was recently admitted into the program for Winter 2021 and I was able to transfer credit to fulfill CS 161. The course I'm transferring over was taught in Java, but I went through Python on Codecademy and am currently reading through Think Python and the CS 161 course materials (no access to assignments/projects/quizzes though) on Canvas. A little bit of background on me, I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering and have some experience programming during internships and my current job (in SQL and VBA), but nothing extensive in Python other than using it as a MATLAB alternative for computation.

**Do you think it would be beneficial for me to still take 161 in my first term of the program or do you think it would be a better use of my time to go straight into 162?** I've heard about how 162 assignments tend to be a significant step up from those in 161 so I'm a little worried I might be under prepared if I skip 161. Also, I'll be taking 225 my first term as well so 161 would probably be a better pair than 162. Let me know what you all think and thanks for the help!

EDIT: Forgot to mention my company is paying for the program so cost isn’t an issue!"
k61dk3,0,2020-12-03,To defer or not to defer?,bauhausmcgee,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/k61dk3/to_defer_or_not_to_defer/,"That is the question.

Some background: I'm currently at a public university studying computer science. I'm on track to graduate Spring 2021, but before my current school I was pursuing a completely different major (biology and later math) at a private university. 

Long story short, after some time away from school (i'm currently 27), and because I had all those credits, all I needed to do was finish a major. I started my CS major back in Spring 2019, so this will technically be the second year I'm learning the material, but I've finished the entire major program in just two years opposed to the four it takes most undergrads. 

Because of this, by the time I was remotely confident enough to apply to places to intern, the hiring season had passed and the next one was, well, this one. I've applied to entry level SWE jobs and have been rejected from two after being !nterv!ewed so far. 

My gpa is decent (3.7), and I have job experience at my school as a TA for an OOP course, and a data structures course. Additionally, some other leadership experience bringing a CodePath course to my school, and some projects on my github.

My question is: should I defer graduation and try to nab an internship before I split or just bite the bullet, graduate and take my chances in the new grad market?"

I did a lot of research of what to ask before an internship start, to prepare the most that I can for it. I’ve asked the HR about housing (answered, someone from the plant I’m working at will assist me with it), transportation ( last year, all the interns carpooled), dress code ( I got sent a document, I’m still iffy abt it because I’m female, and I honestly have no idea what to dress like, blouse and blazer? They just say that the requirements are steel toe boots, and no tanks). Lastly, I asked for a former intern’s email, for extra questions. What do you think from experience I should ask? 

-&gt; How is our Supervior like?
-&gt; How is the work environment? 
-&gt; The dress code is apprently casual to business casual, but I’m not sure am I going to have to get down in some heavy machinery to fix parts, or am I mostly going to be conversing with people, and working with a computer? ( this way I know whether or not should I wear white blouse [computer job], or like a black polo [working in the plants])

Also, how should I phrase my email? I don’t want to sound like a bother and just negging to get my questions answered... I also want to establish good relationships with everyone at my internship place..

I would greatly appreciate anyone who can give an awkward engineer student some help!"

I just finished an interview that went pretty well, and my interviewer said she was impressed with the test they gave me prior to this interview. The position is for a company that provides b2b tech solutions, where one company would approach this one with a project they'd like built, and then this company builds a team around their budget and timeframe to build the project.

&amp;#x200B;

The job posting says that Java and Angular are required, neither of which I have experience with. I didn't lie or suggest that I had experience, and expected that the interviewer would ask me why I applied without that experience but they didn't. Instead, she assigned me a project using Java, Angular, Spring Boot, and JHipster to then be demoed for her and the CTO Monday.

I've obviously put myself in a tough spot. I can't decide if I should clear my schedule and try my hardest to put something together for Monday, or reach out to remove myself from consideration. I've sent 410 applications out to date, so any chance I get is very important to me, but then I also have to consider what happens if I manage to wow them and get the position. With them expecting me to complete a project like with these technologies I don't have experience in, it goes to reason that I would be expected to be able to hit the ground running with these languages and technologies when I start with them."

And how did it turn out?

This is what I want to do. Instead of just teaching myself DS&amp;A and system design, and working on personal projects of my own, I want to do something more. I want to network and rebuild a reputation from having another try at a college experience. 

I messed up my first time in college. I majored in something else and only got interested in programming very late in college. I didn't join career-related clubs, or any orgs of any kind. Then I graduated with a 2.75 GPA with no internships and got into these meh agency jobs doing WordPress and e-Commerce most of the time.

And yeah, I can study all the stuff I mentioned earlier to get a stepping stone to a better job, but that stepping stone is hard to find when you're stuck in a catch-22 of no relevant experience and nobody to vouch for you.

Besides, when you're unemployed like me, I start to miss human contact. 

As an aside, one thing I'd like to do before I retire is to work in the space industry. I don't plan on working there forever but if I could get an experience to work at NASA from an internship, that alone would make college worth it for me. As it stands, my CRUD web dev experience doesn't meet the requirements without having connections at NASA, or aerospace in general. It would be like going from 0 to 100 quickly. But many students can make that leap more easily via internships.

So, I don't simply intend to return to college to get smarter. I want to leverage it to build relationships for the future and get big names on my resume more easily. Land some good internships, transition that into a better job etc."

Im a senior. I have 2 semesters left and i really messed up 2 semesters ago. I was in a hard place where i was low on money, so i couldn't get the homework i needed until the last minute. The professor said i could finish everything, but it was too late and i just didn't finish it all. I finished with a D and had to retake the class. That same semester because i was so stressed or probably just because im a dumb procrastinator got my first F, so the D and F brought my gpa to a 2.8 and now im stuck there until I graduate.

I just feel so dumb and like I'll never do anything right. I've been trying harder this semester and will try even harder my last 2, but theres no way for me to bump it up to a 3.0.

My boyfriend says that in order to get any good job i need to go to grad school because i wont find a job with my bachelors since i have a low gpa and haven't done any internships (interships require you to have a 3.0 gpa as well) but i dont have a 3.0 gpa so theres no way i can even get into a graduate program.

I just desperately wish i could go back and withdraw from that semester like i wanted to, but everyone told me not to, so i ended up fucking myself over. 

I just feel not good enough and i feel like my boyfriend is going to leave me because im an idiot and dont have a gpa and wont get a job im interested in, and I just feel bad about my future. 

I shouldn't have gone to college in the first place. I only went because i felt forced and in turn i didn't have any drive or motivation to do anything and im still aiming to get more motivation, but im at the end and I've just wasted everything. I just don't know what to do because i want to keep pushing to do well, but im already fucked and doing well wont do anything for my gpa, so no graduate school for me. No internships for me and apparently no job for me because i underperform.

I nver thought much about any of this stuff (my future, my grades, my life after i graduate) until I met my boyfriend a year ago, and in a way im glad because now im getting a bit more motivated which im not sure would have happened before, but i also feel horrible about my future. I just dont know what to do.

Tl;dr i i went to college because i felt forced to, had no motivation and fucked my gpa over, now that im about to graduate i can't fix anything and my boyfriend says im not going to get a job im interested in because there are no defining qualities about me that would make me a better candidate over others."

TL;DR: Company has been harassing me for years despite me telling them to leave me alone until the end of time. Their contractor brandished a gun on me last year. They contacted me again. What are my recourses (detailed questions at the bottom)


**Lengthy backstory that should start with ""it was the best of times, it was the worst of times...""***
I'm in the midst of ongoing issues with a local real estate company. I moved into my house several years ago and have been contacted by them quite regularly. This contact had mostly been by flyers on my house advertising their agent(s). Each flyer advertised a singular agent, but the agent changed on each flyer. Every time I received one I contacted the agent and told him/her they are to stay off the property and never contact me again by any means; I listed ""by any means"" to be ""by ads on my property, physical mail or ads to me/my home, phone call, text, email, carrier pigeon, etc."". I also told them that the real estate company was not to contact me either and I specified this included anyone directly hired by the company, a contractor, volunteer, intern, etc. From the start of this I had a no trespassing sign visible from the sidewalk. A few years into this I posted a no soliciting sign on my door as well. 

At this point I had contacted the CEO of the company and told him to get control of his people and to leave me alone until the end of time. He informed me he has no control of the real estate agents working for his company due to either how the company was structured or the type of employees the agents were. I told him that anyone representing him or his company is to halt contacting me as they are working on the company's behalf and thus, representing him. Admittedly, I don't know if the ""your people represent your company and you as the CEO"" holds ground or not, but it was said. I need to review my notes to see if I have documented this or not, but I think I have.

Issues culminated last year when one of their contracted solicitors was canvassing my area and placed another flyer on my property. I saw him through my doorbell camera and came outside. I finally got the police to start enforcing my city's laws for soliciting without a permit, illegal solicitations and trespassing so I wanted to get a card, the solicitor's name and determine if he had a permit to solicit or not. 

I exited my front door and asked him for his permit to solicit, he replied with ""have a nice day"" or some other nonsense. I asked him again as I approached him. Nothing I was doing was violent or threatening. At this point he brandished a firearm (he lifted his shirt to expose it to the point where I could ID the make and model.) and said ""don't fuck with me"". 

I was armed, and despite a clear and imminent threat in a stand your ground state I retreated and called 911. The detective told the contractor to never come back to my property and documented this, but she didn't say or document the same when she spoke to the real estate company's CEO. Long story short prosecutors are useless and didn't bring charges, which surprised the chief of police and two detectives, but that is another story.

In the aftermath I contacted the CEO of the real estate company, again. I reminded him that I ordered him and his company to stay off the property and to leave me alone. If memory serves correctly he apologized for the incident and said the individual was not an employee. Long story short he danced around the issue. It was going nowhere and I reminded him, yet again, that he, his company, employees, contractors, vendors, interns, volunteers, cats, dogs, children, or anyone a reasonable person would see as a representative of the real estate company and/or him are to leave me alone until the end of time and I reiterated the list of what construes contact.

I have PTSD from our wonderful endless wars and needless to say I was triggered by the event. No, I wasn't a threat to myself or others and I'm still not. But I slept with some leftover combat gear and a rifle for the next several days. I was constantly checking my surroundings, was in a state of hyper-vigilance and most of the fun crap that goes with PTSD. My life was hell.

Well, one of their people texted my cell last week wondering if I'm interested in selling my house. I'm on the FCC do not call list, which is a joke, and it looks like this was an automated outbound dialer/text, which appears to be a violation of the 2005 Anti-CANSPAM act, which I reported to the FCC.

This company clearly does not take a hint, or direct orders, and I'm done with this. I have done everything I can think of, legally, to get them to leave me alone and I'm wondering what my options are. I'm at the point of wanting to go nuclear and screw everyone over that I can.

* Can I apply for something similar to a restraining/no-contact order for the company, its affiliates, employees, contractors and anyone associated with it? If so, how do I proceed with starting this?

     * Since the contact continued after the firearm incident, could I instead file for a protection order?

* You can sue anyone for anything, but that doesn't mean you actually have a legitimate case and won't be laughed out of court. Do I have any civil recourse to go after the company, company owner, CEO, etc.? If so, what can I do and where would I start?
     
     * If I am able to go after them civilly I would likely want a lawyer. I can always google for one, but how do I go about finding one that isn't a ""better call Saul"" dirt bag? What questions do I ask, what criteria should I use to filter out those who are good and effective vs those who aren't?

k6ahad,1,2020-12-03,Is CS masters not popular?,laurkorps,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/k6ahad/is_cs_masters_not_popular/,"I have friends in other majors that tell me how they're going to apply to grad school, but I don't know of any CS major that's planning on doing the same. In fact, one of my friends in CS said that working after graduating (along with any internships you did during your degree) is much more valuable than going for 2+ years of grad school. 

Obviously a masters would be an advantage to specialize in a field of study, along with higher starting salary, but is it really as popular in CS? I don't have any statistics, but I feel like most CS graduates work right after graduating. 

Of course, there will be opportunity costs. Is doing 2+ years of graduate studies in CS more beneficial than working *full time* in that field?"

I hope this helps others during their job search. 

I graduated in May with a BA in Computer Science. A lot of my college career was thinking I wasn’t cut out for programming at all. I scraped by classes with the help of friends and only until my senior year did I realize I need to step up my game. I took a programming course assistant job at my school so I could relearn all the basics and a bit more advanced programming while helping beginners learn programming. This also made up a bit for not having an internship on my resume. 

After graduating I knew I would have a difficult time but with covid, I really didn’t know what I got myself into. All my friends had jobs lined up with big companies. The first 100 jobs I applied to felt fine. But as I pushed more, I could only think of all the things I was doing wrong. And I questioned my major. I tried studying and applying to so many different things like front end, Ux/Ui, marketing, analyst because I had some freelance experience with all of them. But I got overwhelmed and I ended up giving myself anxiety. In the last few weeks i couldn’t eat or sleep properly. I even hurt my relationship. 

I spent about a week to two weeks focusing on my health and just talking to my friends and family. It helped so much and I realized I should just focus my attention on one field and get back to busting through job apps for that field. I had my resume changed up a lot, I started doing more mock interviews, networking more etc. 

Well it finally paid off. My bf’s friend helped me land a software engineering job and I started crying. I gave up doing my hobby and enjoying games throughout the whole process to find a job. But I’m so happy I can get back into it. 

This sub helped me a lot because of all the similar posts and experiences. I just want to let those who are still searching know that it’s possible! I learned that a lot of the process is to be willing to change and adapt. My bf offered me this advice. If your current process isn’t working, then try a new approach. If you’re feeling down, don’t be afraid to ask others for help. Be willing to take criticism and move on when it doesn’t work out. Keep at it though. 

Good luck to all of you!"

\- Take the easy A classes with easy professors

\- Doesn't challenge yourself with relevant/technical classes

\- Partying whenever and wherever bc school is easy 

\- Will quizlet/cheat on any and every exam possible 

\- Doesn't care at all about the team presentations for class 

\- Goal is to skim by, interview well, land a job in corporate/Big 4, make 50k-80k starting salary 

If you are in this pool, you are on track to become a corporate rat. 100%. You're following the exact path that the US school system has placed in order for you to become a corporate employee, paying the most taxes, not starting your own business, not learning about self investment, and not increasing your financial IQ.

You will be paying the most taxes, working a job you most likely hate, and have felt like your college education was useless.

I graduated the college of business with a 3.94 GPA, 2 ""prestigious"" internship, offers lined up, but decided not to pursue any of those options because 1. I didn't enjoy the work at Big 4 and 2. Not learning or developing a high income/technical skill. I now work at a startup and I love it, but wish I did things different in college.

On the other hand, 80% of my friends in corporate want to quit their job. There's a reason why the turnover rate at Big 4 is ridiculously high.

If you want to pursue a career you'll actually enjoy, not waste your tuition, and not end up like most people out of college, listen up.. 

**My BIGGEST RECOMMENDATIONS TO BUSINESS MAJORS** 

1. Don't pursue accounting because the career advisor says, ""it's a safe choice and you can figure out what you want to do later"". You will be doing tax/audit/ or if you're lucky some sort of consulting. 
2. Stop chasing money. Chase knowledge.
   1. Take the classes that will challenge you. Stop looking up highest GPA courses. Read about classes on course explorer and choose ones that will actually develop your skills.
   2. Doing a class presentation on a business? Pretend that business is your business and make recommendations/slides as if you were presenting to C-level executives. 
3. Stop tacking easy classes for a high GPA. 
   1. Real technical skills and experience on projects or with businesses &gt;&gt; high gpa 
   2. I was told this by a Google Employee my sophomore year and I ignored him because I wanted an easy college life 
4. Start a side hustle
   1. Dropshipping, Amazon FBA, 3d Printing, SMMA (social media marketing agency), Youtube channel
   2. There's so many bums on Youtube that are making $$$ by starting hustles. This is your one chance to start a side hustle and really have no risk, besides a little less studying for your exams. 
5. Go on LinkedIn, get on Zoom calls with people in positions you'd want to work and see if that's a career you'd actually like to pursue
   1. Want to work at Google, FB, LinkedIn, Salesforce, etc? Figure out the path someone else took to get there and put in the work to end up in their shoes. Google does not come to career fair but they do hire out of Illinois.
6. Talk to and network with professors that have actually done significant and relevant work in the real world.
   1. What's the point in asking our data analytics teacher about what career to choose if he's only worked at one no name company for 2 years? 
   2. Teachers teach because they probably like teaching, not because they're running a successful business. 
7. Talked to a FB data scientist last month. If you're interested in tech, consider learning skills like R, SQL, PowerBI, Tabluea, Salesforce, etc.
   1. If you had one of these skills under your belt, you could be a data analyst/scientist making 70-90k a year versus an accountant making 50-70k a year. Don't need all of these skills, just one or two. 
8. Stop pursuing a career to impress others. 
   1. Want to impress your friends and family? Why? Their opinion doesn't matter. If it does, learn to let go of it. You'll be miserable living for someone elses expectations instead of your own passion. 
   2. Who cares if you're a Tax Consultant at Deloitte or in Cyber Security at Accenture? You're 6 business friends and your linkedin connections... for a hot second. But you're dreading work for 8 hours a day 5 days a week.
9. Join clubs that'll develop your interpersonal/consulting skills 
   1. Technical skills can be taught to anyone. People skills is much harder to learn. 
   2. Try out consulting orgs like IBC, OTCR, Enactus, etc. You'll probably learn a lot more than being the treasurer for your business frat
10. If you're day looks like this: school hw/exam/class, eat, be lazy, occasional workout, repeat... that will be our life as a corporate rat. Create your own future. Invest in yourself. Read books. Watch Youtube videos that'll teach you how you can be financially free and an investor.
11. Surround yourself around friends that will be interested in self investment, growth, starting a business, and pushes you. You'll thank yourself in the future.  
12. Differentiate yourself from your peers. Do those things above, and you will stand out. I promise. 

Don't waste your 25k-50k a year tuition to just be like 99% of your peers. Please.

Imagine what 25k a year would turn into if you put it into a business. 

Geis has some decent resources for you all to learn and invest in yourself. Most of you are just too scared/lazy to utilize them. Comment below with any questions and I'll get back to you! 

If you made it this far, hope it helped. ;) Good luck on finals kiddos."

so, to keep it a long story short, I am graduating this spring with a bachelor's in Industrial &amp; Systems engineering, with a minor in computer science. I discovered CS a bit too late in my college career and i realized it is a career path that interests me much more than ISE. I had kind of a BS internship 2 semesters ago where I made a game in unity for a position that didn't pay me lol. I'm currently interning at a company that is ""semi"" big but in finance data stuff- tableau, excel, etc. (it's not the most interesting to me but it's what I could find with my eh GPA and credentials) This company is pretty big on SWE,  so I'm thinking of applying internally for some internships there just to see because I don't really feel like I have credentials to get hired in such a competitive field when I have minimal projects. My plan was to continue with this company in my role, do some projects post-grad, and try to find an entry-level position but I imagine that will be 100x as hard.

Most of the posting I'm looking at for my company require you to not be graduating, which really blows. Is it abnormal to be hired post-grad for an internship?"
k6cfrg,2,2020-12-03,"Coasting by doing little work in my first job; is this normal? Should I enjoy it, or is it a bad idea?",Ashleighyee,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/k6cfrg/coasting_by_doing_little_work_in_my_first_job_is/,"I've been working as a SWE for the past \~10 months for my first job out of college at a very big and prestigious company, and to be honest, I feel like I'm completely coasting, in fact I'm probably in 'slacking off' territory. Most days just go by trying to get someone experienced to respond and explain a proprietary tool to me. I end up doing a lot of nothing. Frankly I love it, I'm not a ""code 12 hours a day for fun"" kinda person, my hobbies lie elsewhere. My manager doesn't seem to think I'm slacking, and it's not like I've got \*nothing\* done at work so I've already proven myself to be marginally useful. Any hits on productivity are assumed to be because working from home makes it harder for new hires to learn quickly from experienced people, which to be fair is true. Although admittedly I could be faster and more productive if I really tried.

&amp;#x200B;

But I am getting a little concerned that my relaxed approach is gonna screw me in the long run. I feel like I'm not at the point someone with almost a year of professional experience should be at. Pretty much any current college student I meet who's interned at a startup is more adept than I am, for example we had an intern this summer who had done exactly that even before this internship, and they were far and away a better programmer than me and worked a lot harder (they were actually surprised that they weren't expected to be constantly on the ball here), which made me feel a teensy bit insecure because I had been out of college for some months then and was not nearly as good. I can understand people late in their career settling for a 'rest and vest' job after years of working hard, but it seems like it could be dangerous if I take it too easy right off the bat. On the other hand, the argument against my concern is that since you have to relearn the rules and codebase for each new company you join anyway, the fact that I'm not grinding hard won't matter in the long run, and that I should enjoy the good times for now.

&amp;#x200B;

**Anyone else have experience being in an easygoing job, early in your career? Did the poor habits end up being disastrous for your career? Or did it end up not mattering?** My ideal situation would be that I can keep coasting for some years taking on just enough responsibilities to remain useful, and if I really need to find a new job, \~2 weeks of leetcoding (plus my resume with 2 or more years of experience at this prestigious company, plus my soft skills) should be enough to do good on interviews and make up for the years of taking it easy, but I want to know if that's an impractical and unrealistic scenario."

I guess it's not the nicest way to react but it's like kids aren't even allowed to have feelings. I asked her why I can't ever be angry, and she said, ""You have nothing to be angry or annoyed about.""

That is pretty ridiculous lmao. I think most adults need to understand that kids and younger adults DO have problems, even though they appear nbd to older adults. 

I used to sort of have that mindset myself when I tutored younger kids for a part-time job, thinking, ""Oh you're only in 7th grade, you don't have to worry about choosing the right major or getting an internship or finding housing or a career, all you have to worry about is this petty math test when you probably won't ever be going into a quantitative career anyway."" 

However, I was able to catch myself by realizing that the 12 y/o I tutored doesn't have the skills/perspective to cope with being anxious about her math test. That's something my parents and most AP's lack, I think. Like, ""my work stress &gt;&gt;&gt; your internship search + college stress and it's easier to be 21 than a parent in your 50s."" 

I mean, when I was 12, I was being fed the notion that people with awesome grades and high GPA's are gonna be winners, and people who suck at school are gonna be homeless, mostly by my parents. I think schools aren't as extreme but schools definitely reward high academic achievement, as they are educational institutions, and some teachers also had similar mindsets as my parents, while not as blunt about it. So I tried to use that to understand and reassure her instead of saying ""you are 12 and you have no problems stfu."" 

So my question is, are they emotionally controlling because they genuinely do not think we have problems? Or that ""seeing us unhappy stresses them out more?"" Or idk being unhappy is seen as being ungrateful?"

Also note, I’m not going for SWE as a career, but cybersecurity :)

I graduated from community college a bit over two years ago with an Associates degree in CS. I didn’t transfer and instead worked as a waitress because I had lost interest in the field. Someone contacted me about a contractor role, related to manual software testing. It paid $15/hr which was just a bit better than I was making at the time but that was enough for me to make that move.

I had the chance to use my Python skills to automate some basic tasks and enjoyed it, but the job felt pretty dull overall. I started working on my CS Bachelor’s at an online no-name school because I wanted to get hired at the company I was working at. Through a bit of networking internally, I was offered a contract role as an analyst on the Info Security team unexpectedly. This was a year after I started my first corporate role.... I had no experience in the field but I became really passionate about learning and loved challenging myself. $25/hr was a huge jump for me, and when I graduated a few months later, I made a salary of $70k. I enjoyed my team and not so much my company, but I was comfortable. At 22, that’s not bad money!

I decided to start grad school (at yet another online no-name school) because I wanted a stronger foundation in security. I never dedicated much time to applying to other roles, but figured there would be a small chance of ending up getting a nice internship since I’m a grad student with a few months of experience.

Two months after I submitted (and forgotten about) a security internship at Tesla and the whole interview process went by so quickly I couldn’t believe it. I was offered a Security Engineer internship at Tesla that paid $35/hr, more than my full-time role. I still haven’t completely processed it. I start in January.

In a panic, I started applying to summer internships because I’d be losing my job security (no pun intended). I think I applied to 70 within the past month. Last week I did my final interview for a pretty well-known tech company, for another Security Engineer internship. I was extended the offer today... $50/hr. And I still have interviews for two other companies next week.

Money was never really my motivator, it was my desire to find more challenges. I had no idea that I’d even be considered for a role at a highly respected company because of the non-traditional path I’ve taken, which was looked down upon by a few people along the way. But it is possible!"

I am an tier 1 engineering college graduate in ECE (2018) but due to family problems and then an fall accident(back and leg injury) i wasn't able to start my career well at all.

During my late recovery phase i joined an technical startup in a majorly non technical role due to my situation but got jobless during march this year due to covid.

I had interest in coding since school time and was well versed in python during my college so took it up again and after researching well on web as well as with some batchmates i got the suggestion that data science with python should be my way to go as it could help me grab a good package in today's scenario and i tried learning through various MOOCs and then did some basic and entry level projects also and finally started getting shortlisted for interviews and technical rounds for internships and entry level roles during mid August.

I got rejected in most of the interviews due to various reasons like zero technical experience to requiring a more experienced candidate to some companies totally changing their t&amp;c that i will have to be on an unpaid intern for 3 months and then will get the job according to my performance.

During September my father got a heavy exposure to covid and was literally at such a worst condition we ever saw in our life that i wasn't able to give any more interviews or study anything and my whole time was spent in him and in October due to my his negligence me and my sibling also got affected and my October month got into Drain as well.

In November we all recovered and after taking care of all the mess of covid i started of thinking getting back on track but again i was not getting shortlisted for any interviews at all and i had to revise some things again as i had just studied them before covid so i asked suggestions from some friends about how should i proceed.

They gave various suggestions like private job will make my life further hell and i should prepare for gov jobs and all since i already have been jobless for so long and during 2018 i scored less than 2 -5 marks in gov job exams that too without coaching so they said that it will be much better for me than this but being jobless for more months was already haunting enough and after that since we already were low or money my father's abusive behaviour made me think too much about that part.

Some friends suggested that data science is all name and requires too much experience to enter and i should instead look on web development where i could learn js and angular within 3 months and start my career in that and it has also good money and all.

Some suggested giving 3 - 4 Months to data structures and algorithms and that if i master it then no company in the world would be able to reject me.

One guy due to my financial problem suggested joining a mass recruiter such as infosys or tcs but others said that it would be real bad for me and instead i should prepare well and i could be in a much better place within 4-5 months instead of them and since i have so much financial burden mass recruiters salary won't be of much help either way.

With so many suggestions and getting stuck due to all these factors such as injuries and covid and then restarting everything again has made me even more depressing on what should i actually do.

Sometimes due to my father's abusive behaviour i think of getting into a mass recruiter so that i can help financially as much as i can and that he stops his narcissistic behaviour a little but then other's suggestions also come in my mind and i am extremely confused and feel totally lost.

I know most will think that i am getting to whiny and being a cry baby but i was a bright student but all these injuries and things like covid which made me lose on opportunities make me too much depressing since i see people who passed by cheating on their papers with my help doing much better than what i am doing currently.

Sorry for such a long and crybaby post but if you have read till here and have some good suggestion please do help me out.

Thank you!"

This actually happened ten years ago but I think of it often enough - it's almost like it just happened last week. This still haunts me at random moments of my life.

I went to the doctor because I was experiencing some pain and wanted to have it checked out. I was running late so I grabbed a bag that was sitting near the bed and threw my wallet and keys in it and ran out the door.

The appointment ended up being in the hospital near me and on that day the doctor had two interns with her. She asked me if it is ok if they stick around and I say, of course yes.  I sat down and started telling them about my issues. They asked me to move to the table for an examination and so I popped my bag on a chair and walked over to table. At this point I was so frazzled that I was late, I didn't notice the sound that my bag started making once I placed it on the chair. I sat on the table and as the doctor was poking different areas of my abdomen. I am finally starting to pay attention to what is happening around me and I hear a wauuu-wauuu-wauuu-wauuu-wauuu sound. It didn't hit me yet what I was hearing until one of the interns said, ""what is that sound?"". I look over at my bag and the realisation slowly sinks in: That sound is coming from my bag. The bag I grabbed that was sitting near my bed. The bag that I stashed my vibrator in last time I used it.

My face started to flush red. I let the doctor finish prodding my belly while attempting to answer her questions. The only thing I could think of was 'oh god how am I going to get out of this'. At this point, one of the interns had figured out what was up and started to laugh. The abdomen examination was done and I hopped off the table and walked over to my bag and attempted to put my hand in to turn it off. What happened then can only be described as the worst case of Murphy's Law in the history of fuck ups. This vibrator had two settings and in attempting to turn off one setting, I turned on the other setting and turned up the first setting to which now the sound was a sped up wau-wau-wau-wau and  increasing vibrations from the other setting.

At this point, the intern, the other intern, and the doctor are all starting to understand what is happening in my bag. I don't know what shade of red I was at this point but I'm guessing it was something to marvel at. I'm sifting through some papers that had been in the bag and feeling other junk that I had thrown in this bag at some point. My heart must have been beating a thousand beats a minute and I finally realised that I needed to pop off the battery pack and pull the batteries out. The sounds suddenly stop.

Now in what felt like total silence, I stood there with my hand in my bag and slowly pulled it out to look over at the doctor and her interns and all three of them are just looking at me, the first intern with her hand on her face trying to choke down laughter. At this point, I sit down in the chair and try to act normal until the end of the appointment. I literally have no recollection of her diagnosis. I do remember the doctor telling me something between spurts of laughter but that is it.

This day has haunted me ever since.

TLDR; I brought a vibrator to my medical appointment and the vibrator I forgot was in my bag turned on when I put it down."
k6ik63,10,2020-12-04,TIFU by blaspheming in a cultural sensitivity class I was running,SolidGradient,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/k6ik63/tifu_by_blaspheming_in_a_cultural_sensitivity/,"This actually happened about three years ago, but like most healthy people all of the most mortifying experiences in my life starting age 3 will occasionally pop in to my head like random little blasts of embarrassment adrenaline.

I was working in a company in Japan where the workforce was 98% Japanese. For some insane reason, the CEO kept hiring foreigners from overseas as interns straight out of college with no Japanese skills at all. This caused some heavy cultural clash (and basic communication issues) as we had people from the former Soviet Union, Latin America, the British Isles and other parts of Asia all sharing only an ability to speak English and a desire to not get the polite smile of contempt from their Japanese coworkers.

As the only foreigner there who could speak both English and Japanese fluently, I decided to try and stop this runaway cable car of cultural calamity. I volunteered to run weekly English classes for the Japanese and weekly Japanese classes for those poor fools who’d come to Japan with no clue just how hard it can be to survive overseas in an alien culture with no language skills. *Those* lessons went fine.

At the same time we had lunchtime cultural exchange meetings where people could talk about their own culture and ask about others. These were occasionally fraught with danger as one particularly risqué talk on the sexual nature of candy in Taiwan revealed, but I figured nothing too terrible could happen.

Unfortunately, one day the talk turned to religion, the most dangerous topic of all. As I always did in these meetings, to get the ball rolling I brought up Google on the projector and started Googling each person’s religion in Google image search. Normally this gave a nice visual backdrop to whatever we were discussing so people could understand what was being talked about. Photos of interesting food, beautiful places and famous landmarks, that sort of thing.

We started with discussing Catholicism, so up came images of the Vatican and Jesus. Next was Confucianism and so Confucius was displayed in all his glory. The next person whose turn it was to speak was a very sweet, kind young lady from Kazakhstan. She was a very devout Muslim, and so as she began to talk I went back to the keyboard and started searching for “Muhammad Islam”. 

The rest of the group, in chorus, raised a susurrant “Uh...” of warning but it was too late. By then I’d already hit enter and images of the prophet were plastered 12ft tall across the lunchroom wall. This is how I ended up being schooled in certain Islamic cultural taboos regarding depiction of the prophets by an apologetic English lad while a Kazakhstan lass facepalmed in the background.

TL;DR - don’t try running classes on various cultures without a bare minimum understanding of the taboos."

I am a graduate software developer with 35k salary. Payment not competitive but they said they will do the sponsorship, and as a international students that’s important for me so that’s why I accepted the offer.

But then later a 42k internship also got back to me. I like this company more. But since it’s a internship they cannot sponsor me. And there’s no guarantee I will get a job after the internship.

Rationally I should do the full time job because they sponsor me. But I like that internship company more. If I really do good in the internship I feel there’s a better future there. And if I didn’t secure a job from the internship I am not sure by next year Summer how hard or easy it is to start finding jobs again?

Any idea?"

I am a international study that finished my bachelors degree in CS in a university. After graduate I got rejected on my work permit. So my agent suggested me go back to school to get a chance to apply for post graduate work permit again .I take the advice and go to a 2 years college program for CS.
I know it’s wired to take a program that lowers than my current degrees but I have no choice.
So in my resume, my education has a bachelors degree in CS and taking a diploma in college now.
This year when I tried to find a internship,  I apply almost 100 companies and only one gives me a interview.
I don’t know the college study experience affected my career or not.
If you had experience as a hr, please tell me the learning experience in college will increase my mark on career or decrease.

k6lwym,47,2020-12-04,Sewanee: The University of the South is an amazing college (LAC Highlight)!,Fearless-Quit,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/k6lwym/sewanee_the_university_of_the_south_is_an_amazing/,"To be honest with you guys, southern liberal arts colleges deserve better in terms of recognition. I for sure love to see liberal arts colleges getting more and more recognition by recent applicants as we speak, but other than Davidson, Washington &amp; Lee, and the University of Richmond, liberal arts colleges of the South are largely never talked about, especially in r/ApplyingtoCollege. That being said, while I’m still debating on whether I should make a miniseries on southern liberal colleges, I’d love to present a school that primarily serves undergraduate students (and also has some graduate students) and is one of my top choices for the below-listed reasons: **Sewanee: The University of the South**:

&amp;#x200B;

* Sewanee’s average class size is 15, and its student-faculty ratio is 11:1. The undergraduate population is 1,710 students.
* If you love colleges like Haverford, Davidson, and Connecticut College for their respective honor codes, you will likely be pleased by the University of the South’s as well. The college holds its Honor Code to extremely high value, as each entering student will abide by the Honor System by signing an acceptance of it. To ensure that trust is enabled amongst the student body, each individual agrees to hold responsibility for the prevention of cheating, stealing, or deception. Like the aforementioned colleges, Sewanee’s Honor System is maintained/run by an elected student group that enforces its purpose and, if necessary, votes on any changes for the Honor Code document.
* The Sewanee Pledge ensures all students will receive funding for a summer internship or research internship, have access to a semester-long study abroad program (50% of students choose to do so), and graduate after four years with at least one major or be granted one additional undergraduate year at no tuition cost.
* In 2019, the college has expanded its financial aid program to meet 100% of demonstrated need for all students who qualify for financial aid, domestic or international, starting with the college class of 2024 (by the year 2026, it will meet the full need of all undergraduate students). If you don’t qualify for it, however, don’t worry! Scholarships range from $4,000-$26,000 per year (a very select few will qualify for full-ride scholarships). 97% of 2020 entering freshmen receive aid directly from the college in the form of merit scholarships or need-based grants. About 18% of entering students for 2020 are Pell Grant-eligible.
* The previous two points have been further ensured thanks to the “Stronger, Truer Sewanee” campaign, which has raised exactly $266,863,703 in endowment funds for financial aid resources, academics, and other programs plus $95 million in undesignated gift funds as of October of 2019.
* Such generosity even comes from current students at Sewanee, one example being when one student in late October of 2020 voiced concerns in *The Sewanee Purple* about McClurg Dining Hall workers being paid the minimum wage plus not having any emergency funding to back them up. She, with partnerships from student leaders of other organizations, launched a fundraiser for the next couple of days at customink.com called ""Stand Up Sewanee!,"" where supporters could buy a cotton T-Shirt for $22 with the goal of selling 50 (for a total of $1100 based on calculations) for the purpose of raising awareness of the demands of higher wages for the workers plus the money going towards the emergency funds. By the end of the program, 214 shirts were sold (for a total of $4708) plus generous additional donations of $16472, for a total fundraising of $21180! Although the aftermath has yet to be revealed, it's clear that students and alumni are willing to give back to the community, including the workers!
* There are 38 majors, 44 minors, and 15 special programs/pre-professional programs to choose from. While the college primarily offers liberal arts subjects as majors/minors, students can minor in business or partake in the 3/2 engineering program from Columbia University, RPI, or Washington University in St. Louis. The most conferred majors in 2019-2020 were by order Economics, English, Psychology, International and Global Studies, Politics, Biology, and History. However, this college also offers a fair number of majors related to the studies of the environment and sustainability, namely Environment &amp; Sustainability, Environmental Arts &amp; Humanities, Forestry, Geology, and Natural Resources &amp; the Environment, plus exclusive minors consisting of Archaeology, Environmental Studies, and Religion &amp; Environment.
* Arguably the most appealing part of the campus is its 13,000-acre land stop the Cumberland Plateau, making it one of the largest in the US. It is officially known as “The Domain” and offers lots of forests, lakes, and caves to hike around, plenty of which host dozens of natural plant and animal species. There are plenty of hiking trails (they make up approximately 60 miles total) in the shape of one-ways, round trips, or loops to explore the wilderness.
* The Sewanee Outing Program (SOP) encourages students to explore the environments of the campus, whether climbing, caving, cycling, hiking, or more, by loaning outdoor equipment, such as backpacks, maps, sleeping bags, tents, stoves, first aid kits, or other essential items, at no cost. You can use it for as long as you need, as under the Honor Code, students are given the responsibility and full trust to use and eventually return the borrowed item(s). If you’ve considered colleges like Middlebury, Colorado College, or Whitman for their encouragement of exploring the outdoors, you should definitely consider adding Sewanee to your list, too! Don’t worry about it being an overbearing part of campus either if you’re not an outdoorsy person, as you can still thrive on campus just fine (I've talked with several students/alumni who said that they weren't quite the outdoors person but still enjoyed the college).
* On the subject of engaging with the environment, new students are introduced to the campus life plus new people by participating in the Finding Your Place (FYP) program, which begins in mid-August as a nine-day pre-semester immersion and ends in October. Students engage with professors via field trips around the region (the college campus and surrounding areas) plus readings, reflective writing, and small-class discussions. These courses will also fulfill part of your General Education requirements as well! All courses available are ""Community Narratives of the South Cumberland Plateau,"" ""The Mythology of Place on Stage and Screen,"" ""Medieval Sewanee,"" ""The Idea of Home -- Ecology, Economics, and Nativity,"" ""Land and Life,"" ""Anthropologies of Space,"" and ""The Stories We Share: An Exploration of Place-Based Storytelling.""
* It also hosts the All Saints’ Chapel, a ministry of the Episcopal Church which students can join for regular prayers or choir membership. Although it should be noted that plenty of Christian-affiliated students thrive in this college due to some of the college’s values, there are also plenty of students of other religions or no/unknown affiliation who thrive here just as easily. There’s a high diversity of types of Christian-affiliated distributions, including Baptists, Episcopals, Presbyterians, Roman Catholics, and United Methodists. The college does its best to create a stable interfaith environment as part of its goal to encourage students to engage with the natural and global communities.
* Since 2012, the Sewanee University Farm was reestablished to provide vegetables, meats, and eggs to the University Dining Hall. It’s also a laboratory for students to learn more about the environment + sustainability and other topics. In April, around the time of final exams, students can get professional yoga instruction with 30 baby goats frolicking around for stress-lowering petting sessions there. This occasional event is officially known as ""Goat Yoga.""
* Some special interest organizations that you can participate in include the Sewanee Natural History Society, the Organization for Cross-Cultural Understanding, and the Tennessee Intercollegiate State Legislature.
* You can participate in the Sewanee Volunteer Fire Department (SVFD), one of only two student-led fire departments in the country via tryouts for students and nearby residents!
* There are also “themed houses” so that you can live with other students of the same interest as you, such as the Community Engagement House, Fine Arts House, Queer &amp; Ally House, STEM House, and Writing House.
* Not only does the University of the South have a dedicated coed varsity Equestrian Team that offers tryouts for people of any experience and competes against other southern colleges (mostly other colleges from Tennessee, like the University of Tennessee, Rhodes College, and Vanderbilt University), but it also hosts the Howell Riding Facility and Boarder Barn on campus, which includes 2 boarder barns, an indoor riding area, 2 outdoor riding arenas, and 30 acres of pasture and paddocks. This is perfect for those who seek such a dedicated team and wish to train on campus instead of traveling far frequently.
* It has produced 26 Rhodes Scholars, 49 Watson Postgraduate Fellows, and 32 NCAA Postgraduate Scholars.
* Professional school acceptance rates are high, with business at 90-95%, law at 90-95%, and medicine at 80-85%.

&amp;#x200B;

And you can apply to this liberal arts college on the Common App with NO application fee! It has also remained test-optional for \~10 years for those of you who don't have/wish not to submit your SAT/ACT score.

Of course, I do wish to mention some of the college’s flaws as well. For one, since it’s a PWI, it’s not very diverse racially (the minority population is overall average, and there are very few Asian American students). It does also host a heavy fraternities/sororities culture and a slightly heavier emphasis on Christian values, both of which aren't for everyone. As much as it is a highly academic-emphasizing college, it is also a party school with an underaged drinking culture as a result of the college's isolation as a rural area, so do be aware of that as well if checking out this college. The college is very much aware of this issue though, and the administration system and campus police are attempting to combat such issues, although this can lead to negative reactions from students.

However, I want to also clear out some misconceptions about the college. For instance, although students typically prefer to wear formal clothes, it’s not enforced under a dress code, so you can wear whatever appropriate clothes you want. Also, although its origins were associated with the South’s ideals in the mid-1800s, it increasingly distances itself from the unhealthy ones today. In fact, on September 8th of 2020, the Vice-Chancellor has sent a letter to the Sewanee Family that the college will launch initiatives that reject and combat its past ties with the ideals of the Confederacy, including the ""Lost Cause."" The Robertson Project on Slavery, Race, and Reconciliation at the University of the South has investigated the college's former history with ties to pro-slavery origins and other cases of racism against African Americans since 2017 and will last a total of 6 years with the intention of acknowledging the university's dark past and therefore being more easily able to fix such issues on campus. Although it’s not great in racial diversity as of now, it’s more openly embracing the idea of racial diversity/inclusion.

These are the reasons why I’m for sure considering the University of the South! As with other college highlight posts, I do encourage you to explore these colleges if interested in them before adding them to your application list. Sewanee isn't for everyone, but I do hope to spread awareness of this college’s niches and strengths! I would love to thank u/Rob-Barker and u/eccentricgalaxy for inspiring me to make this post! I also want to give a shoutout to u/bakedcowboyy for introducing the A2C class of 2020 to this college last year! As mentioned earlier, I’m still thinking about whether or not I should make another southern LAC highlights post (if I were to do them, they would be much smaller than this post lmao), but until then, I hope that all of you undergraduate applicants have the best college admissions results!"

Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m a believer that small details make a big difference and that you have to be motivated,  hard-working , and passionate to achieve success; this is why every position I step in to I put my best foot forward and accept any challenge. I’ve been praised by past management for my execution on email marketing campaign, organizing data through Excel, and recognizing new demographics that were untouched by the company. 

Thank you for spending time reviewing my application. I truly believe my skills and qualifications make me an ideal candidate for the Marketing Intern position at \[Company\]. I’m extremely motivated to join  and look forward to discussing my candidacy in an interview.

Background: I'm a sophomore girl at a CS target. My major is CS/Stats and I have a 3.8. I'm involved in some Reinforcement Learning research on campus. I just finished taking Data Structures this semester and will be interning at JP Morgan this summer as a SWE Intern. 

I got to the first round interview at FB this cycle, but failed miserably due to 1) nerves and 2) lack of adequate DS&amp;A prep. I also made it to Goldman's Superday and didn't get an offer due to the same reasons. What can I do between now and next August to set myself up for success? And how much of a difference do referrals make? Should I be focusing my efforts on cultivating those relationships right now?

Thanks for the advice guys! My school's career advisors aren't necessarily the most helpful..."

Also note, I’m not going for SWE as a career, but cybersecurity :)

I graduated from community college a bit over two years ago with an Associates degree in CS. I didn’t transfer and instead worked as a waitress because I had lost interest in the field. Someone contacted me about a contractor role, related to manual software testing. It paid $15/hr which was just a bit better than I was making at the time but that was enough for me to make that move.

I had the chance to use my Python skills to automate some basic tasks and enjoyed it, but the job felt pretty dull overall. I started working on my CS Bachelor’s at an online no-name school because I wanted to get hired at the company I was working at. Through a bit of networking internally, I was offered a contract role as an analyst on the Info Security team unexpectedly. This was a year after I started my first corporate role.... I had no experience in the field but I became really passionate about learning and loved challenging myself. $25/hr was a huge jump for me, and when I graduated a few months later, I made a salary of $70k. I enjoyed my team and not so much my company, but I was comfortable. At 22, that’s not bad money!

I decided to start grad school (at yet another online no-name school) because I wanted a stronger foundation in security. I never dedicated much time to applying to other roles, but figured there would be a small chance of ending up getting a nice internship since I’m a grad student with a few months of experience.

Two months after I submitted (and forgotten about) a security internship at Tesla and the whole interview process went by so quickly I couldn’t believe it. I was offered a Security Engineer internship at Tesla that paid $35/hr, more than my full-time role. I still haven’t completely processed it. I start in January.

In a panic, I started applying to summer internships because I’d be losing my job security (no pun intended). I think I applied to 70 within the past month. Last week I did my final interview for a pretty well-known tech company, for another Security Engineer internship. I was extended the offer today... $50/hr. And I still have interviews for two other companies next week.

Money was never really my motivator, it was my desire to find more challenges. I had no idea that I’d even be considered for a role at a highly respected company because of the non-traditional path I’ve taken, which was looked down upon by a few people along the way. But it is possible!"

Anyways, I knew I wanted to come back to school so once we went into quarantine, I realized it was the perfect time for me to really fix some of my issues and work on myself, which I did and I'm feeling the best I have ever felt before. So that's basically my background, I started coding during quarantine (around March) but I wouldn't say I have all the skills yet, I know basic python and am still learning it as I go, but I kind of stopped my daily routine due to the demands of my other courses. I am taking an intro to computer programming course this fall (which is so much fun and I absolutely love it!), but most of the in-depth cs courses for me are happening in the winter term. I also want to mention that from my first year, I did complete 2 courses before dropping out (bearing i did the absolute minimum in them) wouldn't show up and honestly just gave up so my gpa from those 2 courses combined is a 2.57 but again they're 2 courses out of the 20 i'll have to take for my degree so it's not very accurate. This term I'm hoping to bring that 2.57 up to a 3.06 (bearing exams go well), and next term if I continue the way I am, I can atleast end the year with a 3.3-3.4, and then I have another 2 years to continue bringing it up(again assuming everything goes well). I've also attended two hackathons this term (included in my resume), and am apart of my school's WiCS club, (Women in CS), I guess because today's the 4th, and I'm in Canada and just from browsing this sub I know a lot of freshman have already began to hear back, so i'm just starting to feel a little scared. I really wanted to experience Google Step and felt like it would be such a great opportunity for me, but I have all these fears, concerns and I don't really know how to overcome these. I put all my eggs into one basket (i.e. google step), and now I have a strong feeling I won't hear back. I really want to do one internship this summer (ANYWHERE), but I don't know why I assumed I would hear back from Google that I didn't even bother applying anywhere else (No microsoft explore, nothing), I'm wondering if anyone has any suggesstions on still applying, I really need an internship this summer. I thought I did a good job of outlining my situations in the essay section and had my resume reviewed 10 times by my school's career centre, but I guess now I realize just how difficult it really is to even land an interview, and I guess i'm not on par with a lot of other candidates. I still want to keep going, and keep the momentum i've built for myself after some really hard years, but I just feel like an internship is so cruicial for me right now. I'm 1-2 years behind everyone else my age and I just need to find something. ANYTHING"

Now I have a diploma and still feel stupid because it wasn’t as hard to get as I feared.

Following a depression and a panic attack I (&gt;30 y/o) just found out this year that I have ADHD so my SO pointed me to this subreddit. I don’t like my job but I cannot change it atm because until this week I did not only feel like an impostor but I actually was one.

When I applied for my current job it was assumed I had a degree because I have had multiple jobs in well-known companies before. And when I applied for those jobs, it was the same. But: I do not have any diploma other than my highschool graduation. If someone would have asked me directly I would have told them but no one did. And after my first internships and then my first job the shame was unbearable so I had to go with the presumed story. Also I told myself I would finish my studies pretty soon anyways so there's no need to kick up dust. How long did I do that, you ask? Well, more than five years! I payed a load of tuition fees - not voluntary, of course: I always did it on the very last day before being expelled and after being constantly pressured by my SO - and with every year I repressed the thought of the whole thing even more.

How the hell did that happen? I finished my bachelor thesis after 4 years and was very anxious because it took me one year longer than the regular study period (little did I know that this wasn't even half-time in retrospective). At this point there were still some additional courses missing because when I started my studies I was convinced they would determine my life and I couldn't possibly make such a big choice. I had an immense pressure to succeed so I landed an internship in another country and then moved back to my home country (not the one where I studied) for my first 'real' job - that I got because I thought and communicated that picking up my diploma was just a formality at this point so they never asked for it again. I had to organize moving, find apartments and all that stuff and couldn't finish the missing courses in time. One year after I finished my bachelor thesis and while already working full time I was fed up enough to search for the easiest additional courses, travel back to my university and complete them, just to be done with it. As proud as a peacock I filled out all the forms and handed them in. But when I wanted to pick them up I was told that there were two ECTS missing. I totally lost it, I was devastated and felt betrayed. I had those specific courses planned and calculated from the beginning, like wtf? I must have gotten it all wrong, I felt so stupid.

After this I never set foot into the university again. I didn't want to speak about my studies, avoided people I studied with and in general everyone that could have asked me about it. Every six months I would break down and cry when the university asked me to pay my tuition fee and it would take me at least a week of struggle to pay it. Then I would repress it for as long as possible again. Last year I got an email: It said that my study programme would end 2019/2020. I was forced to follow up what went wrong and get back to it. I started in 2019: I found out that years ago they changed the ECTS for two of my courses JUST BEFORE I TOOK THE EXAMS - back then I didn't notice because I sat through the lectures first and only took the exams a year later (= after the change) because I was afraid to not be able to learn enough. Back to 2019: I picked a course, didn't look into it until weeks before the exam and found out I had to read what felt like all European philosophers. Impossible to do, so I missed the first date for the exam. Then came Corona, there was no possibility to travel to my university. I fell into a hole, found a therapist, did a therapy and felt better - but could not focus on this matter because I was busy getting my shit together. Meanwhile two other exam dates passed. That was it. Or so I thought: Due to Corona everything was chaotic, a lot of students couldn't take the exam and so they set a fourth date! Plus: This university that is famous for its complete denial and rejection of the digitalization set up a digital test! Luckily for me it was totally different than usual and I could use the literature so I managed to take the exam and passed with a “good”. My therapy was approaching its end and my therapist kept pushing me to just hand in all the forms again to finally get my diploma and celebrate this success together. But I couldn't, I just couldn't. I needed to beg my study department to authorize the new course, review all the forms, see through my bad grades, maybe even search for certificates that I really didn't know where to find in the mess that is my desk, I would have to approach all those same people that saw me fail years earlier and so on. Plus: I couldn't travel there so I would need to send all the stuff to a friend that would hand it in. It usually takes weeks for every step to be authorised. (edit: Honestly: I was just terrified some other thing to get in the way, something I did not see earlier, some mistake I made that would suddenly turn up as it did before.)

**Long story short:** Everyone is in home office, so the whole process is digital now. All the old employees seem to be gone, I got all the necessary forms within half an hour, filled them out, scanned them and then mailed it to someone who just unbureaucratically signed everything off within a day. The whole thing took less than 48 hours and after more than ten f\*\*\*ing years I now have a mediocre bachelor degree but at least I am not a fraud anymore."
k6qvmu,14,2020-12-04,I'm not sure if its going to be worth the money for online school in the spring,throwaway81648191,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/k6qvmu/im_not_sure_if_its_going_to_be_worth_the_money/,"So, I will be all online for the spring semester, but I don't know if it will be worth it. It would cost about $20k, which is no small sum, and id be doing it all at home. I originally deferred the fall semester, hoping things would be better, but given how things are going (covid numbers being so high rn), I decided against going in person. That, and also my parents have basically refused to send me at the moment, their reason being the pandemic, so I'm not sure what I should have said or done. The school never received a housing application, so I was never slotted for dorming, so that ship has sailed if i had any other thoughts. I did 3 classes online at a local community college for much less, and kinda just worked on myself (nothing crazy, just working out, reading, that kind of thing), and helped my parents move. 


The issue is im not sure if I should defer for the spring and just go on campus in the fall, since it feels sort of weird to be a mid year and it kinda makes things like being pre med a bit weird with the app cycle and all. I think I'd spend my time trying to continue improving myself, and probably start investing since I have some money I want to invest in, probably also deal with my finances more closely, but on the flip side I just feel like im missing out, or losing out. All my friends went in the fall, and more are going in the spring, albeit I don't live in that area where I graduated from anymore I still feel like I'll be left behind, or that I'll be that one dude who never left or something idk. I also feel like im not doing enough with my life. Like, I was going to continue an internship at a small museum but we moved (I had no where to stay so im living with my parents at the moment), and I can't seem to find a job (no previous job experience so I feel stuck ngl), so I kind of feel like a leech.


I know usually no one responds to these, but honestly I'm just nervous and unsure what to do. Any advice? Is anyone else deferring for the year (going fall 2025 instead of now), what are you doing with your time, any advice? Anyone else have anything that would help me out a bit? My parents kind of have let me make the decision, and while I appreciate that I kind of fear making a wrong choice I guess?"

But lets say, things like career services or fairs, can I attend those even though I don't go to that school? Maybe I can contact the school or whoever is hosting the fair and seek permission to go there. 

I was also reading about a Cornell program, its like a one year masters program for computer science students that has this cool internship set up for you or something like that. I don't want to get into the details, I'm pretty sure I can directly apply for this because its technically just a masters program. However most Cornell students take it their senior year. 

I was actually just reading about a Harvard introduction class for computer science that has a homework assignment where you build a website that uses google maps  
you enter a location and it brings up links to news stories in the area or something like that. They use python and the SQLite database. For a beginner level class, that sounds so awesome. I do projects in my classes too but idk, for a beginner level class, that one sounds so much more applicable to the real world.  Where can I find out about other stuff that other university classes have like that, that I can maybe try at home?

I don't know if there are other kinds of resources other schools have. I just feel really dissatisfied with the kind of resources my college is providing. Unless they actually have stuff and are just not making it known? Should I contact someone from my school"

k6u9ny,0,2020-12-04,Took a non-technical role and regret it. How long should I wait to switch jobs?,ThrowAwayConsultant0,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/k6u9ny/took_a_nontechnical_role_and_regret_it_how_long/,"I graduated from a no-name school with a 3.0+ GPA in May 2020. At the time I had been interning for a very large company in the credit industry on a tech support team for the past year. I had been doing a myriad of different tasks ranging from web development (PHP, Oracle, Perl/Python), to CI/CD ( BitBucket, Jenkins, Rundeck ), to helping out with some automation scripts. I basically had a verbal offer as early as 2019 that once I graduated I would be brought on either as a contractor or full time. 

Then Covid happened.

My company went into a hiring freeze. My manager didn't want to lose me and managed to offer me an extension on my internship, with a pay raise, and I stayed for a few more months. The extension was only for \~3 months or so and time was getting close. I spoke to my manager about it, and he told me he was working on getting me an offer but he wasn't sure if it would happen. We talked about it, and he and I both agreed that I did not want to get strung along with another extension of my internship, and even if I couldn't come on as a full-time employee, he would try to get me hired as a contractor at least.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to \~September. My company has started hiring again and I sent out some applications. I would really have preferred to stay on my current team, but I also needed to get a full-time position. I applied to some technical roles that matched my experience ( SDE/SRE ), but did not hear back / got rejected from those. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then I finally found an entry-level position I knew I was qualified for. A ""Solutions Engineering Consultant"" aka ""IT Solutions Delivery Consultant"". I knew when I applied that the role would be less technical. It is basically a client-facing position where you middle man between the client and the engineering team. The most technical thing I do is SQL queries. I was offered the job. Before I accepted, I went back to my manager. I told him I'd really prefer to stay on his team as I loved the work I was doing and really liked my team members, but it would not make financial sense for me to turn down a full-time position. (The full-time role was \~30k more total comp.)

&amp;#x200B;

He was not able to get approval for another employee, but when he heard I was moving to a less technical role he told me to wait a few days, and he would see if he could get me on another manager's team as a developer. Unfortunately, that did not work out either. So I accepted the consultant job. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been working this job for a few months now and it is terrible. I have \~25-30 hours of meetings every week. The work is not fulfilling at all. This job stresses me out so much, and my last job was the most stress-free I've ever been. There are many reasons why I hate this job, but I won't go into all of them. I'm wanting to look for a new job, but I'm worried about having my first ""full-time"" job on my resume only be \~3 months. Should I just not include this job on my resume? I would really like to just transfer internally again, but I think my company may have some policy against transferring/changing roles in less than a year.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think I should do? I hate this job, but if I need to I can keep doing it for a while. I have \~14k saved up which could pay my expenses for \~7 months. Although I would really rather not quit a job without another one lined up."

k6uuh5,1,2020-12-04,Is my salary is too high for my experience level?,afelipems,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/k6uuh5/is_my_salary_is_too_high_for_my_experience_level/,"Hello, everyone! This is my first post here, so I'm sorry if I'm doing anything wrong.

Let me cut to the chase. I've been working as a software developer (.NET Core) for 3 years, to be clear these are a year and a half as an intern and the rest as a developer. Since I joined the company in which I work today I have evolved a lot. I started here as a junior software developer, but I was always able to deliver with the same efficiency and quality as all the senior developers on the team. I have already contributed to key Product decisions, incident handling and training new co-workers.  After 9 months on the team, I was promoted to technical leader of a team of four software developers. In the beginning it was very scary, I didn't feel capable of having such a responsibility, but nowadays I am considered as one of the best technical leaders, both technically and in the ability to evolve my teammates. This was certainly only possible because I recognized my gaps and worked hard daily on how to improve them.

This is literally my first formal job and I went from junior developer to technical leader in a very short time. To give a little more context, I joined the company earning approximately 48k BRL / year (I am Brazilian), a reasonable salary for a beginner. Today my salary is approximately 123k BRL / year, not one of the highest salaries for someone who has the responsibilities I have, but definitely a nice amount of money.

Now comes the sad part. Since I've joined the Company, I didn't do any interview for any other place and I believe that we should always do this, whether it is to feel what the job market asks or how much we are ""worth"", financially speaking. However, I can't get past the initial stages of any job interview. I feel that the interviews are good, the recruiters are excited to know what I work with (event sourcing, cqrs, messaging etc), but I feel that whenever we talk about money the tone of the conversation changes. I believe that people are not interested in paying my current salary to someone with less than 3 years in the market. That way I feel like I'm ""stuck"" in my current job, where I have a good context and respect from my leaders and colleagues until my salary matches my experience.

I would like to know from you how someone with little experience, high salary and high level of responsibility is seen in the market. Did I just have a bad sample of job interviews or do my impressions make sense?"

I have many friends who applied at the same time I did and I don’t begrudge them their victories because I know that they are very hardworking and talented.

I avoid both social media and family gatherings (reason one Covid) and also cause I feel neither are good for my mental health. I’m mostly a positive and driven person who minds my own business but of late my SIL has taken to forwarding me the achievements of a friend of hers who is also in grad school. This girl though book smart took many (and in some cases illegal) shortcuts to get where she is and I feel aggrieved thinking about it. I’ve seen many pages dedicated to her achievements and awards she’s won. I know I sound bitter but when I see people getting to places they want by taking a - let’s call it a shortcut (rather than calling it cheating /s) it makes me mad that I have to fight and fight hard for everything every darn time!

Ive received an offer from each of the last 5 out of the 6 interviews I’ve done in my career.

Where I personally think I do well is the behavioral questions - although I’m normally quite shy, I put a lot of effort in being super friendly and joking around with the interviewers. I try to get a conversation going, and ask lots of questions that take them a while to answer. Often I run slightly overtime.

Pros:

* I've been in school for 17 years now, (grade 1-12 + 5 years of uni), and I feel it would be extremely underwhelming to end this part of my life through online classes. I want a proper ending to my career as a student.
* Wait for market to recover so there's more job opportunities
* Take a year to do what I want to do, and focus on myself

Cons: 

* I am currently in the 5th year of my degree (I worked 16 months of internship), and I'm afraid that taking 6 years to graduate university would look extremely bad.
* Losing out on a year's worth of potential income

LORS: my brag sheet was really good ngl??? i spent a weird amount of time on it. one letter is from my biotech teacher who’s had me for three years now so i think it’s probably a 9/10, other one was from my lang teacher who i was really close with on a personal level last year so i think it’s probably an 8-9/10. my counselor was new this year so she doesn’t know me super well which kinda sucks but if she followed my brag sheet pretty heavy then it should be around a 7/10

Interview: felt very conversational, got along really well, she told me she thought i’d be perfect for rice and fit into the student body really well and said she’d be recommending me. told her i wanted to sort into Wiess and she told me i totally seem like a Wiessmen

i’m very apprehensive of if my gpa/test scores will hold me back :("

I know as a freshman, my chances are significantly lower, but I figured I should at least try - since the alternative would be working a minimum wage job. As a double major in computer science and business, I'm open to internships from tech to sales.

My skills/experience are:

* Job experience
   * McDonald's crew member 
   * Founder of nonprofit tutoring at high school (I was thinking this shows my initiative to take action and work with a team)
* Tech Skills
   * Web/Mobile development (JavaScript frameworks, Firebase)
      * I started developing my own app when covid hit and since then I've found that I really enjoy coding and learning new concepts
   * Languages: Python, Java, JavaScript
* Business skills?
   * Microsoft Word Expert (Certification) and Excel (About to get it soon)
   * I applied and was accepted to my school's ""Entrepreneurship Society"" in which we help give businesses consulting but that doesn't start until next semester

Do you guys think I might have a chance with landing an internship?"

k707x3,9,2020-12-04,How not to let my fears get to me?,mi_x58,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/k707x3/how_not_to_let_my_fears_get_to_me/,"It's a really fickle question. I am constantly under the pressure of doing better and getting to a point which is better than the present. Whether it be about my upcoming exams or worrying about anything else. But mostly about exams. These decide where I would go in the future but these exams are two years from now. I'm already thinking about it due to past mishaps. When I take CAT my acads aren't that great both mid 80s, I will try my hardest in college to get the highest cgpa. But I feel like it's not good enough. Some say it is and some not. Finally, decided to not bother with it. Just focusing on college and doing some internships and co-curriculars. 

Another thing that always bothers me is I can't stop comparing myself to others. And not the ones who have achieved what I want but to the ones that are doing stuff that I am afraid of doing. Things that I presume will set me back. Some staunch examples might be to end up as a primary teacher after BA or doing MBA from places that nobody has even heard of. I'm always afraid I might end up like that. I always end up with questions like why didn't you try harder? Your grades are good so why did you settle for Bharati vidyapeeth for MBA? Believe it or not, these things bother me. I am not going to a therapist because I don't want anyone to know and don't want to burden anyone with my expenses as I'm already a college student. Maybe someday.

I do plan to work hard but seeing as many things didn't work out in the past, I always feel it won't as well in the future. 

What ifs are always bothering me. If this doesn't happen or if that doesn't happen. I don't think I can control anything but will it be too bad to prepare for it. Like kids take coaching for an exam which will happen after two years from now. But then as plans go wrong I think trying is useless as well."

I graduated with a degree in Computer Science in May 2020... probably the worst time to graduate I've ever seen in my short lifetime.

I had no internships upon graduation. Getting a job after graduating was hard even before COVID... I applied to SWE jobs all summer with no luck and I gave in and decided to take an IT Specialist position because I didn't want to have a gap of employment on my resume or a gap in earnings. 

The job turned into not being what I thought it would be but in a good way! The IT department is super small so I found opportunities to work with software that would be more useful to me in terms of developing useful skills. Besides MySQL everything else they use is useless to me so I've volunteered myself for anything having to do with it. Now from the start to end of my day I'm pretty much always making sql queries and generating reports.

There is not and will never be an opportunity to be a software engineer at this company... eventually I'll have to leave. I got this job in late October... I haven't had it long... how much longer should I stay? IDC what they say my job title is... the job title they have me working as doesn't fit the responsibilities they have me do so they can get away with paying me less so I'm not gonna use it on my resume... I'lll probably use SQL Report Analyst or something more fitting to what I actually do. I'd ideally like to move from this job to something like a junior back end development position. What makes me think staying is a good idea is essentially 2 things... the unstable job market and the fact that jumping ship fast might look alarming. If staying there until October 2021 is for the best for my career then I would but I just wanna know how I'd fair with a Bachelors and 1-2 years experience as a SQL Report Analyst. ALSO! In the meantime do you guys think I should work on personal project or go for a cert or something?"

I made the switch last year and I’m about two terms away from graduating with a Bachelors. I did manage to land an internship doing game development (gaming). The work is pretty interesting and the people are really cool, but I’m not quite sure if this specifically is what I would ultimately want to do for the next long haul. I’m currently looking into grad schools (OMSCS &amp; UIUC, specifically) and considering specializing or expanding my knowledge partially out of self-interest and partially to be (hopefully) a more valuable asset in the full time job market. 

The dilemma: I’m not quite sure what I would want to do. Although I do love programming, I also think it would be fun to learn to actually build things with my hands too, like robotics, machinery, etc... Are there jobs or specializations out there that allow people to code and build things in the physical space? I love the idea of working in video games (I think I would feel comfortable in a creative space given my previous career), but I hear horror stories about the working conditions and pay of that career path. AI sounds interesting, too, although I’ve never personally delved into it and I’m not very sure what a specialization in it would open the door to career-wise.

The question: What insight could you seasoned developers offer for someone in my position? If you’re in one of the careers I mentioned having an interest in, what is it actually like? How do you enjoy it? What do you do? What would you advise someone in my position to do to position themselves for that sort of work in the best way possible? If this question seems fairly broad, it is - I’m a bit lost right now tbh."

I applied to many internships and have not even been offered an interview. 

&amp;nbsp;

I worked in blue collar industries for the past 10 years and have never had an office job. Im currently focusing on getting an Aws cloud cert as well as setting up a nice looking github with a few projects.

&amp;nbsp;

I am social, friendly, and as a result I have a few friends in my area who have good jobs at tech companies and are willing to help me out. I also have several family members who are doing quite well at some big companies.

&amp;nbsp;


My questions are these: 

how can I best use these connections to my advantage? Many of these are an ""ask once"" type of situation and I dont want to waste any favors with an empty resume or by failing an interview. 



Also, how early should I be calling in these favors if I want to be employed in July or August? 



Should I try to get some experience at a smaller or less desirable company before trying to leverage my connections?

&amp;nbsp; 


More info: the companies where I have the strongest connections are Microsoft, amazon, paypal and youtube.

I am 24 years old i live in germany and i am not german but still living here I've migrated from my country because I was in danger so now i am a refugee here. 


There is so much happened with me in my life that I can't take it anymore

Me and my family were living in libya I've lived there for 18 years and it was the most beautiful time of my life

I had 2 elder brothers and a sister in law and mom and dad.

My life was really normal as every teenager.

And one day i went to school and my family was gone I've heard the news in the school that my family died in a car crash.

My mom my brothers and my sister in law they all died but my father was alive he was at home.


From that day things changed in my life my father and my relatives started to abuse me physically and verbally and also in School other students started to taunt me without reasons they used to bully me i didn't knew what to do.


And there's an important fact that I am a (gay)

My mother knew it and she accepted me but my father never did when I told him.

When my family was gone my father fixed my marriage with a girl.

And I had to tell my father then I couldn't keep it inside me because I didn't wanted to ruin my life and the girl's life too.

I told my father about my Sexuality and from that time he started to disrespect me more and more and hurted me physically also and used to cuff me that I won't go out of the house.

My life become more and more worse and then my father threatened me to kill me if I won't marry.

I had to do something about it and i had to flee from there.

The only person I could rely on was myself at that time i was just 16 and i was jobless and had no money.

In our countries like ( Asian) (arab) countries when our mothers die they leave something for the children behind.

My mother's gold was in my father's possession which was mine.

And I knew if I would've asked my father for it he would've never gaved it to me.

So i stole it and ran away from my house and contacted an agent who could've sent me to Europe illegally.

Well then i met one and he smuggled me to someone who was sending people to Europe by boat it was the biggest risk of my life that I took and saw many people dying.

Well i survived and reached Europe and when I reached Europe I thought everything was OK then and i was completely fine but it wasn't.

There were alot of people with me because the authorities took us to the camp in italy (Sicily).

We stayed there like for 14 days and we've had our choices if we wanted to travel somewhere else or wanted to stay in italy.

Well people were deciding where they will be going and then I've spoked to some people and they told me italy isn't a good country to stay it's not financially strong and don't have alot of jobs so it's not really good to stay here
We're deciding to go to Germany and I've had some money with me.

I've had that money because I've sold the gold of my mother and got some cash.

Well i came to Germany then and felt peaceful like it is my home i started going to school made new friends learned the language and found the part time job also but have to mention that I've applied for asylum.

And i was in the process of the decision.

And one day a letter arrived at my camp that I can't stay in Germany because of the Dublin law and had to go back to Italy because I've gaved my fingerprints in italy.

Well i was deported back to italy.

It wasn't good Milan (Milano) .

For some months I couldn't find a place to sleep because the places were full.

But I managed to find some places where I could eat food.

But it was so hard to live in the streets but I tried to be strong and face it.

And then I've got a call one day for a place where I can sleep.

It was a big camp there were 600 hundred people in that place.

20 to 40 people in each room with no privacy.

The food wasn't good also but I won't complain about it because at least I was getting something.

I had to wait alot to get the work permit to work and in that waiting period I've learned Italien.

And finally that day arrived when I've got the work permit and I was so happy about it even though things were really bad with me.

Well then i started looking for job but I couldn't find one.

But instead I've found an internship for 3 months in a super market and I was really happy about it.

From my first salary I've rent a room with someone and that place was all mine.

I started to live my life normally and tried to get better everyday and started to save money for my little wishes like ps4 and video games.

I love traveling hiking and also music movies and video games.

Well that day arrived when my internship finished.

And my financial problems began I had problems with paying rent buying food and also had to recharger my phone and i wasn't paying tax because usually with internship we can't afford it the government knows it. 

With Internships we get around like 500 to 800 euros. 

Well i had to leave that place and had to sell my things also had to sell my ps4 which I loved alot and it helped me with my depression. 

Well then I couldn't find anything a job or an internship or something even though I did some courses. 

People were so racist to me because of my colour because of my skin the way I look and so on. 

Even if someone had a job they wouldn't give it to refugees. 


My life was torn apart again and I attempted suicide but survived. 

I had a psychologist also who used to talk to me and helped me somehow with my depression and ptsd also BPD. 

I didn't knew what to do so. 

I kept thinking and thought about coming back to Germany and give it a new try ( i have to mention here that i had Italien work permit with which i was only allowed to work in italy). 

So i came back to Germany and made second asylum request and started to learn German from where i left and in the mean time i fell for someone he was really nice and beautiful and funny i really liked his personality and started to spend more time with him. 

And we spoked about relationships and stuff too and he was always like I love you and blah blah. 

I trusted him and gaved him everything that i had until one day I found out that he was cheating on me and confronted him and then he told me that we're not a thing and we never were it was all just fun. 

I was so broken so depressed so in pain that I wanted to scream and cry but I couldn't i felt like my soul left my body. 


And also got the negative decision from the government and they said i can't stay here have to go back to italy. 

I never wanted alot from my life i didn't had big wishes like to have a big house or a car or something more I wanted to have a family a simple house a simple job and some friends and also a ps4. 

I am in Germany now and they took all my rights away i am without any psychological help without financial help also without friends my friends left me alone. 

I they couldn't send me back to italy because of the corona pendamic but i still have to go back don't know when. 


I've lost everything 

Everything that I wanted 

I am in depression since I lost my family i felt so broken so lonely so helpless can't describe. 

Also i developed ptsd and BPD also social anxiety disorder that i can't even meet people personally now.

I feel so anxious so scared I've lost my confidence myself esteem i can't look into someone's eyes and talk. 

I've distanced myself from everyone and everything I've lost my interest in my hobbies too. 


I am not posting this to have someone's attention or begging for help but just wanted to let everyone know that sometimes being so strong breaks you inside. 

Sorry a for long post but I hope it's worth reading 

I didn't told people close to me because they don't care but I really don't have a reason to live Further and I can't take it anymore. 

So m writing it here.

M sorry for my English it's really bad.

EDIT - I'VE GOT THE DEPORTION LETTER TO ITALY TODAY IT'S OFFICIAL AND THE DATE IS 11 FEBRUARY."

*Heya guys, I’m quite new to writing so please give me some constructive criticism, I’d really appreciate it! I've decided to write a very short two-part or maybe three-part (we’ll see!) series on humanity’s first contact with the galaxy at large and their impact on the galactic community since college work can be a pain at times :)*

*Most alien measurements/items have been converted into the \[human equivalent\] for clarity*

*Edits were mainly just me trying to mess with getting a horizontal line and failing, don't worry!*

&amp;#x200B;

“...one which gave birth to a species like no other” - the legendary xenobiologist J’Alla’s famous last words moments after she heard about the formation of the Galactic Cooperative. A sneaky member of the \[paparazzi\] (we share a commonality with humanity there, as they're almost as universally despised with us too) had taped an \[audio recorder\] to the underside of her bedside table before being forcefully escorted out by security the day before but had immortalised these words forevermore into galactic history.

Maybe I should explain the very significance of this event, in case you did not receive a basic education in epoch 32 of galactic history. It all started on one backwater world (literally, over 70% of this planet’s surface was covered in water!) and a species who refused to die.

Well, every single one of the millions of species on that damn planet refused to die, but one had come from humble beginnings (as a *persistence hunter* nonetheless) to rise to become the tamer of a world without parallel… in how brutal natural selection could be. It’s no wonder the humans had a full functioning theory of evolution (from a *single* bright individual as well) midway into their industrial revolution, and a scarce two centuries prior, they’d nearly executed a man for even proposing the idea that their backwater planet wasn’t the centre of the universe. Truly a curious species.

You see, life on most other life-bearing worlds tends to enter a stage of natural equilibrium for many millions of years, something human xenobiologists would term as *evolutionary stagnation* (apologies we don’t all come from deathworlds where life is so bleak and violent that minute mutations actually mean the difference between life and death) where there are no cataclysms to force organisms to leave their niches or perish. On Earth, the name for the human planet in their dominant tongue, life is forced to adapt or go extinct - something that humans excel in. Earth has had **6** **major mass extinction events**, with the most recent being induced by humans themselves - it was enough to cause many researchers to go into a frenzy; it defied all basic logic that sapient organisms could arise from such a hellhole. A planet where volcanoes can erupt near-spontaneously with the force of *10,000 atomic bombs*, lethal pathogens that have a ridiculous ability to adapt to any known treatment except the ever-adapting antibody swarms of nanites and with a gravity well of \[9.81 m/s\^2\] \[1\], it is a wonder humanity ever got to escape that cruel, inhumane cage.

It was always thought that sapience was a passive evolutionary process, simply because when evolutionary pressures were too great, it was more cost-effective and *immediately* useful to evolve claws or deadly toxins compared to bigger brains. Herds of herbivores slowly became more intelligent over many millions of years to evade predators, and predators slowly became more intelligent to catch herds unawares. An evolutionary race at a snail’s pace compared to the spectacle of natural selection on Earth, in fact, the first sapient race in the galaxy may well have come from Earth if it were not for all its mass extinctions regularly wiping the slate clean. Apparently, humanity’s primate ancestors were in a position where having a bigger brain was an *actual* selective advantage, taking less than \[6 million years\] to evolve sentience (counted from their last common ancestor with another extant species of primates). Our xenobiologists are still barely recovering from that fact, the speed of evolution on Earth was so breathtaking it was actually *experimentally observable* in several of its lower order lifeforms.

Humanity can certainly be characterised as a barbaric and violent race (big surprise there considering they live on a spinning rock with a *very* bad temperament). Sure, any civilisation will find having only a single planet of resources quite restraining and will have some kind of conflict over limited resources. But humans had certainly surpassed and exceeded expectations in this regard, with their wars being measured in *megadeaths* before nuclear weaponry was even conceptualised. That macabre milestone was achieved with solely basic chemical weapons and mass-produced weaponry. Yet, only humans could become *more peaceful* with the advent of nuclear weapons, saving their planet from being one of the innumerable charred husks put into permanent nuclear winters. Although, maybe that didn’t mean much when a single very lethal disease had caused *untold billions of deaths* throughout human history, only confirming my initial thoughts that Earth might as well be renamed *Insanely Deadly Monkey Cage* or something along those lines.

But humanity has been on a centuries-long redemption arc since the successful (but *very nearly* failed) implementation of mutually assured destruction (yes, humanity was saved by their collective MADness), with the formerly disparate nation-states of Earth being slowly transformed into a single federalised United Nations of Earth. By the mid 24th century \[2\], humanity was still in the middle of the transition to becoming a race with a single government. It was simply *unthinkable* that a species could colonise other celestial bodies before even uniting their own (only a whole planet had the resources necessary to start space exploration surely), but humanity was very much an *unthinkable* species. Their very existence threw several millennia-old scientific theories and laws, the majority of which were in the biological sciences, out of the window and into a flaming \[dumpster\].

A very controversial human economist stated, back when humanity was still colonising parts of their hostile blue dot, that the early and crude capitalist economies of humanity would be its own downfall with surprising accuracy \[3\]. The human automation revolution created billions of unemployed workers over several decades in a huge range of industries while unprecedented strides were taken in AI technology, computer processing power, the development of viable fusion reactors and nanobots amongst others. Capitalism, made obsolete by humanity’s access to nearly limitless resources due to nearly 100% efficient recycling of materials, was replaced by a form of universal basic income in an economy where robots replaced every job so humanity could lift itself to higher heights of creativity and innovativeness, now decoupled from profit margins.

Luna, Earth’s single satellite, was the site of huge human colonies almost solely dedicated to Helium-3 mining (billions of years of exposure to the harsh solar rays of Sol creating an extraordinary amount of the substance in the fine regolith that covers Luna) as fuel for fusion reactors. Mars (the fourth planet in the Sol system), ironically named after a long-gone but influential human civilisation’s god of war, was settled as a co-operative effort to reduce geopolitical tensions between the nation-states on Earth at the time. Mars along with Venus (the second planet in the Sol system, suffered from runaway greenhouse emissions billions of years ago) was in the lengthy process of being ‘terraformed’ by the millions of humans who call those celestial bodies home, which was a very alien concept to us at the time (and still is in all honesty, like only humanity would try to make a planet inhospitable to all higher forms of life habitable).

By then humanity had sent out several thousand quantum-entangled ion-thruster communication probes into the dark in a vain effort to declare to the universe that *“we were never meant to travel the cosmos alone”*. An intrepid, just out of school xenobiologist was posted on the fringes of civilised space in the Orion Spur to a small research outpost orbiting a grade 5 (very hostile) planet \[4\] to study and collect samples of the pathogens there as well as run evolutionary studies using some of the \[insect analogues\] there - this was all to contribute to their dissertation as well. J’Alla was working alongside a few other similarly naive xenobiologists when they noted an intense radio signal emanating from a strange table-sized probe with no known origin.

The probe had slowed down once it entered the system, confirming its artificial origin, and entered a prograde orbit of the very grade 5 planet the xenobiologists were studying. No recovery required, as the probe broadcast its intentions for a rendezvous with the station and was recovered within a solar day of its first detection. In being sent to a savage world on the edge of known space (unbeknownst to them, it was an assignment solely to get them out of their professors’ hair - though, now I think about it J’Fola don’t have any head fur to speak of), a group of 8 intern xenobiologists from 4 different species made the galactic discovery of the millennium.

Soon the entire GalacticNet was buzzing with news of the first space-faring race from the Orion Spur. Concurrently, on the purely research-affiliated NebulaLink, the collective shock and horror of the galaxy’s xenobiologists was profound when they pinpointed the location of the alien homeworld after extracting the coordinate info off the probe and found it matched to an entry in the ancient Galactic Celestial Body Database: a *grade 6 deathworld* orbiting a G2V main spectrum star (last surveyed 200,000 years ago).

A sixth of a solar year later, thousands of lightyears away from Earth in the Perseus Arm, orbiting around a very typical K-type star, a megastructure of truly epic proportions spanning over \[1000 kilometres\] from top to bottom and \[300 kilometres\] at its widest was shaken by this very discovery. The rushing back and forth of nerve-wracked politicians, the faces of utterly shocked researchers deep in whatever appendages they had and the panicked ramblings of top admirals and generals - the most stoic men and women in the galaxy reduced to mere schoolboys and girls. A *sapient and space-faring* deathworlder race that actively sought out alien life in a peaceful manner... to say that this was unprecedented in galactic history would not do that previous statement justice.

The very best of deathworlder races were told in age-old tales to have been so ravenous for resources, harbouring a very strong desire for greed that served them well on their deathtrap of a homeworld, that they delivered only genocide and annihilation and eventually sent upon swarms of Von Neumann replicators in their hubris only to doom all sentient life including themselves. Only the activation of vast \[hundreds of thousands of kilometres\] spanning arrays of neural/electronic jammers utilising a very poorly understood branch of physics esoterically termed “neural physics” by these precursor races, saved the galaxy from certain doom at the cost of killing all higher forms of life within it.

This age-old prejudice of deathworlders came into full force in this 60001st session of the Galactic Council \[5\], and many of the representatives of the more powerful species called for nothing short of complete annihilation of this upstart species before they “\[grey goo\] this galaxy leaving only machines and black holes.” The debate was at a fever pitch with many of the educated civilians, there to report on their work or to witness the workings of galactic politics, such as researchers, political scientists, and lawyers wanting to initiate first contact with humanity while the majority of the old-guard were about as unyielding as expected - the council seemed as if it was going to tear itself apart, with allied species taking opposing sides, and former brothers in arms, who both saw and lied through unspeakable acts of horror while in service, decrying each other as mentally insane.

That was until a ripple in spacetime swept over the Council Station, and momentarily the megastructure orbiting one of the suns of the Core Worlds felt as if it was actually going to tear itself apart, with all the important figures of the galaxy within. All of them at the mercy of this insanely humbling phenomenon of the universe. The latest tech of hyperspace sensors, recently installed onto the station, with \[picosecond\] discrimination of spacetime ripples formed by anything weighing more than a car entering and leaving hyperspace in a 5 light-year radius of the station. The full explanation of spatial-temporal dynamics of the physics of hyperspace travel would require 3 years of full-time study at one of the few accredited-Omega Institutions located in the Core sectors of the galaxy but very very simply put, the mass of objects entering hyperspace ‘ceases’ to exist in our universe and ‘appears’ back when leaving hyperspace; creating minute ripples in spacetime as the universe ‘adjusts’ to the instantaneous change of mass at a point.

After the groaning of the hyperdimensional superstructure of the station seemed to reach a crescendo and faded away, the silence of the assembled leaders and civilians alike was even more deafening. All the sensors pointed at the origin of the spacetime ripple being from the Sol system.

\[1\] For reference, the galactic standard is about \[6-7 m/s\^2\] and even then the rocket equations are decently inhibitive to space transport, one can only shudder thinking about how inefficient the early human space programs must have been.

\[2\] This is based on the primary dating system of the humans, which counts the number of orbits Earth has completed around Sol since the birth of a religious figure that plays a major role in two of humanity’s major religions.

\[3\] **OOC:** Yes, that was a reference to Karl Marx and before any of you say it, no I’m not a communist. This isn’t even a criticism of capitalism per se, but automation *will* change the very fundamentals of economic activity as normal levels of consumption would be made impossible by the mass levels of unemployment created, economic systems always change and transform with time as understanding of economics improves anyway. Manna by Marshall Brain is an online sci-fi read that honestly explores the issue of post-automation economics in a much better way than I ever will.

\[4\] That very planet was later downgraded to a grade 4 hostile planet in light of the discovery of post climate change Earth. Yes, it really was so bad that Earth made some planets *ex-deathworlds* because they couldn't compare.

\[5\] The Galactic Council is very similar in function to the 24th century United Nations of Earth already described where some executive and legislative power is held by the council president and judiciary respectively, but individual alien governments are lent a significant amount of autonomy. The institution is a \[quarter of a million years\] old bureaucratic nightmare with over 250 represented sapient species (thankfully, there are only 10-15 major ones that basically run the whole show). The council comes into session every \[4.2 earth years\], the amount of time taken for the Larredon (one of the founding species) homeworld to orbit its star twice."

I’m currently a junior in college but I realized I will be graduating with only 2 internships. 1 internship as a PM and one as a “Technology Analyst” which is practically SWE but the title is not there.

This puts me behind because I will have no SWE title before graduating and I’ll only have done 2 internships in total because I slacked off freshman year.

What is your guys’ opinion on doing school part time and an internship part time? Is it worth it or is it too much of a hassle?

I really wish I had done an internship Freshman year so I wouldn’t have to worry about this but there’s just not enough time to do a third internship unless I graduate later or drop to part time, both of which are questionable decisions.
Thanks for any advice/feedback!"

**Intended Major(s):** Economics, Marine Biology

**ACT:** Not submitting scores.

**Academics:** My school does not have GPA or ranking. We were not allowed to take AP classes freshman or sophomore year. Junior year we were limited to 2-3. Senior year the only ap class that remains is ap calculus, the rest of the ap courses are now called UL (upper-level).

I had an awful 9th-grade year which I explained in a very well written additional Common App essay. I talked about how I had to deal with some bullying in 8th grade and I had to find new friends.

&amp;#x200B;

9th Grade: B-/C+ Average (One class I had a D+) (5 Academic Classes)

10th Grade: B+ Average (5 Academic Classes)

11th Grade: A Average (6 Academic Classes, AP US History (Score = 5))

12th Grade: A Average (7 Academic Classes, 2 UL Classes)

**Recommendations and Interview:**

3 Recs from Junior Teachers: 10/10

3 Recs from my Internship that I had Junior and senior year: 20/10 no joke. CEO (Fuqua Alum), Head of Sales (Trinity Alum), and manager of inside sales.

1 Rec from someone who funds a scholarship at Duke who I have known for years: 10/10.

I don't think the interview could have gone better. We connected on a bunch of things and it went over an hour and 20 mins.

&amp;#x200B;

**Extracurriculars:**

1. Master Scuba Diver: I have logged over 300 dives since I got my certification at age 10, participated in service expeditions that save marine and coral life.
2. Intern: managed customer database &amp; did customer administrative work. Two months for the past two summers
3. Freelance Business Owner and Founder: Ran a local tech support referral-based freelance business for 6 years.
4. Sailing, Varsity Crew and Skipper: 1 out of 3 people from my school that has ever been part of a  competitive sailing team.
5. Vice President and Co-Founder of a community service organization: Award winning community service organization that delivered thousands of homeless outreach kits
6. Tutor at my school: I tutor students from a local public elementary in Washington, DC
7. Harvard Model Congress: I have participated in HMC as many years as I could. My roles were: United Nation Security Council (Kenya), Junior: NSC (Pence).
8. Recreational Tennis: I play tennis recreationally with a group of students from my school. I would play competitively, but it does not work with my sailing schedule.
9. Member, Jewish Student Coalition: A group of Jewish students meet at my school to discuss current events going on in the world and how they relate to our culture.

**Essays:** I think my essays were excellent. I had multiple qualified people read them and they all loved them. My main essay was about how SCUBA diving is a natural fit for an introvert. My additional information essay was about my freshman grades. The ""Why Duke"" supplement was about the mix of marine biology and economics at Duke and the professors that I met with before I submitted my application. My ""share a unique perspective"" supplement was about how I have always connected well with older people.

I took Data8 this semester as an introductory to coding and really enjoyed it. After a lot of contemplation, I decided that I want to switch to CS so I'm taking 61A next semester. However, other than knowing what classes to take in order to declare and graduate, I really have no idea how to set myself up for success post-graduation while at Cal. Should I devote my time to clubs? Is research as prevalent of a priority the way it is for those doing premed? How does one even begin applying for internships? Overall, what should I do with my time not devoted to classes?

Sorry if these questions are super general. I think I am just so overwhelmed since CS and coding is all super, super, super new to me and I feel like I'm starting off with a disadvantage having *literally* no previous experience outside of Data8. I know everyone's path in this major and what they want to do in the future is different, but does anyone have a general guide on how they would lay out their four years at this school and any additional advice on how to ""succeed""? As a general note, I want to graduate and immediately start working, maybe grad school after. But what are the pros/cons of working before grad school/going straight to grad school after undergrad?

k7gumb,12,2020-12-05,Application,buddysharkfan,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/k7gumb/application/,"Well it’s official, I’ve applied to the OSUOnlineCS program with a summer 2021 start. 

My background: BS degree in Actuarial Science with a minor in Mathematics.  I have over 7 years experience now in my respective field (including internships). I....despise my career as it stands.  Need a glorified Excel/Word financial reporter? I’m not your guy, even though that feels like the only thing I’m qualified professionally for these days.  For those asking, I’ve reached associate level of my relevant actuarial society (though that probably means nothing to you, just like it means nothing to any non-actuarial recruiter out there).  I’ve been dreaming of a change for years now.

I always felt like I missed my calling going into computer science in college.  I had a passion for it, no doubt.  I opted for the actuarial path because of high paying internships and job outlook.

In the last year and a half I’ve been hitting the self-taught route hard (Udemy full stack boot camp, several books, personal projects, etc.). I’ve applied to many junior level SWE/developer positions, but obviously to no avail.  2 of these applications have resulted in a 2nd round of interview (furthest I’ve been).  I’ve had a few coding challenges sent my way as a first round.  But alas, I live in rejection most of the time.

This has led me to seriously consider getting a degree, and OSUs post baccalaureate program has definitely piqued my interest.  Thus, I am here now.  In a pretty cushy job that I have 0 passion towards, and career that will do me no favors in developing my technical skills.  I want out and want to know if I’m making the right decision to enroll in the OSU program (acceptance permitting). 

Thanks for taking time to read."
k7hvho,1,2020-12-05,This is getting a little annoying...,Rukeriusu,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/k7hvho/this_is_getting_a_little_annoying/,"Okay so I'm a 23 year old unemployed recent graduate. I'm getting attacked from all-sides(kinda) and I feel like I haven't exactly explained my position here.

I graduated with a degree in Agricultural Education and Communication. Explaining what the degree is about is a bitch. I know what it is, but putting it into words that people can understand is difficult when most of the folks I'm trying to explain it to think that studying a certain degree just strictly means what you are studying based on the title. Like if you're an engineer, you're gonna work with Tesla or something, not a bank or something entirely different(which my folks DO NOT believe and almost always assume they are either lying about their success or they picked up some sort of minor in financing).

But here is what my degree entails from my understanding. Essentially, students studying AEC learn basic general journalism skills enough to do science communication. I'd say we would be learning science communication skills, but we actually learn to do things other than science communication. Kinda confusing I know, but the degree is still fairly new in my college. I'd say it started around 2005 and then it got more popular starting 2011. 

Communications isn't the only thing AEC students study. They also pick up leadership skills and get exposed to some companies on how they work, what they do during some crisis situations, and how they lead their people. Leadership is a pretty broad subject there and it's about half of the study. That's about as simple as I can think of to explain what Agricultural Education and Communication is about. In short, I always just say it's journalism under the umbrella of agriculture with a side of leadership. But I wonder if people actually get the idea, y'know?

Obviously, you know with the pandemic, getting a job is really hard and remote jobs are just going like hotcakes. However, with me it's even more difficult. So I am more focused on trying to get videographer job or anything to do with digital media production. I have the experience and skills. However, a remote videographer who hasn't worked under any companies or organizations is really tough to get. Yes, I did make videos but to be fairly honest about half of those videos, they were actually for projects from digital media courses, but they were featured in a museum. But I don't tell the employers that. I just say that I did videos for a museum because technically, that is true. And these videos all happened when I was an undergraduate. I even did freelancing on the side so I'm able to just one-man band things myself, while also taking advantage of the resources an AEC undergraduate would have. I also have other experiences other than videography, such photography, writing, indesign, and photoshop. There's more but I wouldn't say I'm too proficient, just still learning.

Okay so here's where things start getting annoying. My folks, that being my parents, aunt and uncle on my mom's side, and also some of my friends, are bugging me to go for masters or just pick any other job that isn't even about what I've studied. Here's the problem: I can't. Professionally speaking and given my situation, I need to keep my skills in videography sharp while also learning skills that pertain to digital media. And I can't do that if I get any other job while I'm doing my own thing, because I know realistically for a fact that I won't have any time or energy to do both. I've tried before as an undergraduate and it just wasn't a great idea to overload myself given the amount of effort and concentration that goes into my digital media works. I'd be doing the same thing if I just get any job while babysitting, searching for the job I really want, and also working on my digital media skills. 

I've told them about this and I just get either ""you're just making excuses"" or just the usual optimistic ""you can do it if you try"". Like seriously, I'm not doing it again and I know for a fact that mentally and physically I wouldn't be able to handle it. I know my limits and picking a job out of the hat is beyond my limit. People seem to even think I'm just being over dramatic when I said I literally passed out during one of my presentations during undergrad years. I even have my professor on speed dial to attest to this. 

Now masters? I do wanna go for masters, but I don't know where to go or even have a feel for what specifically do I want to do in life. I don't have enough experience to discover that and I don't want to go and pick a masters and then later have regrets thinking ""I don't think I'm cut out for this"". Again, folks not understanding and it's getting really annoying when I'm pushed to business administration just because I was looking at advertising companies to work for. Like hell no, business administration isn't even popular anymore. 

Now I could ignore my parents and everyone else, but it doesn't help when they're going to me and bugging me about it when I'm over here formulating plans, researching what's going on, and even reconnecting and connecting professionally with some alumni and professors. And for the most part, the core problem is my aunt. Yeah uh...her son's successful and is studying to become a ""doctor"" and has an internship right now. Me and my cousin(that being the aunt's son) have a really good relationship and we tell each other things.  And also, my cousin texted me saying he's sorry in advance about his mom because his mom gossiping and also showing him off about what he's doing. Basically, my mom, and my aunt, and a couple of other relatives, are just having a contest about their sons and daughters and what they've accomplished.

I'm trying to get a job jfc, but it doesn't help when everyone is bugging me to do something. Like I can't! And I can't help it when the jobs I've applied to are on hiring freezes or literally just on a very slow hiring process."

Long form:

I’m in college and I’ve been talking to this girl for a few months now. I’m REALLY into her, but because of COVID things have been kinda complicated. We went on one coffee date in October, but because I live with my 65+ immunocompromised parents and she lives on campus (which is teeming with corona) we hadn’t seen each other since that date three months ago. I just wasn’t comfortable risking bringing an infection back home with me just to see this girl, and she understood that and was cool about it.

Last week was thanksgiving break, and her roommate moved out of her apartment and back home for the rest of the year- this current week being finals and my college administering them online. But, for reasons I won’t get into, this girl didn’t go home for thanksgiving and stayed in the apartment alone for the past two weeks. So, in an attempt to see her again before she moves back home until spring semester, I suggested it would be safe enough to meet up since nobody has been around her for two weeks anyway. She agreed and I was obviously hyped but also nervous.

So yesterday I take an examine in the morning and then eat a small lunch. I’m supposed to be  at her apartment by 6 PM, but an exam I’m taking runs longer than I anticipated and I don’t actually leave my house until almost 7. By this point, I haven’t eaten anything since around 1 in the afternoon, and I’m starving. Thankfully, she said she was going to cook some pasta for dinner, so I’m not worried about it and hop in the car.

When I get there I awkwardly search for the door in the apartment complex that’s her’s. After finding it, and getting a warm welcome, it’s time to dig in! Ah, delicious! Linguine with cooked cherry tomatoes and mushrooms covered in a light pesto sauce and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. WOW- it so much better than I expected! 

We start talking, and talking, and talking, and... talking. We talk for probably an hour and a half at this small dilapidated table in the kitchen. The chairs aren’t great, and while my ass is fine, my back begins to ache. Finally, she decides we should move to the couch.

On the couch, I sit awkwardly next to her. Close, but not too close. I’m honestly a very shy person and don’t want to make he uncomfortable, so I play it so much safer than necessary. We keep talking... about our families, politics, Covid, religion, school, mathematics (she’s a stats major and I’m Econ), internships, etc., etc. It goes on, and on, and on. For hours... just talking.  

Over time, we’ve both scooted closer to each other, so that our shoulders are touching and our legs too. I’m nervous as hell, and just keep bringing up new topics because I don’t know what the hell to do. Eventually I wonder if I should shut up and leave- but she’s talking a lot too so I stay. 11 o’clock roles around, which is her pretty much her bedtime usually, and she doesn’t seem to be dropping any hints of wanting me to leave.

This is around the point where I start to notice I’m still hungry. The pasta was absolutely fucking delicious, but god almighty that’s all we ate. I’m used to eating like a salad, some carbs, and some protein for dinner... and all I’d had was small bowl of noodles in the last 10 hours. I can feel my stomach churning, but it’s not that bad, so I get some more water and drink up to see if it helps, and it does a little but it’s not what I really need.

Finally, back on the couch I begin to loosen up. We’re holding hands, we’re kinda snuggling. I’m feeling good- she’s laughing. Awesome.

But it’s not long after that when the incessant conversation we’ve been having for 5 hours trickles to silence. I feel fine with the silence itself, because I’m a generally quiet person, but I’m anxious she might be feeling uncomfortable. I don’t know what to say though so I just sit there kinda staring at different objects in the room. 

I can see from the corner of my eye she keeps looking at me. I’m staring at the fucking thermostat, the lamp, the back door... and no matter what she’s looking at me next to her on the couch. I know what she’s thinking... she wants me to kiss her. She’s probably confused as hell why I haven’t yet. Well, I’m just not very fast moving with that stuff... yikes.

I look over at her. We both laugh nervously, then I glance away again. Shiiiittt. Okay, okay... I’ve got this. I look back at her again and smile- I want to kiss her but I’m so damn nervous.

That’s when I do probably the least romantic thing humanly possible and literally ask, “Can I kiss you?”

Yup. I asked if I could kiss her. Lame as fuck. 

But she took it well. Laughing, she says yes and that she was waiting, and then tells me about this one guy she dated in high school who never kissed her or even like held her hand, and blah blah blah.

So I ask her, genuinely, curious, if she’s ever kissed a guy before and she says she hasn’t. She asks if I’ve kissed girls and I definitely have lol. 

Now I’m feeling super nervous. I’m shaking. My stomach hurts and it’s growling at me. I’m laughing and smiling and she tells me I look, “so red” because I’m blushing. What a bimbo. 

I go in like I’m going to give a kiss on the lips, and then I get too scared and pull back. A few times I actually do this. She asks me what I’m doing and I tell her I’m just nervous. I feel like shit because this isn’t what it’s supposed to be like and she definitely deserves better than this circus.

Eventually, I man up and kiss her.

The first kiss we have is horrible. Honestly, trash. I pucker up and lay one on her, and she literally just sits there. It was like kissing a fucking brick wall. 

I laugh, afterward. Okay, I guess I’ll teach her how to kiss a guy. 

About an hour later my lessons have paid off! Things are getting pretty hot and heavy but my stomach is absolutely empty and I feel sick. My small intestine might as well be eating my large intestine. I keep feeling gas coming up from my stomach chamber into my throat.

So here I am, fucking lip-locked, french and all on her couch and I can’t stop whats about to happen. I swallow a few small burps (or the gas that causes them). Then, it all comes back up with a vengeance. 

Mid-make-out session I let out a, “BLAHHHHRRG” so loud you’d think The Revolting Slob was in the room; INTO HER MOUTH. 

I BELCH DIRECTLY INTO HER MOUTH.

Then, silence. 

She doesn’t say anything. I open my eyes, and after a few seconds of silence I say what she surely knows, “I burped... sorry.” To which she responds sarcastically but coolly, “I guess I’ll forgive you.” 

The rest of the night was still pretty good, but I felt bad about it (still do). I got home around 4 AM, still about to starve to death, and scarfed down four pieces of baloney right out of the fucking package before hitting the couch to sleep. Woke up this morning STILL hungry and ate a big breakfast. I just hope this girl doesn’t overthink it, but I have to admit it was a pretty bad move on my part. I should’ve just asked for something else to eat.

TL;DR: I was on a second date with this girl I really like. We ate dinner at her apartment, but hours later my stomach got upset because I hadn’t eaten in a while and I was hella nervous to kiss her. Ended up burping in her mouth and having to apologize."

* you’re struggling to make friends because of your refusal to compromise your values or because... zoom uni
* you were not able to participate in overhyped campus events because you had to work (pre-COVID)
* your university experience is not what you expected it to be or like the movies make it look like it's supposed to be
* you’re battling with your mental health right now
* you've had to take some time off school to take care of yourself or someone you love
* you hate your program or you didn’t graduate with a degree in your program of choice
* it took you a bit longer than your peers to graduate 
* you’re not a fan of zoom university
* you are having a good time at uni, but just don’t have the pictures or instagram posts to prove it
* even pre-COVID, you really just wanted the degree. not the parties, not the stereotypical unhealthy lifestyle, just the degree.
* you’re giving uni your best, but still haven’t found your passion or your purpose
* you feel FOMO because you are doing your bit to stay safe and not put others at risk during this pandemic 
* you’re giving it your best, but still haven’t found an internship or a job
* you’re giving your studies your best, but your GPA doesn’t reflect it
* you’ve found out that a lot of your thoughts, beliefs and perspectives on certain issues are unpopular and sometimes you find yourself in a lonely fight for the things that matter to you
* you feel out of place with other students of the same age, race, or nationality as you
* you didn’t fall in love with your city like others did or didn’t even get to experience the city this semester
* you’ve changed your major like 5 times
* you've outgrown your friends
* zoom uni made you realize you had more acquaintances than friends
* you’re older/younger than most people in your program
* zoom uni has you feeling disconnected from the university life
* this finals season feels particularly scary and uncertain

as we’re heading to finals season, i really just want to encourage other students out there who have mixed feelings towards their time in university or really the semester we've just had. you’re not alone and you have a bright and beautiful future ahead of you, regardless of how the present looks. more than ever, we need to let go of the pressure to do uni right or make these years the best years of our life. it's okay if your uni experience is not like everyone else's or anyone's expectation of what it should be.

I was wondering if I could get some insight from anyone. Some background: I have a BA in graphic design. I have over 10 years professional experience from working freelance, commercial, and I worked for a church doing design for them. I loved that job, but it was a paid internship and was temporary.

For the life of me I have never been able to find a job in graphic design in my city, or anything else for that matter. I've applied to other positions such as courier, data entry, administrative jobs... hell, I'm not even sure I want to do graphic design anymore (especially commercial, I learned I hate designing for clients with a passion). I've been stuck in low paying entry level jobs (currently working assembly for a shady company that might send our jobs overseas), and have been trying to figure out a career path and I just feel lost, so I decided I might go back to school for programming.

So here's my questions: as someone with a background in design, what programming languages would be ideal? I've done web courses and learned some HTML, CSS, and a little Java, but are there any others you would recommend with my background? Also, because I already have a degree, could I get away with getting a certificate? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated friends, I don't know what to do anymore and just want a career instead of jumping from crappy job to crappy job.

When I was filling out my UC app recently with my dad, I realized my major was CS at almost every single one. Only a couple months ago i was completely opposed to doing CS bc I dont have a lot of experience with coding, but my dad was pushing me in that direction bc $$$ obviously.

I could use a bit of advice on what I should be focused on.

I'd like to ask a bit of advice. But first, some background info:.My qualifications are:

* Air Force Veteran, unrelated feild (jet mechanic).
* Serving tables for many years; excellent softskills
* I worked my colleges help desk for 6 months during a semester.
* I worked as a cyber security intern for a summer internship.
* I have an A+ and Net+ certification. Im going to get my Sec+ over the winter break.
* I'm in my 3rd year of college as an IT major. Ive gotten near straight A's throughout the entire time. I will likely attempt to get a masters.
* I speak pretty good spanish for a gringo. I live in Miami so its kinda required.

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

1. are these certs worth it? Ive heard ""certs or degrees but not both."" but some info is conflicting.
2. Should I be super focused on getting internships? It seems the vast majority of them are for coding. While I am very good at it, I dont enjoy it at all. I much prefer the IT side of things. They seem rather rare.
3. Once I graduate, or approach graduation date, what positions should I be aiming for? I see plenty of help desk positions but this seems disapointing because the pay is rather low. like 15$ per hour range, often lower. I didnt go through 4 years of schooling to make 15 an hour resetting passwords. Seems a bit entiteled I know, but I made more money bartending/serving.
4. Is it worth it to get a Master's Degree? My college offers one for 13k. That is fairly cheap IMO

I just accepted their offer for an internship which is very likely to convert into a full-time job (according to HR). It all looks so good that I'm not sure if I should trust the stats shown there lol... 

Any insights will really be appreciated! :)"

So far, majority of the classes I’ve been taking are general studies and business core classes. No IT experience, and been working as a security guard for the past four years. Within this next year, I’ll be taking most of my CIS classes. Hopefully, I should be done by Fall 2021 and my end goal is to become an information security analyst or in some sort of admin role. I am studying for CompTIA Net+ now, and am planning on getting Sec+ before I graduate. As of now, I have no real technical skills besides knowing basic python and some troubleshooting. The question is what should I do between now and graduating to become a more marketable individual? Should I try to get an internship or is there any other steps I can take to stand out from the competition?"

k88vw3,160,2020-12-06,Feeling so burned out from job searching since May and not getting anywhere. What do I do now? When do I throw in the towel?,asumello15,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/k88vw3/feeling_so_burned_out_from_job_searching_since/,"Hey r/AskEngineers,

I graduated in May 2020 with a degree in mechanical engineering from an accredited university, and I am having an impossible time finding a job. Primarily I would like to go into mechanical design, aerospace, defense, manufacturing, or a similar field. During my education I was involved in EPICS, ASME, Order of the Engineer, the marching band, led and successfully executed multiple project teams over 3 years, held a job at the engineering research lab on campus, and finished college with a 3.5 major GPA/ 3.86 upper-division GPA and honors for 5 semesters. Additionally, I hold a CSWA-Mechanical Design from Dassault Systemes and have strong recommendations from professors who are former NASA engineers.

Of all the possible reasons why I seem to be unhirable, my glaring weakness is that I didn't have an internship. I went to all the internship fairs my university offered since freshman year, but I was never even given a chance. This compounded year to year, and soon I was simply not offered internships because I did not have previous internship experience. Obviously, this was extremely frustrating.

If my tracking is correct, I have sent out close to 600 applications since June 1st and conducted a total of 2 interviews-- both of which I felt went very well. I was not selected for either position.

Understandably, many sectors in the engineering workforce were (and evidently still are?) facing hiring freezes at the end of May 2020, which led to the job offer(!!!) I had lined up being rescinded. This was a massive blow to my confidence, as the company that offered me a role in their mechanical design department was my senior capstone industrial partner. I poured my entire soul and nearly 60 hours per week for my whole senior year into this project, and after my final showcase the entire staff we worked with even offered their personal congratulations with optimistic hopes of working together in the near future. I think it's worth noting that this offer didn't come out of anywhere, but rather my industrial partner liaison (who was a systems engineer with the company) and I had been discussing my post-grad plans for several months leading to my final presentation. A week after my graduation, my liaison emailed me with news that they would not be hiring me, but would gladly pass my resume along to one of their partner companies. I never heard back from either of them... But the worst part for me was seeing all the new hires being celebrated on the local branch's (where I would have worked) LinkedIn page just a few weeks later. Radio silence from my liaison. It's as if I never existed.

Cut to December, seven months to the day after I finished school, and I'm no closer to starting my career. At this point, I honestly don't know what to do. It's so demoralizing knowing that I've spent the better part of a decade trying to finish my degree only to find that nobody wants to hire me. Yes, I graduated into a pandemic and I'm sure there are hundreds of thousands of students and recent graduates in this same position. Nothing I can do about that. I just don't understand what makes me so undesirable as a candidate. I feel like my lack of internship experience shouldn't be enough to disqualify me from an entire industry, especially given all my other academic achievements. =\\  


Edit: Forgot to add academic honors and Order of the Engineer.


Edit 2: Holy crap this absolutely blew up overnight! I appreciate the support and advice from everyone, let me try to answer the most common questions here so I don't end up repeating myself.

Regarding resumes: I think I have been to the career center at my school more times per semester than most others have in their entire academic career. Over the course of 4 years my general resume has evolved several times thanks to the advice from counselors, industry professionals, and career advice professionals. The best advice I received was to keep one long master resume and tailor each one that I send to that specific job. I've been told by almost everyone to keep it to one page and only include the most relevant information. One of the biggest problems I face is keeping it to that one page limit white maintaining a succinct structure and form. I never submit an incomplete resume or allow typos to slip through.

Cover letters: yes, I send these unless the application does not allow for submission. Similar to my resume, I keep a couple different forms of these handy for each type of job I apply to. I want them to understand WHY I want to work for them, not just that I'm looking for a job.

Response after sending an application: almost always don't hear back. I've gotten maybe 50 to 75 ""we regret to inform you..."" emails. Typically I will follow up after a week or two. On one or two occasions I've gotten ""we're reviewing candidate applications soon,"" but I almost always don't hear back from these either. I understand employers have to sift through thousands of applicants each month, but I usually let it go if I haven't heard back for more than 6 weeks or I see the same position reposted on a job board.

Interviews: both in-person interviews I have been invited to occurred on Zoom. I sat at a desk with a window in the background, and I wore a suit. When asked why I was wearing a suit, I replied that I felt like the only part that should have changed was the medium over which the interview was conducted. I don't feel like my communication skills are so poor to deter others from wanting to continue the conversion organically, as some have suggested. I am pretty comfortable speaking to others I haven't met and I try to be friendly without crossing the line of weird. When it came to technical questions I was honest without overstretching my reach of knowledge. I am comfortable telling an interviewer I do not know the answer to something if I genuinely do not know, rather than lie to them and having to weasel my way out of an awkward question about said topic later in the interview. Sent both a follow-up email after the email thanking them for their time and consideration. Did not hear from either.

Applying for internships instead of full-time positions: I can say with confidence that as of my graduation I have had 0% success with this. The most common responses are, ""try applying for a full time position instead,"" ""we only accept junior level students,"" and ""check back with us in a few months if there are openings we haven't filled."" I do plan on continuing my education to the master's level, but I am not currently enrolled in school. Therefore I cannot verify my enrollment for graduate level internships.

The FE: this was actually one of the things I was most looking forward to. I studied my ass off to take this in April 2020 while everything was still fresh in my mind. Then testing centers closed and the exam was postponed until August/September. In that several month-long stretch, the state in which I completed my undergrad got so bad covid-wise that I had a hard time justifying going anywhere but the grocery store. As a part-time employee without health insurance I couldn't afford to get sick. The FE sorta dropped off my radar as my mental health steadily declined. But, I eventually want to take and pass this exam as many companies in my current area require an EIT or the ability to receive an EIT within 6 months.

My area: I currently live in Seattle. Obviously not as good an area for ME as for other disciplines like computer science. Made the move in August with my SO, who was able to get a fairly well-paying job (frustratingly) only 2 months after finishing her masters in social work. We live comfortably at the moment and I'm doing part time work from home so the need for a second income is not life-or-death. The move was really good for both of us, as we both needed a change of environment. Since leaving my home state, we've noticed considerable improvements to our mental health."

We don’t have a lot of girls in CS classes and this makes it very hard to meet girls  compared to students in other majors. I don’t know how many of you can relate but given that we spend much of our time I computer labs, grinding Leetcode , working on side projects and so on, I don’t get exposure to more women and as a result I haven’t had a huge dating window, let  alone get a girlfriend. This is kinda scary  since college is where you are supposed to meet people for this kind of stuff and once I start working full time I am afraid it’s gonna be even harder. 

On the other hand I have interned with two Big N/FAAMG  and I feel like I know what I need to do to get a big N offer. For girls on the other hand, I can’t seem to hack it. Can any of you relate?

k89vyn,1,2020-12-06,"Losing hope - how can I move up from help desk, and/or land a WFH position? What certifications are most worthwhile?",ShaolinShade,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/k89vyn/losing_hope_how_can_i_move_up_from_help_desk/,"(TLDR at the bottom)

I've been researching a good path up from desktop support basically non-stop and can't seem to find a good path forward. I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/k26bmv/needing_career_advice_whats_the_best_way_up_from/) a little over a week ago and it died in the water after the initial set of comments, never received replies to my responses. I'm working with 7 years of desktop support type experience, started in college for IT, earned 80 credit hours, got an internship which turned into full time work, and haven't returned to college yet (due to financial difficulty) or moved up (due to struggling to find a good path forward). I'm tired of being in this career limbo and starting to get desperate though.

I'm fortunate enough to have work at the moment, working from home for a call center; this job is very busy and stressful, but it's allowed me time with my needy pet parrot which I highly value and don't want to give up. Unfortunately they've told us that as soon as the pandemic situation is over we're going to have to return to the office. Aside from the pet, I also want to position myself for better paying remote work so I can move northwest, or at least to a better apartment in the meantime - I've been suffering in the heat of Texas due to the increasingly hot summers, a heat-based medical condition, and a poor quality complex that has refused to fix ongoing AC issues. Can't afford anything better on my current paycheck though, and can't seem to figure out a good way forward to make myself qualified for what I'm looking for.

I'm hoping that by the time vaccines are available and they make us return to the office that the job market will have more opportunities and I'll be able to switch over to a remote position after making myself more valuable, studying certifications geared to that end. The best path upwards I've been able to come up with is to move towards systems administration and then towards cloud solutions from there, although I'm not sure how to do this. The information I'm able to find tends to be conflicting, and the (increasingly small of late) number of positions upwards offering what I'm looking for always seem to demand a random combination of specific certifications, years of experience with different specialized software, a bachelor's degree, or a combination of the above. I was originally thinking of going for Net+ and Sec+, then MCSA, to position myself for systems administration, but the MCSA is being retired with no clear alternative, and Net+ and Sec+ increasingly seem like they offer very little as far as career opportunities. CCNA is another consideration, but that's a significant time investment, doesn't seem to offer a whole lot higher chances of landing a position versus the others (especially in consideration of the broad depth of experience usually asked for), and I'm running out of time.

I've thought about going back to school, but finances are still a roadblock for that, and I'm not completely sure how much more likely that is to get me where I want to be versus just spending the time and money towards certifications and further experience. I would have to take out thousands more dollars in loans to afford tuition on top of living expenses, or continue working while doing school part time, which would still likely require loans. If I could find work that offered significant downtime I could use to study during the day that could counter balance that problem, but that goes back to the original set of problems, and I'd likely still need loans to afford the tuition. Not to mention that I'm not even sure what my eligibility for loans is at this point. I deferred payments on them a while ago due to my tight finances, have been trying to reach them recently to find an answer to this but have been having issues getting an answer.

The closest I've gotten after countless hours of searching and applying was a $20/hr desktop support position with permanent WFH available, got to the final interview stage with that, then was turned down with no reason given. My best guess is they thought my technical qualifications were lacking, but once again this loops back to the original problem of not knowing how I should move forward with fleshing those out. The only other positions I've been approached with didn't offer WFH, and I'm not comfortable with that in the middle of a pandemic (not to mention the pet)... the whole point of this search is to continue WFH and try to move up.

**TLDR:** After 7 years of helpdesk support I need a way upwards and out but can't figure out what certifications are worth my time and money, and how I could move upwards with them anyway. All the positions I've been able to find seem to require a random array of certifications and experience so I'm not sure what to focus on to get to where and what I need (higher paying, remote work opportunities). Returning to college may not be an option due to loan ineligibility. Any advice is appreciated"

Im a current CS student looking to get an internship to gather expirience before graduation. I was a math student before and in my senior year I transfered to CS. Programming was something that interested me in later years and I decided to pursue CS. Having around 3 semester(only CS courses) left I have no prior expirience to get a job, let alone an internship/COOP. Having a 2.97 GPA isn’t the best scenario but knowing I have time left to raise it gives me hope.

My main concern as to why I come here is to ask the following. I’ve seen some courses in edx/coursera/udacity that offers specialty like cyber security, data science many more. Some courses have a capstone as final project to complete.

As im finishing my finals this week, I’ve been thinking to get a course to entertain myself during the winter and do a specialty course. The thing is I can continue to learn on my own reading books and watching videos but a course with a certificate and a capstone project is more structured. I believe it can help me land an internship/COOP which is what Im looking for. 

Has anyone taken a non-accredited online course on one of this website? Has it helped? Can it help? Can it help me stand out having it on my resume/CV? Is the capstone project is helpful?

k8dx6q,2,2020-12-07,[Advice Needed] - Disillusionment with Business School Programs,felipearthur,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/k8dx6q/advice_needed_disillusionment_with_business/,"Hi all,

This is a personal but hopefully relatable account.

After high school, I enrolled in an international business degree at what is at least on paper (according to the Financial Times) considered at top 10 European business school. For lack of a better option, I felt this was the right step for me at that age. My performance was adequate and I managed to get some (while hardly inspiring nonetheless) relevant internship experience in wealth management and risk consulting. So, I stuck around to complete my degree.

At the end of my studies, out of what I can only describe as complacency, shortsightedness or flat-out laziness I decided to cruise into a graduate management program (MSc.) at the same faculty with focus on innovation and strategic management, as this meant not having to go through rigorous application processes at other universities. This is where my disillusionment with business school graduate programs began.
Aside from the master thesis research, the course did not prioritize the development of any transferable hard skills but felt rather like a one-year subscription to the Harvard Business Review. Despite the majority of my classmates seemingly enjoying the experience, I was left with the sense that I was more unprepared than ever for today's complex job market. Though, I suspect it to be rather common with business school graduates, I continue to be surprised that I find relatively little evidence of this frustration on reddit and other forums. This is in part the reason I am writing to consult this community for help.

Fast forward to 2.5 years after graduation - (to my own surprise) I have been working as a management consultant on IT projects in the pharmaceutical industry at one of the Big4 for the past two years. So it's safe to say things worked out, right?
To avoid going into detail about the nature of Big4 consulting I will just say that it's not for me and I want out. Although there appears to be a career path, I (now 25) am aching for a role where I foresee future relevance and the chance to develop technical ""craftsmanship"" - aspects a typical big4 consulting career and many careers in the professional services industry do not entail in my opinion.

Consequently, I am back to the drawing board to figure out a path that does not fully discard my priors but also opens up doors to a more engaging and less menial profession. In this vein, I have started to research other Master programs - most of which ironically are taught at some of the top-tier business schools. To give you an idea - while I am still exploring, so far I have zeroed in on programs in data analytics, quantitative finance and development economics. Though I am fully aware that the course I chose at age 21 was inherently vague, I can't help but fear that what I described above is a systemic issue in business schools. Good universities (especially for 1-year programs) appear simply to cash in on their reputations as finishing schools for the multi-national corporate machine, in turn producing half-baked ""consultants"". After all, it seems even featured alumni for some of the courses which I am currently considering sometimes do not end up having jobs I would consider far more desirable than my own. I don't want to sound cynical but I believe this is all the more reason I need all the help I can get in navigating this strange secondary education landscape if I am going to quit my job next fall and dish out another fat check for university.

Now to my questions (btw if you kept reading to this point you are my hero!):

- In this increasingly skill-based economy, is it really still worth spending so much money on programs that seem to regurgitate publicly available information?
- Are there alternative routes for transitioning into more technical subject matter expert roles in business and finance that I am missing (e.g. conversion courses, part-time programs, certificates, perhaps options that can be coordinated with my employer)
- Have any of you successfully transitioned from business into completely unrelated fields that you feel are more fulfilling? If so, what's your story?
- What are your favorite websites and/or methods for researching truly worthwhile graduate programs?
- If you can relate to my frustration in consulting and have any similar experiences but ended up finding the right program, kindly share them with me!
- I would also be very appreciative of any suggestions on specific courses to consider.

Thanks a million for your support!"

I’m planning to keep studying and applying throughout next semester but i’d love to hear if you all think it’s realistic to get a summer internship offer during the spring semester, or if i should focus on a fall 2021 co-op.

Also, if you know of any companies hiring for SWE or any similar roles next semester please feel free to drop the names!"

And today, at 1:30 PM, he send me a message asking me to photoshop something for him. I politely declined and stated firmly that I was on a vacation. He then fired me through message after rambling about how ""it's not easy to find clients for you guys yet you don't want to work"". 

FYI, this fucking employer is notorious for bad management and unreasonable demands and ALL the full-time employees had quit, I was the last one (not anymore). And now, the company only has his wife and 6 other internships.

Since I have my family to back me up financially + I already had plan of my own (building 1-2 web projects for my portfolio) so it doesn't impact me too much. Basically, I knew this day would come sooner or later since the company was operating like shit and I (an in-house designer) could be considered an unnecessary expense.

However, while I'm not truly really at loss, I don't feel like letting them getting off this easy. Therefore I want to know what should I do to make the most out of this case: should I prepare documents, file a lawsuits, etc... Or I should just hand-over my works and be done with all this shit?"

Chicago here, Currently finishing my BA in psych (2 yrs. left), and I had some questions on how to find and secure an internship!

I have been browsing the web in search, and it seems many employers want previous HR-ish experience. **What would be some good ways to get that** (ive been thinking of working as a lab secretary at my Uni. for some exposer to data analysis and Microsoft programs) 

I also noticed employers want a degree in HR or a related field (**would psychology be considered a related field?**)

I'm starting full-time in early January in a sub service line of tax, on the tech side of things. The office is in HCOL (I think). Home is 1.5 hours from there and is much lower COL. Firm says we will have 60 days notice before returning to office, but during my internship staff and seniors were remote a lot anyway. Seems to be the norm for the group. 

I have a really good opportunity to move in with college friend in a good situation, 800 a month with a 20 min commute by rail to the office. Far side of city tho, so really 2 hours from home.

 Girlfriend is here in hometown, fam + friends are here.

Do I move there just to be in a diff location but still working from my room? But have the safety net knowing if we do return to office I'll be set.  

Or do I take the risk and forgo a good living situation to save a little money. But possibly get into a bind if we have to return to office in spring, probably end up paying ~1200 per month rent best case I would say if trying to find something last minute."

I'm graduating in CS this semester and I'm an IT intern in a company which does not have that many IT solutions for its own problems at the moment.

According to my managers, one of the most important issues to solve for now is to have a decent intranet. We already have one, but no one neither use it nor like it, but they actually need an intranet in order to stay informed on company stuff and to have access to other online services available for the company and its departments, like our internal softwares, websites and so on.

Based on that, we are struggling because we don't have an intranet solution on the market good enough for fulfilling our needs. And besides that, the company's highest hierarchy managers are pressuring us for an intranet ASAP, like, in one month or so. 

But the problem is that we have so many other important projects currently going on and we cannot focus completely on developing an intranet on our own. Adding to that, there are only three developers in our company (including me, as an intern, of course), and they simply don't have time to develop an intranet at the moment.

I think I can work on that, but I don't think I'll be able to finish an intranet in only one month. So I'm asking you guys what should I suggest to our team: keep looking for intranet solutions and acquire one or really put myself into programming that intranet? 

Should I take the challenge and ask them for some more months? And what about my other projects and tasks here? And how to keep up with my studies for the college semester? I think I need some advice on that. Besides that, if you've been though some similar situation, can you tell me how did you solve the intranet problem in your company?

k8n3gx,3,2020-12-07,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (12/7/2020),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/k8n3gx/weekly_job_qa_thread_1272020/,"Hi all,

Here is the forty-first installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

\--Nick

Graduated from law school in May 2020 and took the bar exam in October. CA won't release scores until mid-January. Ideally want to work in-house but with the current job market feel inclined to take whatever job I can.

A mentor from a past internship has been helpful in giving me advice and introducing me to legal recruiters. He reached out mid-November and told me his company was hiring and he referred me, and that his team liked my experience. 

Did a phone screening the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, then did a final round (4.5 hours) interview last week on Wednesday. I thought the interviews went really well -- one interviewer said I was an excellent candidate, another said I was a perfect fit. After the interviews I spoke with HR and they said they usually get feedback quickly and if all went to plan that they'd reach out Thursday and ask for references. I still haven't heard back and am getting a bit worked up about it. Still applying for jobs, just really wanted this one :)

Currently I am on my second year of the master's and I fell in love with quantitative research and data driven marketing I also found consumer behavior highly interesting because of its close connection with psychology and this is where the source of confusion mainly started.

So the main dilemma I have is that my ultimate goal is to work in the video games industry as a marketer but I also enjoy quantitative research and working with data as well as consumer psychology as I mentioned. Any seasoned marketers here can tell me what would be a good career path to take after graduation, I understand its ultimately up to my preferences but if someone can give me some practical advice I would highly appreciate it.

Machine learning student researcher role conducting (Lung cancer classification w/Genomics ) SBIR research for private company via University). 

Haven't been able to land a job this year, but this the game plan 2021::::

1. Between December '20 and January '21, Get certification for FE in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I currently Don't know a Professional Engineer (PE)  for recommendation for the EIT certification but passing the FE exam should suffice for now.
2. Going back to college for BS in Computer science 
   1. Why? Most of the work I've done in Engineering Undergrad revolved around coding and I think BS in CS from a ABET accredited college will be really good fit, solid for my fundamentals and great to develop connection for jobs. 
   2. Why not masters? Master without solid job experience seems like bad investment to me. Master degree is very expensive. BS in computer science is gonna cost me 9k per semester  vs 15k per semester for MS in computer science (going to NJIT btw). 
   3. After credit transfer I am a Junior, which is awesome, If I take winter and summer classes should be able to complete the degree by May '22 or earlier and it will be mostly online.

Got Few questions:

\- definitely see my self in Data Engineering and system engineering positions in the future. Regardless, From what y'all have read is there any other career paths I can pursue? 

\- Anyone here taken two BS technical degree?

k90n7f,38,2020-12-08,"[Uni] How much should I care about grades, really?",Zaheen60,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/k90n7f/uni_how_much_should_i_care_about_grades_really/,"Strange question, I know. Hear me out. 

I’m going to Uni next year. Getting into CS.

Coming from A levels, your grades literally determine which industry you go to, and whether you can get that $100-150k worth scholarship. You’re awarded (really) handsomely when your number is higher. CCAs, testimonials and projects come secondary to that magic number.

But after Uni, what determines your (private sector) job is your job-related skills, portfolio, interview charisma, internship experience, and people skills. GPA is simply one variable in an equation with many other variables which may have higher weightage. 

Even in public sector, once you reach a certain band (first class honours, second upper etc) they won’t discriminate between higher and lower grades (eg, there’s no distinction between a 4.97 GPA and a 4.51. Both are FCH). 

The only situation when GPA matters most is when getting into research etc.

Usually, what’s taught in school isn’t even the skills needed on the job. Famously, in CS they teach you the theoretical stuff behind everything but when it comes to the hands on working world applications you have to self-teach.

This is ESPECIALLY so in the tech industry. You can be a NUS CS GPA 5.0 but if you don’t know that Angular + Django stack (which is not taught in school) you won’t even get past the first stage for a company that requires it.

All this is to say, why shouldn’t I focus a good deal of my time and energy (maybe 40-50%?) honing the skills that’ll actually qualify me for the jobs rather than spend almost all my time slogging through the rigorous CS curriculum to get that FCH,then get my job taken by someone with more applicable skills than me?"

I don't live in the city I study in so I didn't physically go to campus a lot even during pre-corona. My friend who graduated last spring asked me if I had been living under a rock because I didn't know about the business events that were being held every Tuesday or something where companies present themselves and you can network. 

Now during corona it's impossible to check these events out, but I might be able to do it during my last year. My question is how important are internships and networking? If I am not able to attend these events during my last semester, I will have missed out on it all.

I don't even know if I want to work in this city after I'm finished, as there are places with far cheaper rent and still have job opportunities elsewhere. Can you go from \*no\* working experience within programming after bachelor graduation and land a solid junior job?"
k92izd,1,2020-12-08,"What do I do about my complicated, volatile boss?",DependableWeasel,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/k92izd/what_do_i_do_about_my_complicated_volatile_boss/,"Backstory:

A few years back now I worked a pretty low paying job with Laura, who was an intern for John. John owned a business with his ex, Jane. They were together for 15 years, until John got together with Laura. 

Laura and I are close friends, and I am good friends with John too and through them, friends with Jane. A vacancy came up working for John and Jane, which they encouraged me to apply for and won the role. John is completely different as a boss, which didn’t bother me initially as none of his anger was directed at me. Him and Jane have a very volatile relationship - he is constantly belittling her and putting her down in front of staff. Socially, they seem to be fine, but work is a constant struggle because of this. 

Lately, John has started to take his anger out on me. He was sitting at my desk discussing something, and trailed off. I got up to follow, thinking I was still being spoken to. He turned around and shouted at me to sit down. He then made a second belittling comment. I burst into tears when he left the room. Jane told him she saw me crying and he blamed Jane ‘because she made him angry earlier in the day.’ 

Today, I got blasted by an angry customer on the phone. I told John, who proceeded to call him back. John then told me ‘he wasn’t mad at all - you just misread him.’ I was literally yelled at and hung up on, but okay. 

Last week I was told not to tell people they ‘will be missed’ when they’re leaving - ‘because sometimes we don’t miss them.’ We have had 10 people leave in the ~year I have been there and he doesn’t seem to get it’s mostly because of him. 

The other day he got angry at me for tidying the meeting room before a big meeting - that was ‘his job.’ The same day I got told to take my little shopping list in the kitchenette down (that I invite staff to write down if they need milk or tea etc) and made to move the box of tissues on the kitchenette bench for some unknown reason. 

I’ve also been told never to ask how he is. Then he will complain that no one cares. 

I don’t know how much longer I can take being micromanaged within an inch of my life. I am very close friends with Jane now, and I don’t want to jeopardize any friendship with her, or my existing friendship with Laura. I get that 2020 is a tough time, but I am really struggling with not knowing which boss - happy or tyrant - that I’ll be dealing with from day-to-day. I’m also scared if I address this in any really meaningful way that I will get my own shortcomings (of which I am well acquainted with) thrown back at me. 

He takes it incredibly badly when people leave yet seems to have no self awareness as to why. Sometimes he’s great and work is fantastic. But that’s getting less so now. I feel gaslit, dumb and useless. Help appreciated!!"

Here in India, undergrad professional course for law is a five year programme. 

I suffered from crippling depression and anxiety almost all 5 years of my undergrad course. I took the medications but they were barely making me get off my bed. Needless to say, my academics and co-curriculum took a huge dent and my CV is shit. I have finished my course and I’m looking for jobs now. But I lack both, the required experience and the knowledge. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. Should I apply for internships and just intern for a year to gain knowledge and experience? Or should I apply for jobs and take anything I’m being given? Would interning after law school make me look like a failure because I couldn’t secure a job after college? 

I’m motivated and focused now, because the corona phase gave me a lot of time to heal and work on myself. My mental health has been so much better and I have been studying at home too. I’m determined to get into the industry and work but I don’t know what to do.

Had no guidance or goal in life whatsoever, took science, did okay, landed up in a good engineering college in India in the Computer Science branch. I always liked technology so I was like ""eh what the hell, I'll join"" and my potential career options seemed attractive at the time with the promises of big money after graduation while working on new technologies at big companies that impact billions of people. I'm currently in my 5th semester of college and I've come to the realisation that Software Engineering is NOT for me. I've tried everything from taking courses online, learning from world class teachers, putting in effort consistently over time, paying attention in classes, indulging in self projects. NOTHING has worked out and I've given it all my effort and time and I just know it isn't for me. Now, I am a very average student in terms of grades and I don't want to sound like a dick who's entitled but I have enough algorithm and development skills to bag a decent software engineering job that pays well into the 7 digits. Problem is, I know already that I am not cut out for a coding job and I'm more inclined towards the business side of things and wish to start my own company someday. This led me towards the path of product management and as far as I've seen, very few companies hire associate product managers out of college outside India, let alone inside. I am not from a premier institute (IIT/BITS) and getting those roles is a little unrealistic at this point.

Every single person in my college seems to have it sorted out and knows that they want to be a developer or want an MBA or want to do an MS. They're all passionate about what they're learning and go above and beyond to learn even outside of college. Me, on the other hand, after a lot of fighting and drama with my parents, I've decided not to study further in the traditional sense. I have had sleepless nights and constant headaches for over 6 months now thinking about my future career options but I am just lost as to what I should be doing? I see people bag internships, do well academically, create amazing projects and I just feel lost and hopeless. I feel tremendously stressed out every single day and career counselling and all of that is useless.  


I DESPERATELY need some guidance from someone who's preferably been in a similar situation.   
What do I do? I can't take it anymore."

At some point, I decided that I would apply to switch into an MS, since I had the prerequisites and it's arguably a better investment in the long run. Yesterday, I was accepted, but I am trying to decide whether or not I should make the switch. Here are the variables:

* Firstly, the MS is a bit more costly, but will only take me an extra semester as opposed to completing the second BS.

* This is a very average, barely top 100 state school. It's an R1 for sure, but not exactly top of the line per se.

* I have an internship that I've been working through with an admittedly great F50 company. This past semester I have been working part time (15 hrs/week remote) with them, and they want me to stay on for the next semester. Hell, I want to stay on for the next semester. Do you all think this is doable while pursuing an MS?

* I also have an internship with this same company coming up in the summer, meaning I might have to pause my MS for a second.

It goes without saying that I am speaking to my advisors about these things, but I will gladly take any advice you all might have too. Thanks!

Edit: Thank you all for the great advice!"

That internship was annoying so now, before I apply for Business Development and Marketing related roles, I always clarify my doubts first.


I'm confused that why can't recruiters simply say they are looking for salesperson and not disguise it with fancier terms.

I am learning new things and learning Front End along with Digital Marketing and hopefully this will help me get a good job or help me start freelancing at a basic level atleast.

Without further ado, here are the official character bios/backstories of each of the T10 (ish) schools as teen movie/TV archetypes. Clearly these are gospel truth and should be taken 100% at face value. Sorry I don't make the rules.

**Harvard:**

* The Queen Bee. The closest thing you'll get to Regina George in this town. She's been ""the most popular girl"" at school since, what, elementary school? Kindergarten? Since time immemorial? It's basically just an endless self-fulfilling prophecy at this point. Her family's the richest in town, and she isn't afraid to let you know it. A reliable contender for Homecoming Court every year. Admittedly, she's also pretty smart. Always travels in a pack with her two friends Yale and Princeton -- you probably just know them as the Plastics. Everyone else looks on with a mixture of envy and disdain.
* *Senior Superlative: Most Popular*

**Stanford:**

* The stereotypical, popular ""golden boy"" with a California tan. Captain of the swim team and president of National Honor Society. He doesn't buy into the old-school social hierarchy nonsense (Plastics who?), and if we're honest, he's probably a bit more popular than even Harvard (who, as much as she doesn't want to admit it, sometimes gets jealous). Cool and unbothered on the outside, but his whole arc next season is about how he's actually an anxious, insecure wreck on the inside. Also comes from wealth, but has a part-time job at Taco Bell... 'cause he likes the architecture.
* *Senior Superlative: Most Likely to Succeed*

**Yale:**

* Harvard's slightly more chill, more liberal best friend/arch-rival. Often gets compared to Harvard, but doesn't actually mind it because she ends up looking less pretentious in comparison anyways. But don't be mistaken, she's still undeniably part of the country club set, and her parents are the town's high-power attorneys. Has a slightly artsier streak than her two besties (she has a musical number in every season). Always has really smart and insightful things to say in class. Loves to look aesthetic while reading a book under a tree.
* *Senior Superlative: Most Likely to Become President*

**Princeton:**

* Harvard and Yale's slightly snobbier, WASPier friend. Captain of the women's golf team. Her parents chair the town's country club, and she can often be seen eating her meals and lounging at the clubhouse. She probably gets a bit less attention in the midst of Harvard and Yale's more infamous long-standing rivalry, but most would begrudgingly agree that she's probably the smartest of the three. Favorite colors are orange and black, so naturally Halloween's her favorite holiday (she dresses up as a sexy tiger every single year, don't ask about it).
* *Senior Superlative: Best Dressed*

**Columbia:**

* Also part of the old money/country club set, but with an edge. President of the chess club (rumor has it Queen's Gambit was partly based on her). Has an ""urban"" flair, thanks to the fact that her family's got deep roots in New York City -- and she will *not* let you forget that about her, ever. Sometimes hangs out with her old-school pals Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, but also sort of does her own thing and can kind of be a bit intimidating and aloof -- she's *cool,* goddammit! A hard worker who studies her ass off, and can usually be found in the library. Slightly neurotic. Probably has an undiagnosed Adderall and/or coke addiction.
* *Senior Superlative: Biggest Overachiever*

**MIT:**

* Basically Jimmy Neutron in the flesh. Math and science whiz, with a reckless streak. Well-liked because he's so unabashedly nerdy while also maybe kind of being a badass? Last season, he somehow got a schoolbus on top of the school cafeteria roof and almost got expelled (unsurprisingly, he's organizing this season's senior class prank). The classic tech genius who always swoops in to save the day with a line of code and some ""hacker"" magic a la CSI. Probably a pothead to help cope with his absurd IQ. Lives next door to Harvard. They're cordial.
* *Senior Superlative: Biggest Techie*

**UChicago:**

* Your classic ugly-duckling-turned-swan story. President of the econ club, ex-president of the anime club. A couple of seasons ago, she was sort of a background character, but she's gotten a huge makeover since, and is now a season regular as a solid member of the ""popular"" crew. Always makes absolute sure you can see the huge-ass Ayn Rand book she lugs around everywhere. Used to be even quirkier, but she's mellowed out a bit since her pre-makeover days. Smart as hell, and also a tad neurotic like her friend Columbia. Lives in the same neighborhood as Northwestern, her childhood bestie. Main mode of communication is leaving shit tons of notes in everyone's lockers.
* *Senior Superlative: Most Changed Since Freshman Year*

**Northwestern:**

* The friendly girl-next-door type who's super smart, super nice, and *kinda* does everything. Think Betty Cooper from Riverdale. Or Emma Stone in like every other movie. Editor-in-chief of the school newspaper and captain of the women's lacrosse team, but is *also* first chair in orchestra, is in the school play (catch her acting opposite Yale), *and* competes in Science Olympiad?! If anything, she has range. People never expect it since they're polar opposites, but she and UChicago are actually still really close and can sometimes be seen studying together at the neighborhood cafe (when she isn't at one of Duke's parties getting white girl wasted).
* *Senior Superlative: Best Smile*

**Duke:**

* Star player on the basketball team. Also captain of the men's lacrosse team. Unironically has an undying love for salmon colored shorts. His family is part of the same country club as Princeton, so the two of them can sometimes be seen hanging out together at the clubhouse, looking down on the poors. Wicked sharp but, unsurprisingly, widely known as ""the douchebag"" around town. People let it slide though because he throws a killer house party (cue: red Solo cups). Dabbles in stocks and frequently exchanges Wall Street tips with UPenn.
* *Senior Superlative: Life of the Party*

**UPenn:**

* The villain you love to hate and hate to love. The quintessential ""finance bro."" That one kid who always brings a briefcase to class. President of FBLA. Has survived multiple seasons of being sidelined by some of his more popular friends -- but he's coming back with a redemption arc, with his eyes set firmly on Wall Street and/or bitcoin. Always talking about $$$ so people forget that he has other interests, too. Can also be reliably found partying it up with Duke and telling all the others to ""come thruu!"" in the groupchat. Frequently gets confused for a similarly named character from a completely different TV show, Penn State.
* *Senior Superlative: Most Likely to Become a Millionaire First*

**Johns Hopkins:**

* The super intense hard worker who can often be found in the library with his nose buried in a textbook (rumor has it he sometimes rips out some of the pages in said textbooks in fits of frustration). The origin story? His parents are the hotshot doctors in town, so he's constantly feeling the pressure to live up to their expectations and their image of success one day. But neuroticism aside, the fruits of his labor show: he's secured the town's coveted research internship (Gwen Stacy, anyone?) and can frequently be seen cavorting around town in his lab coat.
* *Senior Superlative: Most Likely to Cure* *~~Cancer~~* *COVID*

WOW ok this took way longer than it should have. I dunno if anyone's actually gonna read this but if you've actually gotten through all of this props to you? I'm sorry this is just how I cope with all the news about schools getting larger pools of applicants this cycle. Also I hope none of this was offensive or anything lol this was all in good fun and these schools are all AMAZING and you all will reach your goals and dreams!!

EDIT:

An additional parting thought... no need to speculate on who's attractive or who's not. True to the American teen genre, they're all inexplicably hot and probably have all hooked up with each other at some point, and are also 30 years old."

I've been working out, studying hard and applying for jobs. I've just been focusing on the present and never looking back.

However, this new internship that I joined started off with an icebreaker presentation between the members and it brought back things that I've kept repressed inside. All these other people in my group have impressive resumes with a shit ton of volunteering experience and extracurricular activities under their belt.

I, on the other hand, don't have anything whatsoever. My past was just full of abuse, being an outcast and suicidal episodes. And every time I try to talk or write about my past, anxiety, and depression come along with it. My turn to present for this is due 2 days from now and I don't know what to say or do. 

Talk about my future plans? I'm just living in the present and trying to stay alive and become a better person each day. After all the shit I've gone through and all the dreams that died, I know much better to ever hope again and have dreams so I don't have a topic on that either. 

Talk about my passion? I don't have any. I'm just a workaholic. Just studying and working hard to pay off a shit ton of debt my parents handed down to me since I'm the eldest. I do play games but even then, I do it for the money. For example, grinding hard in Dota and Csgo events for items to sell back. The moment the events are over, I stop playing.

Now with all this put into text, all I could think of is I'm trash. I don't have anything that stands out. Will I even get along with these people? I can't believe I'm having a panic attack over something so trivial. 

Anyways, I would really appreciate if I could get some tips on what I could say? Or maybe how I could fake it? My mind is just kinda blank right now.

I have a fair amount of programming experience from side projects, and I've taken an algorithms class. However, I don't have any internship experience. I spent my summers doing undergrad research in math/stats, which did involve writing a bit of code. I had previously planned on applying to grad school, but for a variety of reasons, I spent most of fall being too burnt out / depressed to do it. Additionally, I'm not even sure if I want to pursue an academic career at this point. Right now, I'm scrambling to have something to do after I graduate. It seems most internship positions at the big companies are already done hiring. Do I have a chance at getting an internship / job at this point in the year? Would I be better off applying for internships and then trying to get a new grad position from there, or do I have a shot going straight to a job in my current situation?  I'm planning on dedicating as much time as I can on doing projects and grinding leetcode if that's what I have to do."
k9bkl7,1,2020-12-08,I need advice on this contract Desktop Support position. I live in the NYC area.,TecKing,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/k9bkl7/i_need_advice_on_this_contract_desktop_support/,"So a quick run down, I graduated last year in December in Information Systems. I was also an IT Support intern for the University's Engineering department for about 8 months which was right up until my graduation. Then I immediately enrolled in a cyber security bootcamp program that prepped me for taking both the CompTIA Network+ and the Cisco CCNA Cyber Ops. I took those exams and passed them both around late August. And now I've been job hunting since September. 

I've had a few interviews with employers and recruiters with a few of them going quite well. Most of the common feedback I got from the recruiters that spoke with me was that the employers liked me and my answers to the questions they had but ultimately decided to move on from my application mainly because of my lack of experience. 

The starting salary I was going for was 55k a year which I believe is fair for an entry level position in my area. But now a recruiter has reached out to me with a 1 year contract which the location is very close to home, its within the same city I'm in(which is convenient). The location is in a hospital with me having to work with a team that helps with hardware troubleshooting/potentially networking equipment etc. The contract also has a chance for it to become a full-time position but I wasn't told how likely(the recruiter probably doesn't know). 

Now the only issue I have with the position is the pay, instead of the initial 25/Hr it's somewhere around 21-ish which I believe is around 43k, there's also benefits with the contract. So while I understand that the experience would help with my resume, I'm still bothered my the low salary concerning all the learning I spent trying to get a full-time position and I still feel I might get lucky with a better position. Should I go through with the decision? How much of a difference does this really make If I'm working for just a year?

Next, let's say I complete the 1 year contract and my next full time position is at another company, would I be able to request a salary of 60k or would it be too early for that and stick with 55k? Could I move to a bigger role like a level 3 support?

Lastly, do you guys think that the rejections are solely my lack of experience or a combination with the impact the virus has had on the economy? It just confuses me how entry IT support positions require  2-4 years of experience. Wouldn't that amount of experience make you anything but entry level?

Anyways for those who want to see my resume I've attached it below. Any and all feedback is greatly appreciated, thanks.

And how is the prospects for full time employment after?,AsapEvaMadeMyChain,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/k9by5x/how_is_the_internship_market_for_robotics_and/,"I am currently applying to Master’s programs and doing a bit of planning ahead. Long story short I am coming from a biology research background and have some data analytics experience with R, which is totally unrelated.

Decided I simply wanted to go for something that makes me passionate. 

I read and hear conflicting information. Some say self driving cars and robotics are oversaturated with Stanford and Ivy League PhDs, and it’s a long journey ahead. Others say that companies like Waymo and Lyft are hiring interns and there are reasonable career opportunities. 

I also hear about subspecialties in self driving cars and robotics, like computer vision, ML, ect. And a person would need to specialize in one of those. 

Where should a person like myself begin?"

My brother is fresh out of college and has secured an intern position at a medium sized software firm. His main skills are C, C++, Python and Java.

Currently, he has been assigned a project based on Angularjs, type script, JavaScript and Cypress testing. He has been asked to fix bugs in the code making use of cypress.

He is struggling with his job because he has no clue where to start and his mentor instead of guiding him has started complaining about him to the manager. In fact, he's pressurizing him constantly. He does have a daily call with his mentor but most of the time is spent in scolding my brother.

My brother has lost all the confidence and getting another job in this recession is almost impossible as a fresh graduate. I don't come from a programming background and hence I can't guide him. Remote work because of covid has become extremely challenging especially for the fresh graduates.

My questions are -

1. How can he learn the required skills and where? 

2. How to avoid getting fired?

3. How can I as his brother help him?

4. Any other suggestions and tips do you have for him?

Thank you guys!


Edit: From a concerned brother. Throwaway account because my brother knows my reddit account."
k9fvtc,1,2020-12-08,Why do I feel so guilty for moving out?,curiousrabbit97,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/k9fvtc/why_do_i_feel_so_guilty_for_moving_out/,"I (23F) have lived with my parents my whole life. I'm still quite young, I'm aware, but I've been ready to move out and live independently since I was 19. I graduated in 2019 and lived on my own for two of my university years, then moved to the 'city' and again lived independently/with friends until the end of 2019. I quit my job because I absolutely hated it, and I was convinced by my parents to move back home. I was told that if I went home I could figure things out, but that I could visit my friends whenever I wanted (I have to travel to do so - my parents live abroad). 

For a bit of context, I come from a semi-conservative family. What that means is, I have to ask every time I want to do something - any time I want to go out and see friends, I have to essentially ask for permission. Last year's NYE I had to spend alone with them because I wasn't allowed to spend it with friends because they 'don't know them'. My older siblings who are also in their mid-twenties were free as birds and allowed to do what they like. I have tried before to speak to my parents about it, but they both have little patience and blow up every time it is brought up, no matter how polite or calm I try to seem in the moment. I was planning on returning to university this year for my postgrad, which they initially were incredibly on board with. Cue a few months later and they're screaming at me not to go. I thought it would be effective if I calmly said 'this is my decision, I have made a decision to go', and they were furious that I thought it was okay for me to state my decision rather than ask for permission. 

It's not just things like this. I love my parents dearly, but it's driving me up the wall. I've essentially been in my own personal lockdown since moving home. I try to call my friends as much as I can so I can stay virtually social, but on several occasions they have complained that I'm on the phone too much - which is untrue. I work from home so I can't constantly be on the phone, and on average I'll call a friend once every two/three days, for maybe an hour tops. A few months ago, I was FaceTiming my friend who lives in Far East Asia and we were having a long catch up. During the call, my mother walked past and said 'you've been on the phone for too long, what is this?!' and the shock on both my friend and my faces was unforgettable. I was mortified. I felt like a child. I will consistently be told what to do and when to do it. If I want to have drinks on Zoom with friends on the weekend, I'm embarrassed to do so. 

The list could go on. A couple years ago I took on a short summer internship, and for weeks they tried to convince me not to go - that it was 'silly' etc. I feel incredibly suffocated and I have felt this way for a long time. A lot of people will say I should appreciate family more and I can see why you would say this, but I feel like every move I make is scrutinised and judged. If I go to bed late I'm told off. If I'm on the phone for too long they complain and ask who I'm talking to. 

I mentioned that I wanted to move out by the end of January, and the first time it was brought up they got angry and they immediately made it clear that I would have to pay for everything myself. This wouldn't be an issue (as I previously told them I'd like to support myself, but they insisted they'd help at the start) if they weren't paying for both of my siblings' rents. It just seems odd to me. I'm afraid to approach the subject further and I also feel racked with guilt that I even want to move out. But I'm truly miserable and I feel like everyone around me is moving forwards and I'm the only one at a standstill. I've lost friends, my freedom, and essentially a large portion of my early twenties. They're incredibly loving parents but there's so much tension in the house and I feel so stuck and sad all the time. I guess I'm just asking for understanding really."

Currently a Canadian citizen and university student - got an offer for an internship with a large tech company on the West Coast for summer 2021. The issue is that the company usually auto rejected Canadians as they couldn’t sponsor them (they didn’t do j-1 visas???) but I got around this screening because I was internally referred. The recruiter is trying to work out a solution, however, is there anything I can suggest to them? The internship would be virtual and since the company has Canadian offices, I figured I might be able to be “attached” to Canadian office for payroll purposes since they have some of those and work virtually with the US teams.

k9ixrf,3,2020-12-08,Average(?) CS grad concerned about my current situation,zaubereixmc1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/k9ixrf/average_cs_grad_concerned_about_my_current/,"As per mod suggestion, trying a repost!

\*\*\*\*\*

**The short version** as per /u/Forrest436's suggestion:

I graduated in the summer of 2019 with a B.S. in Computer Science, specializing for the most part in embedded systems. Unfortunately,  I was always drained by my assignments feeling like busy work and not providing practical skills—especially because in retrospect, there was so much handed to us. Further,  I never did any internships since I was worried about doing badly at them or that I didn’t need them, and none of the jobs I did on campus were related to the industry, either.

I was content with my part-time manual labor job until this last September when I decided that I couldn’t take living in my hometown anymore, and at the start of October, I moved up to the northwest ‘burbs of Chicago to live with my brother’s family while I job search. I certainly don’t wish to remain here, and to pursue the goal I’ve had for years of living near or in the city. I'm still working on applying to as many positions as I can manage, though I am currently working at Chipotle part-time. My brother/SIL pointed out that January 1 is a deadline of sorts, in that they won’t *necessarily* kick me out, but they want to ensure I’m making progress and not stalling out. I've applied to almost 100 applications with a 20% rejection rate. This includes an audio software internship with Microsoft, a new grad position with NVIDIA, and a phone screening with a small game company. All the others are either still under review or have not provided any updates. So, I'm worried that if I companies won't take a chance on me for entry-level or intern positions like that, I'm not going to get anything that's going to be substantial for my goals.

So, **my question is**: Is there any way I can improve my chances of getting an engineering/programming/IT position with which I can actually survive on my own? Unfortunately, even working full-time at Chipotle wouldn't cut it at $12/hr, and I'm just not sure if I'm totally screwed at this point with my family's deadline approaching.

\*\*\*\*\*

If you’re curious about the long-winded specifics, I appreciate your time in advance, since there's a bit of life-story to it. I've tried to boldface the highlights. Here goes.

I **graduated in the summer of 2019 with a B.S. in Computer Science**, having chosen the program specialization in systems. Most of that education was in **embedded systems**, where multiple classes of mine involved working with STM32 MCUs, peripherals, datasheets, low-level C, etc. I took the standard intro courses (Scheme/Java) and the data structures course, though I never felt attached to the latter’s topics, having simply wanted to work with hardware/firmware hands-on. Of course, I now realize how important those topics were.

Going into college, I did not have a great grasp on what I wanted to do in my life outside of music. Education had simply been the routine, and I found the time to fulfill my expansive list of passions outside of it. Because of my mom’s unemployment when I was in middle school, I became a 21st Century Scholars recipient, and while I am grateful for it, that meant that college was *going* to happen. Hence, I never felt the sense of urgency that many of my peers felt to decide on where they wanted to go, what they wanted to do, etc. I still worked to maintain good grades, graduating with honors from high school, but decided to apply only to my hometown university (Indiana University Bloomington) since it was either that or Purdue (21stCS does not fund out-of-state tuition), and IUB was the simpler choice. Shortly before moving onto campus from my parents’ ten minutes away, I had not chosen a program, but knew that I wanted to pursue either Audio Engineering or Computer Science. I chose Computer Science not only because a programming job could fund music on the side, but also because Focusrite had just released one of the first iPad audio interfaces and figured that developing systems like those would provide more job security than competing with them. That being said, I don’t think a professional audio engineer will ever become obsolete, but certainly more difficult as it becomes easier for people to make professional-sounding recordings at home.

There isn’t much for me to write about for my education, since **I was always drained by my assignments feeling like busy work and not providing practical skills—especially because in retrospect, there was so much handed to us**. In fact, I feel that I learned more in my final semester’s independent study than I had in the majority of my program, since the approach was to build something unique that I actually had to figure out on my own.

Unfortunately, **I never did any internships** since I was worried about doing badly at them or that I didn’t need them. Obviously, I was wrong, in that pursuing one could have provided the practical experience that I craved. **None of the jobs I did on campus were related to the industry, either.** I was a TA for multiple CS classes, and enjoyed doing that, but that’s the closest thing I have aside from a data management job I did at the library. That being said\*\*, I did do a fair amount of freelance audio engineering and videography work during undergrad and developed a portfolio for that\*\*, but I wouldn't necessarily want to do it full-time.

So, I graduated without any practical experience, and nothing particularly exciting to show for my degree. There’s definitely a significant part of me that feels like I pissed away my opportunity. Still, that was fine by me for a bit, and I was content working my part-time stock keeper job and living with roommates, especially since my loan repayments were $0 from being income-based. Around this time (December 2019), I applied to a Firmware Dev job with Shure Microphones, but I never moved on from “Under Review.” No joke, the application is still labeled as such.

However, this last October, I had been living with my parents after dealing with two moves-worth of garbage roommates, but I could not take living with them anymore, either. I decided I needed to start using my degree to improve my situation and particularly to have my own place.

I talked with my (half-) siblings, who have been supportive of me doing exactly that, sold a bunch of my audio equipment, and **at the start of October, moved up to the northwest ‘burbs of Chicago to live with my brother’s family while I job search**. **I certainly don’t wish to remain here, and to pursue the goal I’ve had for years of living near or in the city**.

A few weeks go by, and I had applied to only a few jobs, becoming intimidated by some of the requirements. I had been studying up on my programming concepts, reading through *Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++* and starting to work on a JavaScript project, until my brother and SIL confronted that behavior (approximately five weeks ago now). They were completely in the right, since I had not been holding up my end of the deal, and so I start applying like mad that night, even to positions at CostCo, Starbuck’s, etc. to get *something.* That reality check snapped me out of my “gotta prep” mentality, and **I shortly thereafter began training at Chipotle**. My niece had an endoscopy appointment, and so my manager allowed me to quarantine for a week and a half leading up to that.

However, after being back only a few days, I’m getting pressure from the family on how far along I am in my training, where I honestly have no clue. To be fair, I had over a week’s worth of training time lost.

In the reality check I mentioned, **my brother/SIL pointed out that January 1 is a deadline of sorts, in that they won’t** ***necessarily*** **kick me out, but they want to ensure I’m making progress and not stalling out,** which is obviously understandable. They also mentioned that they’d rather I play the numbers game and apply en masse instead of working on projects.

I’ve been applying to as many positions as I feel are relevant and would be a step up versus a side-step from my current job. This includes audio/visual and firmware/software. Out of the **89 applications** I’ve sent out thus far, I’ve had a 20% rejection rate. This includes an audio software internship with Microsoft, a new grad position with NVIDIA, and a phone screening with a small game company. **All the others are either still under review or have not provided any updates,** which my brother has even said may be partially due to the holiday season or Q4 planning.

Again, I want to spend a decent amount of time reviewing my data structures, algorithms, etc, but it seems like my time is better spent working with what is currently in my toolbox.

Right now, **I want a position where I can support myself enough to go home and do the things I want, or even learn the skills to transition to an even more fulfilling career path.** I'm willing to work hard, and believe I have great work ethic if I'm given the structure to nurture it. I'm also not very picky about what I work in, whether it be audio software, fintech, data analysis, etc. Just something where I can actually be independent, which I cannot do on $12/hr around here.

I really like working with my hands, and so hardware/firmware seems like the right path. Networking also sounds fun, as I did take a networking course but had to drop it due to a horrid professor that just curved everybody up (this was confirmed by peers at the end of the semester). **I’d also really love to get into DSP and audio programming, since that would be audio-related, but not to the point where it overlaps too much with my hobbies.** Unfortunately, my college didn’t offer any DSP courses for my program (the closest being an IOT/cloud processing seminar I took), and I connected with a faculty member that specialized in it too late. I don’t necessarily want to do audio as a living, especially with the pandemic, since I’ve previously experienced the burnout effect it can have.

I’ve been told by friends that while my situation is rough, I have to give myself the fact that most of the cards outside of a place to stay are turned against me. I think that’s true to an extent, but I cannot help but think I shot myself in the foot by making this decision now.

I figured I could post here, and get some advice or even harsh truths on a situation that is manifesting an increasingly large pit in my stomach as January comes up. I've read posts where CS grads found a position after a while, though many of them had the time and opportunity to do projects and improve their skills, which is a luxury I don't feel I have. It was also a bit therapeutic to write it all out!

Thanks for reading/replying, and let me know if there's anything I can clarify! My hope is that this post can also be referenced for anybody else feeling similarly."

Part of me does believe that this is normal and that internships are typically basic and as an intern, I'm not going to work on anything cutting edge, so I don't believe I had high expectations for what my internship would be like. But to have not done a single thing the past 3.5 months related to my interest has me wondering about this field of work.

Is it normal to spend most of your day sending emails, clicking buttons, and networking as opposed to problem solving? If you had an internship in data analytics or software development, what was that experience like, and did you too do nothing related to your field the entire time?

P.S. Yes, I've asked for more work, reached out to other team members in my field of interest, and whenever I ask my manager how I'm doing he says I'm doing fine."

k9m9xg,1,2020-12-09,Fall Internship vs. Master's Degree,indecisive_divider,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/k9m9xg/fall_internship_vs_masters_degree/,"Junior at top 15 CS school w/ high GPA, non-SWE internship, and research experience. I've received an SWE (likely virtual in summer, possible in person in fall) internship offer with a FAANG company that can be taken in the Winter, Summer, or Fall 2021 and another SWE (virtual) internship offer with a Unicorn for Summer 2021 only. 

The Unicorn pay is better and a much smaller program than the FAANG offer, but wouldn't have the same name recognition as FAANG so leading me to choose FAANG over Unicorn if the question was summer only.

The real question is whether to take off the Fall semester to pursue Unicorn in Summer and FAANG in Fall or to just do FAANG in Summer. I would graduate on time in Spring 2022 either way, but if I do both I would no longer be able to participate in an express Master's degree program at my school which allows me to get a CS Master's in a semester. Without the express program, I wouldn't pursue the Master's.

Another thing is Unicorn is confirmed virtual for the summer, but I am hopeful that FAANG could be in person in the Fall (maybe just maybe?) which would allow me to get a sense of what the Bay Area is like as well as I have never left the east coast.

I guess the final question boils down to what would be more helpful in the long-term: an extra internship (which possibly leads to a full-time offer and gives me more insight into what another company would be like) or a Master's degree? The Master's would be mostly in name only as I would've completed \*most\* of the courses required in Undergrad already, but could be a good resume/salary boost.

This is a major case of first world problems and a very good problem to have. Very thankful to be in this position, but a stressful decision to make without much guidance available on previous Reddit posts.

TL;DR: My options are as follows:

1. Take FAANG internship in Summer. Have entirety of my senior year to continue CS education and earn extra credits towards an express Master's degree program so that I could complete that degree in just one semester
2. Take Unicorn internship in Summer, take FAANG internship in Fall, graduate w/ Bachelor's on time but no longer be able to complete a Master's degree in just a year so would no longer pursue it

Would an extra internship or a Master's degree be more helpful in long-term?"

I want to preface that this situation is self created. I didn't pull my weight, I acted like everything was fine, and I didn't ask for help in time to save my grades. 

That being said, fuck depression, fuck dysphoria, fuck anxiety, and fuck low self esteem. This semester was my first semester of my first year of college. I switched majors in the third week of the semester to follow what I felt was right for my career and what I want to do with my life. This royaly fucked up my schedule though and I was three weeks behind in my new classes. At this point I should have just realized that I would never catch up and dropped my classes for the semester, and then made next semester my first. That, and with covid all my classes were over zoom, which is an environment that I don't learn in. 

I never caught up. The semester ends tomorrow and I'm failing all of my classes, which honestly I could give a fuck about. I understand that struggling doens't define me and what I am capable of in an in person environment. What does terrify me though is that I'm going to lose my scholarship (my school requires you to keep a certain GPA or you lose the money). I've been panicking and trying to catch up on the work the last two weeks, but theres no chance that im going to get anywhere close. I'm not going to be able to pay for college anymore, and I'm fucking terrified to ask for help. 

How do I explain this to my family? How do I explain that I lost three semester's worth of scholarships because of my mental health? My mental health doesn't matter at the end of the day, honestly. I should have sucked it up and forced myself to do the work. I should have just dealt with it. I feel like I should have reverted back to the unhealthy coping mechanisms that I've been avoiding this whole time. If I had let myself succumb to self harm again I would have been able to at least get myself to a numb space where I could force work out. I could have forced some endorphins that would have given me the energy I needed to get out of bed. 

How the fuck do I explain this to my boyfriend? He has this rose colored glasses look on my mental health, I think. He hasn't seen the disgusting things that it leads me to doing. How do I explain that I fucked up everything?? We're planning on being together for a good chunk, if not the rest, of our lives. How do I tell him that I fucked up my finances so bad? How do I tell him that I want to drop out of college? How do I tell my family that? How do I accept that myself? At this point im just so tired of everything honestly. My room is disgusting, im a mess, I cant change my shirt because of my dysphoria, im just paralyzed by this fear that i trapped myself in this mess. i dont want to exist anymore. im not going to take my life, because i know that it would break the people that i love, but fuck. i dont want to be here anymore. i want to find a specialized program that i can follow. i want to find an internship or an apprenticeship. i want to train for my trade instead of slaving away to earn a degree in something i dont entirely care about (for context, in going to school for costuming at a theatre arts school, i'm more interested in just the construction and design parts of clothing, i could give a shit about theatre at this point honestly) 

i know when i tell my boyfriend about this he's going to be upset. Maybe not at me, but definitely at the situation. I know if i mention that i want to drop out of school he's going to be upset. his reaction the last time was ""you can't do that, you just can't, everyone hates school, i hate school, but im doing it.""

i just don't know. im terrified that ive thrown my life away and im going to become someone useless to my family and useless to society. my current plan is to not take any classes next semester and work full time to save up the money to pay for (hopefully) the next semester while i reapply for, and hope to god i get, federal financial aid. 

tl;dr i failed my college classes and lost my financial aid (unless i can do 1/2 a semesters worth of work tomorrow). im terrified of this situation and dont know how to tell anyone in my life that i fucked up this bad. 

this got long, sorry to anyone who reads this. Thank you for your time. im not sure that all of this made sense, but i needed to get it out. im going to pull another all nighter tonight to work on work and try and salvage what i can. if anyone has any advice or words of comfort that would be really appreciated right now."

To give a background, I graduated with a CS degree from a University of California and also have two internship experiences, but worked in a different field for a bit after graduating. Now, I plan to switch careers and want to do software engineering. So, my question is would it be better to relocate to a tech hub than a common metro area in terms of job hunting for an entry position? I'm considering moving to Houston or Charlotte, but those are not really tech hubs. Otherwise, I would look into going to RTP in NC. Any other places to look into would be great. Note that I have to move before job hunting.

Would I also be considered a new grad or entry level? A side note would be that I do not have many personal projects--if that matters. Thanks!"

k9omsc,33,2020-12-09,I think some majors need to be more geared toward *employable skills*.,[deleted],UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/k9omsc/i_think_some_majors_need_to_be_more_geared_toward/,"We’ve all heard some version of “STEM majors get jobs and everyone else goes to the unemployment line."" I’m not here to tell you that. I don’t believe it myself.

What I am here to complain about is how some majors largely teach you what to know for their midterms/finals, and nothing else. From what I understand, some STEM majors actually fit this description too.

I took EDS 125 (I think it was that one... it was so long ago) as my DEI. Everything I learned there was about how to teach a bilingual class. Those skills were obviously very employable for teachers in bilingual ed. That was the only EDS class I took, but I get the feeling most EDS classes were about learning how to teach, not just how to pass a test on teaching.

I’m an international business major. Given that it's called “international business,” I never thought about whether I was learning employable skills. Every major class I took was about companies, marketing, money, and so on. So it didn't occur to me to think “will I be using this in my future job?”

Unless you're set on going to grad school, you end up thinking a lot about this in your senior year. I learned very few skills in my management (MGT) classes that I expect to be useful in most jobs. MGT classes were really fun, no question about it, but I can’t imagine being at work and saying ”the stuff I learned in those MGT classes is really coming in handy now.”

The one exception was MGT 12, but even that was different since it taught you how to manage your *personal* finances. It was very useful info, and you'll probably be using it throughout your career, but it probably won't make you a more productive employee.

That doesn’t mean the degree is useless. Obviously having a degree sets you apart from someone without one.

Many jobs seem to ask how well you can use Excel and Microsoft Office. Did I learn how to use those in any MGT classes? Not a drop.

It would have been so useful to take a required MGT class on how to use Excel. So if an application asked you how well you're able to use Excel, you'd feel confident in saying you've pretty much mastered it.

I interned at a couple places and I’ve gotten one job offer that I might accept in PR. There’s no way I would’ve received that offer if one of my professors hadn’t helped me intern there. IRONICALLY, it was a professor for a non-major elective who helped me with that.

For many (most?) of us, internship/work experience weighs more than coursework does, but I'm still uneasy about how many courses teach you absolutely nothing besides what to study for the test."

We hung out all the time and talked on the phone everyday. In August 2020, our school canceled on campus housing so I moved into an off campus dorm. But she couldn’t afford it so she stayed home, 2 1/2 hours away from me/the school. Halloween she came down to visit me and when she went home she completely ghosted me. For a week there was no communication and then finally she told me that I was “acting like a bitch” and “needed to get over myself.” I was completely shocked because besides for one argument where she was bragging over her internship, stuff was going pretty good. So I was blindsided. 

I was already going through a lot so I wasn’t trying to argue with her, I basically just said “I don’t know what you’re talking about but ok.” And that was it. 


We haven’t talked in almost a month now and yesterday a man come through my line (I work at Food Lion). And I recognized it was a man that my friend used to talk to. He followed me on social media a while back but out of respect for my friend, I didn’t follow him back. At this point I realized he was cute and EXACTLY my type. So I followed him back and he wanted to hang out with me. Lay in bed and watch some movies. And he stays in the same apartment complex as me. 

Her and him never hung out as far as I’m concerned because she always felt like he was just trying to have sex. So I know that’s why that didn’t work out. But I do want to hang out with him. Lately I’ve been wanting company, and this seems like the perfect opportunity because I find it hard to find men I’m attracted to. 


I’m not sure if me and her will be friends again because of how she went about things. But my sister said not to because of me and her happen to be friends again. The past couple days I’ve been avoiding him cause I’m not sure what to do. Help?"

I can choose a laptop to work with (for free) but I have no idea what the best choice would be. I will use it for some datamanagement but nothing very special I guess. I guess it will be protected and I should only use it work-related.

The three laptops I can choose from are:

Laptop 1 – MS BASIS TOUCH Lenovo ThinkPad AMD Ryzen 3 Pro 3300U-processor (4 MB cache, tot 3,50 GHz). 8GB intern and 128 GB. 14 inch

Laptop 2 – MS BASIS TOUCH 360 Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 4. Processor: Intel Core i5 16 GB Max. 8GB intern and 238 GB. 14 inch

Laptop 3 – MC XS Dynabook (Toshiba). Intel core i7, 16GB intern and 128GB. 13,3 inch

I already have a 2,5 year old Asus Zenbook flip UX360CA  13.3"" Touchscreen with Intel Core i5-7Y54, 256 GB SSD and 8 GB RAM, pretty similar to the Lenovo thinkpad yoga however I NEVER use it in the tablet mode because it gets a bit glitchy and does not work properly from the beginning. I guess the Toshiba is nice because of the i7 and that it can be used as an actual tablet, however I don't know how good that functions (probably not as good as a real tablet). I'd rather have a better quality laptop instead of one that can be used as a tablet but breaks easily/lower quality.

What is the best laptop in your opinion, and why?"

I am a recent BBA graduate in Canada. Out of school I was able to turn my small marketing agency internship into a full-time position at $17/h. I really enjoy the work, but there is zero opportunity for career advancement here, both in terms of learning and pay. I do seem to like marketing as a career, but I haven’t yet been successful in getting an interview at a bigger marketing agency. 

I was just offered a causal administrative assistant job at the Correctional Services of Canada (Federal Government) at $25/h, which is a 50% raise. It is only a three month term though, and there is no guarantee that I could renew it or eventually get a full time position there. I would also need to buy / lease a car and possibly move, as it’s 50 minutes from where I live and I don’t like the long commute (I currently walk to work). 

I’m already not sure if I’m going to like the bureaucracy of the public sector, but an extra $8/h is nothing to scoff at, and I would be learning new things again, which is something I feel is missing at my current job. I also may love it - I haven’t had enough job experience in that environment to know for sure.

So I guess I’m asking whether I should take the job from a career standpoint? If I like it, I’m pretty confident I could get renewed somewhere in the organization (though there is still some risk that I won’t, which leaves me in a poor position). 

If I don’t like it and want to go back to marketing though, could I use that $25/h figure from the three months to negotiate a higher starting salary at a different marketing job, or would they not care because it’s not a marketing job? Am I better off to just stay where I am until I hear back from a marketing position? 

Just wondering whether this is a worthwhile time investment for me. The opportunity came out of left-field (a friend who works there requested me), but the money would be nice so long as I’m not left worse off.

Looking to hear any experience or advise! Thanks so much :)"

k9v6co,2,2020-12-09,[Advice Needed Regarding Specialization] - Disillusionment with Business School Programs,felipearthur,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/k9v6co/advice_needed_regarding_specialization/,"Hi all,

This is a personal but hopefully relatable account, so I hope it is in line with this subreddit's content expectations.

After high school, I enrolled in an international business degree at what is at least on paper (according to the Financial Times) considered at top 10 European business school. For lack of a better option, I felt this was the right step for me at that age. My performance was adequate and I managed to get some (while hardly inspiring nonetheless) relevant internship experience in wealth management and risk consulting. So, I stuck around to complete my degree.

At the end of my studies, out of what I can only describe as complacency, shortsightedness or flat-out laziness I decided to cruise into a graduate management program (MSc.) at the same faculty with focus on innovation and strategic management, as this meant not having to go through rigorous application processes at other universities. This is where my disillusionment with business school graduate programs began. Aside from the master thesis research, the course did not prioritize the development of any transferable hard skills but felt rather like a one-year subscription to the Harvard Business Review. Despite the majority of my classmates seemingly enjoying the experience, I was left with the sense that I was more unprepared than ever for today's complex job market. Though, I suspect it to be rather common with business school graduates, I continue to be surprised that I find relatively little evidence of this frustration on reddit and other forums. This is in part the reason I am writing to consult this community for help.

Fast forward to 2.5 years after graduation - (to my own surprise) I have been working as a management consultant on IT projects in the pharmaceutical industry at one of the Big4 for the past two years. So it's safe to say things worked out, right? To avoid going into detail about the nature of Big4 consulting I will just say that it's not for me and I want out. Although there appears to be a career path, I (now 25) am aching for a role where I foresee future relevance and the chance to develop technical ""craftsmanship"" - aspects a typical big4 consulting career and many careers in the professional services industry do not entail in my opinion.

Consequently, I am back to the drawing board to figure out a path that does not fully discard my priors but also opens up doors to a more engaging and less menial profession. In this vein, I have started to research other Master programs - most of which ironically are taught at some of the top-tier business schools. To give you an idea - while I am still exploring, so far I have zeroed in on programs in data analytics, quantitative finance and development economics. Though I am fully aware that the course I chose at age 21 was inherently vague, I can't help but fear that what I described above is a systemic issue in business schools. Good universities (especially for 1-year programs) appear simply to cash in on their reputations as finishing schools for the multi-national corporate machine, in turn producing half-baked ""consultants"". After all, it seems even featured alumni for some of the courses which I am currently considering sometimes do not end up having jobs I would consider far more desirable than my own. I don't want to sound cynical but I believe this is all the more reason I need all the help I can get in navigating this strange secondary education landscape if I am going to quit my job next fall and dish out another fat check for university.

Now to my questions (btw if you kept reading to this point you are my hero!):

In this increasingly skill-based economy, is it really still worth spending so much money on programs that seem to regurgitate publicly available information?
Are there alternative routes for transitioning into more technical subject matter expert roles in business and finance that I am missing (e.g. conversion courses, part-time programs, certificates, perhaps options that can be coordinated with my employer)
Have any of you successfully transitioned from business into completely unrelated fields that you feel are more fulfilling? If so, what's your story?
What are your favorite websites and/or methods for researching truly worthwhile graduate programs?
If you can relate to my frustration in consulting and have any similar experiences but ended up finding the right program, kindly share them with me!
I would also be very appreciative of any suggestions on specific courses to consider.
Thanks a million for your support!"

I graduated from a 4 year Computer Science and Software Engineering degree from a well known Irish uni this year. Before I got my results I was offered a job in the IT department of a pretty big Irish company. I took it as the pay was good and I was interested to see what it might be like. Fast forward 6 months, I am working primarily in the Support role, doing support internally, externally for both software and hardware, a really broad role and extremely fast paced. 

But I’ve realized it’s not what I want, I realized I love coding and I love software development, i did a 6 month internship and all I can think of is how much I enjoyed it. And I graduated with a 1:1 so I suspect I’m not half bad at it either. 

I’m just confused now, how do I get out of this? I feel like I’ve forgotten what I learned in college, I understand I’m just rusty but I feel in a rut. What’s the best way to get back into being able to apply for entry level SWE jobs? I’ve lost my “new grad status” so I’m just not sure what’s the best way to go about this. 

It’s making me feel really low and making me hate the role I’m in now, even tho I’m paid very well and the work isn’t exactly bad I think I just have a desire inside me to do more and I feel the longer I stay, even tho that would be the easy option the harder it will be for me to do what I want

Now I wanted to learn more about backend development and I want to learn by doing so I started looking around for projects on GitHub to contribute to.

So what should I do?

I've spent countless hours applying to them this semester and I'm always stressed out by deadlines for assignments AND trying to squeeze in applications when I can. 


I've applied to so many internships and it's extremely frustrating. About 70% of the things I apply to don't even get back to me. 20% of them say no immediately. Maybe 10% of them actually give me a chance.


And of the ones I've interviewed with, it always feels so deceptive. It feels like things are going great, everyone is happy to talk, I send my thank-yous, everything goes well.


I had one that kind of sent me over the edge and now I am writing this. They told me they would make a hiring decision within two weeks. They got back to me a month later saying ""we made a decision (...) when can we call you to talk?""


So I had foolishly thought that ""talk"" meant that I got the job and I was finally relieved. A weight had been lifted off of my shoulders. If they were going to say no, they would have just said no in the email, right?


So I scheduled a time to talk. We had to reschedule because the person I was going to talk to was busy. We then had to reschedule again because they were busy. Finally we rescheduled a third time. All this rescheduling really cemented my belief I was going to get the job. If they had to reschedule it so many times, it had to be a yes, right??? If they were going to say no they wouldn't reschedule 3 times, they would just send an email, obviously!


So, we finally get on the phone. Talk for a bit. She says I ""was a great candidate and interviewed very well BUT"" and as soon as she said ""but"" I almost hung up. I thought ""of course"". I'm sick of being dragged along.


I'm just sick of never being good enough for any of these places. It's really disheartening. I've put so much time into trying to find a job and I am so deeply unhappy with my life this year. I just wanted this one thing to work. If I managed to land this I could have enjoyed some free time during my winter break. But now I will have to spend that time searching for more jobs.


Thank you for coming to my rant."

I'm looking to relocate for Jan-May, and not sure where to look. Some other details:

* I don't own a car, so a place with lots of walking is ideal
* Budget isn't really a concern, but I don't want to pay over $1300USD per month for housing
* I'm open to moving around frequently
* I need internet for classes
* I'm a business student studying finance and business analytics while also getting a computer science minor
* ideally, would love a work study or internship during the semester
* ok with any weather, but I am Floridian (so maybe not Alaska haha)

That's all I can think of right now for details. Really, I'm just looking for opportunities that I can take on as a student since I don't have to be on campus, so if you know of any student-friendly programs anywhere, please let me know!

EDIT: As travel is limited currently, I'm particularly interested in domestic travel, so if you have any places in the US in mind that's great too!"

He suggested WordPress and thought that there would be plugin I could set up to do all this. I soon realised there wasn't and we would have to piece together different plugins. I ended up learning how to use php templates so we didn't have to rely on as many plugins.

When I showed him my work after a week he was so unimpressed he fired me. I only had 4 weeks to make this CRM portal but fired me due to not finding the correct solution.

My questions is was a correct in trying to make most of the PHP CRM myself and only using plugins for features. They said money wasn't an issue but only got me the cheapest wordpress.org host."

And its not like i'm solving the problem in silence either, I've done many mock interviews and feel like I do a good job at explaining my thought process yet I constantly get fucked in these interviews.

The thing is that, I’m trying to get a summer internship at the end of the school year to potentially get a full-time job and the issues I have seen in recruiting would be being ghosted for weeks or months for an interview, getting the interview but either getting clapped because my code isn’t fully correct (very small syntax errors in SQL code, but I’m only given a few minutes to write out my answer, so time pressure is an issue and they don’t even run the code anyway, so it should be based on closeness to the right answer), or you feel kind of guilty to say IDK to an answer for a question.

This is my first post in r/jobs. I wanted some advice and opinion about the meeting that I have next week. It is more related to my career/job than about the meeting. I will start with some background information.  

I started working for a small midsize company named X on Oct 13th, 2016 as an intern. During that time I was doing my Bachelor's in Information Technology. In December of 2016, they decided to pay for my school's tuition fees for my entire Bachelor's and Master's program. Overall they paid $47,000 in total (Not the exact amount). In return they wanted me to work for them for three years after graduation. Until I graduate with my master’s, they were paying me $38,400 per year ($20 per hour). I negotiated my salary, it was tough but I was able to make them pay me $43,200 per year ($22.50 per hour) for the first year after graduation, $48,000 per year ($25 per hour) for the second year, and $52,800 per year ($27.50 per hour) for the third year. My third year of the contract is starting from January 2021. Yesterday, my Company's owner asked me to come to his office. He told me if I am available for lunch someday next week. They wanted to discuss what are my plans after the contract is over in 2022. He told me they really want me to continue and eventually take my supervisor's position (My supervisor is Vice President of IT) when he retires in 10 years.

I am 26 years old. My title is Solutions Architect. I have a Bachelor's and a Masters's degree in IT. I also have several professional level certifications from Google Cloud, AWS, and Azure. I am working on getting some certifications related to management like CAPM, CGEIT, and CSM.

I work in the Cincinnati area and I really love the place I work at. Since my company is small-midsize I am not sure if they will be able to pay me enough. I am wishing if they can pay me a minimum of $90,000 a year. My questions are:

* How can I convince them to pay that much? 
* Am I asking for too much? 
* How can I be smart about this meeting? 
* How to negotiate this in the best possible way?
* I will really appreciate any additional advice regarding this meeting!

Thank you so much for taking time reading my post! Stay Safe!"
ka01lx,2,2020-12-09,Chance me for College (mainly Virginia schools) + Advice for what I can improve on to increase my chances,lmaololhello,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/ka01lx/chance_me_for_college_mainly_virginia_schools/,"Demographic: Asian male, upper middle class, living in Northern Virginia, currently a Junior.

GPA UW: 3.945

GPA W: 4.50 (this is my projected GPA for the end of this year (my junior year)

Notes: I took AP Physics 1 in my sophomore year, which is a year ahead of the generally top-level section that most juniors at my school take. I was the only sophomore to take this course last year.

Class Rank: N/A, our school doesn't do rankings unfortunately

SAT: Currently only a 1480 (700 reading, 780 math) Will most likely retake in the future.

SAT Subjects: N/A as of now

Sophomore APs

AP Physics 1: 4

AP World History: 4

AP Chinese: 5

Junior APs (No scores as of now)

AP Physics C:

AP BC Calculus:

AP Lang:

AP Macro/Micro Economics:

7 APs taken Sophomore and Junior Year so far + 1 community college course

Plan on taking 3-4 more for my Senior year, so 10-11 total.

Other classes:

Also taking entrepreneurship, which is a college-level course at my school but not officially classified as an AP.

Another thing to note is that I have taken the highest level of English, AP Chinese, and am currently in Spanish 4. I am fluent in both Chinese and English, and I am planning on taking AP Spanish next year, so I am also close to being trilingual. I would say I am pretty interested and invested in languages.

Extracurriculars:

* National Honor Society
* National Math Honor Society/Mu Alpha Theta Honor Society
* 4 Year Varsity Tennis athlete
* AP Chinese Teachers' Assistant. Every week I help out at an AP Chinese class and I am the teachers assistant.
* Model UN. I have been an active member of Model UN for 2 years. I have won a few lower-level awards, and I often attend local high school conferences and travel to national college conferences as well.
* (Name omitted as it contains my school name): A school club that I was a part of that was focused on fundraising money for the Children's Network Hospitals and raised 55k dollars last year
* Director of Operations for a local non-profit organization (name omitted as well): This organization focuses on fundraising food and donates the food to local food banks, which is especially important and helpful with COVID. This organization has raised over 3000 pounds of food for local food banks in the past 6 months.
* Internship with a Professor at George Mason regarding Machine Learning/Diatoms. This was an internship based on classifying diatoms (a type of algae). While manually classifying the species and genus for these diatoms is tedious for scientists, I was able to help program utilizing neural networks that could input these diatoms and classify them based off a certain dataset. I also wrote a few articles and plan on publishing a research paper.
* Accepted into NASA Stem Enhancement in Earth Science (SEES) Internship: I was accepted into this competitive internship that only accepted the top 9% of applicants out of over a 600 people. I was unable to do this internship due to COVID. :(

Future Plans for Extracurriculars:

* Plan on getting a job when I turn 16 (I am also technically one year ahead for school as I am a 15 year old Junior as of right now). This is mainly to also get some work experience.
* Starting an Economic/Finance club in my school
* F=MA competition: A national Physics competition conducted by the national U.S. Physics Team. I am hoping to place at least as a finalist or get some higher award (bronze, silver, gold medals)

Another thing to note: Hopefully what I listed above so far does not seem ""stereotypical"" for an Asian Male. Personally, I don't really think I really match up with the classic example of the Asian tryhard (personality-wise), and while I have not really listed anything that defines my personality, I hope that I can display these types of qualities on my essays for colleges as well.

Schools (Safety and dream schools)

* Virginia Tech
* George Mason
* Virginia Commonwealth University
* UVA
* UCLA
* UC Berkley
* Stanford
* University of Chicago
* Columbia
* NYU
* USC

It would also be great if anyone also had extra suggestions or recommendations on how I could improve my overall application to increase my chances of getting into these schools. Thanks!"

I’m retaking it this semester and I don’t even know if I’ll have pass this time.

I got carried through all the projects and whenever I look around me or on the internet all I see is code this, code that, google this amazon that. But the thing is that I’m doing well in all my other math and physics classes. I’m so afraid for my first internship, it’s literally keeping me up at night. 

I don’t think I’ve put in all the work I could but I don’t think a degree should be 4 years of non stop struggle. Sometimes I wish I would’ve started to code earlier but that’s worth nothing now.

I’ve always been passionate about technology and solving problems but the more time passes the more I wonder if I made the right career choice.

I graduated last year with a Software Engineering degree, but have had no luck in getting a full job offer, until now. I had no internships and a pretty average GPA. I'm working on a side project, but other than that, all of my projects were done in school.

So, I live in a relatively low CoL area, and I just got a job offer for 60k in Atlanta, Georgia. The offer includes bi-anual performance based merit reviews, with each review promising a potential raise. It also includes all the standard health, dental, vision insurance, 401k, stock, etc etc. I also get a relocation stipend to help with the move. Remote work is expected to go on for a few more months.

In my opinion I'm in no position to negotiate as I have no prior experience and I consider myself a pretty average entry level developer, and the promise of bi anual raises sound nice, but that only matters if I like working at the company for that amount of time.

If you were in my shoes, what would you do? Take the job to get much needed experience in the field? I just feel like it's unnecessary risk asking for a 5-10k raise?"
ka3om6,8,2020-12-09,Sophomore CSE major who needs help building resume,Gapphew,udub,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/ka3om6/sophomore_cse_major_who_needs_help_building_resume/,"First off please don't be toxic and say stuff like ""you don't deserve to be in CSE"" and stuff like that. I heard plenty of that during my freshman year when I took math 12x and cse14x.

I don't have a good or a complete resume yet. The only real thing I have done that looks good on my resume is I've been private tutoring college students in their intro cse classes since the summer. I have a couple of generic stuff like work experience at the library, etc.

So yeah nothing good. I'm planning to try to get internships my junior year but after getting rejected from cse 14x TA application for the second time in a row I'm now worried that I won't be able to build a good enough resume for anyone to hire me as an intern.

I'm still want to be a TA for 14x or maybe even one of the cse major classes like 331. I want to do some personal projects with android and ios apps and put that on my resume. I'll still be private tutoring for the winter quarter but then I will stop because I will be taking 332 and 312 in the spring and I will be focusing on that.

Other than that, I'm not sure how I can find opportunities to improve my resume (especially during these covid times). I feel pretty imitated because I know a lot of cse majors who have great resumes and I'm just worried that all the internships will be taken because of the competition.

So basically what I'm asking for is advice on how I can make a good resume in the next nine or so months.

Also, do I have to get a letter of recommendation or a referral from a cse professor?

To provide a little background, I am currently working in a mobile computing technology lab at my school, doing CAD, basic circuit-building and low-level programming.

Anyways, around a month ago, I applied to an internship position at PTC (creators of Creo/Windchill) that listed augmented reality and IoT as potential areas interns could work in (I deal with both of these on varying levels at my lab). Additionally, the position was open to all engineering majors, so I thought I'd give it a shot. Recently, I was invited to do an interview, and as happy as I am to have a company reach out, I realize now that PTC is more so a computer software company and I am honestly confused as to why they would interview a MechE. 

Sure I have some programming experience (basic C# scripting in Unity, Arduino programming, MATLAB, limited exposure to python and java), but my skills are honestly laughable when compared to your traditional CS student. 

Which leads to my question. What kind of work would I even be doing at a company like PTC (or any computer software company for that matter)? And how should I prepare for my interview? From what I understand, PTC develops industry software and tools for traditional engineers rather than employ them within the company. Thanks in advance."

My cousins live down south in America working as a software developer, have same experience as me but they almost get double of what I get here in Canada. The work culture in IT seems to be very flexible in California especially in Silicon Valley.
It is also my dream to work for one of the international companies in Silicon Valley. What is the best way to move from Canada to California with a high paid job in information technology preferably as a software developer.
P.S. I am fimiliar with all the benefits of living in Canada such as universal health care, quality of life etc. But I still want to live my dream working in Silicon Valley."

I am a cs major here who failed 351 twice as of and currently in limbo since I was supposed to graduate this upcoming semester. I also did not end up appealing because I had heard they rarely approve them and that my downfall was me not paying enough attention, and not doing hws. I have since started taking math courses since I had 5 courses left to get a double major. However this semester has not been going well either, I am failing most of my classes and thinking of dropping the semester. My gpa has also dropped to 2.3. I am not really sure what to do anymore and the thought of telling my parents I won't graduate let alone I got kicked of cs scares me. I don't know what to call this, blessing or ... but I ended up receiving several swe internships offers like Facebook and Bloomberg but I fear that they will ask me for my transcript and rescind my offers, (they have not yet). I am terribly scared and hopeless. I don't know who to contact or how to proceed."

**Situation:**

In a Product Analyst role at Telecom Company in Canada. I've been in this position for two years. My role consists of lots of admin work updating product catalog, reviewing Sales Contract, training Sales on product, and doing pricing/cost analysis of our products. My salary is 65k a year.

The culture of my company is shit. Our company did a pulse check and as an organization it was around 40% engagement. Canadian company standard is 60%. Its been two years and I've seen minimal growth. Its all firefighting because our company lacked any urgency, care to take care of its products/customers. Our software is dated, and our workforce is overworked, or stifled to the point of apathy. I feel like my manager doesn't really care about my growth (this is pretty important, obviously).

I've had to learn all the products on my own by asking the technical people how our products work. My manager is so busy he doesn't have time to train me. I've had to spin in my head to figure shit out. This is an accomplishment on its own, but leads to the apathy because it takes so long to do things that should be so easy. Employers don't recognize how resourceful I am. This should be table stakes?

I feel like the company culture has stifled me so much that it affects my mood outside of work. When looking at other companies I can't really say any major projects that I spearheaded that makes me interesting and worthy candidate. All I do is firefight to keep shit going. I am not creating anything in an impactful way. I see others getting promotions, and doing great things. I'm a pretty capable person, why not me?

**My Resume... maybe you guys can help me see what's out there. I don't know what I don't know:**

\- Business Major in Marketing, and MIS

\- Done a lot of business cases analyzing viability of SaaS products. There are situations where we need to make the tough decision to end of life some of our products. I confirm this with my analysis

\- I am OK with excel. I know Vlookups, If functions, and pivot tables. I know enough to get the job done. There is much to learn there

\- I have a solid understanding of Project Management, and created a PMO at another organization

\- I've executed marketing campaigns for major corporation

\- I have a fundamental understanding of finance. It was something I wanted to major in, but didn't go through with that.

\- I've been in the work force for about 6 years now including my internships. I graduated in 2016.

**My goal:**

\- I think I want to be a product manager. This is so broad (this is a problem of its own). I enjoy the challenge of stepping up to the plate and managing ""something"".

\- I enjoy the fundamentals data decision. I understand basic SQL, but definitely do not enjoy writing the queries. Added to this, making pricing/financial decisions based on data is something that gets me going. I like this.

**Question:**

\- What's out there for me? I felt like this company that I'm at sucked all the confidence out of me. I don't feel like I'm good enough considering the last two years I've been dragged through the mud. Ideally, I'll stay in technology. I think there is a lot of growth there. Again, its so broad.

\- I want to take classes outside of work. I'm willing to put in the hours to learn new skills/new industry

\- My company has offered to pay for class(es), within $$ reason. I am looking at taking Pragmatic Marketing - Product - Foundations to learn more about Product Management. Would you guys suggest this or is there another institution that would be better? Hell, is there other courses you guys think I should focus on to further my career?

General feedback is welcomed. I probably need to add more details. I just cant think of it right now. I am in a weird spot because I want to move forward and up to become a manager, but I don't know how to get there. Also, I am willing to move laterally to gain experience before moving up. However, I feel this time pressure to ""catch up"", I'm 33 already. It's time for me to make some $$$."

It feels horrible when I think if I just changed one or two answers in your final round, I could’ve gotten the offer too. 

Now I’m just stuck with local companies making like $55k for my final internship and likely have to delay my graduation just to try to get more jobs.

I feel like my life has been spiraling downward over the past year.

About 3 years ago, I left my comfortable IT Consulting job with the goal of starting an online business and ""getting rich"". I bought into the idea of building an eCommerce store and greatly underestimated the amount of work that would go into it.

I ended up doing decent and making a little bit of money from it, but I ended up dissolving my company and moved on to the next business idea.

I've since been through 4 or 5 different serious online business ideas, each one lasting shorter than the last. I also got a marketing internship with the hopes of gaining valuable business skills, but I also eventually grew to dislike that job and eventually left shortly after becoming a full-time employee.

I feel like I'm a bright guy, I pick up skills very quickly and I think I'm moderately creative, I'm also great socially and feel like I can talk to anyone. But every time I start a business idea or a new job and think ""Do I really want to do this long-term?"", my brain starts to freak out and make excuses like ""I'm just not passionate about the work."" or ""When I find the right thing, I'll work hard then."" and I ultimately end up quitting.

I'm incredibly grateful that my girlfriend's family helps support me by allowing me to stay in their home. But I also feel like not having to worry about having to be fully financially independent is giving me a reason to not work hard and not take my work seriously.

Am I shooting myself in the foot? I want to build a business that pays me later on so I don't have to work, but I feel like having that intention is sets me up for failure. Because if I want to achieve success, I need to have a good enough relationship with work to the point where I want to do it long-term or feel that it's positively adding to my life more than just financially.

I guess my question is, how do you build a good enough relationship with work to the point where you don't feel like quitting at the first sign of trouble? How do I stick with an idea after it loses its ""honeymoon phase""? Is it foolish to ""follow your passion"" and just work on accepting that work is work?"

Yesterday I got my interview for System Administrator INTERNSHIP and they called me the same day to start next week. My duties will cover quite a lot from ticket resolving, on/off boarding users in Azure AD, through end-user laptop troubleshooting and probably helping setting up whole office since it's a new one.

About me: Finished studies in unrelated field which is physiotherapy, moved out of my country and worked as a waiter and at some point realised that my whole life I was into something related to IT, from simple coding in html and building simple websites, through game server administration to setting up multiple unix-based servers on vps, building multiple pc clients and troubleshooting all the  magic that I encountered with my own PC or other's. Started with ITIL v3 and now preparing for CompTIA A+ to have some basic certificates.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for any replies, I am very excited to learn more and I would like to be well prepared for what I may have to learn and what I can do right now to make myself more useful there."

The problem is I have no personal projects, no work experience in my life, no volunteer experience and am just about to start practicing LeetCode problems. I have a decent WAM but have forgotten most of what I've studied and understand that all of the above are my own fault.

I'm sure there are other students in a similar position, so my question is how do students like me find relevant internships to fulfil their IT requirement? So far every ad I've looked at seems to require a much more capable candidate. I'm going to do my best to improve but I doubt I can get all that far by the time positions start opening up.

kae89m,25,2020-12-10,Self doubt about ADHD and therapist just makes it worse 🙁,Zerinho_gameplays,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/kae89m/self_doubt_about_adhd_and_therapist_just_makes_it/,"TLDR: my therapist seems to be trying her best to convince me that I don't have ADHD, making me wonder whether I am just creating labels for myself.

Context: I've been diagnosed on october 5th. I didn't go to my neurologist looking for an ADHD diagnosis but actually to treat epilepsy. I've started going to therapy later the same month

Going to therapy is really good, I do feel I've been developing a great self esteem and building a few good habits that have had a lot of impact on my life. My therapist helps me a lot with internships I'm looking for and with other personal issues (besides those ADHD related).

However, from time to time when we talk about my ADHD she doesn't even try to hide that she doesn't think I have it. She constantly asks me to think if it's just a label I'm tagging myself with just to justify my mistakes (constantly getting late, procrastination, forgetfulness, mood shifts, overfocusing). She doesn't seem to understand my efforts and the things I've tried to overcome all of this struggles.

Yes, I did great at school and I am doing great at university, but at the cost of gigantic struggles no one sees.

My family already already doesn't believe me and the only support I have come from a friend, my girlfriend and my mother in law so I really needed a therapist that helped me dealing with this.

Is it common that therapists doubt the diagnosis during the beginning of the treatment???
Am I just paranoid or is she right and I don't have ADHD???
I DONT KNOW ANYMORE AAAARRRRRRGGGHHHHHH

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the kind words and advice! I read everything and all the suggestions were really helpful

I had my session today and confronted her about the diagnosis and whether she agrees with it or not. She said that due to my progress during therapy she believes the problem is psychological rather than a disorder however said that will be taking more tests to evaluate it and asked me to talk about it with my neurologist and let him be the judge (since she agreed he knows more about the subject than her)

I won't dump her because she was helpful even today and didn't deny the possibility. She helped me a lot and I think that giving her the neurologists notes will be enough to convince her."
kae8mp,0,2020-12-10,JPL Summer Internship Questions,Street_Theory,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/kae8mp/jpl_summer_internship_questions/,"I’m thinking of applying for a summer internship at JPL. It’s been my dream for a long time. A few questions:

1. My gpa is above their 3.0 minimum cutoff, but not that much and still low by JPL standards I think. They have an optional comments section at the end of their app. Should I briefly explain my gpa and why it’s not that high? I do have a couple of legitimate reasons, but I also don’t want to draw too much attention to that or come across as someone with a sob story or seeking pity. What do y’all think I should do? 

2. Does JPL have summer intern work for just CS/software engineering i.e. nothing to do with EE, Aerospace, or MechE? It seems most of their work involves some EE/Aerospace/MechE knowledge.

3. Any other recommendations/suggestions to maximize my chance of getting the internship? 

Thanks in advance!!"

kai5u2,0,2020-12-10,Risks of taking time off to travel after school?,Conscious_Biscuit,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kai5u2/risks_of_taking_time_off_to_travel_after_school/,"I am considering travelling (depending on restrictions) after I graduate in May for 3-4 months. 

I live in Canada, so I am incredibly grateful to have zero student debt. I have enough of an emergency fund in case it takes me awhile to get a job (I would probably be okay for up to a year). I have 16 months experience in the industry through internships, a few projects, do leetcode, and would continue improving my skills while travelling.

My concerns are:

A) Would starting to apply a significant amount of time after my graduation date be a red flag to recruiters?

B) How long after graduating are you able to apply for ‘New Grad’ roles?

C) Is taking time off to travel after school a red flag on its own?

D) Are there any other risks in doing this that I am not thinking of?

My reasons for wanting to take this time off:

A) I’ve worked all summers/breaks since I was 16, minimum wage jobs and as a server before getting my dev internships. Frankly I’m a little burnt out and I genuinely believe taking a break would be beneficial to my career.

B) I want to get travelling to countries I really want to visit out of the way, so factors such as vacation time etc are less important when applying in the coming years and I can focus 100% on my career.

C) I’m probably not going to get another opportunity to travel for months at a time until I retire.

D) The job market is kind of shit right now anyway.

E) I am looking to move to the US and am concerned that starting as soon as I graduate will incline employers to just hire me remotely as a Canadian.


I really don’t want to completely mess up my future and any advice is greatly appreciated!"

I’m a college age student, and I am looking for a summer internship. I’m curious as to what type of roles y’all might recommend for somebody who is relatively inexperienced in this field and is looking to learn. 

I do have experience with CS as a developer, and I’ve gained in interest in security through my adversarial-ML research. I’ve started studying for the CompTia+ exam, and I’m taking a course on security in the spring. I have dabbled in pentesting on my home network, but I think I would benefit to learn from a mentor and as part of a team."

I am a junior college student who just went through an application season for computer science internship positions at numerous companies. I am lucky to say it was successful; All but one company gave me an offer. I have already accepted a position at a large tech hub in my state and I'm very happy with it. However, this morning I was given an internship offer from the NSA and it looks very promising. I know they work on a lot of data science and digital signal processing projects and that alone is a big deal to me. I'm unsure of what to do. Even though the job I have already accepted is an internship, it seems really unprofessional to back out from the position after you have accepted. Any advice or word on this would be really appreciated!

For those who have done the NSA's computer science internship program or know about it, here are some simple questions I have;

My current accepted internship position has a 5k signing bonus and a $25/hr wage. This is the highest any internship I've seen pay. How does the NSA compare to this? 

The cost of living in the surrounding area for my accepted position is also relatively low for any given metro area in the US. How are the costs of living in Fort Meade and Maryland in general? Is it hard to find a good space out there?

Lastly, does the NSA hire interns from the CSIP program?"

I have completed the challenge and did not share the original code as the code was provided for applying for an internship and I do not want to share what they may consider to be their intellectual property for assessing new interns.

 Hi folks, here are 69 New Data Science, Data Engineering and Machine Learning jobs. 
 Let me know if you have any questions. Cheers!"
kalk28,1,2020-12-10,I screwed up my Test Automation Engineer job,georgebool0101,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/kalk28/i_screwed_up_my_test_automation_engineer_job/,"I graduated with a CS degree in 2020 and currently pursuing an internship based in India. 

I applied for a Test Automation profile at this 10 year old startup which is actually a big name in Virtualization space (by now you'd know it I guess)


I cleared the initial HackerRank test. Then had to attend totally 5 rounds of technical interviews. 

The first 3 rounds were actually pretty good. Basic to medium questions on DS, Algo, OS, my project at school, etc. 

They scheduled 4th and 5th round of interview on the same day on morning and evening slot. 5th round was taken by Engineering Manager. In the 4h round scheduled in the morning slot, I didn't give an efficient solution to one of the two questions that were asked and it set off my mood. Till now I was asked to write code glider.ai and for some questions I just had to explain the algorithm and code was not required (depends on the interviewer).

 In the 5th round scheduled in evening slot, I was actually not in good mood and the manager shared a Google doc. The first question was to calculate the time needed to sort 2 Billion integers using Bubble Sort and Quick Sort. Little did I know that he was looking at how I would write down the equations to solve the problem. I wrote the solution in gibberish math lingo and he said, ""Man, what're you doing. It's a mess. Write them neatly"". Then I realised it and wrote the equations properly. This made me nervous as I wanted to clear the last round. He asked a DS question to which I though my answer was correct but he denied it. Then he ended the 1hour interview at 45 minutes and said ""I expected you to do better"".

The HR called today and said you got 2 negative feedbacks. Sorry. 😐

It was really good paying job and I'm very much sad over screwing it up. I don't know whose fault it was but I was eventually affected. 

But good feedbacks from previous 3 rounds doesn't matter at all? What do you experienced developers say?"

I know that a lot of tech jobs have moved remote, with some places (e.g. Twitter) saying that they will be remote forever.

How are starting salaries decided now? Are companies tying it to your location? Super curious to hear about this process, especially considering that (I'm pretty sure) internships will be remote this upcoming summer too."

I absolutely hate it. My school has a coop system where 95% of students get 2 years of experience. So far I got 1 year of experience through 3 different internships as a Software Engineer. I wanted to switch out of chemical eng since 1st year but due to bad marks, it was impossible to do anything. I tried switching every term but was rejected. Finally, I get accepted now to switch to Computer Science but I am wondering if switching is worth it. I am already in a 5-year program and if I switch, I will be set back one year and will end up doing a 6-year program. I have a decent software resume and am fairly confident that I can work in the software industry by following the current path I am on. I just don't want to learn anymore chemical engineering stuff lol. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to switch to CS but at my school, it is an extremely hard program. A lot of people fail out and honestly, I don't know if I would survive. I don't consider myself smart and engineering is pretty hard for me. I haven't failed so far so I think I am smart enough to pass. I fear failure and don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl:dr In chemical engineering, got offered to switch to CS after trying for 2 years. Will graduate one year late if I switch and am asking for advice on if I should switch or not. I fear failing in CS :("

**Situation:**

In a Product Analyst role at Telecom Company in Canada. I've been in this position for two years. My role consists of lots of admin work updating product catalog, reviewing Sales Contract, training Sales on product, and doing pricing/cost analysis of our products. My salary is 65k a year.

The culture of my company is shit. Our company did a pulse check and as an organization it was around 40% engagement. Canadian company standard is 60%. Its been two years and I've seen minimal growth. Its all firefighting because our company lacked any urgency, care to take care of its products/customers. Our software is dated, and our workforce is overworked, or stifled to the point of apathy. I feel like my manager doesn't really care about my growth (this is pretty important, obviously).

I've had to learn all the products on my own by asking the technical people how our products work. My manager is so busy he doesn't have time to train me. I've had to spin in my head to figure shit out. This is an accomplishment on its own, but leads to the apathy because it takes so long to do things that should be so easy. Employers don't recognize how resourceful I am. This should be table stakes?

I feel like the company culture has stifled me so much that it affects my mood outside of work. When looking at other companies I can't really say any major projects that I spearheaded that makes me interesting and worthy candidate. All I do is firefight to keep shit going. I am not creating anything in an impactful way. I see others getting promotions, and doing great things. I'm a pretty capable person, why not me?

**My Resume... maybe you guys can help me see what's out there. I don't know what I don't know:**

\- Business Major in Marketing, and MIS

\- Done a lot of business cases analyzing viability of SaaS products. There are situations where we need to make the tough decision to end of life some of our products. I confirm this with my analysis

\- I am OK with excel. I know Vlookups, If functions, and pivot tables. I know enough to get the job done. There is much to learn there

\- I have a solid understanding of Project Management, and created a PMO at another organization

\- I've executed marketing campaigns for major corporation

\- I have a fundamental understanding of finance. It was something I wanted to major in, but didn't go through with that.

\- I've been in the work force for about 6 years now including my internships. I graduated in 2016.

**My goal:**

\- I think I want to be a product manager. This is so broad (this is a problem of its own). I enjoy the challenge of stepping up to the plate and managing ""something"".

\- I enjoy the fundamentals data decision. I understand basic SQL, but definitely do not enjoy writing the queries. Added to this, making pricing/financial decisions based on data is something that gets me going. I like this.

\- I enjoy strategy and planning for execution to success 

**Question:**

\- What's out there for me? I felt like this company that I'm at sucked all the confidence out of me. I don't feel like I'm good enough considering the last two years I've been dragged through the mud. Ideally, I'll stay in technology. I think there is a lot of growth there. Again, its so broad.

\- I want to take classes outside of work. I'm willing to put in the hours to learn new skills/new industry

\- My company has offered to pay for class(es), within $$ reason. I am looking at taking Pragmatic Marketing - Product - Foundations to learn more about Product Management. Would you guys suggest this or is there another institution that would be better? Hell, is there other courses you guys think I should focus on to further my career?

General feedback is welcomed. I probably need to add more details. I just cant think of it right now. I am in a weird spot because I want to move forward and up to become a manager, but I don't know how to get there. Also, I am willing to move laterally to gain experience before moving up. However, I feel this time pressure to ""catch up"", I'm 33 already. It's time for me to make some $$$."

This is my junior year of college so I really need to land something. I applied for more than 50 positions and haven't received a single interview. I have been using LinkedIn, attending career fairs, and reaching out to people I know. I received two OAs: from Smartsheet and from Amazon, the latter I received only because I applied through a contact.

The Smartsheet one didn't go too great. I did well on the two coding questions. But I am pretty sure I bombed the multiple choice section. There were three questions I did not know the answer to at all, and I made a big mistake in one of the other three, which happened partially because I freaked out about the time limit.

And if that was bad, the Amazon one was terrible. I took the OA1 which is for code debugging. I took 13 minutes on the first one, thinking the timer would reset after each question. Then, I wasn't able to do any of the others in time.

I found this sub while looking for other opportunities I could pursue. I thought I was in a good position but was just struggling because the jobs are so competitive, especially when it's LinkedIn. But when I saw other people's resumes on Resume Roast, I took some time to cry. I have one relevant experience, one personal project, three class projects, and that's about it. I do have experience in other fields cause I have worked two jobs, and have taken part in ECs. I know Python and C++, and a little bit of Java and C#. But other people here have had 4-5 coding jobs, another 2-3 independent projects, and know 10 languages.

My classes are at a fairly high level, including Machine Learning and AI, and I am planning to add Algorithm Design and Database Systems this winter. I am at a top public college. I am a little behind my peers on coursework because I am a Computational Cognitive Science major, but I don't know if that affects my chances of a call back.

Anyway, I would really appreciate some help on how to move forward! Thank you!"
kaxrl1,21,2020-12-11,Two years in and I suck at programming.,internally,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/kaxrl1/two_years_in_and_i_suck_at_programming/,"I'm so insecure about this haha. I have been interning somewhere for six months and almost got no where with the project I was doing. Let me explain.

I came in with no ReactJS experience, no TypeScript experience, no TailwindCSS experience, no AWS experience, little Git experience, no REST API experience, no NextJS experience, no NodeJS experience.. absolutely none of these things. As a result, I had to spend the first few months of my CO-OP trying to learn how to read documentation just to produce something shitty the first three months in. I have been trying to rewire my brain (I have ADHD mind you) to focus and reorganize itself and the way it dissects and read code. I get so frustrated and so impatient with myself that anyone can see it in my body language.

I had to build a dashboard from scratch. It took three months to do. Then the senior developer told me to redo it. How embarrassing is that? Arguably I did a much better job the next time around, but I don't even know why I was chosen for this position if I'm a waste of company resources. Because I took too long writing the backend (I wasn't given a testing environment or any mentorship) they have to send the rest of the dashboard project to some other web dev company. I don't know how long it's going to take, but considering it's a startup and they had high expectations of me (even though I only knew a bit of VueJS before this and didn't mention in my resume at all any of the other skills they needed), I have so much weight on my shoulders trying to impress my boss(es).

I was recently dumped a new task. That is to automate(?) code so a button on Shopify goes to a different web service called ReCharge for subscription services. I'm trying to learn Liquid and AJAX now. It makes me feel stupid when my boss says what I'm doing should be easy (which, it's not) because I'm so slow at Googling.. at reading documentation.. and even comprehending half the material I'm doing in a short matter of time.
I was able to complete the task, but not necessarily in an efficient way, just because a customer would be confused by the process of getting to the subscription service and just.. *tangent here*.

I arrived with another intern who had three months more experience than I did, except with Android/iPhone development. She was absolutely able to kill her tasks at a blink of an eye. We got along very well, but just talking to her, she has the mind of a programmer and business person. She's so beautiful as well! I had to use Prettier to clean my code and she didn't. She got one project out of the way last minute for investors, whereas I was stuck on one and nearly got sick of it.

I recently had a talk with my boss. He told me that when he first interviewed me, he knew he wouldn't have to boss me around to get things done. Arguably I think that was mistake number one LOL. I needed way more guidance, but I also don't think I came in with enough coding experience - I only did some research, two Hackathons, and like one (very small) personal project, on top of some school projects which were nothing like this.

I came into the company as a sophomore and learned how to code the second half of freshman year. So it's been two years, as I'm a junior now, and will be leaving in December. But after working here, I realize I suck so much and have so much longer to go. I actually asked for an extension (I will be receiving a stipend) because I thought I was so shit but still wanted to prove myself. I feel like I owe them for what little progress I did. The other intern didn't ask to stay when I think she deserves it way more than I do.

*Phew*

Okay, I'm done venting now.

TLDR: I made progress so slowly at my COOP internship. I don't think I am business or programming oriented enough to do a good job. I actually love to program though because I like seeing my results and find problem solving rewarding, but I think I entered my company too soon. I don't spot or understand problems quickly enough and I think I'm a hindrance. Sigh."

I'll be completing my full-time national service obligation in about 2 months and would like to find an internship in the roughly 6 months I have before university begins. I would like to get an internship preferably in the finance sector as I would like to have a greater insight into the industry. However, I have noticed that many companies only accept university students. Does anyone know any openings/opportunities in which I can try applying for? Also, in what ways can I pad my resume to help me bolster my chances of securing an internship? Will going for online courses be beneficial? I know a bit of python and am looking to go for some courses teaching data analysis but not sure how useful it will be. Thanks in advance!"

Please Help Me Decide!,No_Background_6659,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kb0yqw/earlymid_career_advice_please_help_me_decide/,"**About Me:** I have about 4 YoE working at a startup (+1 YoE as intern). My work mostly involved building client side components with some minor server/services work.

I have recently received two offers from Amazon and Microsoft and would like some help in deciding between the two.

&amp;#x200B;

**Amazon**:

One of the AWS Compliance services at KMS.

Offer: SDE 2, 200 TC

The good: I feel like this job would give me direct exposure to server-side work at large scale. Java is sort of my main language. Had some friends ask around for me and current employee on the team seems to like the manager and says pressure is not too high. On call is 24/7 every 2 months?

The not so good: The amazon culture? I've heard some weird/bad things about Amazon. A quick search of linkedin, average employee tenure is about 2 years. The overall pip culture is a bit off putting to say the least. Should I even work here for 2 years and hop to another job? Bad vesting schedule.

**Microsoft**:

Office 365 Org, Windows 10 Security client

Offer: SDE 2, 150 TC

The good: MSFT seems to have better culture, nice perks. Average employee tenure is around 4 - 5 years in this specific office. The skip manager seems to be a nice guy with solid background. This seems like a nice place to build career? I agree with the company and CEO's vision. Learning/growth mindset. On call seems to be less than Amazon? Yearly refresher.

The not so good: MSFT stack seems to be less open. The work is mostly for the client side in C/C++/C#. Pay is less than AMZN, about 100K less in 4 years. Stock growth is slower. I would have to renege on Amazon offer... 

&amp;#x200B;

**Additional Info:**

I've already accepted the Amazon offer before the MSFT offer comes in (Interviewed at MSFT before Amazon). I know it is not ideal to renege (especially when Im about to start at AMZN soon) . But I am really torn on what to do. On one hand, I do want some exposure to cloud/service at scale experience, but on the other I also have some personal interest in security work. Company culture wise, Microsoft wins hands down, but friend of friend seems to suggest it's not that bad in this particular AWS team. As for pay, amazon wins.

&amp;#x200B;

I think i'm overthinking this and reaching decision fatigue... Any help/suggestion/recommendation is greatly appreciated!"

To start off, I have my BSME from UCF and have been in the power utilities industry in Texas for about a year now. I like my job but am beginning to feel complacent. There is a part of me that seeks more with a different career direction now that I am in the engineering workforce and am exploring my options for the future. I recently created a drone company that is slowly beginning to unfold and have been focusing more on that then work.  

The program I look to pursue is the Cockrell School’s Operations Research &amp; Industrial Engineering degree with a concentration on data analytics or optimization for Fall 2021. I have noticed the admission rates are discouragingly low as well as the admitted to enrolled yield, and have been curious to as why that is. I have graduated cum laude with varying internships and credentials, but still feel ill-equipped for admittance. 

Anybody that was in or still in the ORIE program, or even just the college of engineering, that could share some insight or advice for me, I would greatly appreciate it. 


A couple of general questions:

1. Anybody advise for or against this decision and why?

2. If my goal is to be more on the decision making and delegating side of the engineering industry, is this the correct path to pursue? If not, what alternative path would you recommend?

3. Should I have more work experience and/or search for other jobs prior to or instead of going to grad school and what would be the advantages/disadvantage?


In advance, I would like to thank everyone who takes the time to read and respond to this post. I have an immense amount of respect for those who seek to help others be the best the can be."

My first year was horrible so it’s currently really low, but after this semester it should be brought up to a 2.9 and hopefully above a 3.0 by the end of the year. Would internships for this summer still consider me if I don’t have a 3.0 yet but am on track for one?"
kb75d7,2,2020-12-11,Is an internship good for an undergraduate student?,typicalBACON,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/kb75d7/is_an_internship_good_for_an_undergraduate_student/,"So I (19M) have moved into the UK because I got accepted into an University where I'll be studying BSc(Hons) Computer Science.

I've been looking for jobs but I'd prefer a job in the computer/technology fields where I could get some experience and learn about these areas that I love so much.

I didn't find many internship jobs but the ones I found before were terrible because they were full time and everything. Obviously I don't have any experience so it's either an entry level job or an internship I believe, unless I'm wrong (I don't understand much about the job market).

I found this IBM Internship, the only issues is that it's 20minutes away from my house (by car), it requires python which I didn't have the chance to learn yet but I could learn it now, and it also requires some quantum computer coursework or projects which I don't have, I don't know much about quantum computer either, I've been more focused on normal computers which are the ones I have access to but I am interested in quantum computing and if I had the chance to learn about it, I wouldn't mind at all, and this is a part time job. Or should I just search for a different internship?"

Also, a letter from my school counselor who told me I am the only student he has worked with that has Harvard potential.

Harvard Supplement- My personal identity and development from a realist to a realistic optimist through my life experiences and love for serving my community. My teacher said it was a strong essay but I’d give it an 7.5/10

I have four people willing to write me a LOR. Three are professors, one is my former boss from an internship. There are only three slots for LORs for many applications. 

My boss and two of the three professors specifically said they would be happy to write me a strong LOR and seemed very enthusiastic to do it. The third professor said he was willing to write me one, but didn’t specifically say he was happy to do it, as the other three recommenders have. It was certainly less enthusiastic of a response. I assume this means it will not be as good. 

So, which one is the better option?"

I am currently a freshman CS major and am having difficulty understanding how what I’m learning (things like data structures and algorithms) apply to what would be expected of me when I get a SWE internship or job.

I can’t imagine that the job is just doing leet code style problems. I’m scared that once I get a SWE position, I won’t be able to do anything because I don’t know how to apply these skills.

I think it would really help if you guys could provide some examples of what software engineers do on a day to day basis and how the conceptual things learned in college are used to build applications."

I currently attend school at another UC but would like to try my chances at admissions to some of these schools. My GPA is a 3.8/4.0 and I have leadership positions in some CS clubs on campus along with 2 summers of internship experience at industry level labs. 

My main question is, does my lack of doing undergraduate research on campus hurt my application? If so, should I try and involve myself with research before I graduate? I think through my involvement on campus I should be able to obtain 3 LORs but I guess getting a LOR from a PI would be helpful.

I have a Masters in Computer Science and I am currently working as a software developer at a fairly reputed company. However, I have decided to go back to research (specifically, in areas at the intersection of deep learning and theoretical computer science) and have applied to PhD programmes in this admissions cycle (finished submitting my applications only a week back!). I have a decent CV, but I have applied very selectively so I can't be sure that I'll get an acceptance.

Irrespective of whether or not I get selected to a grad school, I would like to get started on my research. I have heard of students going for 6 month long internships at universities. However, I do not know how to apply or even start asking. Do universities have programmes for these long interns? Do I email professors directly? Are these funded programs? What are my chances? Being a developer who's looking to get back into research - will it be a concern?

I'm really in search for some guidance on this issue. LMK if there's any more information required. :)

I transferred to a different major in my senior year. It was well understood in my family that I would have to delay my graduation. 

So I just got the list of classes being offered for the spring and just found out that I got only 10/16 credits that I need to graduate. It was an obvious disappointment to me since I was given an indication that it could be offered but was not given a guarantee. 

So my parents started blasting me for my ""inaction"". My mom went as far as to say that I had sabotaged my own graduation and was comfortable with delaying my graduation. The conversation took a huge downturn when I told them that I intended to pursue internships that would take place during the fall (along with my classes) in order to make sure that I am not underutilizing my time.

My parents told me that I could not be professional in any internship since I could not communicate effectively with the Department Head and the Dean. Both of these individuals have replied to my emails and have made it clear that it would not be offered. I made my case as best I could. The emails made sound arguments that even they acknowledged.

After they left my room, I sat there stunned. For one hour, I didn't even know what to say. I didn't feel like moving. I didn't know what to do next. They came in to say good night and hugged me. That just increased my confusion.

I feel so guilt right now for increasing the financial burden on my parents. Their taunts related to my weight gain, looks, career and the fact that I am not in a relationship don't make things any easier. They keep saying that I need to ""catch up"". At this point, I have no idea who I'm playing catch up with. An ideal son? Relatives? Just about anyone who is more successful than I am? 

I just hope that my internship search amounts to something so that I might gain some financial independence. Anything to make it easier to deal with my parents."

However, I am struggling to find out my market value as the compensation ranges found online typically assume that you have a MSc in CS, not a PhD in math.

My prior experience is a 5 month internship at a software consulting agency and 5 months of C++-development as a student assistant at a renowned research institute. Additionally, I developed software as a hobby for the past 15 years and have a few side projects.

I am working with a head hunter who was able to get me some interviews, but told the companies that I would like a compensation between 95k CHF and 100k CHF per year (without asking me if I am OK with this range). Additionally, when asked how I should proceed if a company extended an offer, he told me it would be seen as greedy to negotiate if the offer was in the 95k-100k range.

I find this rather weird, as the consensus on compensation negotiation seems to be to never accept the first offer. Also, I am not sure if 95k-100k is the typical market value for a math PhD with about one year of experience.

Could you guys please tell me if what the head hunter says is correct? Or do you know of any resources for finding out salary ranges for math PhDs?"

I started my undergrad in biology to go to medical school. I'm no longer interested in working in medicine (basically because mentors in medicine have explained how burned out they are; I don't want to spend my life telling people to stop being fat, lazy, and stupid and then trying to fix whatever happened because they are anyway). So, I've been pursuing computational biology research. This is what I really enjoy, and I'm pretty good, so I could probably have a fair career in science. However, I would like to leave the biology side and break into tech, mostly out of interest and a desire to have a broader impact on people's lives.

I'm wondering how to go about this? I have quite a strong computational biology resume (good school, good GPA, several first/second author papers, developed an R package now available on Bioconductor on my own, etc.) and I'm very comfortable with R, Python, and shell scripting. However, I have no CS background beyond this, not many math courses, and no internships... I have a few elective spots in my fourth year, so I can take one year of ""introduction to programming/CS"" (in Python, since that's how my school starts) and one semester of linear algebra, in addition to the year of calculus and semester of statistics I have done right now.

My current plan is to stick to computational biology, get a PhD or Master's to prove my abilities a bit further (and because I do my enjoy my research, I just don't think I want it to be my life's work), then try to jump to maybe a data science job?

Any and all advice is appreciated!

Edit: I have searched and read the FAQs, but I'm hoping some of my experience gives me a bit of an advantage over the standard ""no degree"" or ""unrelated degree"" questions"
kbbecs,44,2020-12-11,How To Guide for Networking,sneakiesneakers,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/kbbecs/how_to_guide_for_networking/,"In an effort to bring more quality content to this sub, I'd like to share some lessons learned from both sides of the networking table. Hopefully this can help someone in the community!

I've outlined my process below, which was useful to me both as a prospective student and someone who pursued off-campus opportunities for full-time recruiting. Throughout my MBA journey, I've become a true believer in the power of networks, to the point where I will no longer apply for anything without having a connection first, both for the referral spotlight on my app as well as knowing what you're walking into before you get there. 

Happy to have a conversation around additional tips you all have discovered or points of disagreement with how I've done things so far. Would love the opportunity to tweak and refine my networking strategies as well.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Decide what you want to get out of the conversation. Common things include: 

* due diligence
   * What red flags can I dig up? Is the culture/opportunity something I would even want to accept if offered OR are my efforts better spent on another school/company?
* background research 
   * What is being here like? What tidbits can I learn to ask future interviewers about? What problems are they facing and would I enjoy tackling them? What support is there to help me learn and grow? etc. etc.
* advocacy 
   * In effect: I'm going to impress the socks off of you so you pull for me in the process!!

&amp;#x200B;

2. Identify the right person to get you what you need. 

* someone formerly at the institution 
   * red flags / due diligence - there's a higher barrier to them advocating against your candidacy in case the conversation goes poorly, but they can probably still connect you with someone in the company for further discussion
*  someone junior or right where you'd be starting out 
   * background research - they understand where you're coming from, have (relatively) more time to explain basic things about the institution, etc.
* someone more senior 
   * important for advocacy - the more senior, the better
   * this one's harder to do for b school apps, since there's not much of a hierarchy and people don't just give away adcom email addresses, but certainly applies to recruiting (internship or FT) 
* target 1st or 2nd connections (or non-LinkedIn equivalents) first
   * warm lead or email intro from someone else will always be more comfortable than a cold contact

&amp;#x200B;

3. Know before you go.

* Background on conversant's profile
   * know who they are and what they've done - good starting point for questions and you might find some shared point of relevance to make small talk about 
* Conversation flow
   * brainstorm all the questions you could possibly ask them, then put them in an order that could make sense in a natural conversation flow
   * write out your intro and how it will segue into the first question (the segue is key!!) - it's awkward to jump right in, but you also don't want to waste 5 minutes rambling before asking your first question 
   * be willing to go off script, but have your question list as a backup anytime the organic conversation dies down

&amp;#x200B;

4. Follow up with every excuse possible (within reason). Good reasons include: 

* Rejected - send an update to everyone from that institution whom you want to stay in touch with
* Successful at getting to the next round OR received an offer - send an update to everyone you know at the school/company so far, ask for another chat to either interview prep or help in your decision making
* Accept an offer - send an update to literally everyone who helped you in recruiting letting them know where you landed"

But my dad is harshly pushing me learn coding, data science, IT softwares etc., demanding a minimum of 1-3 hrs a day, almost no skipping days. He thinks this is almost necessary to land a job worth having, paying at least 50k. 

He thinks knowing this is the way to stand out in the applicant pool even if the job/field doesn’t need or use it. He thinks my current Excel knowledge is enough, but I have failed Excel tests in interviews that prevented my interview advancement.

I was feeling so dejected and like it was hopeless trying to get a job in this job market, and I was feeling pretty sure that I wouldn't get an offer from this company, but they gave me a verbal offer today and sent a formal offer a few hours later. It's just an internship for now, but it pays pretty well and they have a strong track record of hiring on interns for full salaried positions (and they explicitly mentioned this during the interview process as well). It's fully remote but their office is in the city near me for when restrictions ease up. It really couldn't have worked out better.

I'm feeling really relieved, but also fortunate that I was able to find employment during the pandemic. I know this is a difficult time for everyone, but specifically to recent grads, I want to say to not give up. Consider going for an internship if you can't get a full salaried position right off the bat. Networking helps, but don't be afraid to apply for companies you have no connections to - that's what I did here, and I almost didn't even bother applying because I thought I wasn't qualified.

I've accidentally pigeonholed myself into a SharePoint/PowerApps project that is not engaging or fun, especially because I can't put my programming skills to use or grow them. I've reached out to my manager and a senior engineer in my team about taking on additional programming work (SharePoint project is a long term project) but they've deflected or ignored my ask. It feels like they relegated me to this SharePoint thing because they don't have anything I can do or they don't feel comfortable handing to me. I'm not lazy and I will finish this SharePoint project, but I feel like I'm missing out on the opportunity to learn real industry programming practices. 

I want your thoughts on some of these other approaches to learning those programming practices:

- ask to shadow my manager, another engineer, or both.
- ask about internal learning resources I can take advantage of to learn in my own time.
- bunker down and push out this SharePoint project faster (likely to take weeks or months) in hopes of being reassigned to more relevant work.
- wait a bit then express my interest again to my teammates (maybe poor timing?)
- ask for work from other teams (my team works closely with 3 other teams, I'm afraid asking one of those other teams might come off as annoying or going over/around my manager)
- rotate out (my internship lets me rotate halfway through the 9 months, problem is that I think my best chance of being hired full time is by building a good relationship with my manager and proving my value, but if I switch I'll have to start over on my 2ish month progress so far)

I say this because the rat race for prestige/clout doesn’t end with college admissions. You want to work in finance? Goldman, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley. Tech? FAANG. And once you get your job, there are levels— analysts, associates, VPs, MDs, etc. 

My parents always told me some equivalent of ‘work hard now so you can enjoy life later’, but the more I think about it, I feel like our whole lives until maybe retirement age will be the same grind that we’re on now. We grind in high school— gpa, test scores, ECs, essays, etc— to get into a good college. We’ll grind in college— gpa, internships, ECs, and maybe test scores— to get a good job or get admission to a good med/law/grad/whatever school. If you’re in one of those fields, rinse and repeat. If not, you’ll go into a career where you grind to get a promotion and/or bonus. 

And for 40-50 years most likely from now on, that’s what our lives will be like. If some of y’all have genuine passion for a field, it probably won’t be like this, but for the rest of us it feels like the same stressful grind we’re on will repeat again and again. Instead of homework assignments, it’ll be stuff for your boss. 

I feel like the best days of our lives were definitely our childhood— freedom, boundless energy, too young to stress about stuff. And like ofc when we’re kids nobody will tell us ‘hey in 10 years you’re going to be stressed af and working all the time’.

kbidxl,3,2020-12-11,College billed me for health insurance but sent it to the wrong email address,onearmeric2017,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/kbidxl/college_billed_me_for_health_insurance_but_sent/,"Hi all! I have had a very frustrating 24 hours and although this may end up just being a crappy situation rather than something I can actually do anything about I figured its worth getting off my chest.

Some background first: I am currently a third-year PhD student at a college in the United States. I am studying biomedical engineering, and I am supported by the university financially so I have both student and faculty standing. What is nice about that is I can park in faculty lots which are closer to my building and not as congested so win-win. However, I was getting ticketed the first few weeks and found out the university erroneously assigned me the status of a ""health sciences"" student (which is for like med and dental students, and have different requirements/status like dealing with personal health information electronically and what not) which I am not, the confusion probably being that my department sounds similar to that but is actually part of the school of engineering. This issue gets corrected and all is fine... or so I thought.

One annoying thing at my school, since I am getting paid the school provides their own health insurance, and they AUTO enroll you unless you opt our by filling out a waiver every semester. I am on my parents health insurance still since I am not 26 yet so I did not need it. The insurance office at the school emails reminders each semester to fill out the waiver, so no big deal I see the reminder then fill out the waiver and I don't need to pay for the insurance, all is fine...

Last fall, I am updating my resume and realize my school email doesn't look super professional (like firstinitiallastinital123@schooldomainname.edu), and my school gives me the option to personalize my primary email address and I can make it more clean (something more like firstname.lastname@school.edu) so I do this and now I can put that when I look for internships, networking, etc.

Fast forward to now and I am registering for classes in the Spring 2021 semester and I go online and its giving me an error message saying I have an outstanding balance on my term bill and must pay it before I can register for a new semester. I was really confused, because I was not supposed to have charges on my bill since I was getting tuition remission plus a stipend. I look back and the charge comes from the Spring 2020 semester, and it was for HEALTH INSURANCE which I was never even aware I was enrolled in! Putting the pieces together I realize I never completed the waiver for the Spring 2020 semester so it auto enrolled me, and I must have been charged for that semester. That part was completely on me, that was clear from the previous times to do it and I must have just forgotten.

But it strikes me as very odd, since I literally had no knowledge of it this entire time. Like no email reminding me that the waiver period was coming up, no email once the enrollment actually started, nothing about getting an insurance card, absolutely nothing! Not even a letter in the mail or anything!

After a lot of digging I found out why. So when I changed the domain name for my email address to look more professional last fall (back in the fourth paragraph, wow this is getting long), somehow it changed my official email address for the university to an email affiliated with the HEALTH SCIENCES school (from the second paragraph!) which I never had access to and I shouldn't even have because I am not associated with the health sciences department at the school! I contact the email help office at the school and gain access to this wrong email address. I search the emails and sure enough there they all are. I did not see a reminder to waive the insurance, but there's emails regarding becoming enrolled and also about obtaining the health insurance card and setting up an account (it also said in the email my insurance card would not be mailed to me and via this email was the only way to access it, which I guess it legal but its legit sketchy imo).

So now I owe not a small amount of money on health insurance that I was never aware of because the school has this email address for me that never should have existed and was also something I was never aware of until recently, which I only found out about from my own investigative actions. The email address must have been set up when I first started but it was never opened by me until now.

I am just really lost, I contacted the insurance office trying to explain the situation and they just reiterated without really listening to me that the waiver appeal deadline was in April and they already paid for the insurance so there's nothing that can be done. But I'm like uhmmmmmm, idk, like yes I did not fill out the waiver but also the school was wrong because they gave me an email address for a department I am not in which this information was sent to! Can I really be charged with health insurance when they failed to properly inform me and provide the actual insurance information to me?? So idk, I really don't think there is anything that can be done but its just really shitty I have to pay for this insurance when the entire time I actually had the coverage for it I did not have the faintest idea it was even there.

I think the only avenue I would have is trying to hold the office accountable for setting up this wrong email address, but there's no way I can get there solely from talking with anyone at the university since they're not going to want to eat back any of this money. I feel like f\*ing pepe silvia here trying to put all the pieces of this together to find the exact point and cause for this issue, so I appreciate anyone who actually read this to the end. Thank you!

So, any suggestions? Do I have any claim for not paying this bill? Would it be worth the effort to contact someone with legal expertise on this?

TL;DR. College is forcing me to pay health insurance which they sent to an email address they set up on accident because they thought I was in the medical school, and I never knew about or used or even opened the information on it.

Note: I had been aware there was an outstanding balance on my bill. However, anytime they sent something notifying me of that they ended the email saying if I was expecting tuition remission to just disregard it as it would be taken care of, and I was expecting that so I did not do anything about it until now."

4) Founded and became president of the Entrepreneurship and Finance Club of our school. Grew to 35 people.

&amp;#x200B;

5) Founded and became president of the Microfinance club at school. Grew to 62 people. Apart from discussions on microfinance, we allowed underprivileged girls to make their own products, sold them, used that money to fund more of their products, sold them, which created a continuous source of income for them.

Launched an offshoot of the microfinance club that focuses on employment generation during COVID, since several financially underserved people have been rendered unemployed. We sold the products mentioned above, fundraised, and used that money to conduct workshops by professionals in areas like hairdressing, stitching, computers, etc. to make them employable/self-employed.

&amp;#x200B;

6) Founded a monthly newsletter that reaches 450 people monthly across India. I am the co-founder and editor-in-chief along with a core team of 7 people. We have 52 people in the team overall. Since its beginning, we have expanded and also made our website a platform where our students can convey their thoughts and pieces of writing.

&amp;#x200B;

Got a great letter of recommendation from them too!

&amp;#x200B;

8) Published a research paper in a journal that has an impact factor of 5.87. It accounts for inflation and estimates India's GDP in the present, calculating what India's GDP would have been without the British Raj.

&amp;#x200B;

12) Interned with the finance department of a startup that is an aggregator of home-chefs. I worked to devise a strategy on how the startup can offer discounts without affecting its commission. I also recommended how their capital should be allocated, successfully helping them to launch in my city.

&amp;#x200B;


13) Research intern under a professor from the University of Glasgow for an economics research project.

&amp;#x200B;

14) Part of the committee at school that connects students to alumni of our schools. Interviewed, taught resume writing, etc., and connected each participant to an alumnus/alumna of our school. Spent quite a lot of time on this. I also designed a research portal and conducted research workshops where students in our school can showcase their research. This committee has greatly expanded as well.


&amp;#x200B;

I also changed the club recruitment process of our school. Earlier, it was difficult for underclassmen to find and enroll in clubs but I changed that and now participation in school clubs has increased dramatically, which also lead to an increase in the number of clubs. Over 1000 people have joined the new clubs due to this, fortunately starting the club culture at our school that never existed before.

I have been accepted into both and plan to be a communications/broadcast journalism major. Temple has a great program and i was confident they could help me get a good internship/job. However a lot of people from my school go there and is close to my house. I want this to kind of be the start of my new life and get away from the kids ive been with the past 12 years. York also has a great program and is further away without a lot of people from my school. But idk if I can get the best internship with them and I don’t know what kind of effect it will have going to a less known college and probably not as strong a college in the communications world. But I really like York. How do I make this decision and know I wont have buyers remorse the first year I go there?

For context I'm currently a sophomore studying CS. My interests lie in software engineering and data science + ML, which are two kind of distinct areas in this field. My long term career goals is to work more on the ML side of things, and I do regularly participate in campus activities like clubs and research that relate to my interests in that field. I'm also planning to pursue a master's in DS or ML, one of the reasons being I've rarely ever seen a decent job posting for such a position that didn't require at least a master's. However, I've only ever done SWE internships; my work experience is 100% SWE, not even an iota of working with any sort of data analysis. So I'm kind of worried now because after summer 2021 I'll have had three SWE internships and I might forever be labeled in both recruiters' eyes and grad school admission offices' eyes as a SWE person. (And in case you are wondering why I keep doing SWE if I'm so worried about this... I literally always get rejected for other types of positions and I felt it was better to have any internship than none at all.)

I guess my questions are: will I have a decent chance of grad school admission into a DS/ML track if all my work experience is SWE but extracurricular experience is DS/ML? And will future companies still look at my SWE experience and prioritize/overshadow that over my other experience?

I just feel like I'm kind of stuck in a cycle because it really do be hard to break into the DS/ML field, and due to that I've just been staying in SWE, making it even harder for me to break into the other, etc... Any advice would be so greatly appreciated! Thank you all &lt;3"

kboy1w,1,2020-12-12,my therapist is abandoning me and now I want to kill myself,hysterical_salami,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kboy1w/my_therapist_is_abandoning_me_and_now_i_want_to/,"2 days ago we had a session and I told her about my suicide ideation and then some hours later she texted my mom to tell her I was in danger. My mom doesn't understand mental illness so she freaked out and started screaming things like killing herself with me and killing our dogs too. It was a nightmare...
in that text my therapist told my mom she won't see me anymore and that she would just help us to get help in the public health services. But I did an internship in these services and I know a lot of people who can't pay for a mental health treatment and have to use the public system. And they all said what I already knew: it's not worth it, they won't give me the help I need and there's a big chance that I'll get even worse.

After all that my mom was screaming with me I had a panic attack and started swearing and saying a lot of bad things to my therapist and I regret it a lot because later she told me I was attacking her and making her feel bad. That wasn't my intention, I was just feeling really bad and ended up doing things I didn't want to.

But I don't want another therapist, I like her a lot and I was getting so comfortable with her... Now I feel like I'm being punished for being sick, I'm being punished for being too honest with her about my feelings.

now she doesn't answer my texts and I just want to die. I don't have energy to look to another therapist and I don't even want to do it. I want her...

I called her today. I heard her voice but then I felt bad and hung up. She didn't know who was calling so she probably deleted my number already. She moved on...

I want to die. My mom said that if I killed myself she would kill herself too and kill our dogs. I feel guilty for that and I love my mom and our dogs but I'm too depressed to care about anything

I am currently an analyst working at a local investment advisory firm in Pakistan. I am looking to move to the UK (I am a British citizen ) and switch to software development . I have thought of three possible  entry routes:

* Enroll in a part-time online conversion MSc for computer science in the UK(York or Bath are my best options). It will take me around two years to complete either of these programs but as they are part-time, I can start looking for internships or an entry-level role while working for my current employer. I won't incur any additional living expenses and both degrees are under 13k GBP.
* Enroll in a full-time conversion MSc in the UK (possibly at Birmingham). It will take me one year to complete my MSc and hopefully I will have  landed a role by graduation. These programs usually start in autumn (next intake is in September 2021). This is the most expensive option (25k GBP tuition plus 8k GBP living expenses).  I have heard people who have completed these programs usually have no trouble finding employment but I am not sure about how the pandemic has affected the job market for the tech sector.
* Move to the UK in the latter part of next year and start looking for opportunities immediately. Breaking into the tech industry without the name of a top uni on my CV will be difficult but it's doable. However, many companies will filter out my application because I do not have a STEM degree.

I understand that skills are far more important for breaking into software engineering so I will continue completing online courses and working on side projects in my free time.

Can anyone here be kind enough to advise me on my options?"

kbstji,3,2020-12-12,Recommended entry level JS framework to study before angular?,amyu98,Frontend,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frontend/comments/kbstji/recommended_entry_level_js_framework_to_study/,"Hey,
My company has an intern program, where we teach new programmers some basic Web developing for a few months, then they join a team.

So far we've let them study ASP as the entry level framework, before moving to Angular &amp; .Net core.

Since we no longer support ASP, we are looking for a framework to replace the front end training before they move to angular.

I was thinking of letting them write plain HTML 
&amp; JS &amp; CSS, but I wanted to hear from you if you can think of an interesting alternative. Even a very vanillaish one. 

It cannot be react / Vue since it should fit people with 0 background knowledge. We don't want to make it too complicate.


Thank you"

I’m wondering if y’all can help me with some insight on what to do, career-wise. I’m not really sure how to move forward—I graduated with an accounting degree, and unfortunately, had no internship. It’s been hard to find a job related to that, because despite my degree, I have done “jobs”—not any career position—all based in digital and tech.

I’ve managed Office 365 accounts. I’ve migrated web server email accounts to O365, I’ve done DNS troubleshooting on web servers, I’ve managed ad accounts in Facebook and Google Ads, I’ve run social media for some smaller orgs, I’ve done reporting in Google Analytics and Data Studio, I’ve been essentially a “help desk” for email and domain problems for a client of mine, I’ve done web design with Divi, client-facing work, and a whole gambit of other things. 

I really need a career instead of these one-off jobs, and I’m not really sure how to spin this into an IT position right now, and absolutely no clue how I would even make it work with a finance position, what my degree was in. 

I guess I’m not really sure how to pick up these scraps I guess, and turn it into something. I just want to get on a “path,” and I’m not sure how to make that happen with this “Jack of all trades, master of none,” list of experience I have.

Has anyone been in a similar situation that was able to make this sort of change? Or anyone that simply had suggestions?"

For ex- if there is an executive position job, requiring a top school MBA- does it make a difference if it is done through PT or FT?

kbzxw0,5,2020-12-12,Should I go back to school for my dream career of Interior Design at 31F? After graduating from another Interior Design program that led me astray?,geniebythesea,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/kbzxw0/should_i_go_back_to_school_for_my_dream_career_of/,"I hope this is the proper sub for this type of question. I want to give a warning that this is a long wall of text but I am desperate for help and appreciate anyone who reads it. I want to offer a little back story:

After high school, I went straight to University without much thought of what I wanted to do with my life. I loved University, I fell in love in my campus and this new city I was in (Guelph, if anyone cares to know). I took Sociology, I learned a lot, but also not much in terms of how I wanted to proceed career-wise. After University I moved back to Toronto, and got a job working in a restaurant, while I figured out my next step (I knew I didn't want to pursue a career in Sociology). A year or so later, I finally settled on going back to school for Interior Design. I applied to a local college for a program which I thought suited my needs- I wanted to become and Interior Designer. I was so excited. I put the deposits down, made my payments, and went to school again. I kept my job at the restaurant though, and I balanced both full time work and full time school, doing what I thought was best for my future. I was really putting in the effort that I thought would help me land my dream job in a few years. 

Here's my BIG mistake: I had unknowingly (naively) signed up for Interior Design Technology, not Interior Design, they are different things (I really didn't know that they were at the time). I didn't learn this fact until Year 2 (since Year 1 for my program was just Architecture, we didn't learn too much about Interior Design, and nothing was said about the Interior Design portion of the program). At this point I was one year in, and had made payments for Year 2 (of a 3 year program). I felt stuck and that I was led a bit astray. The professors made it seem that the program was basically Interior Design. We learned everything that a normal Interior Design program would offer. The professors were trying to get our program accredited with the Interior Designers board, but since it wasn't, our Advanced Diploma (what I eventually graduated with) was basically garbage. When I graduated, I was still hopeful. Some of my friends and classmates got jobs, so I stayed optimistic. I kept applying, I redid my portfolio three separate times, I continued working at the restaurant in the evenings in a management role, and worked on my own projects on AutoCAD, or REVIT at home during the day, so I could continue my practice while looking for a proper job in my field.

 I was finally contacted by a not- for-profit organization who was looking for someone to redesign their Community Centre- for free. I took the job because I felt it would eventually lead to better things for myself (it hasn't yet). This not-for-profit project was completed in March of 2020, right as we were heading into a lockdown here in Toronto. Since then it has been non-stop work, morning, afternoon, and night looking for a relevant job in my field. I have been tweaking my resume, redoing my portfolio, typing up a hundred cover letters, buying programs I can't afford to redo my portfolio, working on hobbies and projects which I feel would be beneficial to me landing work (sketching, painting, concept work, floor plans, renders). I'm just desperate. I have had interviews here and there, I've broadened my search for work to include high-end furniture stores, and anything else really that can relate to my desired field in the Interior Design industry, but I still can't seem to land anything. I've been hired by three separate places to do projects for free (where they are basically calling the work an internships and they just use me for my REVIT knowledge and REVIT program). I feel like I just can't seem to catch a break.

Here's my question to you: Should I go back to school for a proper Interior Design Degree, at an accredited school? Should I just suck it up for three more years, get a student loan, and do the same thing all over again at 31, where I know I'll be able to land a job, or do I just let my dream go, be more realistic, and try and find something else somehow.

Something important to note: I recently applied to an accredited University for a January start, but they were offering an online Interior Design program which wouldn't be covered by a government student loan. They also offer an on campus program, which I wasn't considering at the time due to COVID. Since I have a diploma from a similar program, I would be able to be exempt for a few courses, reducing the program from 4 years to 3. This would be the school that I would apply to again.

Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks again for taking the time to read this."
kc19du,6,2020-12-12,George Mason or James Madison?,lizakugs,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/kc19du/george_mason_or_james_madison/,"Both schools are great with my major (marketing), and George Mason is close to home. They are both great schools... but here’s why I cant decide between them:

James Madison
• Kinda in the middle of nowhere
• great party scene tho
• great marketing and business program
• very pretty campus 
• business school is... kinda like a prison inside tbh
• business school is far from everything, i would be living near there so i would have to walk a lot

George Mason
• close to home
• in a rly cute town lots of restaurants
• lots of connections with my minor (poli sci)
• the buildings are nice, the inside of them is     gorgeous and so nice and clean 
• food robots!
• not a great party scene :/ i love socializing 
• business school is gorgeous inside
• redoing a lot of buildings, great food options

They both have similar salaries, George Masons is actually a bit higher. I would also have more internship opportunities at george mason because of my connections in DC. 

As you can see, there are definite things that could make me flip flop between schools. I have visited both of them, and I liked both of them a lot. I would be close to my family even though i would live on campus. The schools in my mind are equal and I cannot decide. 

I want you guys to tell me what you would pick, I won’t base my decision off your choice completely but maybe you will put some things into perspective for me!"

When I hear my friends getting interviews and/or passing the interviews that I failed and getting the internship, I’m really happy that they got it but at the same time I can’t feel genuinely happy for them and it really sucks.

It feels like I’m reminded that they are better than me and I try to tell myself that maybe they got a bit luckier than me as an act of self-defense when in reality I know they worked harder and deserved it more than me. 

I’m doing my best to “work harder” as well and get those internships but I feel like such a shit person cus these are my close friends and I want to just be happy for them for their success but I can’t.

Can anyone help or have tips at how I can improve this mentality? I realize that it’s largely a personal thing that stems from my technical incompetence and insecurities but idk how to get rid of it, also it’s not like I’m not getting any interviews/offers, but I guess u can say my companies are slightly “worse” than theirs

Edit: thanks for all the advice everyone, I’d greatly appreciate it if any others have some thoughts about this ~ perhaps u feel the same or dont and just lmk ur opinion on the matter"

I want to gift a family member (26M) a gift that will encourage him. He’s been stuck in a rut, has anxiety, and had mild depression in the past. 

He’s always been a perfectionist growing up, always needed to be the best in the class and get in the top colleges. These high expectations have also resulted in him avoiding taking risks - he’s never had an internship or a full time job because he’s really scared of failing. 

What is a gift that will encourage him to take chances and build self-confidence? He’s more of a tech guy, but any recommendation is appreciated."

Hello peeps!

Just completed my first semester of college. Surprisingly, I ended with a 3.675 GPA and made the deans list. I am now looking to get into internships to develop gain some work experience, and developed my skills with programming. I honestly do not know where to begin with interning, and I can't ask my faculty for advice because they are on break as well. In addition, I only have a some experience with programming in Python from the assignments, tests, and labs we have done over this semester. So, knowing this, I already posted my questions in [/rcscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions), but I'd lime to post them here too in hopes to hear from you that have been through this process before. There's 3 questions I would like to ask.

1.) Is it too early to begin looking for internships?

2.) How much experience do I need to be considered for an internship?

3.) Where could I begin looking for internships, and what all do I need to get started working in the field of computer science as an intern?

Any advice would be much appreciated! Much thanks!

kc6oac,4,2020-12-13,How to make the most of opportunities that are given to you?,essyooenn,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/kc6oac/how_to_make_the_most_of_opportunities_that_are/,"Hey Reddit. 

I was talking to a close, ambitious friend today and it struck me that I haven’t made a lot of progress in terms of academic/career development. 

Usually, people get an entry level position (internship, research, etc) and then work their way up from those opportunities to better positions. I feel like I haven’t?

For most of my life, I’ve felt like I’ve gotten good experiences that I just... don’t do anything with. I’ve held internships and research positions, but I’ve never branched off of those opportunities to accomplish something more. I don’t really have “longitudinal” experience. It feels like I wasted a lot of potential, because I was handed so many good things and I didn’t make the most of them. 

This lack of upward progress happens in my everyday life too. For example, I meet someone -  but I don’t take the steps to deepen the friendship. I go to class - but I don’t take the steps to get to know my professors. I have hobbies - but I’ve never done any big projects that really showcase all the effort I put into those hobbies. 

Maybe the answer is literally as simple as “just try something”, but the issue that I run into is that I get overwhelmed easily and I don’t want to seem like I’m forcing anything. I know I shouldn’t be faking passion or enthusiasm. But if I only choose to pursue things that I’m 100% interested in... honestly, I probably wouldn’t be doing anything. That mindset is really fucked up, but nothing in life has really made me go, “wow, I definitely want to follow-up with this and see where it goes.”

I don’t know. Maybe I’m ungrateful. Maybe I’m in the complete wrong field. Maybe I have a fixed mindset. Maybe I’m too critical and I self-sabotage. Maybe my fundamental needs aren’t being met and so I can’t focus on self-development. Maybe I’m looking at it wrong. The issue is I just have no idea why I’m not interested in continuing with anything I do. 

Any insight to how to get over this weird mental block and start making some progress would be really appreciated."

I am most likely going to graduate with a grade between 13 and 14. Worst case scenario a tad bit less.

I have not done any side projects or internship during my time at uni. I did however do my thesis for a small local company.

I aim to become an AI expert or at least work in data. 

I lay this background so that you can have better insights to answer my question.

I don't really know what to do next. I am told that pursuing a 1 or 2 year extra degree in business or management at a good school like INSEAD or Vlerick Business school can really open doors a bit further down the road. However I can only start this in September if I am accepted, which would leave me with a 6 months gap between graduation and my new studies. I could maybe use that time to try to do an internship, but it seems like companies are not interested in taking care of newbies rn. 

However I am not entirely sure how important and decisive that extra diploma would be for a career. 

The other option would be to start working rather soon. But I am told that even for young SWE the market isn't easy right now, so maybe it is not the best time. 

But at the same time if I wait I guess the market will be overflowed with the students graduating next year's in addition to the ones that couldn't find anything this year. 

I am a bit lost as to what the reality of the field is and what my best bet should be. I am not sure what the most important thing is between getting more experience through personal projects, or an internship, or getting an additional degree or trying to enter the market at a more appropriate time. 

Has any of you some advices I could use? 

Thank you :)"

Once the pandemic hit, I was lucky to land a six month contract job. Once the contract ended, I took an internship for a few months and then landed a full time job. 

I’ve been at my new job for three months and I find the workload overwhelming and much more fast paced than I expected. I’m 49 and honestly do not have the energy to move at this pace. I find each day I’m completely depleted, my house is a mess, I’m neglecting my family because I have to work off hours to keep up. By Thursday I feel like I can’t function and by Saturday I’m nothing but a slug, which is not like me. I normally am an early riser and head out for various outdoor activities.

I had a physical just to make sure this isn’t a health related issue. Everything came back normal. I have excellent time management skills and amazing work ethic.

The sad thing is while I don’t love this particular position, I spent a few years working towards breaking into this field. I’m considering staying in this field, but in another organization like higher education. I know it would be a big pay cut, but I also know it would afford me more time off and a more manageable work load. So, I’m looking and hoping I can make a leap.

My career has been pretty stable since college. I haven’t had any missteps or been flaky at any job. All of my previous supervisors were happy with my work. I’m thinking maybe the work is fine for me, but maybe not at this current organization. 

I’ve had other jobs, but I’ve never left a job after just a few months. I have to think my age factors into this. I just don’t have the energy now like I did at 30, and I’d really not like to have high stress as I inch closer to retirement. My family is so important to me. I’ve never had a job that consumed me as much as this one.

My main goal is to just have some experience on my resume with the part time internship. Is this a bad idea? Are there any laws being broken? 

I don’t mind not ending up working for them full time, but if I get the chance, how likely would I be able to get a workers permit? So far I’m reading those are pretty hard to get."

I still love the subject of CS, but I really did not like going to school for it.




First of all, I expected going to school to be a fantastic networking experience, but I never expected CS students to be so competitive and non-collaborative.  The worst example was the competition for grades.  I personally never cared about grades, as long as I passed and learned from the class.  For that reason, it was hard making friends in class.




Getting into clubs was also hard as they required interviews, and positions in the clubs seemed reserved for students who had family connections in the tech industry or who somehow obtained freshman and sophomore summer internships.  I feel like I really missed out meeting big companies who came to campus through those clubs because I never got into a club.




I ended up getting lucky and getting a single internship during my time in school that lead to a full time offer.  But I feel like I never made a single professional connection through college.  All of my connections in the tech industry are through my current job.



Because of all this competition, I decided not to pursue a PhD, even though it was my previous career goal.  Did I just attend a bad university, or is this experience normal in CS?"

I am a software engineer in the midwest who has been working with a government contracting company as a SWE for almost 5 years now. Coming this spring, if I add my internship experience and miscellaneous experience, I come out to ~6 yoe. In my experience at this company, I have spent 3-4 years writing Java, maybe 1-2 years of Bash/Shell/Python scripting, and 3 months of Django experience for an internal tool. Outside of this, I've been taking leadership roles, System Engineering, and Lab Monkey roles to name a few, mostly in interest to chase after promotions.

I am feeling a motivation to look for a new job, namely due to the carrot-on-a-stick scheme that my company uses for promotions has me pretty frustrated and lacking in salary growth. Additionally, working for government contractors makes me feel like I am falling behind in technology, due to being so caught up in being absorbed in so much company-specific process and red tape. It feels like all I am learning is skills to progress me into this specific company, not actual tangible software engineer skills. It ultimately makes me feel like my career is not being respected and I am lacking tangible lessons and skill building.

Is this a normal feeling for a mid-level? I am flirting with the idea of looking for a new job. Are these valid reasons for looking for a new job? After looking around this sub, it looks like I would need to catch up quite a bit - leetcode, studying, and grinding. Is this really a necessary activity to get into ANY software company? Or just FAANG?

For some context, to get my previous jobs, all I did was have a good GPA at an average school (BS in CEE) and show up to the interview. I never studied or had outside projects, yet here I am, still holding a job. I don't even have a Github. Is this an actual wakeup call that I need, or am I over-reacting here, and should I just brush up my resume and start applying now? I also wouldn't be against grinding and going for a remote FAANG job, especially considering we all have extra time on our hands with the pandemic going on right now. But is that even realistic given my background?

Thanks in advance for any advice that may come my way from this post! :)"

Without revealing too much about myself, I'll say a couple things: I obsessively watched this subreddit when I was applying to college (I'm a sophomore at the moment, so this was 2018/2019). I had objectively awesome stats (1580 SAT, 4.5ish gpa) and pretty good ECs, but I ended up choosing my state school, as I received a stupidly good scholarship. My state school isn't particularly good for CS (it's like top 100 I think?) but it's R1, so the professors are fantastic.

At my state school, I've been able to immerse myself fully in my studies without worrying about paying for college/rent (this has helped me in ways I cannot truly express). In my brief 1.5 years at this college, I've managed to pursue both a BS in CS and a BA in an unrelated field I just happen to be passionate about. I've conducted original research with an awesome professor, and built a really good mentoring relationship with her as well. I even scored an internship offer at a Fortune 50 company, and have an upcoming final round interview at a FAANG+ company. In addition, I've made the best friends of my life so far, I've changed immensely for the better, and I've met someone who makes me believe in soulmates.

If you had said all of this to me in spring 2019, when I thought my life was over because I didn't get into Stanford/MIT/Berkeley/CMU, I wouldn't have believed you. If you're in this situation, believe me, things will be better than you ever thought. In life (but especially in CS), the university you attend is far less important than the things you accomplish there. If you go to a less prestigious university, still work your ass off and do the best you can. There's a lot to be said about being a big fish in a small pond, you can really stand out.

TL:DR: in CS, the actual work/projects you do are much more important than the prestige of your university."

kcmw1p,8,2020-12-13,"Looking for input on the career path I've mapped to move from desktop support to cloud - best next step (net+, sec+)? Best learning platforms / courses? etc.",ShaolinShade,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/kcmw1p/looking_for_input_on_the_career_path_ive_mapped/,"(Apologies in advance for the wall of text, there's a lot to cover here - hard to provide a TLDR but you can scan the background paragraphs and skip to the numerical steps for the career path plan to that end)

So after a lot of research and a few posts on here, I think I finally have a solid plan for how to get myself from where I am (help desk) to where I want to be (cloud / CSA), thanks for the input you guys have provided along the way. Hopefully this will help inform some of you who are starting into figuring this out, and hopefully some of you who have experience moving through similar paths can offer advice if there's any mistakes or better ideas for the plan I've laid out here.

Currently, I have 7 years of desktop support experience - all your typical hardware (troubleshooting, imaging, repair) and software support (primarily Windows with some iOS and android), some light networking and server / admin type work, printers etc. I started at an internship I got in Houston after accumulating 80 credit hours towards a BS in IT. I never returned to school to finish that degree, at first due to financial reasons (I almost went homeless while at college, the internship honestly saved my neck, didn't want to return until I was confident I could comfortably support it financially), but later due to questioning whether it was worth going back after accumulating the experience. I'm a higher tier desktop support agent working from home for an internal call center help desk at the moment, but have no certifications yet, as I've been struggling to figure out how I want to move forward from here for a while now.

My immediate focus is to move up to a better paying position, remote if possible (my current job has us WFH but they're going to bring us back to the office when the pandemic ends, and I have a needy pet now who I don't want to start leaving alone 5/7 days a week), with benefits since my current position lacks them. I live in a low income apartment complex that I want to get out of as quickly as possible as well for safety and health concerns. I've had a few promising remote positions come my way during my job searching over the past half year or so, but haven't landed any of them unfortunately. I suspect the lack of certs and degree have been hurting my resume, and the job market is worse now than I've ever seen it, so I think my focus for the moment should be on getting certs to position myself to move up.

Here is the plan I've mapped out for what to do next to that end, and eventually moving into cloud work:

1) Get my Network+, then my Security+ (sec+ is easier, but I'll get more out of it learning the net+ fundamentals first, more likely to understand the concepts in context, and they'll do more for my resume together)

1.1) Search for a better position, likely still doing support but possibly low level networking, security or administration stuff if I'm lucky, while studying for the above and afterwards

2) Get my Linux+, start spinning up home labs, playing with linux administration, networking etc

2.1) Start learning JS / Python, build my app project (I have an idea for an app related to a passion of mine I've been wanting to develop, JS with cordova or react native seems like the best fit) and other portfolio projects I can use to demonstrate my coding capabilities

2.2) Move up into an admin position, Linux most likely (maybe low level dev / engineering in place or in addition to that, depending on how far I've gotten with the coding), continue to make portfolio projects I can use to demonstrate my coding capabilities

&lt;I live in Texas but want to move to Seattle, I'm guessing I'll be positioned well enough to land a good-enough paying position remotely to afford the move sometime around the beginning of step 3 or 4&gt;

3) Start down the AWS cert path, get my practitioner and solutions architect certs

3.1) Learn anything else needed for Cloud architecture (platforms like Docker, Terraform, maybe Kubernetes, SQL etc.)

3.2) Build cloud projects using the above to demonstrate my capabilities there

3.3) Maybe also get Azure or GCP certified and learn powershell depending on trends and position demands (or maybe go for one of these as my first instead of AWS if the market has shifted AWS out of the top spot by then)

4) Move into a lower level CSA type role

4.1) Gain higher level (or perhaps lateral, like DevOps etc) cloud certs, build experience and portfolio further

5) Move into higher level CSA roles (positions that best enable me to work on my own terms hopefully - remote, not too demanding so I have time to work towards other goals hopefully)

5.1) Shift focus from climbing the career ladder to building passive income, (solely, as I probably will have already started doing this earlier on the side), hopefully position myself to be able to spend more time working on my own projects and passions, maybe start working independently or start a business etc.

I think I can realistically get my net+ and sec+ in 4-5 months, studying around 10-12 hours a week or so (maybe faster), which should position me to move up to a better position before the pandemic is over and my current job makes us return to the office.

What learning courses / platforms would you recommend? I'm not afraid to pay a little bit for quality training, but I've heard Professor Messor recommended a lot here and from what I can tell his resources might be sufficient, at least for the CompTIA certs. But my top priority is learning the material as effectively and efficiently as possible, so labs, communities etc. will all help towards that end - don't want to just watch video courses that info dump without applying what I'm learning and forgetting it. Open to whatever is best for overall, whether Messor, Udemy, Lynda / Linkedin learning, Pluralsight, CBT nuggets, Cybrary etc. Also going to need resources for the coding side of things, but that can wait for a later post I think since I won't be focusing on that until later.

From what I can tell, Linux and coding is the best stepping stone I have between the support level and cloud, not only for AWS but also on the Microsoft side as it looks like Microsoft (Azure, etc) have been using it more and more lately. Using Microsoft focused certification and administration doesn't seem as effective for that step anymore, as evidenced by how Microsoft is retiring the MCSA now.

I think I'm leaning towards not returning to school, although that could change if I find I'm having a hard time moving from one step to the next. But from what I can tell I think I can get myself there without it, and save money in the process, doing it at my own pace - employers care about what you know, and your ability to demonstrate it (experience, certs, portfolio etc. all accomplish this). Just have to make studying a significant part of my day to day routine, and find good online learning resources and communities.

Thanks in advance for any advice or input!"

To give some quick summaries about myself

I have about 3 semesters left till I graduate and get my bachelor in computer science. I do not consider myself terrible at programming, i am just normal. I have not yet worked in a professional setting, and this summer approaching I will be doing my first internship. I fear exhaustion and life after work. I want to of course complete my degree and try out my internship to see how I truly feel about working in the field. I chose this program because I wanted financial stability.

What other careers exist that I could do with a bachelor in computer science and Make atleast 50k a year in Canada. I want to work on a business after work and not be so flooded with stuff from my job.

I would consider myself very sociable, and if it wasn't for french being such a dominant language in my city ( i am from montreal) I honestly would not have mind being salesmen.

My french is decent, I understand perfectly. However I forget words when I speak the language so it comes off as stuttering. I also can read it perfectly as I went to a french elementary school. 

I swear on my life I am a hard worker and driven however I'm unsure if it is just fatigue from school that makes me hate studying computer science or I truly do not enjoy what I am doing.  My father was immigrant who never had education so he went directly into truck driving and my mother worked at a factory. I never really had anyone to ask about the types of jobs that exist.

Can someone please give me some opinions... My end goal is to work on my business after work and not be so mentally drained from work that I wouldn't be able to do so."

I hadn’t landed a job prior to my graduation, which was my goal when I was in school. At the lowest point of my undergraduate years, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and I barely survived college. My gpa is below 2.5, but what I lack in grades, I make it up with research and 3 internship experience. 

I thought that maybe the pandemic is a small hiccup for my job search because there is a need for engineers in the job market. But after months of job hunting, I’m starting to lose hope. I had a few interviews and screenings here and there, but I never landed an offer.  The closest lead I had was a biotech company. They liked my resume and interviews, but didn’t offer me the position because the other candidates had more experience. 

It’s honestly so discouraging and soul-crushing to apply everyday and get a rejection one after another. In the meantime, I’ve been studying for the FE exam and have registered for it. I’m worried that I’ll be in the same position six months from now, still job hunting. I’m worried that my degree will become useless because of the job market, and I don’t think I have the mentality to go through graduate school right now because of my low gpa."

I've thought about this long and hard, and I'm still indecisive as to what I should do.

The reason why I'm deciding about quitting is because the internship was not what I expected and I constantly feel stressed out and anxious about it. I dread going to work, and whenever I'm there, I look at the clock to see when my shift will be over.

At my internship, I'm basically cold calling local businesses and generating leads for the next businesses I try to target. Then, I'm advised to schedule appointments with potential clients before/after work hours to initiate/follow-up on a conversation about the services that I pitching to them. *I was told to do this on my 3rd day there.* Most of my stress comes from figuring out how I am going to meet with clients around my current schedule in addition to this internship. My stress increased again when I heard from other interns going out of their way (out of state) to pitch to potential clients. I don't even know how the heck I am supposed to meet with potential clients locally let alone out of state. Furthermore, the idea of having to go to businesses in person to pitch and before/after work hours unsettles me. When I asked my manager about whether I would have to pitch out of state or far from where I live(2hr+), she gave a vague answer and said that the company could schedule time for me and another employee to pitch out of state.

I had spent many months looking for an internship, and when I finally got an offer from for this one, I felt ecstatic. I didn't have internship experience, so I was trying to be as open as possible when I was applying to internships. I felt like I needed a foundation to grow my work experience from so I decided to take on this position. I am appreciative for the opportunity given to me, but I'm not sure if I should continue on with the internship.

I'm working tomorrow so I will be talking to my manager about this when I arrive.

**tldr:** I'm a current college student studying computer science and I want to quit this sales internship that I started 2 weeks ago. The internship is 6-months long."

I previously interned as a data engineering intern.

I have a personal website where I uploaded projects that I did for fun (such as building a silly calculator, medication diary, recipe lookup program, shooting games using Python/SQL) and obviously, they are not fancy professional projects. I purely did these projects for fun, and I also have some projects on data analysis (using Python; pandas, NumPy, sklearn, etc), but again, I did it for fun so the topics are nothing serious (such as video games, movies, shows, etc).

Now that I'm applying for tons of jobs (mainly using Indeed), I noticed most of them ask my website/Github (a lot of time optional), and since my projects are nothing serious, I'm worried if I should not give my project website... I'm planning to do more serious(?) projects but well, I like building fun stuff so I've been putting off........... 

Anyway, is it okay to include my project website (even though the projects are beginner level and most of them were done for fun) when I apply for jobs?"

What should I do?,STAG_MUSIC,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/kcs1s8/job_opportunity_from_previous_internship_after/,"Long post so also attaching a TLDR the end. 

Hi! I recently started out as a UX Designer straight from college in one of the BIG4's. The work is hectic sometimes but I kinda of enjoy it. The people here are young and everyone contributes to the team on the projects. The pay is decent but work-life balance has taken a hit. I would have to shift to a new city once things settle down so I also look forward to the new culture and people.

A week back I got a call from my internship (It was with a big tech firm) mentor stating that there is an opening on the team and if I'm interested I can apply. I eventually did but now that I think of it, I'm really not sure if it's the best decision to make. I've worked as a part of the team for close to 4 months as an intern and they really liked my work. On the flip side, I really never enjoyed the environment of the team (a lot of politics and rants about their small kids). Had a talk with the team lead on the opportunity and he said they are looking for people with 6-8 years of experience but since they liked my work they reached out. He mentioned because of this, I might struggle because I have to do the same level and quality of work as the other experienced people but the final call is on me to take of I want to be a part of the process or not.

I would have to go through the process with a few interview rounds with the team and HR before getting the offer letter. They pay would be a decent increase from what I have currently. Tbe job location is at home so I will be staying with my parents which personally is not great for my personal growth.

Since I'm so early in my career, I'm really not sure whats the best decision to take here. Since I still haven't received a interview date I can still take the call. Looking for some advice and opinions. Thanks!

TL;DR: Started my first job 4 months back with Big4 as a UX Designer. Decent pay &amp; hectic work-life but kinda enjoy it. Got a call from previous internship mentor of an opportunity on the team. Applied for it but now not sure of its the right call since never really enjoyed working on the team"

I have an interview for  a software developer internship(my second actually. There are three to get the job) and I'm not sure if its what I want anymore.

On one hand, I can get a great job now and it's the safer bet with benefits and job security. On the other hand, I can try for high risk high reward with software development in this internship which is only part time with no benefits. 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I take the safe option or go with the high risk high reward option if I'm offered the internship? I can't possibly do both and If I take one over the other the one I didn't take will certainly be gone almost immediately.

I know unpaid internships are kinda shit but I'm rather desperate here, I've gotten few interviews and no offers for summer 2021 after ~200 applications. Due to a personal circumstances I probably won't do an internship this summer even if I get an offer.


I've only recently committed to CS so I feel very unqualified for even this position, but I'm leaning towards accepting it; it sure looks better than a random personal project, and I think I'd need this kind of external pressure to keep working on CS outside of class. I literally don't know crap about mobile development so idk how I managed to finagle an offer but it could be an interesting sink or swim kinda learning environment. I'm fortunate enough to not need money in the short term so that's not a huge concern. I honestly don't think I'm in a position to reject an unpaid position on principal right now, I already feel behind.


What would you do? Thanks in advance."

I currently have two offers on the table, both very different.

The first is a government position, paying $18/hr but the job description sounds pretty unique: Intern Cloud Architect. The role would be on a team researching new technology to modernize certain federal systems and not a lot of hands-on coding. The title and job sound pretty great, but the pay is much lower than the other offer.

The second offer pays $30/hr and is a typical Java Springboot backend dev job. I've already had an internship as a backend dev, so the experience may be similar to what I have had before. The company and culture are super cool, and I would enjoy working here for sure.

Not really sure where to go here - while exploring new technologies and systems sounds great, almost half the pay of the other job makes me not even feel like considering it. On the other hand, the goal is one day to be a real cloud architect because the position and TC are both great and this position could be a great stepping stone.

Any advice would be appreciated! Thank you!"

I'm considering leaving my Masters of Computer Science with a specialization in AI at a Canadian University. I already have a Bachelors of Computer science with internship experience. I'm one semester out of 4 into it so far. I didn't do enough prior research before accepting the offer. The program involves too much statistics for me and I don't enjoy training a model only to need to make a single change and then train it again. I've submitted papers but they keep getting rejected because of a lack of novelty or some other issue. I have trouble coming up with any useful ideas on my own though.

&amp;#x200B;

There are also some problems in my lab. The professor is new to the department and has related research experience but isn't an expert in AI. There are no PhD students who can help mentor me on research either since the lab is new. The supervisor expects some unreasonable hours such as meetings on weekends, available at night, and expectations to audit additional courses.

&amp;#x200B;

I previously completed an internship in a backend developer / devops role and really enjoyed it but I did the masters because I  figured I could make more money with AI. I've been applying to backend / devops jobs in my area to test the waters and have gotten a few interviews. It's tough to spend too much time applying to jobs / interviewing given the unreasonable hours though.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any thoughts on how to quit or if I should in the first place? Should I quit and spend all my time applying / refreshing my skills or apply more slowly and stay in the program? Given my experience so far, I believe I want to get back into software engineering and not focus on data science / machine learning / AI.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advanced."

kd4gx9,6,2020-12-14,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (12/14/2020),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/kd4gx9/weekly_job_qa_thread_12142020/,"Hi all,

Here is the forty-second installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

I also have 2 jobs to pay for my living and school expenses(they are both not related to this field). So far I have maintained a 3.5 gpa taking 12 credits per semester. Working 2 jobs leaves me with no time to learn extra material that can help me in the long run. My biggest worry is I will end up with no job when I graduate. I do have some scholarships and grants that cover about 80% of the tuition costs. I’m thinking about applying for a student loan to fully pay for my tuition(about 40k annually) and quitting one of my jobs so focus more on my major. I believe this would also give me some time to do internships. Is there anyone who has had to make a similar decision in school? I would appreciate any sort of advice."

But upon some research I also saw some comments online about how this company is like a networking or pyramid scheme which is a bit concerning. Also, as an international student, I am concerned that they might not be a good stepping stone for me to get sponsored for an H1B visa.

I’ve been living alone away on an internship and since it’s a tiny company I don’t talk to anyone at work and I can’t meet up with any friends because of COVID so I literally haven’t had a real conversation in person with someone in months.

This isolation I think has contributed to my spiralling mental health and it’s been affecting my sleep heavily. I’ve been falling asleep around 4 a.m. and waking up at 9 every day for the past month or so and I don’t know how to escape.

I always get in bed way before but I just can’t seem to close my eyes and sleep because my day just feels.. not done? I feel unfulfilled, discontent. Because I wake up, go to work, come home... to nothing... every single day. And so to fill this void I just mindlessly scroll through reddit or tik tok or YouTube hoping to feel something, and I obviously don’t. I just wait until I get exhausted and am forced to sleep.

I don’t know what to do. But I just can’t lay there with my anxious thoughts swirling around my brain and fall asleep.

What can I do?"
kda0ji,2,2020-12-14,Difficulty getting a job after graduating,cs_throw_away44,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kda0ji/difficulty_getting_a_job_after_graduating/,"I graduated from a reputable and known public university in December of 2019 with a bachelor's in computer science and a minor in cybersecurity. Since July I have been applying off and on to entry level positions (junior/associate software engineer/developer) to companies around the major city I live in, as well as remote positions throughout the US. Over this time period I have applied to 40-50 locations and only had 1 opportunity to interview. The interview was for a really small fintech startup and I got through 2 rounds of interviewing, but eventually was given a generic ""we didn't decide hire you"" email after over a month of waiting for a response. Never gave a reason or any feedback. I'm starting to really doubt myself and wonder if I might never get a job in this field.

I've worked with my university's career center to update my resume and help it look as good as it can. I didn't get any internships during school (which I hugely regret now) and don't have a great GPA (2.83), but I've heard from multiple people if your GPA is below a 3.0 it usually isn't beneficial to list on a resume anyway. My resume primarily highlights group projects I completed at school and my role in them. In addition it highlights an indie game that I started work on recently and my devlog website for that project. To be fair, this website definitely needs more content as I only have one blog post from several months back at the moment. But the website itself is very well done and was designed with Squarespace (though someone viewing the site would have no way of knowing it uses a template).  

I'm not employed anywhere currently, but it's really starting to suck living at home and feeling like I'm letting my parents down. I have my game project I can work on and a seperate side hustle that I can generate some small amount of income from, but other than that my life basically feels like it's in limbo as I wait to hear back from anywhere I've applied.

I've been checking pretty actively recently on Indeed, Handshake, and Linkedin and applying to any relevant position that pops up. I'd really prefer to not move out of the city I live in, but if it was absolutely a last resort there is one other major city relatively close that I think I could handle working in for a few years at least to build experience. 

I always heard before/during starting my CS major how there were more jobs available in the sector than the workforce could fill and how easy it would be to get a well paying job. After not even getting an offer to interview at 99% of the companies I've applied to, I realize how naive I actually was. Is writing a cover letter highly tailored to the company and position a big boost to my application? Is there some skillset I'm missing that I should have put on my resume? I have pretty strong C, C++, HTML, and Python skills (along with a handful of libraries and other tools), but a lot of places seem like they're looking for Java and Javascript experience. I don't think those languages would be difficult to learn, but should I really take a month(+?) to learn those just to add to my skillset on a resume? Without professional experience using the language it just seems like it wouldn't be that useful. Is Covid really impacting the volume of available applications or the amount of companies hiring? I've just passed a year out of school with no real work history aside from personal projects. I feel like I've missed the golden window to get a job and from this point on employers will automatically pass me up or question my gap in work history.

I'm just feeling really down and lost and could use some advice or words of encouragement. I can't understand why a company wouldn't see my degree and at least give me an opportunity to try a leetcode-esque interviewing question. It's not like I'm applying to be a senior software engineer or something, I just want the most entry level position and to make $60K+ a year (honestly would settle for ~$50K if the experience would help me get a better job later on). I feel like my only option for related employment would be to try a place like Revature, which the internet says avoid like the plague, not to mention they lock you in with a 2 year contract and pretty low pay."

kdfzva,519,2020-12-15,How I failed/withdraw 5 semesters in a row and somehow got a summer internship with a 2.30 GPA.,Mr_Two_Bits,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/kdfzva/how_i_failedwithdraw_5_semesters_in_a_row_and/,"I don't hear a lot of stories about failing nearly two years' worth of college and somehow making it back. So here's my story.

I suffer from severe depression. I barely graduated from high school but the extra credits of my AP classes pushed me over. I only applied to one college and I somehow got in 2015. I thought I was doing alright for around two years into college. I got some internships as a sophomore, got into clubs, and did the whole computer science grind life.

But my issues were never actually solved. With depression, people frequently get episodes. They do fine for a bit and then they regress heavily back to a bad place. For the next 2 years, I was in a cycle of almost killing myself, then taking a break, going back to classes, and then falling apart again. I would go to a therapist, take different medications, and nothing would change. At some point, I didn't believe I could change. Ironically, thinking so make it impossible to change.

The scariest part of depression is losing all passion for everything I used to love. For the entire time, I never changed my major from CS because I knew that's what I wanted to do. But when I fell into depression, I just lost all interest in doing anything. I didn't read about CS anymore and just coasted in my apartment watching the world and my friends move on.

I watched people who entered college after I get internships at Google, Microsoft, and Facebook. I saw my friends building careers at these companies. I remember going to the library seeing my friend study and just hanging out. Now I don't recognize anyone in the clubs or the library. I broke down in tears at the library realizing all the time I wasted and all the friends I can't see anymore. With covid, it upended everything and now no one can go to the library.

But the course for me changed. At the beginning of last year, I started to take meditation more seriously. I figured that if nothing could help me, maybe doing this would help. At the start, it didn't do anything. But as I got better at meditation, I realized that its true power lies in examining and reflecting on the thoughts that happen in my head. I had CBT done with me but wasn't helpful since I wasn't taking in the lessons. However, meditation was like taking a microscope to these thoughts and critically examining their sources and their effects. The dark cloud that robbed me of my happiness wasn't random or impenetrable. That mood was fueled by ""clinging."" (This is a Buddhist term). If I just let go of these thoughts, often they don't come back.

This process didn't lift me out of depression entirely. Meditation and reflection were more like cleaning a dirty lens so I can see more clearly. The lens of my mind gets dirty very often and frequently, so I just clean it repeatedly. Often I forget to do so and start to slide into a depression again but I catch myself and reel back from those thoughts. Meditation allowed me to handle the pressure of classes and submit assignments as opposed to withdrawing. I still struggle greatly with time management, anxiety, and feeling tired all the time but I am crawling as opposed to collapsing. 

I lost all of my financial aid since my grades tanked. I know that the only reason why I didn't drop out of college is that my parents were willing to pay for the tuition and fees. I couldn't have gotten here if I just dropped out of college.

As for how I got my internship with a god awful GPA. I applied to over 150 places, got a handful of responses, and failed most of them. I failed a Zillow interview. I failed a fairly easy JP Morgan coding question. But I wised up and practiced more leetcode, answering behavioral, and cleaning up my resume. I passed a Microsoft phone screen but I have to wait next year to get to the next round.

Another place gave me an interview. I looked up all the interview questions on glassdoor and studied them. I reviewed all the leetcode questions I have done since I write down notes in Google Keep. In the interview, they asked me leetcode question I seen before and the questions they asked were on glassdoor. The second part was a behavioral one where they asked me a set of standard questions that I studied beforehand as well. Don't underestimate these behavioral questions, they can be as important as the technical parts. It turns out in real life people don't care about GPA beyond the resume. They care about having a passion for CS and what you did.

I used this list to get much better at leetcode.

I have a question. I am doing an internship in CV at a large company and I am the only one in my department who knows about DL. The task is to predict the amount of gas (volume flows) running through a leakage from infrared images/videos. How would you approach this task? I have collected training videos of different leakages and have trained a neural net which classifies the amount of gas on images into 4 different clusters (from nothing - .... -  40 ml/min and above) with an accuracy of about 88%. 

In the end we want to take videos of a huge component and tell locations where workers need to touch up leakages. I am not sure which architecture to pick. In the video several classes of leakages can occur. I do not know the length of the video at the moment but i would guess from 3 to 6 minutes. My training videos are 30 seconds and only one class occurs. Training shows that just predicting each frame with a simple convnet is not feasible, because different perspectives can easily change the predicted class. 

So I would do transfer learning with my pretrained model and make it sequential to take several previous frames into account and still predict each frame. If I would pick a lstm+convnet for example, how do I determine the sequence length in training? Should I just pick, for example, 30  frames? And in testing on the longer videos only process 30 frames at once? As I understand, sequential models are not flexible and do not work properly on sequence lengths unseen in training. 

It would be so kind if some of you could give a little insight :)

Being young and naive, I didn't seek out internships independently, and my university screwed me over by not making internships apparent or available, plus, my degree is very, very broad. I got very good grades but, aside from that, I've never was anything more than average. I simply do not have enough experience to get a job that gives me experience; I have no specializations and only a short list of one-year maximum jobs and volunteer work. I am not wanted by professional (actual) jobs. 

I could go back to school and get another degree, or a certificate, or learn a trade, etc. but I need money to do that and minimum wage jobs (you now, that stuff I qualify for) won't ease the layers of crushing debt. I could apply for scholarships, but I've been down that particular rejection-depression road before. 

I gave up on jobs within my field of interest and have applied to anything that I meet the minimum qualifications for - and the response I usually get (if I get a response) is: why do you want to work here if you have x degree? BECAUSE I WANT TO WORK, DAMMMIT! (sidenote: how do you answer that question?)

Basically, it's almost 1am and I've spent too much time today searching job boards (since I have a non-existent network) and trying to avoid thinking about the potential for working at the local mall (for the third time), a lifetime of unstable work, never being able to do more than just barely scrape by, and only retiring when I'm too old to be considered useful (better die before then, \~lol\~).

To the folks who've been searching for jobs (and, lets be honest, the American Dream) for far longer, how do you keep up morale?"

I have been fortunate to receive internship offers from Amazon and Uber for summer 2021 as a junior, but have been finding it rather difficult to decide between the two. 

I'm inclined to choose Uber because I would be on a team and at a location from a list of my preferences and would be guaranteed a project that is impactful within Uber. On the other hand, at Amazon, I would be randomly placed on a team two months prior to the start of the internship and have no say in this process at all. In that sense, I feel like I may enjoy and learn more from the internship at Uber.

In the long run, I could see myself working at either company full-time, but have also read quite a few negative reviews about the work culture at Amazon, though Uber's doesn't appear to be much better either. Nevertheless, I have also heard that working at Amazon could benefit me more in terms of my career progression.

What are your opinions on both companies?

Note: It was confirmed to me by my recruiter that there should be no possibility of a cancelled internship at Uber this summer and that all interns who were recommended last summer received a return offer at Uber.

Any help greatly appreciated.",NoTrade3105,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/kdlxh4/learning_ethical_hacking_odd_question_any_help/,"I'm a computer repair tech moving into ethical hacking and cybersecurity. Currently I'm attending classes for Security+ and CCNA but want more experience. There's nowhere for a few hundred miles to do an internship of this type where I live so I feel I'm at a disadvantage when I get where experience and familiarity with tools are needed. To help alleviate this, I was thinking about setting up some old, derelict machines that I've had donated in a completely closed off network to get experience by experimenting and doing performing real-world tasks.  

The idea is that it would be a designated testing area that's completely sealed off from other network devices and populated by abandoned, non-valuable machines.  Here I can begin learning and experimenting with tools included on Parrot OS and Kali, then eventually move on to simulated tasks like virus removal, data retrieval, penetration security, ect. Perks being it's all physical hardware so I can configure practically any setup I want and all of it is donated so if it breaks or has irreversible issues I'm out no money at all. 

So the question is would I actually be able to gain any real experience like that and do any of you have suggestions or tips for this idea? Currently I have about 6 towers, 1 laptop and 2-3 routers I can set up in my test zone. 

tldr: I want to set up a sterile network where I can practice virus removal, data retrieval and other simulated scenarios. Would it help me at all or is it just a pointless idea?"

I've wasted a lot of time, barely going to some classes, procrastinating, being an unmotivated student all around.

Meanwhile I see some young guys having lots of experience, amassing incredible momentum in their careers, getting great jobs,  creating opportunities for themselves and it makes me incredibly depressed.I was studying this morning in a public library and checked the LinkedIn profile of some 21 year old that I used to know, wondering what he was up to these days... and that guy has done incredible things (volunteering experience, international internships, some professional experience in interesting companies) and is in his senior year of college.

I literally felt sick, packed up my books and went home and laid in bed thinking about how shameful my situation was, how I wished this guy were to end up in some car accident, how I wish I could go back in time and do school properly, how I wish he died, how I would never do anything great in my life, how I've wasted every single opportunities that were thrown at me, how I wished I were dead, and other terrible things... Worst thing is that guy must work a lot, and although we've never really been on friendly terms when we met (probably because I'm an awkward mess) I found him to be genuinely nice to be around, a real social butterfly and a real doer and hence I totally understand that he's now so successful

I know that my life probably won't be what I've dreamed of as a kid and I should get used to seeing successful people be successful (and be genuinely happy for them) otherwise I won't ever get anything done

I think that my behavior is rooted in a sort of narcissistic victim-complex, because I want to drag down other people to my level and I live in a sort of ""HOW DARE YOU DO THINGS, HOW DARE YOU DO THINGS BETTER THAN I DO"" mental state

I do I solve such thing? This is really debilitating, I know how you shouldn't compare yourself to others yet I  can't help but feel anger and be depressed to the point where I want to puke

You're not wasting your time.",CommonAppPro,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/kdog8e/with_early_results_heres_a_reminder_youre_not/,"With early decisions coming out soon, the stress level on this sub has spiked. I've seen a lot of people talk about their fear of rejection. Many of you tie your self worth to acceptance to your reach schools, and I've heard a lot of people panic at the idea of attending their state school just like their classmates who ""didn't try.""

But you shouldn't be worried. **You might go to the same school as your less driven peers, but you'll come in with better opportunities and better skills. After all, state schools are still a great place to land.**

# Scholarships

If you're going to your state school but you were a competitive applicant for T20s, you'll get substantial scholarships. That's going to offset the cost of your education a lot, and there's a chance you could graduate debt-free or close to it.

You might not fully appreciate that now, but I guarantee you will at 35 when many of your classmates are still paying 20% of their income to offset student loans. And if you do decide to go to graduate school, you won't have to worry about the loans you took out for your undergrad.

# Honors Programs

Any state school is going to have a good honors college, which you'll be a member of. Here are just a few of the possible perks:

* **Priority registration for all of your classes.** This is a lifesaver at the bigger schools, where kids freak out the second registration opens and rush to get a spot in their preferred class (and usually don't get it). You'll never have to worry about your long-term graduation plan being thrown off because you couldn't sign up for a class on time, or have to settle for a class with a professor you don't like. You get first pick.
* **Priority and/or special housing.** Lots of colleges give honors kids the first pick of dorms, or they have the choice of living in honors housing. And with the wide range of housing at most state schools, from *built in the 1910s and falling apart* to *modern tech paradise built 2 years ago*, you'll be extremely grateful. Plus, honors housing builds a community for you and lets you find academically minded peers.
* **Specialized advising and mentoring.** Going to a big state school, or even a T20, means you'll probably see your advisor a few times a year, usually just to schedule classes. With honors programs, you have a counselor dedicated to you, and you can meet with them regularly. Obviously, this is super helpful when you're looking for opportunities like internships or summer programs. Plus, you'll get connected to a mentor in your field of interest, and growing that relationship will give you access to a lot of amazing programs you won't have known about otherwise.
* **Honors classes/seminars.** This isn't a thing at all schools, but some state schools let you take a few Honors-only classes, which tend to be much more discussion-based. They're also capped at a much smaller number of students, so your learning is much more personalized.

# Advanced Standing Opportunities

You know all those AP/IB/dual credit classes you're taking? Remember how the whole point is to get you college credit? It actually transfers at state schools, unlike most T20s. You can build a much more personalized schedule, from graduating early, double-majoring, skipping weed-outs, or just enjoying your classes more than if you were forced to take ""Intro to Physics"" as an English major.

For me, my AP classes clear away all but 6 credit hours of a 32 credit hour gen-ed requirement at my state school. I could graduate a year early, but because my automatic merit scholarships are so nice, I'd probably take 4 years and leave with a major, related minor, and 3 school-year internships in my desired field. I wouldn't have that much course flexibility if I went to a T20, and it's honestly a big reason why I'm considering staying in-state.

# Resume and College ECs

No matter what, the tangible stuff disappears once you reach college--you won't be MUN President or LD State Champion--but the lessons you learn from your ECs don't. You're going to enter college with better time management and organization, better soft skills, and better understandings of what it takes to run an organization like a club.

That stuff can stay on your resume until you build up college honors. If it's freshman year and you're trying to get an internship in your field, you'll have the EC experience that shows you understand what you're doing. When you're competing with other underclassmen or even some juniors, internships/competitions/leadership shows that you know what's going on.

That experience also makes it easier for you to dive into campus extracurriculars so you can build up your resume and keep doing the things you loved to do in high school. At your state school, you'll be a big fish. You'll be able to take up leadership more quickly and be a star within the clubs. You'll get to be fully immersed in what you're doing as extracurriculars, not just a minor role like you might be at T20s.

**You've put yourself on a track for success no matter where you go. State schools will throw opportunities at you, and not everyone gets that opportunity. Don't forget that.**

kdq9cu,1,2020-12-15,Career change advice,Tough_Opinion7550,Frontend,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frontend/comments/kdq9cu/career_change_advice/,"Hi! I never asked for this kind of advice, but I truly appreciate a few insights on this matter now. 

I started working on the game industry pretty much freshly out of university. I learned how to code on my free time, not on school. So I always lacked confidence when with people that studied years to be devs. I have 4 years of experience and the past 3y I have been working without requiring help (yeah we sometimes share a few opinions while on conversations, but not like requesting help to get through). I even worked a bit on the backend during this time. 

Now, I got an offer from a new company, to be a senior team lead. I had a nice call with the company founder, he told me that he would like me in that position since I have a good knowledge of the game development, I developed a couple titles on my own and I already supervised devs before (interns or newbies) and would be great to start there (the company is currently having outsource front-end work only, and want to have in-house devs now).

The company I work for might not be an option in the next year due to problems I don't want to write here, but it's for both sides, I mean, we are trying to make it work because I was not thinking about quitting as well as my boss was not getting me fired. It's just bureaucracy, let's put it like this. I might be working one last year because of this, so sooner or later it might happen either way. 

Now, I don't know if I should quit and take this opportunity with the new company since I was never confident in myself. I feel like a noob 90% of the time even if I work on my own and get my job done. He called me senior, what I see myself doing in the next years, offered the position of team lead... I felt like he might have too high expectations, felt like if I get this all eyes will be on me and all my dev flaws will be out there. I was so stressed the first weeks as a dev since I was feeling worried of not being good enough for the job... Turns out, I was enough! I did just fine. But in the beginning I had help if I needed. This offer is going solo first and then build and manage a team.

Am I overreacting? It's the 2nd time I get an offer like this. What are your thoughts?"

Like many of you I am just an average joe Computer Science student and aspiring Software Engineer. I read this board to stay informed but we all know what kind of dread the negative reports can inspire. More experience than me and applied to 500 internships across the country? How will I ever make it? I hope this post inspires the opposite sort of feeling.

Quick profile:

* Early 30's returning to school after working in unrelated field and unskilled positions
* Based in US but doing a fully online BS program in Europe
* Will be Junior (ish) next summer
* QA Co-OP at large company for past year
* Programming experience is from school, personal projects, 1 work hackathon, and some minor scripting at work. Active on GitHub, but nothing terribly special.

I targeted Software Engineering or closely related titles around a major market where I'm based, as well as some remote positions. I primarily used LinkedIn, [the PittCS intern repo](https://github.com/pittcsc/Summer2021-Internships), and Indeed.

**Results**

Here is a Sankey diagram of my journey starting in late September and ending today with an offer for a fully remote Applications Development Internship from a regional health insurance company. I am a bit disappointed in the pay (19/hr) but experience-wise it's a big step in the right direction. This isn't a top-tier internship but this comes less than 2 years after switching careers so I am quite happy!

[https://i.imgur.com/Gw0xWWP.png](https://i.imgur.com/Gw0xWWP.png)

The other offer I got was also software development but the pay was even less and I didn't think it was as good of an opportunity anyway.

**Key Stats:**

* 150 Applications submitted
* 1.97 Applications submitted per day
* 1.33% of applications ended with an offer
* No response at all from 72% of applications
* 2.67% of applications led to a conversation with a human
* 50% of conversations with a human lead to an offer
* Received some sort of response continuing the process from 13.33% of applications. A large majority of these were coding interviews or hirevues that I assume everyone got.
* 2 of 3 hiring manager interviews came after just submitting applications on Indeed. However, these were both relatively unattractive options.

**Why I think you should have hope**

* I received 2 offers without a technical interview portion
* I didn't have any experience programming until early 2019
* I don't come from a top school and the name has no recognition in the regions I applied
* My degree is online, which can potentially carry a stigma. I don't think it was ultimately disadvantageous
* My program is not in the US, so communicating GPA, what year I am, etc. can be difficult

Most importantly, this is not to say that if you haven't gotten offers then there must be something really wrong. It's quite easy for me imagine getting 0 offers. The one I accepted required a hirevue and I skipped several other hirevues because they suck. Point being, you have to apply to as much as you can, as early as possible, and just have a positive attitude so you can show up to the process as best you can."

Thus far I had thought of internships as something that's just nice to have, for those overachievers who want to get into the big, prestigious companies like Google, Facebook, etc. but I hadn't realized that pretty much no company will hire you unless you have at least some internship experience. Now I'm one semester from graduation and I'm beginning to realize that I have no future in this industry whatsoever and the years I put into my degree have no value at all. I'm literally just as qualified for a job as a developer as someone who has just graduated high school. I only sent out about 100 or so internship applications per semester, but in hindsight I probably should have sent much more than that. I just wish it weren't too late. Is there anything I can do at this point to save my career?"
kdtau8,2,2020-12-15,Deciding on Internship Offers,StuffzCrimson,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/kdtau8/deciding_on_internship_offers/,"I’m a Mechanical Engineering student and I recently got two internship offers. I have talked to several friends that I know have interned at these companies and have all told me that unless I royally screw up, I will more than likely be offered a full time job with them which is great to hear.

My dilemma is deciding which offer to accept. As an important note, I strive to one day become a Project Manager, I’ll explain more later in the post.

So both of these companies are in the Aerospace industry. I won’t specify but Company A is essentially in the top 3 largest Aerospace companies in the world and has a great reputation. I have talked to numerous employees that works there and have all told me great things about the culture, work environment and the sheer number of opportunities the company has.

Company A has also been my “dream” company to work at since my first semester in college since my values and interests align very well with the company. 

However, the position they are offering me is Systems engineering which is very interesting for sure, but does not fully align with my specific career path when compared to what Company B offers.

Company B is still a large company but is simply not to the scale that Company A is. B is a great company and have also heard great things from former interns. They offer me a position in Project Engineering which from what I understand is more management oriented and is essentially a step below Project Management(please correct me if I’m wrong).

Over all the position at Company B fits my career path better and interests me a little more, but I also have a chance now to work at Company A which I have wanted to for a very long time. I also hear that Company A has great flexibility in changing your job field so maybe there will be opportunities for me to change my position at some point?

In essence, I guess you could say, “dream” company vs “dream” job? Not “dream” job exactly but it is closer, at least from what I understand.

Any thoughts? I’m leaning to company A and everyone around me is telling me to decide with A but I’m still unsure."

I'm purposely choosing to focus on only one skill over winter break, because I learn better and faster when I can treat the learning of a skill like a full time job (vs learning two skills and splitting the time). I have 30 days to jump-start a new skill before next semester begins. I narrowed down my choice to two skills that highlight different objectives; the academic, or the career objective. Here is a breakdown of the arguments for each choice:

&amp;#x200B;

The academic objective; learn Scala:

\- Scala will be used for the first half of principles of programming languages, which is known to be one of the most difficult classes in the program.

\- The instructor already told me it's a good idea to be familiar with a functional language, and currently I am not.

&amp;#x200B;

The career objective; learn JS/React:

\- The vast majority of jr. dev jobs start with front end development

\- It's a good idea to be familiar with one web app framework before applying for internships/jobs, and currently I am not.

&amp;#x200B;

If I knew I could secure an internship for the summer without studying JS, I would choose  Scala.

If I knew I would maintain a 3.5+ gpa without studying Scala, I would choose JS/React.

It's hard to make a choice on these because I don't know the likelihood of either of these.

Which one of these is a better choice?"

I don’t believe in that myself.

This post might sound very boomer. I guess that makes sense since I’m a senior!!

The job market is so competitive. You don’t just compete with other UCSD students. You compete with people all around the world. I did one summer internship (unpaid... total scam) at a consulting firm and the whole thing was about helping companies save money by outsourcing their jobs to other countries. If a company can find someone in India or the Philippines to reliably do the same job for 1/10th the salary, they’ll outsource the job. It happens all the time. With so much competition, a lot of students, including many in STEM, will have a hard time finding work after they graduate.

That said, if a student is *surprised* to learn what the job market is like in their field, at the END of their college education, that is a problem.

Your department won’t say up front “our students struggle to find jobs!! Of all the majors on campus, our alumni have the highest unemployment rate, whooo!!” They’ll tell you only about success stories, which I’m sure exist in every field.

And honestly, it makes sense why they do that. The school is a business, and too much transparency would cost money. I used to really resent how UCSD is more of a corporation than a learning institution (especially for undergrads), but I have come to find that’s just how education works.

And once again, I’m not trying to shit on any majors, but what irritates me is when this comes as a surprise to people. I’m a senior, and some of my friends are saying how they feel deceived and regret not having majored in something else. If you had no idea what the job market was like in Field X, you never cared to read into that, and now you’re struggling to find a job, that’s on you bro. That “surprise” at the time of graduation is a huge trend I’m seeing."

I'd be working at a Comcast subsidiary, not at Comcast itself. I interviewed with who would be my supervisor for both places and they both seem like they could be great mentors. The pay is roughly equivalent for both. Both places seem to have interesting, challenging work, but I am leaning a little more towards IBM because of its name. Does anyone have some insight on working at either company?

I'm a college student who's always been into tech and cybersecurity. I wasn't super serious about it, but I wanted to change that after I got an internship at a company related to my major, but I got the most out of it by noticing a bunch of really basic bad general tech issues in the company and just setting guidelines and fixing them, (had to teach people about task manager, they're old people). I figured if I had a stronger knowledge in IT and cybersecurity there I might have actually solved some other problems I never got around to, maybe getting me a full time offer right there, who knows. The problem is that the gap between general IT skills and actually cybersecurity is massive. That was why I initially avoided majoring it in, I knew the field was evolving faster than anyone could keep up with, getting more and more insane with all the breaches and vulnerabilities coming out every week ... Ugh. But, if I just keep it as a skill on the side, that might be my best bet for my sanity.

Now cause of covid (and me) screwing myself over, my graduation is getting pushed back, unfortunately, but I have time to invest in some comp sci and cyber security classes to fill in the gap my schedule. I'd also happily start learning things online, (python is something I've been on and off about) I saw a chart here showing all the different kind of certifications out there, there seem to be so many of them. Which ones are really worthwhile? Any personal projects I can look into? The field feels infinite and I'll never be able to keep up, how should I go about getting more serious about it."

I got hired as a software engineer at a company I worked for as an intern for a couple summers, and I love the company and the people. 

I started this week full time. Even though I was an intern, I'm asking so many questions, and I'm constantly asking for help. I know this is totally to be expected for someone starting at a new company, but I'm technically not even that new here. I feel like I should know more. Is this normal?  Any advice?

Landed a great internship throughout that summer doing Desktop/Infrastructure Support and worked hard to develop professional relationships and find mentors. 

A friend's relative set up a call with someone whom was satisfied and hired me to do IT support for his 1-man operation. It sounds worse than it was but his focus was website design/consulting and was growing his Provided IT service biz and so we setup pc’s/printers/routers/etc and it wasn’t bad. 

While there I applied like crazy for something better and I landed an interview with a Fortune 500 for Desktop Support I. I got the interview from a connection I made while in school and working in a restaurant and constantly shaking hands and getting business cards. 

At this point I’m not technical on a granular level on any topics really. I’d been using/building computers for years but I’m unprepared overall, I can say looking back. I was a bit nervous since this was clearly the largest employer I’d ever sat for an interview with, and they put us in a very uncomfortable conf room. Jesus. The lighting. Dear god. Regardless, I was unprepared and was hoping to land a job I wasn’t ready for(even if I thought I was.)

Not sure on the questions they asked me but walking to my car I knew 100% I would not receive an offer. No question. But I had other things working and all worked out. I’m sharing this experience for those who might’ve left an interview recently and KNOW it didn’t go well. Everybody in IT bombs at least one. Bounce back and start applying."

I like learning about the brain and mind, all the neuroscience and psych stuff. Unfortunately, I am a first-year and I don't have much experience or knowledge beyond the cogsci classes I'm taking (with one of them being the intro course haha).

No former lab or research experience. But I really want to be at a lab this summer (is that an unrealistic goal?)

a school mate from highschool  got an intern position at UCLA's Semel Lab (autism research) in 11th grade! i asked him what he did and he said he basically just cold emailed a bunch of professors.

Thinking of doing the same. would it be wise to just cold email a bunch of professors affiliated with the neuro labs I want to participate in? or am I being super unrealistic?

I have no internships, finding a job was already going to be hell without it, and now, I don't even know. I'm struggling a lot in every single class I have, and I've nuked a lot of personal relationships with other students this semester due to poor communication on my end. 

&amp;#x200B;

One project I totally abandoned, and I was a group leader for. The professor for the concerned class is the one I've had the longest, and the one I trusted the most for any possible references in the future. I can only imagine what he thinks of a student who's taken a group leadership position and fucked it up as badly as I have, not even showing for the end of semester presentation.

&amp;#x200B;

This semester I've just seen a lot of long-standing issues in work habits finally come back to bite me in the ass, and expose me in terms of communication/staying on top of things/scheduling. I really don't know how I'm going to recover from the damage I've done to myself this semester.

&amp;#x200B;

I just got broken up with this weekend—at no apparent fault of my own—with a girl who checked off all the boxes for me. Said she just couldn't be in a relationship right now. Doesn't wanna stop talking. I saw her today, and she was fine. I couldn't get out of there fast enough. Went no-contact and told her I didn't wanna talk for a while. No response. It's generally very difficult for me to find someone to date who clicks with me, and it was really something else for things to end with someone, who for all the unlikely reasons for us to find each other during Covid and make our lives brighter together, told me that we just didn't click \*just like her best friends\*, it was just the slightest bit imperfect, and she couldn't go on with it. I've only known her so long but I still just don't get it.

&amp;#x200B;

My best friend is moving away next semester, and without him, without my girlfriend, it's basically just me and one other friend in this town. I don't know what I am going to do without him. He has been a lot for me this entire time just to stick this out , and he's going to be gone in about 3 weeks time. He's moving to live in Boston, so I don't even know if he's going to return at all. Thinking about it now, I really might not see him much at all after this.

&amp;#x200B;

And across town at my dad's house, there's a .22 rifle stowed out of sight, a couple of shotguns too. I know where they are, and ammunition is likely somewhere in the house.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to die. I don't want my mom to have to find my body, or get that call. I don't want her to see me like that, with my brains painted on the walls of the house I grew up in. That she raised me in.  I don't want her to have to bury her own son.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's a permanent solution to  a temporary  problem but everything just keep getting worse, and for the hole I'm looking at myself being buried in, I don't know how I'm going to get myself out or avoid ruining my own life. I just want it all to stop being so hard, and it won't stop getting worse and worse."

I'm currently 28 years old with barely a penny to my name and I'm thinking IT may be a suitable career path for me that'll also be worthwhile. Looking to start with something like a help desk position. I understand that's rather entry-level.

I mention having no funds particularly because—after a brief search—I noticed advice mentioning attaining certificates or internships. Both of which would unfortunately be out of the question for the time being.

However, I am an avid (primarily PC) gamer. Have been my whole life. As such, I've gone through my fair share of problem solving when it comes to software and hardware issues. I've built and upgraded my own PC. Have experience with video editing and graphic design, assuming either of those that matter. 

Current job is as a restaurant host. Been working there and in this position for 2 years so far. Also have previous additional customer service experience working retail in the past.

Seen it mentioned plenty that a willingness to learn is pretty major. Not going to call myself a bookworm or anything, but I do definitely love to learn new things. Also, always considered myself a fast learner.

Anyway, that was long-winded. In certain that with COVID all places are receiving applications to no end these days. Regardless, I appreciate any advice anyone can give."
ke6n3y,13,2020-12-16,Bsc hons at Islington?,user_affinity,Nepal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/ke6n3y/bsc_hons_at_islington/,"Well i was really really attracted by the open house sessions of deerwalk institute and really wanted to join out with the deerwalk family, study and be a graduate for the CSIT course. But change in minds shifted from CSIT to BIT and it's now on the another side of Islington. The fee structures are a bit expensive this year of about 13 and a half lakhs for three years but the thing is that my mother still wants me to join at deerwalk because it gives us internship roles with decent knowledge about everything but here in islington it's just for the standards and nothing else. She was right on one point, islington hires 500 in every intake session while deerwalk only has 48 seats which is a plus point but does that mean my future is just unpredictable when i study at islington and secured at deerwalk.

Of course everything has its own pros and cons but just i want to share you people my story of today, aja bharkharai bihana hamrai chin jan ko IT specialist dai sanga mamu kura garnu bhayo and he asked me to study at deerwalk because tya ko product haru ramro cha and he's of a higher post who has interviewed a few students from Islington too. And what he told was he didn't hire the students from islington because they weren't decent enough? Does this lead to any comparison? Like there are hundreds of people, who are self taught learning at home getting a job without even a degree and even the graduated ones from pulchowk, they too struggle to get a job right? So is the blame on the colleges for the students who don't get to get a decent job or is it sole responsibility of the student to have a goal and fulfill them along with a little help of their teachers and guides? Because IT field is more about learning and practicing and trainings rather than just being completely dependent on the college to develop their own skills isn't it?

I really really want to study at islington, like the courses are simple and up to date with the global market and it has enough time, and time sufficient for me to do a few new researches and learnings on my own, do projects on my own, freelancing at the time of graduation and that is all on me along with a technical assistance from my teachers right? But as of deerwalk, okay they will provide you with internships and all but is it a hundred percent sure that I'll get a job being a deerwalk graduate? Or do i need to develop my own skills and do projects and define my work ethic through my own vision with a help but not due to the name of the college?

Like I just don't know, because deerwalk is nice but it's about preference right? Even if doctors and engineers are high paid jobs, why do people join arts and commerce? Preference and priorities right? And for me i do feel that islington would be good if not the best, for the base structural development obviously it's all about on how the students learn and grab from the teachers. And i did tell my mother if i study at deerwalk it would just be for the sake of her but not my own will? And did i do something wrong for thinking this way? Of being so obsessed with islington? Is islington really that bad as they show or one of my relative told me it is?"

common app (8.5-9/10) - could've been better considering what i think my personal writing ability is, but all in all i think it's definitely a good essay that showed my versatility and curiosity about everything (if you want me to look at your essays, pm me :))

why nyu supplement (9/10) - was pretty good in all honesty. i wrote about my passion for my major (mostly public health, not so much nursing) and how i could achieve that at nyu.maybe a smidge better than my common app.

lor's (10/10 and 7/10) - were from my science teacher of 3 years who really likes me + knows a lot about me as a student/person and my ap lang teacher who i doubt even remembers my name so do what you will with that information!

*nyu - accepted to nursing + global public health ed*

fordham - accepted to humanitarian studies at lincoln center

\*i'm withdrawing all my apps and offers tmrw!

**advice (this is going to be a long one, sorry):**

i got screwed over A LOT in high school. and when i mean a lot, i mean i could not have fared worse circumstances regarding teachers i got, scheduling issues, etc. i was definitely not top 10, 15, or even 20% of my school and i got a total of 10 b's and 1 c (in a stem class that i need to take as a nursing major). when i used to read threads on reddit and cc saying stats don't matter and people still getting 1600's and 4.0's i was super disappointed. as a person going to a high school with asian kids swarming me with their 4.0's, it was genuinely really scary and i thought i wouldn't get into college (hence, me applying to way too many safety schools than i should have). so here's my piece of advice to you: stats genuinely DO NOT MATTER. i channeled all of my energy into doing extracurriculars that both supported my major and that i was genuinely interested in, and that really helped me consolidate my passions for certain things over others. case in point: debate. i joined debate in my freshman year thinking all the nerds did it and i ended up loving it, which led me to public health. you don't need to start 3 nonprofits and do yale young global scholars or win regeneron, you just need to do well in the ones that you do choose to pursue. don't try to overload yourself and later find out that you never got a chance to experience anything in depth. ultimately, my app came down to my essays and my ec's which i think gave me a chance to really show how much i love what i've been doing the past 4-17 years of my life. so, here are some quick tips -

1. find your interests sooner rather than later and do ec's that adhere to them. try not to go the path where you apply pre-med but do all pre-law ec's, that makes no sense.
2. always find some way to compensate for lacking parts of your app. if your sat is low, get a high gpa. if both are low, do really well in the ec department, etc.
3. don't compare yourself to other people. i was obsessed with watching college decision reactions and looking through reddit/cc which are very toxic places to be if you like to compare yourself. this is cliche, but everyone is different and the college admissions process is the luck of the draw.
4. find something unique in your application that you can blow up. for me, it was my versatility and tenacity, but everyone will have different characteristics, so find that THING whether it be an interesting ec or something about yourself you find eccentric.
5. course rigor and school rigor are very important. if you have a 5.0 at a high school that gives 5.0's to everyone, you might want to go ham on the ec's and essays. obviously this applies to competitive schools too, but a 5.0 at a harder hs will be more impressive than an easier one.

for nyu specifically:

1. name drop in your why nyu essay. idk why, but some people told me they really like that and i did it twice!
2. don't talk about why you love nyc, because that applies to pretty much every school in new york.
3. if you have a bad gpa and high sat/act (like i did), don't fret because i heard that they value high sat/act over gpa.

if you have any questions or just want me to look at your essays feel free to pm me! i did a LOT of research throughout the college app process and can probably help with next year's applicants or even this year's. hope to see you on campus this fall :)) GO VIOLETS!

edit: it turns out i was selected for mlk scholars, which entails research/internship opportunities + financial aid, so it really ISN'T impossible! believe in yourselves :))"

I'm a student in an MSc in computer science/quant finance looking to start my career in quant trading (I have a bit of experience having interned as QT for a year in an HF).

After hundreds of applications, I received some offers to join a Graduate Programme in a top 5 prop trading firm, or an off-cycle end-of-study internship in a BB that can lead to a FT offer if successful, all in the UK/Europe. Both interview process were really nice and projects should be interesting in every case.

I know it's kind of a rich person problem, but which one will be more valuable on a CV to continue in the industry?

Thanks!"

Having graduated from a top european university in finance, I can now access my first role.

Having previously worked at KPMG in Post-Deal accounting and consulting (internship 1), and then in BNP Paribas CIB in Paris (internship 2) in M&amp;A FIG, I have received an offer from another Big4, still in FIG, within the M&amp;A and TS division (both reunited within only one business unit).  


This offer has numerous perks :

1) I loved the FIG sector during my time in BNPP (performing team)  
2) Big4 schedules and workload are less intense and state of mind is chiller than in IB  
3) Could work on both due diligences reports and M&amp;A marketing and executions  
4) Covid crisis impacted strongly the financial employment market (especially for graduates), my BNPP BU couldn't afford to recruit one intern this year  
5) Could reinforce my technical skills and understanding of the FIG sector and financial statements  


But it also has downsides :

1) Obviously the salary is wayyy under the IB average  
2) Biggest deals (large cap) aren't covered by the BIG4 BU  
3) Pretty much far away from center of town (suburbs offices)  
4) FIG specialisation could affect me negatively in the future, especially in case of rotation to VC/PE/Strategy firms

Hi everyone, I wanted to ask for some advice regarding two offers that I have received for upcoming summer internships. A little background, I’m currently in a graduate program for accounting and will finish in a year and have a finance undergrad degree. I’m a little older (26) with some varied experience, currently working for a state government in tax, and have some experience in finance at a software company which was my first job out of my undergrad degree.

I was offered a tax internship with Armanino for the summer, the managers were great and everyone I spoke with was very nice and welcoming. They’re a mid sized public firm and I’d be in one of their newer offices in the city that I currently live in. I’ve read mixed reviews about the company with most being that if you can go Big 4 instead, you should.

Was also offered a summer internship at the PwC Acceleration Center in Tampa. It’s an external audit internship with them but I’ve also read that the AC is not the best place to start a career and it’s not even close to the same thing as starting at PwC in a regular practice office. I also would have to move to Florida for the summer which isn’t ideal.

Which offer would be a better start for a first internship in public accounting? Big 4 would be great, but if the AC is considered to be a “lower” position than what a regular PwC internship or associate position would entail, maybe I should take the other offer. Or does having PwC in any capacity on my resume help regardless? I have no preference going into audit or tax, just want to put my best foot forward starting out. Any advice would be appreciated!"

tldr:  I cleared a Hackerrank, and 3 interviews all of which went fantastic. I  have two recruiters. Recruiter #1 manages status updates with my  candidacy, and recruiter #2  schedules interviews. I was told I would  have a response within 5 days and it's been 4 weeks. Emailed recruiter  #1 and no response. Emailed recruiter #2 and they told me they would  remind recruiter #1 to get back to me. No response.

I'll  try to include as much detail in the explanation as I can because I  think there might be some irregularities. I applied for the position in  August via an employee referral. After 7 weeks, I was matched to a  mobile team for a technical interview. I interviewed, and it went great.  My interviewer said I would be a perfect fit at Salesforce, though he  noticed I have less experience with mobile as compared to fullstack, and  he reached out to my recruiter asking for me to be re-matched. A week  later I was re-matched to a fullstack team (which by the way is the  perfect team I was looking to be a part of with technologies and vision  and everything) and another technical meeting was scheduled. Though,  there was some miscommunication with my recruiter #1 (recruiter #2 was  just to schedule meetings) and my interviewer for the second interview  had no idea I was interviewing for their team, and thus we had to  reschedule to a later date. That later date came and the interview went  fantastic. I was then moved to the final round. The final round came  (behavioral) and it was the textbook definition of a great interview.  The hiring manager for the team I was applying for was my interviewer,  and she and I really clicked on our own histories as well as what we  would be working on together on the team. She was very enthusiastic and  told me that I should hear a response by the end of the week via my  recruiter #1. Now this is where it gets very confusing. I thought for  sure I would have a response because every recruiter had been very  punctual and communicative with me thus far. In fact, their thoroughness  and quick responses were a main reason that I had enjoyed the process  so much because I really felt like they cared about doing a good job and  giving me the best chance possible. Ten days after my final round  interview I still had no response so I emailed recruiter #1 politely  asking if there was a status update.

A week later still no response and it's been 4  and a half weeks now.

It's funny becuase a few years ago I was also in a bad place mentally due to not having any luck in school, looking for work or difficulty dating. In that time, Ive been doing really well in school, got some solid internships and enjoyed messing around with some FWBs with the idea that I can get serious about dating in my last semester. Now I'm virtually in the same place. Well that year was so much easier in comparison to 2020. 

As we all know, the pandemic screwed alot of people over, myself included. What should have been me preparing myself for a job in the real world, spending time with friends and enjoying myself my last year of college was all gone due to the lockdown. I lost a job offer, plans for the spring and plenty of friends. Including someone I was dating.  I graduated in a year that no one really cared for since everyone was worried about covid and the job market, so I didnt really feel like celebrating it either. 

Not too bad so far, I at least have my degree and new career to start, right? Well i end up getting arrested and now have to deal with that for 6 months while also dealing with the fallout for the next year. While I learned my lesson from the situation, it also hasnt been helping that I feel like this will be with me for the rest of my life. I have no idea how it's going to affect me long term and it isn't violent. But with the job market the way it is, I'm afraid I might have to the stay at the job I'm currently at for who knows how long until I find something else. I've been here about 6 months and I'm starting to let it get to me. 

I just turned 24 and feel like I've done virtually nothing in the past few years. I have no real career, no relationship, all my friends are in the city and the one thing I do have now is a record which I obviously didn't want. I've been gaining weight and I dont want to go to a gym due to covid in my area being high so I just dont think it's safe.

I'm worried about getting projects done and internships (are part time internships common?) in order to be employable when I finish school, as I live in an area where I know I will have to move for a job.  But without any experience it will be difficult to get hired, especially for a good job that pays close to what I'm making now (I make more that most entry level jobs I've seen, but not even close to mid or high level jobs so I know that even if I take a pay cut for my first SWE job it will be worth it in the long run).  I guess I'm just looking for advice on trying to juggle personal projects and self learning when it seems like there are never enough hours in the day."

I don't even really know what jobs I could apply for, aside from SQL centered ones, which I haven't found many of. And I took a bunch of basic programming courses. By August, I'll have taken 3 courses on Java; so, I should be a relatively competent programmer. As it stands, I know the basics fairly well. Arrays, variables, data types, pointers, references, using files, for/while/do-while loops, form creation, etc.

I've been pounding the pavement for years now, and I have not much to show for it. Except my grants and mild scholarships and a couple semesters of President's List. But no one is hiring me as an intern out of like 20 applications over this year; so, I'm wondering if I'll even be able to get a full time decent job to both survive and further improve my skillset.

Since I have grants lasting the year, I found I could obtain a General Studies A.S. in addition to my A.A.S. by the end of 2021. 

So, I could put an Associates Degree and an Associates of Applied Science on my resume. Would that make any difference? The A.S. could be used more generally to upgrade to a wider range of bachelors; the A.A.S. could only be used to get a B.A.T., but I could go for that, too.

Well I finished the extension, so you can download it [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sheets-job-clipper/glhhocealegfgggkooijdlbffhfagcgi/related) (also free)! Here's how you use it:

1. open the popup and connect to sheets
2. copy your spreadsheet's url into the extension
3. When you find a job on linkedin or indeed or wherever, just open the extension, fill out the fields, and hit submit. The extension will automatically append this entry into the 'applications' tab of your sheet.

No need to manually enter internship applications in your spreadsheet, just use this extension whenever you apply somewhere online!

Amazon:

* San Francisco
* \~9500/month
* \~6k relocation after taxes

PayPal

* San Jose
* $46/hour
* $0 relocation AFAIK

Salary isn't a big concern me for the internship, but would matter more for a new grad role. Would anyone also know if salary difference there? Thanks! :)

I was in the IT position for almost 2 years, although to be honest it was pretty basic help-desk work with only occasional glimpses into server administration. My tutoring was programming related, however it was more beginner oriented (with a focus on data science libraries).

Although I'd say I have a pretty good understanding of data analytics libraries in Python, I can't say I really have any ""stack"" of technologies that I have fully mastered. It was challenging for me to really settle in any one aspect of Computer Science, partially because I was uncertain about continuing my CS degree and had at a couple of times considered switching to Information Systems.

Despite my indecision during my degree, I feel a bit more confident in myself towards pursuing a CS career. However, given that I don't have any direct industry experience through internships or have thorough project experience of a certain set of technologies, I'm not really sure how to approach the job market.

My question to you guys is, do you have any suggestions on what else should I learn so that I can finally get that first dev job? I know that I need to dive into some projects, but what are some other technologies/concepts that I should pay attention to, so that I can reach the next level?

Bear in mind that I do know the basics of front-end with HTML, CSS and JS, but I'm not the biggest fan. Looking for some advice for the back-end with python.

b4 u read the rest of this, just know that everything's gonna be okay. i pinky promise. cross my heart and hope to die stick a pinecone in my eye type of promise, okay?

it's okay to be sad right now. cry, scream, throw a fit- you're allowed to. don't let anyone tell you otherwise. but remember, you've got at least a solid 70-80 years left to live- the game isn't over so don't quit now. four years of college will be just a blip in the timeline. today- right now, this moment, that rejection, that deferral. it'll be nothing compared to the awesomeness you'll achieve in your lifetime. and i promise- you'll achieve something. you might not realize it when it happens, but when you're retired and reading a good book in a rocking chair on a countryside porch, you're gonna think to yourself, ""damn. i did that."" and i wish you knew that you've already done that. 

i know this week has been absolute shit for a lot of y'all. maybe it's been okayish for a few. dreams came true, dreams didn't come true. finals were beasted, finals were bombed. it's okay to be mad at the world. but remember, this year isn't the series finale, just the season's. 

i know a lot of the kids here are gunning for ivys and T20s, so imma let you in on a little secret.

if yale, harvard, penn, brown, stanford and whatever other crap is out there didn't take you- you're not missing out on anything. they are. universities are a business, and they just lost out on an awesome profit margin. 

but that's besides the point. why do people want to attend ivys? some do it to prove that their effort and sacrifices over the past 4 years were worth it. that there's some payoff for skipping all those parties and school events. for bartering a childhood for a better future. others do it for the bragging rights, for the name. so they can get back at the kids who said they were dumb. so they can get back at all the teachers, relatives, and strangers who ever wronged them. some are obsessed with the community. others the culture. the academic programs, the career opportunities. the bandwagon, the clout chase. we all have our reasons. 

but you've gotta understand, an admission isn't going to satisfy any of these desires. at least not admission to a T10 or T20. 

because here's the truth. you go to a fancy school, you trap yourself in a vicious cycle i like to call the prestige pounce. harvard isn't enough. once you're there, you'll be torturing yourself to get the most prestigious grants and programs, internships and fellowships. you'll always be looking behind your back because you go to school with kids who have spent the past 4 years training to be professional snakes. you're going to have to spew nonsensical idealistic bullshit at every turn because that's what the upper echelons of society likes to delude themselves with. that they're making the world a better place. who founded the companies responsible for global warming, privacy invasions, pharmaceutical inflation? they did. stop and think, do you really want to be one them?

there's too many people in high places with holes where their hearts should be. y'all are good kids. i know most of y'all wanted that admission so you could have a chance at being heard, at changing the world for the better. prestige is power. but having that power is only worth it for one reason and only one reason. 

that wonderful human idealism that makes everyday worth living. that lets us believe in tomorrow. 

we're always taught that the people at the top have the most power- they call the shots. we're taught to crawl and climb the day we're fresh out of the womb. 

but y'all know geometry. the top stands on the bottom. when the bottom rumbles, the top topples. if you really want to change the world- if you're serious about it- you can. no matter where you are in this fucked up pyramid we call society, you have power. you've already got all the prestige you'll ever need.

remember to rumble my dudes. it's all going to be okay. i promise."

As the title says, my profile is quite research heavy for an undergrad. I began research because my undergrad school encouraged it and kinda went with the flow. Now I have 4 research internships, a few journal papers, a few conference papers (all first or second author), some scholarships for pursuing research internships abroad (I'm Indian) and some awards by my college for research endeavours (basically all academia, nothing industrial).

I am in CS, pursuing research in ML and Computer Vision, and would be applying to grad schools in the next cycle. I plan to apply to some of the top 10 schools in US as well (Stanford, Berkeley etc etc)

It could be, perhaps, that his permissions weren't set quite right.

But I think that the most likely reason of all,

May have been that his team spirit had taken a fall.

Whatever the reason, the pressure or its choosers,

He stood there on Christmas Eve, hating the users.

&amp;#x200B;

Staring up from his cave, with a status set to :frown:

At the warm lit monitors in the cubicle lined office town.

For he knew every user in Cubeville above,

Was busy now mistreating the IT gear with a shove.

""And they're installing malware!"" he cried with pain so pure,

""Tomorrow is Christmas! They'll have to call me in for sure!""

Then he sneered, and fired off that rapid e-mail warning,

""I MUST find some way to stop Christmas shenanigans from coming!""

For Tomorrow, he knew, all the users and their toys,

Would saturate the network. Bandwidth lost on useless ploys!

&amp;#x200B;

And then! The service calls! The non-essential service calls!

Calls! Calls Calls!

That's one thing he hated! Non-essential AFTER-HOURS CALLS!

CALLS! CALLS! CALLS!

Then the users, young and old, would share the wifi key with a scream.

And they'd stream! And they'd stream! And they'd STREAM!

STREAM! STREAM! STREAM!

They would stream on Netflix, on Spotify, and any others popular now.

Which was something the Sysadmin just couldn't allow.

And THEN, they'd do something he permitted least of all!

Every user in Cubeville, the tech savvy and the not-on-the-ball,

Would stand close together, pillaging the network with haste.

They'd all group together. And the users would start to waste!

They'd waste bandwidth! They'd waste terminal server resources!

WASTE! WASTE! WASTE!

&amp;#x200B;

And the more the Sysadmin thought of this extra Christmas work,

The more the Sysadmin thought, ""I'll lock down this whole network!""

""Why, for thirty-three years I've put up with it now!""

""I MUST stop these shenanigans from happening, But HOW?""

Then he formed a plan! An awful plan!

THE SYSADMIN FORMED A WONDERFUL, AWFUL PLAN!

""I know just what to do!"" The Sysadmin typed on his tablet.

And he made a restrictive network policy then quickly enabled it.

And he laughed, and he gloated, ""What a great Sysadmin trick!""

""With this policy active, permissions will be much too strict!""

""All I need is a valid reason…"" The Sysadmin scanned the network.

But, since good reasons are scarce, there was none that would work.

Did that stop the grouchy Sysadmin? No! The Sysadmin simply said,

""If I can't find a valid reason, I'll make one up instead!""

&amp;#x200B;

So he called the CEO, Bill. Then he took buzzwords mixed with some fear,

And he spun tales of ransomware and foreign hackers in his ear.

THEN he lauded his plan as the only fix to these problems you see,

The clueless executive team and Bill were powerless but to agree.

The Sysadmin's plan was comprehensive and far-reaching,

Toward the office cubes he did fly, empty of users late into the evening.

All their monitors were dark. Quiet stillness filled the place.

All of the users were gone, not even one little trace.

When he came to the first cubicle in the office space.

""This is stop number one,"" the sour Sysadmin bellowed,

And he reset the password, then verified the network policy followed.

&amp;#x200B;

Then he assailed the firewall content filter. All would be blocked.

But, he made an exclusion for Bill, or he'd soon find himself defrocked.

He got hung up only once, for but a moment or two.

A bit zealous with the web filter policy and cut himself off too.

Where the little user IoT devices sit on their desks in a row.

""These useless widgets,"" he grinned, ""are the first things to go!""

Then he shambled and crept, with a smile most unseemly,

Around the office, and he took any device not provided by the company!

Smart picture frames! And Chromecasts! Bluetooth Speakers!

USB doodads! Tradeshow thumb drives! And Android Streamers!

And he sorted them in bins, one by one, very efficiently.

Stored all the bins in his office, under lock and key.

Then he slithered to the office kitchen, he took the users coffee!

He took the sugar and cream! He took the snacks and even the tea!

He cleaned out the fridge with quickness and fervor.

Why, that mean Sysadmin even emptied the office water cooler!

&amp;#x200B;

To his basement he hauled the office coffee and confectionery.

""And NOW!"" smiled the Sysadmin, ""I'll horde all the stationery!""

And the Syadmin took the staples, but left everyone their stapler.

When he heard a shrill sound like the front door alarm beeper.

He turned around quickly, and he saw the new office nerd!

Little intern user, putting in extra hours trying to surpass the herd.

The Sysadmin had been caught by this student outright,

Who's ambition to get ahead brought her back late into the night.

She stared at the Sysadmin and said, ""what are you doing here guy?""

""Why are you taking all our devices and widgets? WHY?

But, you know, that Sysadmin was so clever and so sneaky,

He thought up a fib, and he thought it up quickly!

""Why my sweet office newbie,"" the smug Sysadmin lied,

""All these devices need updates for security to be complied.""

""So I'm taking them down to my office, my dear.""

""I'll update them down there. Then bring them back up here.""

And his lie was believed by the intern. Then he gave her a fright,

And he said the Internet was updating and wouldn't work tonight.

And when the intern user left the office a little bit confused,

HE resumed securing the office IT systems from being abused!

&amp;#x200B;

Then the last act of defiance, was to set MAC filtering on the wifi!

Then he slunk back to his basement, the devious untruthful sly.

On their desks he left nothing but some old velcro cable tie.

And the one speck of food that he left in the office,

Was the rotten brownbag that wouldn't be eaten even by a novice.

Then the Sysadmin made sure to hit every users station,

Leaving them barren, bereft of all personality or decoration!

It was quarter past dawn… All the users, sleeping with pleasure,

All the users, still snoring when he packed up their treasure,

Packed it up with their widgets! The java! The branded swag!

The projector! And the laminator! The scanner! Every laptop bag!

&amp;#x200B;

Two levels down, below even his dungeon, lay the building furnace,

He ferried there his load to commit it to the fires with a grimace!

""What a bunch of losers!"" he said of the users bluntly and cunning.

""They're finding out now that no Christmas shenanigans are coming!""

""They're just getting into the office now! I know just what they'll do!""

""They'll stand there in stunned silence a minute or two,

Then the users up in Cubeville will all cry BooHoo!""

""Those sweet tears,"" grinned the Sysadmin, ""I simply MUST see!""

So he paused. And the Sysadmin viewed the feed from camera three.

And he did see a sight beaming over the screen before him.

It started out dim. Then it became clearer as if on a whim.

But the sight wasn't sad! Why, that sight even seemed merry!

It couldn't be so! But it WAS merry! VERY!

&amp;#x200B;

He stared up at Cubeville! The Sysadmin checked his feeds again!

Then he shook! What he saw defied all logic and wracked his brain!

Every user up in Cubeville, the tall and the small,

Was festive together! Without any frivolous technology at all!

He HADN'T stopped Christmas shenanigans from coming! THEY CAME!

In some weird unexplained way, they came all the same!

And the Sysadmin, with his slipper clad feet sweating by the fires heat,

Stood puzzling and puzzling: ""How could they be so upbeat?""

""Good times are being had! They came without having to call me!""

""Good times without doodads, devices or coffee!

And he puzzled a long while, till his puzzler hurt and hindered.

Then the Sysadmin thought of something he hadn't considered!

""Maybe Christmas,"" he thought, ""isn't something to abhor.""

""Maybe Christmas…perhaps…could bring joy and more!""

And what happened then? Well.. In Cubeville they say,

That the Sysadmin's team spirit grew tenfold that day!

And the minute that great weight was lifted,

He rushed up with his haul from the dark basement and gifted,

And he rolled back the restrictions! And brought back the lot!

And he, HE HIMSELF! The Sysadmin brewed the first coffee pot!

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, this is a repost (I post it every year around the holidays).

kf0jty,2,2020-12-17,Letting my CompTIA certs expire,HomePCOmaha,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/kf0jty/letting_my_comptia_certs_expire/,"They haven't helped me one iota in getting a job. I'm in my 50's and have no doubt that there is a huge amount of age discrimination involved. I also firmly believe that there is discrimination against those who haven't been in the military when applying for government positions, which is what is 95% available here. Local companies aren't heavy into protecting their assets and those that are have a large pool of applicants to choose from willing to work at much lower wages than the national norm. There is no shortage. I had two interviews here locally in two years time. They were both at the same place, one year apart. They apparently didn't remember interviewing me the first time.  I have no doubt that they didn't hire me because of my age after my first interviews. I even went down to applying for entry-level positions. No bites. 

 I was a Senior Software Engineer up until 2003 and have operated my own Computer repair service since. I have tons of experience involving communications protocols. I understand TCP/IP, SPX/IPX, sockets, firewalls, and general networking equipment inside and out. I've ripped every type of computer device down to its motherboard and built it back up. I've seen every type of malware known to exist. I purposely skipped the A+ and Network+ certs as I wouldn't learn anything from them.

After only 2 interviews in 2 years time,  I was left feeling as if I wasn't worth a paper bag to hold dog crap in; especially after talking to one recruiter (former vet) for the government who made me feel worthless because I wasn't from the military.He wanted me for a help desk position. I'm sure many corporations would like to have me for a low paying (think almost minimum wage) help desk position.  Not going to happen. The only offers for employment I have had always seem to come from individuals with a foreign accent working for some unknown recruiting agency wanting me to work in the D.C. area or in the Seattle area and haven't even read my cover letter or resume trying to match me to the job I was looking for. They've offered low-management positions for software QA/security/devOPs and other software-related type positions to which I'm not interested nor even feel qualified for without any 'relevant' Cyber Security experience or top-level positions like managing the overall Cyber Security department for which I'm not qualified for.  They don't even read the resume; they have automated software that scans resumes on public sites for keywords.  If I wanted to get re-involved with software, I'd go back to development/engineering, but I'm burned out on it. 

Does it bother anyone else that all these recruiting agencies run by foreigners are hiring for government positions??????

I wanted a simple mid-level ""Cyber Security Analyst"" position. That's what I would be good at. I'm an extremely logical and analytical individual. My math scores in college for advance classes were top of the chart.  I thought the best approach would be to get me involved with a CIRT team and hit the floor running learning on the ropes. I guess I'm wrong. I'm too old to spend five years at a help-desk.

 I've put in around 100 applications over the last two years since I received my Security+ in April 2018 and my CySA+ in October 2018, both on my first attempt. I even applied for some intern positions but my application wasn't moved to the final candidates. Go figure. I'm not qualified as an intern. I found myself applying for positions I wasn't really interested in. It has gotten to the point that I had to take a step back and ask myself ""what the hell am I doing?"". I found m myself applying for jobs I really wasn't interested in. I wanted to get into the mainstream again because I thought I had something to offer in terms of real security and there was this supposed shortage of qualified people and it would pay well. It's a lie. 

Anyway, I've been left feeling deeply depressed and distressed over the whole ""we need Cyber Security professionals"" and ""here's how much you can make"" fabrication. I was studying for the PenTest+ and CASP+ after my other certs, but I gave it up months ago as I didn't see the point without a career path. 

Anyway, if anyone has read this far, don't get discouraged. If you are older and willing to relocate your family, or willing to trust a foreign accent that doesn't work at a brick-n-mortar shop, or if you are very young with time to spend working your way up the ranks, you will do fine. But it's not for me. I'm going back to running my business and choosing my own hours and spending time with my family, even if it doesn't pay the greatest. If the world doesn't want me, it's their loss."

I'm lucky enough to have a job during the pandemic - however, the pandemic has given me a lot of time to pause and think about my future. I've always really regretted not taking comp sci, and I feel like because I'm young, I still have time to change my path in life to something I like. Admittedly, I need to gain the skills and the thinking (as in how to tackle problems) of a software engineer. In the short term financially, it makes no sense for me to go back to school for another degree after having just graduated. For others who converted to comp sci after graduating in a different major, how did y'all go about making this radical shift?"

kf16o4,865,2020-12-17,"From a ""successful"" engineering student with a low GPA to another.",Akebelan28,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/kf16o4/from_a_successful_engineering_student_with_a_low/,"Looking back at my college experience which is ending next May (I will take 6 years to get my degree) . I am telling anyone who currently has a low GPA to try your best to get it up. I have been on this sub for a little while now, and I infrequently make post, but if there is one school of thought that should not be promoted. It is that, having a ""low GPA isn't that big of a deal"" or the whole idea that ""high GPA students are just book worms and don't get jobs because of it"". Almost implying that having a low GPA is a ""good thing"".


 I will be the first to say, having a low GPA is the reality of the situation for some people like my self, if it is your reality then of course make the best of the situation. Sometimes life gets in the way, and things happen, and you gotta make due. But do not for a second think having a low GPA will make you better off. I have been fortunate enough to get 5 different internships with 4 reputable companies through my entire time in school, and have also managed to get an offer from my dream job. Through my entire time in school, I have never had a CGPA higher than a 2.75. I have been on academic probation once, and have more C's than anything on my transcript. If there is one thing that I can say for any one who is struggling right now. It's GET YOUR SHIT together if you can. 



Right now you may be thinking: (if you're mechanical at least) ""screw thermodynamics, I don't want to do HVAC, I'm just trying to pass."" and although you may not be wrong about either one of those feelings. You have to try to get the best grades you can get in all of your classes, it will only help those future hiring managers see you in a positive light. I have had interviewers who loved my experience, loved my personal projects, loved my student org participation, but could not hire because HR mandates a specific GPA. Yes, I know it sucks, and yes it feels shitty. 



But the honest truth is, for entry level work. The company will be able to train anyone up to do the job if you have a BS in engineering, thus they will of course take the person who seems to learn technical information the quickest (all things equal). I have been able to find success with my low GPA, but my world would have been so much easier if I had taken my courses more seriously. By the time you get your degree, you may see school or have aspiration that are completely different than how you feel struggling now. When I first started my BSME I didn't care about GPA because I just wanted a job. Didn't have to be prestigious or anything I just wanted a JOB. 


Now that I am about to graduate, I have found that I have a love for vibrations/acoustics and would love to go to grad school, so I could stand a chance at getting an acoustic engineering position. Well if you know anything about grad school, most of them require a 3.0. Yes you can get around this, but my point still stays the same, make things in the future easier for you by sacrificing now. 



With my grades, and with Penn State being one of the few to offer an Acoustic MS. The likelihood of me getting in without retaking courses to prove I can handle being a good student, is not likely. I do not want to shit on anyone's success. I am just saying: that do not get complacent. If you can get a C in a class, then you can with more effort and time get a B or even an A. School is an investment, and getting the degree with a low GPA is not fair to yourself if you can change it. 

This post has gone on long enough, I just wanted to show the other side of the ""successful""  low GPA student.

Edit: format

Edit 2: I'm sorry if I gave the impression that ""GPA is life or death"". 

I more so wanted to give the impression if you need an extra kick to go from one grade to another, and the only thing stopping you from studying 3hrs instead of 2 hrs is laziness. Put in the work, get that good GPA your future self will thank you later. This isn't true for everyone, and definitely don't be mistaken. GPA, is one part of what makes you able to he hired. Get as many bragging rights as you can. Getleadership roles, internships, coops, research, projects, and the GPA."

this past May with a Systems Admin degree. I went into this field because I enjoy learning and had no distinct passions otherwise. Unfortunately my professors at my tiny college were not good and classes were mostly 6 weeks with only 2 hours of in-class teaching per week. I did not go on to get my bachelors degree yet because of financial reasons as well as wanting to get some experience in the field to make sure this is something I want to do for the rest of my life. I feel incredibly unprepared and uneducated due to the sparse education I received. I have been working at a local company as a helpdesk intern for 8 months now and have learned more from the other intern here than I ever did in school. To be honest, I barely have a grasp on basic concepts such as networking and hardware. The only reason I was able to get and maintain this job is because I have great interview skills and am willing to ask questions to learn what I don’t know. 
I want to branch out and start looking for full time employment but the only skills I have are basic troubleshooting skills. I am currently studying to get my Security+ and I am terrified that I will not be able to pass considering I barely have a grasp on essential IT concepts. I feel lost and stuck. My supervisor talked about a 1 year course he took that focused in on business-applicable IT practices and even included multiple COMPTIA certs with training. This sounds like something I need. The only thing holding me back from some of the obvious ideas (getting a bachelors) is cost. Are there any course/things that really helped you in your career? I’m great at customer service and communication. Any help welcome.

What I've found is that I've been getting passed the CV screening for a lot of companies such as Microsoft, Stripe, JP Morgan etc. However, every single company that has gotten back to me has either had a Leetcode DS and Algorithms style test or some sort of IQ/Pyschometric test before actually talking to a human being. I know I have to get better at Leetcode style questions but I don't have the time now since I'm in my final year of university. I think I have undiagnosed ADD and this has an effect on my IQ/Psychometric test performance where you have to do some task as fast as possible with accuracy, so I'm screwed when companies use these tests to screen out the bottom 60% of scorers for example. As a consequence, I have gotten around 20 Leetcode/Pychometric tests so far and I haven't talked to one person about my experience where I was actually working as a Software Engineer for 12 months. It's really frustrating. The only bit of success I've had is I passed a large London based investment bank's Hackerrank questions only to go on and completely bomb another HackerRank where I had to share my screen with an Engineer while he watched me try solve some problems.

Are there any companies out there that hire graduates simply by just asking technical questions and talking about projects and past experience? So far, I have found 0 and I'm not being snobby either with the companies I'm applying to. The only positions I don't apply to are consultancy companies, Software Engineering positions that are really Cloud Architect positions and Software Engineering positions that are really Tech support positions."

I was hoping I could get some advice about internships and co-ops from those that have already been there. 

My main question is: When is the right time to start looking for internships and co-ops? 

My school had a career fair in the fall, and I spoke to a couple companies about their internship opportunities, and while I had good interactions with most recruiters, they told me there wasn’t much they could do for me because I have yet to take any true engineering courses. 

I’m a returning student, having graduated a couple of years ago with a degree in Biology, and I’m currently pursuing a ME degree. I just finished Calc 1 this semester, and I’ll be taking physics 1 and Calc 2 next semester. While I still have not taken any upper level engineering classes, I have completed enough hours for my degree to be considered a second semester sophomore. 

Should I currently be looking into internship/co-op opportunities, or is it a waste of time until I’ve taken true engineering classes such as Statics?

Thanks!"

I am a sophomore ECE (looking to go into embedded systems), trying to figure out plans for summer 2021. Obviously it would be ideal to have an internship, but am not sure if at this point I would be competitive in landing one. I have  a high GPA (3.9) and will plenty fundamental skills by the end of this year, but I don't have any projects or experience that may bolster my resume.

I am wondering at this point how realistic it would be to have an internship this summer given my experience. I am living in Seattle and there seems to be plenty of internship opportunities in the area. I am thinking reaching out to smaller startups in the area may be a better route to go than mass applying for internships listed up on places like indeed. Any insight for what I should be expecting, how to make myself more competitive or alternatives to an internships I should look for this summer would be super helpful."

kf8x5t,2,2020-12-17,Should I go back to Brazil?,heis3r_,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/kf8x5t/should_i_go_back_to_brazil/,"As you might've guessed, I'm brazilian. I went to a brazilian university for about a year, but I didn't really take it seriously cause I had just got out of school and still had kind of a childish mentality. The university was absolutely great, one of the top universities in Latin America, specially in the Economics field of study (which is what I study). By the end of 2019 an oportunity to study in Portugal came up and I took it without even thinking twice, mainly 'cause I was eager to live by myself and also 'cause I had never visited another country. The city I grew up in, Brasília, is the capital of Brazil and where most of the biggest banks headquartes are located at, and also all the government things and etc. So it's basically a **gold mine** for Econ students, whether you want to work in the financial market, government projects or in consulting firms. The university I went to also has one of the biggest junior companies (is that how you call it in english?) in Latin America and maybe in the world, it's a consulting firm.  


So, in September 2020 I came to Portugal aiming to get a degree and live in Europe. I'm staying at Faro, a **very** small town in the south of Portugal (the neighbourhood I lived in Brazil has almost the same population, about 60k residents) and it is a very touristic town. In my first day at college, I spent the whole class looking for internships opportunities and I **literally** found nothing, all the jobs and opportunities are in bigger cities like Lisbon or Porto. We also need to take into consideration that the university I go to here doesn't have much renown as my previous one did. All that plus the fact that I'm living in a shared house that doesn't even have hot water in the showers (imagine getting through european winter taking cold showers). 

Europe has great opportunities, of course, but I caught myself thinking that maybe this isn't the right time for me to be here, at least not in Portugal. I was thinking that the best career choice for me is to attend to college in Brazil, at a bigger and more respected university, and later try a job in Europe. Moving to a new country by myself and having to study so hard to make my parents money worth, I think that Portugal gave me the mentality I needed to take the most out of a great university such as the one I went to in Brazil.  


I'm absolutely in love with Brazil and besides all the negative things happening recently, it is and will always be my homeland. Somehow I can't imagine myself finishing college here, though I can easily imagine that happening in Brazil. 

If I ever come back, I would have to pick up from where I left, that means staying about a year behind all my friends and everyone else. My previsions is that I would graduate with 24 or 25yo, and that kind of scares me? I keep thinking that graduating so late will be bad for my career life and etc.

I also feel that trying jobs in Brazil, I can get wherever I want with hard work, but in Europe I feel that no matter how hard I work, I will always be limited somehow for being an outsider, specially a latin american.

So my question is: should I keep studying in Portugal and maybe try a good life in Europe or should I go back to Brazil and get a better degree and try to come back to Europe later in life?"
kf9962,1,2020-12-17,Realistic Internship Advice,SG246,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/kf9962/realistic_internship_advice/,"Hi everyone!

I’m a female sophomore chemE student at a large CA public school, and I’ve been looking for internships—and like many others have had no luck. I attended the chemE career fair at my school this fall, and right off the bat it was pretty depressing because like half of the companies that usually show up showed up this fall. I spoke to like 3-4 companies and actually got an interview request from Chevron, which I had like 2 months ago. Being my first interview ever, I didn’t think it went super great but it was alright in any case I wasn’t shocked when I got a rejection like 2 weeks ago. Since that interview I’ve been applying to internships online, maybe not as much as I should’ve but I think I’ve had a solid 30 applications in. Most of these I never even hear back from, but I’ve gotten a few rejections. At this point I’m feeling mildly hopeless. I feel like the market for chemE interns has suffered a bit as many companies including oil that take sophomore interns are just pulling from last years pool, in addition to the fact that I’m just clearly lacking something these companies want. 

I need some tough realistic advice on what I can do, knowing that right now is not really a time I can improve my credentials. 
Currently I’m aiming to go to grad school, and I’ve found that some colleges are still hosting research programs for undergrads that provide a stipend, but many have gotten cancelled. Since internship recruiting season is coming to an end, should I just aim for those instead? Most of their deadlines are in February or late jan. 
Should I genuinely try reaching out to people on LinkedIn or is it too late, how could that even apply to chemE internships?
Many of my friends who get internships rn have family or family friends that are in that engineering field, my family is not in the position to help that way. 

Other info:

Gpa: rn cumulative 3.98, after this quarter could go down to around a 3.9 (no final grades yet)
Finished diff eq (last math class) this quarter, I’ve taken all the physics and math courses required of me

Involvement: 

-polymer research lab that I was active in last year and was supposed to work in this year and get my own project w python coding but sadly it got disrupted as I can’t go into lab and prof has other priorities rn

-AIChE chapter on the external affairs committee so we organized some stuff like a job board and an alumni panel

-was chosen to be on the chemecar team for my school but that also got cancelled 😃

-in one of the prestigious student orgs at my school that uses alumni funding to put on large, well known events for the whole school

-applying for positions/scholarships from my sorority

-job as a math tutor


At this point I’m not fooling myself, I know my chances of getting an internship for this summer are slim. Should I take an alternate path? I need something to show for what I did over 2021 summer to be in a better position for next years recruiting."

I’m not experienced at all, I’ve only ever taken two computer science courses in my life, passed both with an A but thats with a lot of help from my peers and teachers. I’ve never even coded outside of a school setting. Please point me in the right direction and let me know what I should be focusing on, any online courses or YouTube videos would be greatly appreciated, act as if I’m starting completely from nothing. I’ve heard the interviews aren’t too difficult but that doesn’t really make me feel better because like I said, I’m very inexperienced, honestly didn’t even think I would be asked to interview, I only applied for the internship as an afterthought. Btw my programming language of choice is python if that makes any difference. Thanks again!"

This is also combined with me outlining the languages I know. If I try to cut it any more, I'll be missing what I consider to be some important information.

**Letters of Recommendation**

Counselor: he knows me pretty well. I've been careful to interact with him throughout the years. He knows i'm dedicated to neuro and that I'm academically quite intelligent.  I'm sure the letter was positive, but he's a mediocre counselor so....

Research Teacher: had her every year of high school, she loves me, I love her, she sponsors my club (said yes even before i told her what the club was lol), she said she had to make a table of contents

Calc AB teacher: we're great friends :) he also knows me in the context of my Student Government role and values me as student leader and a math student. Also ure it was positive

Principal Investigator of my internship lab (for Columbia and planning for Duke, Penn, Yale, and Harvard): she let me read it. it was rly good and she highlighted my ability to work with professionals, high caliber of scientific research work, and etc. she said she thinks i'm top 0.5% which is rly something lol

**Interviews**

UPenn: interviewed with someone who looked like my dad lol. He and I had a very interesting conversation, and he said he was very impressed with my answers and candidacy. He said he will write a strong review. my first college interview, so I think it went rly well and will help my app :)

Yale: interviewed w a current senior bc apparently lack of alumni in my area. interviewer seemed a little awkward/unsure/inexperienced,  but we have a lot in common and i think it generally went well. Could've been better, but nothing bad happened.

**Essays**

Lots of time spent on essays in general.

PS was about a negative life event, how I overcame it with the help of my community, and how I developed a positive, active life outlook (sounds bad when i write it like this, but my reviewers were all impressed and moved)

My other essays, depending on the topic of the essay have been about

1. my work with art and how I view creativity as a means to express the truth in painting and in science
2. how my neuroscience internship fueled my passion for the subject because of the interdisciplinary applications of neuroscience I discovered through it
3. founding HOSA at my school where med related opportunities were scarce and making an impact by providing those opportunities for current students and future students
4. my experience in my art studio where I realized the cyclical nature of the student-mentor relationship

I was initially looking at Entry Level Software Engineering positions focused on Embedded Development but realized that I didn't really have any passion to relive the same stuff I worked on in school.  I did an internship (which I thoroughly enjoyed) last summer in a QA position where now that I look back on was fairly close to a Data Engineering.  The internship focused on mainly adding new features to the company's in-house software that was written in C# and would get/send info from their SQL database.  I initially started with zero C# and SQL knowledge (they knew this) and near the end was able to do full-stack for a new desktop application that would essentially pipeline information from tested products to the database as well as generate .csv reports summarizing info from whatever query they wanted.  I've interviewed with a few companies but was rejected because I lacked experience or a few skills they required.  I've taken several courses in Embedded Systems, Data Analysis, and standard programming courses (Data Structures &amp; Algorithms, OOP Concepts, Advanced C Programming).

So here I am, little lost about how to start. Unfortunately I didn’t do any internships while i was in school so I dont even have that experience to work with. 

My logic is to try for lab technician jobs to build my experience but I am worried that the freshness of my degree will soon be lost and I will never be able to get an engineering position . I has anyone started off as a tech and moved up toward engineer?"

I want a general idea of what my chances are, and what I should focus on to improve. Thanks for taking the time to read!

**Demographics:** Female, White, Arizona. ""College prep"" public school (top in state I think), no financial aid needed

Hooks: woman in STEM

**Intended Major(s):** Computer science (or possible double major with something else)

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:**

PSAT: 1440 (last year)

Im a Junior, so I haven't taken anything yet. SAT likely around 1520+ (1530 best practice test score)

**UW/W GPA and Rank:** 

* 4.0/4.4
   * note: Taking many more ap classes this year than before, so weighted will increase 
* School doesn't rank

**Coursework:**

* Currently taking 4 (predicted: three 5's and one 4 probably)
* One self studied (predicted 5 on exam)
* Senior year- planning 5 ap classes, 6 tests (econ is 2 tests)
* My school, because it's ""aCaDeMiCaLlY RiGoUrIoS"", calls all non ap classes ""honors"". Don't know if that actually really means anything though, since they aren't weighted

**Extracurriculars:** 

I only got into programming this summer, so I'm just now starting to do a lot of related activities. Also I really didn't think that much about college for the past couple years, so this isn't very strong yet. I'm starting to do a lot now. 

* Mock trial- will be 4 years. Possible leadership position next year
* Web development internship (all the other interns are college or post college, so this is probably my most impressive thing)
* Self taught programming
* Web development- making websites for non profits
   * So far have done one for my mock trial club, and currently making one for a fairly big chess organization
   * I am planning to do this much more of this next summer
* Tutoring
   * Local tutoring organization + online

**Awards:** 

Nothing big yet

* mock trial awards
   * Team- 2nd place regional, qualified for state (cancelled because covid)
   * individual- misc school and competition awards (most improved, outstanding advocate, outstanding witness)
* 2nd place in high school programming contest (advanced division)
* aiming for national merit scholarship (I think I can hopefully get to semi finalist at least)

**Essays/LORs/Other:** 

I think I'm a pretty good writer, but haven't started even thinking about essays.

Pretty strong possible LORs I think

**Schools:** Stanford (probably REA), MIT, Caltech, Harvey Mudd. Plus, looking for some ideas of what schools are targets/reaches for me. Please crush my overinflated ego, thanks!"

I was wondering if anyone knows if this is mandatory, or if it’s something they just tell students because they prefer interns to be juniors. I don’t really want to spend money on grad school immediately after getting my bachelors, but I will if I have to. Will they care/will my full time offer after the internship be rescinded if I don’t attend a one year masters program? Thanks!"
kfec13,1,2020-12-17,I don't know what to do about my brother's recent change in behavior towards me.,Sweet_Lillylove,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/kfec13/i_dont_know_what_to_do_about_my_brothers_recent/,"Edit: I forgot to add that I'm a 23F. My brother is 22M, my best friend is 24M and my husband is 25M. Other super close friend is 20M

So I have a half brother, we have the same dad but different moms. We were raised apart our whole lives but I met him once in 5th or 6th grade since we went to the same school together but then I moved and went to another city when I was 10. I lost all contact with him since then. I met and found him again around the same time I met my now-husband. I married my husband 34 days after meeting him lol. I saw my brother day of my wedding is the first time we saw each other in years. This was back in very early 2019. I'm actually super excited right now because a few days ago was the anniversary of us meeting each other and we had a very cute date, and in exactly 31 days is our wedding anniversary which I'm all giddy about. Sorry got off-topic. Since the wedding, my brother and I didn't talk for a long time again until this October.

He really likes a girl and wanted my advice. So, he came over to my place and we talked for a few hours. During that, he had a hard time explaining how he was teaching a girl he liked how to bowl. He walked over to me and pressed up against me from behind. He had one hand on the side of me and the other on y arm as he explained what he was doing. This lasted about 10 seconds but during it, mid-way through a sentence he suddenly paused and I actually felt his body flinch for a second and he right away let me go and sat down immediately at the table near me. Beforehand he was standing while talking to me and he even said he generally doesn’t like sitting and will stand and talk with people.

He then continued talking like nothing happened but stayed sitting for like 30 minutes. After that, he began calling and texting every day, sometimes multiple times a day always wanting to hang out with me. He literally has no problem driving every day 20 miles to see me. My best friend can't stand it. He says my brother is weird and this isn’t normal at all. He even got my husband involved and now my husband is suddenly using the excuse that because of the virus, my brother can’t come over anymore for the rest of the year.

I do understand why as things to way more deeper than my brother just him seeing me and talking to me all the time. My husband has no say in it as he stands firm with his word of my brother not allowed to see me for a while. My best friend points out every single thing of how it's so wrong. He will get absolutely angry over it and stuff. And here’s why. They went from saying it's awkward to absolute no about him about 2 weeks ago. And here’s why.

The texts suddenly changed about 2 weeks ago.I noticed when I would tell him something and he would tell it to someone else, he would refer it as ""My ex said this"" instead of ""My sister said this"" He shortly later started using a lot of love emojis when texting me. Like kissing heart emoji, emojis with hearts in the eyes, or just pure heart emojis towards me. It’s not just that but also texts he will say to me too. Like for instance my brother just found out the school I go to. He right away decided to transfer to my school. He even decided to take the exact same class as me despite him already taking the same class in the past and already knowing everything related to the teachings. I’m currently in Japanese business classes. Which is business but it’s taught in Japanese due to there being an internship attached to it that will take to me Japan in August. Thus I have to take a specific amount of Japanese classes as well despite me actually knowing Japanese already. Well… My brother actually also had a huge fascination with Japanese and finished all his Japanese courses last year so he’s fluent in it as well.

My brother often offers to help me with my Japanese homework even though I actually don’t need it, and also my best friend is Japanese, and he is generally always there to pretty much answer any questions I have anyways and I only need practice with things like not pausing so much when I speak in it. My pronunciation is perfect my best friend says, but we both noticed my brother has an accent or doesn’t pronounce certain words correctly and he talks like… in an anime type of way instead of like an actual normal conversation type. Also, my brother has issues with Kanji which both my husband and best friend know fully as they will help with that as they knew how to read in Kanji their whole life due to being raised in eastern Asia before coming to America, and I know how to read and write in Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji as well, but don’t know as many Kanji as a typical person compared to someone who is from Japan. Despite this my brother wants me to go to him instead of those 2.

Now for the stuff that my best friend and husband think is beyond okay. Some things my brother has said is very… IDK how to put it. He is very attentive to what he says. He will automatically correct himself if he notices something wrong in something he says. When he asked when we can meet up I said soon basically and he said “Sweet!!!” With blowing kiss emoji. I showed my husband instantly asking if it's normal for siblings to send emojis like that and he stared at it and read a bit of our messages and then said as a joke ""Does he realize we're not in Alabama?"" and dropped it at that for a while.

Another time I was talking about our dad's funeral. Our grandma from Dad's side out of the blue during it at the end of the day ran to my hotel in barely anything while naked. I told that to my brother and he replied with “I can imagine grandma let alone you naked in public sis” Which sort of led to him saying he would run naked if it was allowed. Then when I commented that the main reason I never show my body too much or wear fit tight clothing is because of the attention I get too much from men.

I have a body type that is sorta extremely noticeable. As I have very large breasts and a butt that’s large too, but my waist is small. I’m also like 5’2 so just small in general which does gain too much attention than I’d like. My brother mentioned that my body probably makes me pick up side-guys all the time even if I’m married with some side smile smirk whatever its called emoji and wink face emoji. The thing that bothers my best friend the most is when my brother and I were going to see each other and then as he was getting ready to go, my brother texted, “You wanna bang”. Which I just fully froze not knowing what to respond. My best friend asked what’s wrong and why I looked so pale and he looked at the text and got pretty angry and said “What the fuck?! What type of sibling says that shit?!” Another super close friend of mine also said pretty much the same thing.

I thought my brother meant to say hang but I noticed he didn’t correct himself. I asked what? With an lol because I didn’t wanna lose my mind. He then said it will wake me up. Then suddenly said “Wait you’re not a fan of energy drinks” which I never actually told him if I drink energy drinks or not, I only told him I don’t drink coffee. He then actually asked what flavor I wanted and which I chose Unicorn and then he actually brought an energy drink with the name Bang on it. My best friend left before my brother came. The next day my best friend kept pointing out how my brother purposely worded it the way he did. And that He’s testing me. And when it doesn’t go right he uses actual things as a backup plan to make it look like he was joking. And then said if my brother wanted to give me a bang energy drink he would have said “Do you want a bang?” or “Want a bang energy drink?” and not “You wanna bang?”

The second time something similar happened was when my brother asked for Christmas presents what I wanted. I said I really don’t know and he said something like “I just got an idea or am idea hehe” with that wide eye smirk again. I asked what Idea and he asked what I do for art. Then asked if I wanna procreate. I was like What again and my super close friend was with me in a Skype call when that happeend he Was so unhappy. He said he doesnt like my brother and he's a complete creep and I need to stop talking to him. Then my brother said it was a digital programing app and that it’s a monthly subscription thing. And said he can get it for me and I can mess around with it if I wanted to and that we can get started on it whenever I have time. Which I later told my best friend in the morning when he came over and he said why did my brother word it like that again and is like “See!!!! Do you see Sweet\_Lillylove!!! He sounds like he wants to bone you for fucks sake!!!” And that’s when he got my husband involved.

I showed my husband the texts already from previous things my brother said but this time I showed him the “Wanna bang” one too and the extra heart emojis and stuff and how my brother says he wouldn’t trade me for the world and that I’m everything to him. And my husband actually paused and made an expression I never seen him have before. And he put down my phone and said my brother isn’t allowed over anymore for the rest of the year. He pointed out that the day he came over my brother seemed too close to me too. As my brother sat facing towards me but we were so close that I was sort of between his legs as he man spread like normal guys do. But we didn’t have anything touching aside from my knees a bit on his lower thighs and when my husband saw that he didn’t know if that’s normal for siblings or not but felt like my brother was getting too close to me.

Last thing that happened was my brother a few days ago texted me about topics like porn and sex for like 2 hours. Asked about sensitive spots and I sorta had to explain a lot. And then he asked my personal like where I’m sensitive or if I watch porn and what categories or whatever like that. And I sorta just haven’t really talked to him since and barely reply but will answer the phone if he calls but I make it really short as I’m generally busy anyways.

But what should I do about this. My husband and best friend absolutely don’t like him. They are paranoid to even have me in the same room as my brother alone. They noticed within sentences back to back my brother said he fucks when he’s drunk, then the next literal sentence he said he had 2 different types of alcohol and asked if I wanted to drink it with him. But he can’t come over and my best friend will refuse to let me go see my brother. He made a comment also the other day of saying our dad would say something, but like… He’s only seen our dad like 5 times since being 8. But he said “If dad as alive he would say ‘hey kids! Nothing beats great porn, unless you got a chick with big titties’ I can just imagine dad saying that if he heard us talking” I tried to brush it off and said maybe who knows. While I know he’s made hints at my tits being big before.

I just want a normal sibling relationship but not this weird stuff. I don’t really know what to do at all. Does anyone have advice of what to do with my brother? Also my brother and I are 6 months apart in age. We are like a copy of each other in all interests and activities. So we get along super well. So I don’t wanna lose him, but I want things to go back to normal like it was a month ago.

TL:DR, Brother is being low key Alabama game of thrones with me and my 2 best friends and husband are not okay with it and IDK how to deal with it and want my brother to be normal again.

Edit 2: When my husband said my brother can't come over due to the virus and stuff he got himself tested a few days later and showed the results were negative right away so that he can see me again.

Edit 3: Half of my post is missing and I added it back on."

I’ve heard lots of conflicting info on this, and with 5 weeks left of my winter break, I’m trying to do a project. Does anyone have any good ideas for me and any insight in what employers are attracted to?

Mind you, this is in the context of someone seeking internships and not a full-time role, although insight into full-time would be useful to know as well for the future.

Imagine you were raped as a child.  Imagine you screamed, that it hurt, but no one cared.

Imagine that videos of you being hurt were shared for people's pleasure. 

Imagine if the abuse turned your focus inward, and you built a rich contemplative world to counteract the hell of our social reality.

Imagine if you were pulled from your home at 13 and believed someone might care enough to help about you.

Imagine how you'd feel when they put out cigarettes on you and beat you

Imagine the terror when you act out because they hurt you and you're labeled an ""emotionally disturbed minor"" and because the foster homes are for the more well-adjusted survivors of abuse, you end up in a large, warehouse-like facility for the refuse children unwanted by the country.

Imagine how your mind dulls when there isn't access to books in these places, when the schoolwork is fabricated and you're never taught anything (because your people don't go anywhere), when they pump you full of medication to keep you sedated because it's easier for them.

Imagine the loneliness when you turn 18 years old in a facility where you're not allowed to even hold someone's hand.

Imagine the inner torment when you mess up in some small way and they lock you in a small room, with no bed, a light that never shuts off, and a cold hard floor for days on end, because you weren't perfectly obedient.

Imagine the pain as you're beaten because you're not as dark as someone stronger; imagine this doesn't make you hate darker people, as the only people you can even remotely open up to in this hellish place are all darker than you and you see that goodness or hatred can come from anyone.

Imagine regularly fending off those peers who would assault you in the middle of the night, and learning that you are never safe.

Imagine being dumped out of the system at eighteen years old, and having nowhere to go.

Imagine wondering what's next because you'd been kept in a box for years, but there is no light to guide you.

Imagine how awkward you are as you begin to try to communicate to the outside world, now as a free person, when everyone else had a childhood and adolescence, some semblance of normalcy.

Imagine you improve.  You learn how to dress yourself and you take classes.  You go to community college.  

Imagine you love to learn and despite everything you dream of more, still.

Imagine you enroll in classes and begin to educate yourself.

Imagine the frustration when even though you don't have anyone or any resources, it's hard to get scholarships because you're not a POC, a woman, or LGBT; imagine that doesn't stop you from having all kinds of friends, because you're intrigued by the magnificent diversity of all people.

Imagine you love people and want to be close to them, but as you watch more relationships (of all kinds) fail, you realize you have been deeply broken.

Imagine you meet a girl you love enough to respectfully court for years, but she pulls away because you're broken.

Imagine you really loved her.

Imagine you spend years on therapy but it never seems to go anywhere.  You've been fighting entirely alone and you are tired.

Imagine you are continually suggested medication but you feel it turns you into a different person.  You still want to feel.  You are engaged in the human experience.  You never want to feel medicated again. 

Imagine that despite the emotional issues, you graduate college and work at non profits because you don't want people to hurt the way you have.

Imagine you still love her, seven years after she broke you.

Imagine you date another girl, even though the chemistry isn't great.  You get along so well.

Imagine you're in the relationship long enough to feel obligated to her even though it doesn't feel right.

Imagine the girl you loved comes back after you've dated new girl for three years.

Imagine when the woman you loved for a decade, when every single person you have cared about has left you, leaves over text because - quote - you are ""not convenient""; How convenient do things need to be when you would do anything for someone?

Imagine you end up at 30 years old with no one, sleeping in your car, educated but without purpose, direction, or emotional stability.

Imagine you decide to make a bunch of fucking money so pretty much everyone can eat your ass, and you get into a mediocre master of finance program at a decent school.

Imagine you parlay that into an investment banking internship, after hundreds of hours reaching out to people on linkedin, begging them to grab coffee with you, looking for that angle.

Imagine it's actually really hard because of ""diversity mandates'

Imagine you're starting to get tired of people not understanding that someone can be a different skin color and have virtually debilitating barriers.

Imagine if you dream of the slightest bit of compassion and understanding, but people don't understand; they couldn't.

Imagine you turn that into a job; you don't mind the hard work, you've had to work hard your whole life.

Imagine you're great at what you do.

Imagine you work your way through investment banking to working for hedge funds.

And now people look at you and see success, see the American dream

People see a white man with a good job.

But imagine you know the truth.  

Imagine you know you're not a success because no one has ever loved you.

Imagine the loneliness when you don't even have someone to pick you up after surgery, or check on you when you're sick; when your birthdays pass alone.

Imagine the years of abuse damaged you, physically, and doctors only ""might"" be able to fix you.

Imagine how you'd feel coming to terms with the reality that you would use your gun to blow your brains out if the only thing they can do is outfit an ostomy bag on you; you cannot live with that constant, physical reminder of what people have done to you.

Imagine you're 34 now and no one - no parent, close friend, or romantic interest has loved you, although you've loved people

Imagine it's your fault, because they've broken you, and no effort will be enough; you're probably not the most convenient choice for someone, you are rough around the edges.

Imagine even still, you prefer the isolation to the saccharine feel of psychotropic medicine.

Imagine this whole world of loneliness, poverty, and pain breaking down on you, but you look like the guy everyone wants to hate.

Imagine you just want to love someone, and maybe give a child the opportunities you never had.

Imagine you just wish someone would stop and realize how badly you've been hurt and how starved you really are, but all anyone sees is that you don't think exactly the way they do.

And then imagine you try to discuss this with the half-black daughter of a Denver post reporter, who went to nice schools and a world-class university with the backing of her adoring family and community.

Imagine she is infuriated by you when you tell her she had more privilege than you, and stomps off.

Imagine that even though you're successful, you're beginning to stop caring about helping people.

Imagine you're more alone than ever because even well-meaning people, with good educations, don't see what it's taken.

Imagine it's not in vogue to just be a person who has been tortured, one must have particular genitalia, melanin level, or sexual interests for society to care about your story, about your pain.

Imagine the last remnants of warmth are dying inside you because you see, more and more, that people only care about dealing with trauma in some abstract, generic sense

Imagine that you understand now that you are grown, and the terrified, scarred child inside of you will never get closure simply because no one has answers.

Imagine if you were strong enough that that would be ok, *if only just someone, anyone, really cared about your ordeal and what it has taken to get to where you are*.

But imagine no one does...

No one sees how tired you are.

No one cares about how hard it is to care when no one care about you.

That all the cliches people say might be true some of the time, but this world took everything from you and no one cares.

How would you feel?

How would you feel if you had no ill will toward anyone, black white, brown, purple?

If you called people sir and ma'am and dreamt only of a slight bit of recognition?  


If when you said ""injustices for people need to be rectified in an individual manner, we have to turn a blind eye to arbitrary characteristics like skin color or sexual preference,"" people took that to mean you don't care about black people?

If you want everyone to have some justice, including black people, including racial justice, but you don't want any one justice to make another person's injustice feel insignificant?

Imagine if everyone treats you like you're the asshole for that dream, that we could all treat one another a little better and that we're too focused on identity politics in a world of hurting people?

Would you just end it now?  How tired would you be?  


And as a side note, if you tell me to be understanding or that I don't understand my own struggles, you can eat my hairy ass."
kfg1si,0,2020-12-18,Applying for CS (Questions),kimee302,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/kfg1si/applying_for_cs_questions/,"Hello,

I'm planning on applying to Berkeley in the L&amp;S department next Fall. I will be transferring from CC as a junior. I'm leaning towards the Applied Math or Computer Science major but I've heard that once you do get accepted, you automatically start off undeclared. I know that it is going to be extremely competitive and given that I have about a year from now, I am willing to work super hard. I had a few questions however and would greatly appreciate any advices!

1. Regarding the CS major, do they care more about your grades or your experiences/projects (for admission)? I'm kind of torn between putting everything towards studying hard for my classes and getting straight A's or focusing more towards coding and getting some experiences (internships, side projects, etc). I definitely want a balance of both but as someone who struggles with math, I feel like I need to put more effort towards actually doing well in my classes. I don't think it'd make sense for me to put up my experiences and projects but present myself with a low GPA. I fear that if I were to go into the CS major, I would not have much coding experience and be completely lost. Is this something I shouldn't be worrying about as much since they will be teaching these things in CS classes?
2. We all know that when it comes to admissions, your personal statements matter **a lot.** To keep it short, I wrote my personal statements when I applied to schools last year and it was extremely bad. Got rejected left and right. Looking back however, I had no form of preparation and delayed those essays badly, so I ended up finishing them in a week or two *(I know. What was I thinking? But I'm a changed person now. LOL. I didn't care about my academics back then but I'm getting back on track in life).* So, my question with the personal statements is, how can I be well prepared for this as well? My writing skills are not up to par so I would love to prepare for them now. Whether it's taking a writing course or reading personal statement examples everyday, what are some other advices for writing a compelling statement?

Any help/advice would be appreciated! Thanks so much."

kfhi7a,1,2020-12-18,Advice on how to answer this question in an interview,_hashdash_,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/kfhi7a/advice_on_how_to_answer_this_question_in_an/,"Hey all,

I have had my fair share of interviews and this one question completely throws me off. I am currently working as an intern in a company and I am pretty sure they have no plans for new hires due to the current world situation.

Keeping this in mind, I have started applying to different companies for full-time positions and I have gotten some interviews. Some pre-recorded ones and some telephonic / video. The interview would go really well and at the end, they would ask me ""Since you are interning at XYZ, will they make you a full-time offer or is there a chance you would start working there?"" and I would answer since they are on a hiring freeze the chances are next to none. While on call, I can sense the confusion/non-satisfaction of the person interviewing me.

I am an international and I am fluent in German, not to the native level but I can fairly get by. The interviews would be primarily in German. If there are any technical questions that fumble me, I would ask the interviewer for permission and I would explain that part in English and then revert again to German.

I have no clue how else to answer this question and any advice on how to tackle it would be really helpful.

Thanks!"

I’m in my first year of software engineering at McGill and just had my first real programming class, ecse 202. I had very little programming experience before this semester.

At the start of the semester, I was feeling so optimistic about my major and the future careers it could lead to, but now I don’t know anymore. Just had my final today and it didn’t go great. However failing this class isn’t what worries me the most. I’m scared of moving on to harder classes and falling behind. Even after a semester, I still feel like I can’t code even just the basics.

The other people who around me already have so much experience programming and I just feel like I can’t catch up. A lot of people in SE and CS seem to have had a lot of previous programming experience. Everyone’s talking about side projects and internships while I can’t even write a simple program on my own. I struggled so much for the assignments in this class and still didn’t even understand them fully. I’ve been feeling so stressed and hopeless lately. 

I’m not sure if it’s the mix of online classes, global pandemic and prof Ferrie’s teaching style that’s making me feel this way, or if I’m actually just not fit for programming.

Does anyone had any advice/experience they could share with me about software engineering/computer science. Did anyone else start uni without any coding experience? Does it get better? Is there any ressources you recommend to get batter at coding? I’m sorry for all these questions, but I would really appreciate anything anyone has to say :))"
kfinxz,2,2020-12-18,6 months from graduating and have had no internships - am I screwed?,beacheytunez_,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/kfinxz/6_months_from_graduating_and_have_had_no/,"This may end up being more for a vent, but I really need so validation and fresh ideas, so here goes.

My university requires students to complete 800 hours of practical work (ie internships) before they are allowed to graduate with the expectation that they complete 400 hours per summer break.

1st year is a general year that everyone shares and decides their specialisation.

2nd year you begin studying your specialisation, but you're not very desirable to companies because of the basic level of your knowledge. I was unable to get an internship.

3rd year (present day) was primarily affected by COVID, and again I have been unable to find an internship.

The 800 hours has been revised in light of COVID to 400 hours, but this requires an application to be made. I have completed about 100 hours of notable practical work. However, I have only 1 semester to pull off the other 300 hours. 

\--

Am I completely shafted? No one at the university ever talked to us about finding practical work, when to begin looking, what counts as practical work (oh that's right. you an do your 800 hours, and then have them all rejected because the university doesn't think they were appropriate), or arranged any kind of placements for us. The only communication that we get for this requirement is through sporadic emails reminding people to submit their reports. 

Yet other students in my cohort are fine for their internships, I am definitely an outlier. I have had some serious (ongoing) mental problems surrounding the uni, and you can imagine that between getting rejected from positions day after day and then not having the heart to keep looking and applying my self-esteem is running pretty fucking low. I just feel so cheated by it all and I'm stressed out of my mind for a second year in a row. My overall GPA isn't great, but it's not offensively bad this year (5/9, B at my uni). 

I only scored one interview this year via nepotism and bombed it on the basis of the job requirements were not at all specified in the description, and I didn't match them.

I have enrolled in programs that will address my technical shortcomings (I've discussed before how we are not even taught fucking Python) and I'm really doing my best. I find the whole job hunting process very scary, because I have not yet had any success. I've applied for 15-25 roles each year and the rejection is killing me. The general attitude surrounding these work hours isn't even supportive in the slightest, it's just demanding and expectant, and we had no idea that it would be this way.

I'm tired, stressed to hell and it's ruining my Christmas for a second year. I just need some guidance

&amp;#x200B;

\--

TLDR: fuck my uni for not giving us any internship support, it's killed my self-esteem and I'm terrified of falling behind, please guide me sensei"

I'm purging all college-related material from my notes right now as a senior so hopefully this helps someone!

**APPLYING TO HIGHLY SELECTIVE SCHOOLS:**

Main facets of the application include: the academic portion (transcripts, really important), teacher/guidance counselor recommendations, and activities. \*everything matters\*

* Accept &gt;30% of applicants
* Students are top academically and have strong transcripts
* Take the highest level classes possible
* Doesn’t matter if you have one subject you love or are more well-rounded- depends on the student
* However, if you are interested in one subject, ex. English, don’t say that you creatively write in your spare time, but show how you’re interested. A good example would be talking about writing mentorship programs, your wordpress, your goal to write 10,000 words a week, and your volunteer experience as an English tutor, etc.
* Want students who impact their community, come from diverse backgrounds, and contribute in a classroom setting
* Brown and most wealthy schools have alumni interviews, and great financial aid
* Smaller schools sometimes have on-campus interviews with admissions officers
* In interviews, focus on who you are as a person; they want to know who you are and what you’re excited to do there
* Examples of interview topics you should include are favorite classes, teachers, research papers that you did well on, why you’re interested in the school, and what you plan to do there
* Brown itself meets 100% of demonstrated financial need and has scholarships; [https://www.collegegreenlight.com/](https://www.collegegreenlight.com/) has a list of colleges which meet these needs
* Some are more fluid in terms of ability to pay
* SEND YOUR FINANCIAL AID PACKET IN ON TIME to guarantee you get it
* Not usually mentioned, but if you need more money for financial aid you can appeal their decision (illness in the family, twin/multiple family members in college, etc.)
* Alumni will often meet you in a more neutral site; one Brown alumni at my school who conducted interviews said that he asks the following questions: what you like to do, family life, what excites you, the last book you read that wasn’t for school. Etc.
* Interviewers like when you ask them questions about the school- it peaks their interest. Research the college in advance
* Interviewers don’t see your submitted application, so assume they know nothing about you and fill them in
* The same interviewer mentioned above said that one student who he didn’t like in the process was ultra competitive and put down other high schools; be pleasant and focus on you
* A lot of athletes ED and are recruited
* Activities you list can be formal and informal: babysitting your siblings, jobs, internships, etc. Depends on the student
* Colleges want you to make an impact on campus and get involved with the community and extracurriculars and help teach other students, not hang out in your room playing video games
* More interest and leadership positions show you can make an impact in the community
* You can waive your application fee if you are first generation student, etc.; email the college to ask and talk about financial challenge

**DEMONSTRATED INTEREST:**

* In short, how interested you are in a school. Some schools keep track of how often you interact with them (tour them, contact admissions officials with questions, go to events, etc.), and can be deciding factors depending on the school
* Matters for certain schools and not others- research. Brown doesn’t really care, but colleges like Rice in Texas really do
* Keeping track of it in an Excel spreadsheet helps

**TESTING:**

* Most colleges accept unofficial testing, such as SAT subject tests- great idea. Show your strengths in certain subjects. Since optional, however, only turn in the good ones
* Instead of paying to send your scores to colleges, you can usually take a screenshot and upload it
* If something on an application is highly recommended, do it
* Colleges looks at multiple scores from your SATs and ACTs- can see your progress over time
* A new thing most colleges are doing in lieu of the writing portion of the SAT/ACT is sending in a graded paper you’ve written that you’re proud of (humanities, not lab)

**BROWN:**

* Very artsy, foodie culture; offers tax incentives for artists
* 1 hr from Boston and attracts a lot of concerts
* Welcoming
* Prefers different students
* OPEN CURRICULUM- one of five colleges in the United States with no course requirements (compare to Columbia, where everyone takes the same classes freshman year)
* As a result, academic and intellectual freedom and engaged in class
* Students still have to fulfill major requirements for their chosen courses of study
* Students select classes by sitting in on them
* Study abroad programs, research on campus, and internships (funds them if unpaid)
* Prefers more rigorous classes and won’t take college credits (UConn)
* 80 concentrations, and ⅓ of students double concentrate
* No minors, only majors"

kfo2gk,15,2020-12-18,College Impressions: Bates,[deleted],ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/kfo2gk/college_impressions_bates/,"I just officially committed to a college (not Bates) and still have all my typed-up impressions on my phone from a year ago. I was able to take a tour in person and I realize that's not possible now, so hopefully this helps someone add a college to their list or make a decision (I'd still recommend an online tour though). If you ask me to elaborate on a point though I probably can't because it was so long ago. Feel free to add stuff about it in the comments! My notes are a bit scattered but this is what I got out of it.

* Gorgeous tree lines campus with central quad, buildings old but architecture pleasing, dorms really modern with high ceilings and spaces- fantastic. Fields lovely,  nice stonework and tree lined streets. Saw ducks and very tiny cute dog :). My tour guide was very passionate and loved the opportunities Bates provided. Great bubble tea place nearby in downtown Lewiston (old blue collar mill town).
* You can live in theme houses with a specific focus but they change every year to prevent a fraternity-like culture. Fraternities replaced by clubs, somewhat aggressive club fair open to all regardless of skill
* Beginning of the year immersive experience levels 1-5; first two days at Bates to acclimate and next going to beaches and playing soccer (1) or intensive hiking and canoeing experience  (4-5). Bonding.
* Premed students can volunteer on an ambulance for 2-3 years, get EMS training, and get to know surgeons. Med school acceptance rate is 40% above the national average.
* 3 theaters, 2 blackboxes with plays written by students
* Amazing research opportunities.  Will pay you to cook for yourself, financial aid applies abroad (one guy took 5 abroad back to back), is willing to work with you to help
*  Intramural club and varsity sports,  8 dances a year and ones which aren't formal decades themed (80s, 00s, etc.) Students take dances very seriously and go to thrift shops months in advance.
* One professor took joint STEM geology and history humanities abroad to excavate Viking site in Greenland- historical and geological significance
* Students find new interests and end up in different places - accidental psych minor, guy finds abandoned guitar and joins band. Work with local politicians,  apply opportunities like water in local community. Popular class analyzes social ramifications and myths behind Disney movies. Often work with professor leads to presentation on a national scale. 
* One guy built an igloo on the front lawn and he and his friend group  (really diverse) slept in it. Everyone supportive,  tight, local involvement.
* Professor open door policy in main house,  unlimited printing opportunities.  Classes usually smaller than 40. Former indoor track now houses dances
* Student center has trees and trickling water,  quiet and private spaces.
* Requires senior thesis but can be in your own forte; ex. One woman painted 20 portraits of local government figures and only wrote descriptions,  supposed to really encompass what you've learned/interests. Again, international scale.
* Really like it, could definitely see myself going here and enjoying the experience.  In library students help each other with classes they have experience with. Presentation and tour passionate and smooth. (personal notes)
* 4-4-1; two semesters of 4 classes (fall and winter terms) and spring term, short term,  with one class as an opportunity to explore interests or new areas of study. Over 60% study abroad,  short term also helps go abroad (ex. Study Shakespeare in Globe Theatre
* Schoolwork is wrapped up by April and lets students get out first for employment opportunities. One girl did a study on prostitution from different societal perspectives and in the modern day, as well as Oscar Wilde trials.
* Finishing strong and rigorous course important.  Balance even for humanities. Focus on gender equality.  Small town New England feel but not isolated.  Big focus on Lewiston open community, community engagement key.  Intertwined.  Top ten university for community engagement. 
* French students as translators for refugees,  working with local middle schools,  etc. Team, acapella, etc. Within community.  Should be connecting all of your interests. Really instrumental in application: should be helping the local community. Impact change = constant among students.  Purposeful involvement - be ready to work and align who you are with what you do. Find true calling, find yourself. 
* Internships too. Will pay you 3500-4000 for summer research you do instead of working  (that amount every 8 weeks). Can also receive funding to pursue a professional opportunity regardless of funding.  Also fusion course teaches applicability of courses like psych, etc. 

INFO SESSION INFO:

Liberal arts about valuing and accepting interdisciplinary studies and skills, thinking outside the box and not being afraid to try new things. 3 pieces that make Bates unique- purposeful work, community engagement,  city and history of Lewiston. Basically every single person in session said they're interested in polysci so if so must stand out. Holistic review, all of you as a person. Transcript in relation to high school. Continuing to push yourself academically,  must see senior grades. Should use additional information sections to explain bad grades (ex. New teacher, pneumonia, ex.) Can also submit supplemental pieces, only one or two more letters of recommendation.  No longer require supplemental essay. Can be an essay you wrote personally that \*connects back to you\*. Good essay ex. a girl's morning commute with her dad and two conversations and ends with fear- what happens when he's gone. Only one page and not too complicated.  Use own voice.  Bates is test optional- if they don't represent academic ability don't submit. 52% of oncoming class didn't.  If they do,  superscore. 100% need based financial aid not merit based. Average packet 44000. Must complete FAFSA and CCFS profile. Legally binding, early decision I and II. Half of class comes in from those rounds.  Premed advising track. Premed and major adviser. Acceptance rate 84-91%. Distribution requirements with writing; writing 1 first year seminar, writing 2 intensive course within discipline,  writing 3 senior thesis.  Within each mode numerous courses across disciplines; skill set to be well-rounded. Interdisciplinary.  One course per mode. 

If you guys can't tell from this, I really loved Bates and was considering applying ED2 there if my ED1 didn't work out. My dad is also an alum so I have a bit of a personal connection as well. I absolutely love the campus and really NESCAC schools in general, so hopefully you get a general vibe/good academic info or this provides a decent starting place. Sorry that the notes are so scattered lol I literally typed this on my phone in the car."

I have been coding for some time now. I can build things that look authentic and work as intended. However, when it comes to some design patterns and OOP I don't really know when and where to apply most of them.

See I believe writing code that just works without proper design is a bad idea. But the gap between ""street"" programming (coding to get things done without understanding the core concepts is too common these days) and the other bunch (academic) is too theoretical, can't write any real-world app.

Let me demonstrate, there are many people out there that can create a React application without proper understanding of JavaScript. And their people who understand JavaScript and cannot create a React app (used to the concept of JS in the browser only). 

If we are to have a new generation of programmers that write clean code, shouldn't the professional help us the young ones?

Because of the above statements, am seeking for a professional programmer who will give me assignments or teach me the proper way to do this. Interest is Microsoft Stack (C#).  Am willing to spend 6 hours every day for the next 6 months.

Don't give me FuzzBuzz assignments, I already have Hackerrank for that, I seeking for knowledge, possibly 1 : 1 coaching on your side project or something like that. Consider it something like unpaid internship."

kfpjlc,2,2020-12-18,College student struggling with life,suicidal_failure1,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kfpjlc/college_student_struggling_with_life/,"Hi

I'll start with giving some context I guess. I am a 20 year old in college. My family isn't very rich and having 3 kids (my older siblings and me) was a lot of burden for my parents. Both my parents have a suite of diseases and I am not much better myself. My siblings are married and happy but the problem is, I am an utter failure. This isn't just emotional speak but an objective fact.

I don't have any achievements to speak of, any person I can call a friend without any hint of a doubt. Every time I try to speak, I start stuttering so damn much. We have an extended family, but I don't have any good relations with anyone of them. My memory is the representation of ""out of sight, out of mind"". If I don't see someone for some time, I don't even remember their existence the next time we meet.

Sometimes, my mother sends me off to buy something, and I can't talk to the shopkeeper. When the we are alone there, I am still able to slowly say aloud what I needed to buy. But if there are other customers waiting, I get so stuck, I just go back without buying anything and say that the shop was closed or buy something else which was easier to point out and say I confused the order.

The only skill I have is programming and even in that, I am pretty much a failure. I know a lot of trivia, exotic data structures, exotic algorithms, general programming tips and tricks etc. But tell me to actually make even a simple program, and I wouldn't even know where to start.

When I was staying in college, it was still somewhat ok. I had my wingmates I could talk to and ""out of sight, out of mind"", I could just ignore all the problems. But now at home, everyday, I see my parents' hopes for me increasing and everyday I see their disappointment in me growing. I had every advantage anyone could ever ask for from birth. And I am still a failure.

A couple months back, was the internship drive in my college. And I absolutely bombed all the interviews. The technical questions were hard, but doable. But the HR rounds were a nightmare. Whatever question they asked me, I gave a totally shitty answer. I can't understand what someone is thinking. My eyes are always cloudy like I am high on drugs all the time. My confidence is lower than the bottom of the deepest well. In retrospect, it was probably my utter lack of preparation. I knew very well that I am not social enough to figure out an answer for the behavioral questions on the spot. And I still ignored preparing for them, because I was lazy and wanted to play video games or laugh at some memes. 

My daily schedule is basically just wake up, eat and shit. I don't come out of my room unless called. I don't talk to anyone on my volition. The only thing I do all day is masturbate and look at memes, not necessarily separately.

I really want to kill myself but I don't have the guts for it. And whenever I think about afterwards, my parents, my siblings, how hurt they would be, it takes away the little amount of motivation I had. I want to cry but its like I have forgotten to cry. The tears just don't come out. I want to talk to someone, but my mouth just won't open."

I live in morocco and i hate what i am studying. I have hated it since the first year but each time I pass finals i tell myself nxt year will be easier and that i will be a smarter more educated man when i graduate, now i am in my last year i regret sticking around. However i rly dont know what i shoudl go do else or if i quit at my first year what would i have done. In my country to even get a job it's hard. I am not dumb i consider myself decently smart not elon musk but not mr bean ( what you would excpect from an engineer )I am so anxious about life about going out there looking from internships and jobs and how much they are going to pay. and if a crisis hit and i get layed out whether i would be able to sustain myself or not. I am so anxious about success that sometime i rly think there is no point, that i am going to be a failure and i will always stay a failure.Last year i was the president of the comitee organizing our local job fair, Miserably FAILED.2 weeks ago i tried an exam for business schools in france now that results are back i didnt get a good mark. Again a FAILURE. Also 2 weeks ago my gramma died she was most favorite person in the entire world. She died and i didnt spend enough time with her because i was studying. I still can't grasp it.

I am not rich tho my parents are willing to pay for me to go study abroad but i cant burden them all that much if i can't repay them back and this is killing me. I am so scared that even if i get admited to a very good school ( finance school or engineering) that i will end up not being good at it and fail miserably. I like coding and programming but sadly i can't affoard going to the us and paying for my education nor can i stand staying in morocco with these miserable wages. In my country youhave to be good and struggle to find a job, a job that will probably pay you 800 dollars a month ( if you are good) and if they sense a bit or need in you they will squeeze you to a 500 or even 400. I suck at everything i dont myself good at a job, I dont see myself good at anything even video games for fucks sake i suck at them. idk what i am here for or what i am meant to do.

I dont see a point in living any more tbh, i dont know where i m headed and i dont know if i should live or not. I wish i could die i have no problem with it, at all but i can't stand leaving my mom alone i love her too much to just leave and i know it will tear her apart. My girlfriend too. I try to keep up a smile everyday but it's really hard to do. I lost alot of friends because i like to stay in and not talk too much. Because after fake smiling to acting happy i need some time off to feel miserable, too feel more like me.  
Also lately i ve been developping some panick attack, just 3 days ago i lost my last intership certificate, and i had one.  
I have a deep fear of failure but at the same time i can't bring myself to study anymore. I lost all my passion. Graduation year of highschool i ranked 1st in my school even won awards. ranked 1 in physics in my county. Now i am barely passing my exams. I dont even want to wake up anymore. Though i m constantly looking for a spark for something i like. 5 years has gone nothing has hsows itself. I even was following Garyvee ansshit like that. nothing gets me up. 

  
If someone is reading this i am sorry this was this long. I dont know if what i am typing is coherent or makes sense. I am typing this tears down and i just needed somewhere to speak where no one knows me. I have never said this to anyone and i doubt i will again, anytime soon.If someone commented Thank you for your time and sorry to burden you with my problems."

kftq0u,3,2020-12-18,Seeking counseling internship during a Pandemic: a nightmare of a story.,PurpleVenus8,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/kftq0u/seeking_counseling_internship_during_a_pandemic_a/,"My story:

Before the pandemic, I quit my job (of 6 years in clinic) to go full steam ahead at my dream and finish grad school for counseling quickly (or so I thought at the time). Last year I was able to secure an internship and that internship was canceled when the pandemic hit. My program has gone from a 2.5year program to a 3.5+year program. I won't even say how much I owe at this point...

The internship sites are swamped with applicants due to people (like myself) who have not been able to find internship. My school has been of little help. They blame the pandemic, have given us a list of over 50 sites (most unusable or don't meet requirements for the program... some are even in Nevada?), and told us in orientation, ""well... you might just not be able to find placement this year."".

I have an ongoing list of about 25 sites I have applied to and am going to start applying this week to WA state. I am exhausted and feeling disheartened. In the grand scheme of things I am grateful to still have a roof over my head, food in my stomach, and a supportive family, but I feel my time is running out to make my career dream come true. If this goes on for much longer I am going to have to drop out and find a job to start paying my loans back.

I appreciate you taking the time to read this. I am in the Portland, OR area. I am looking for any help, leads, recommendations, support I can get. It breaks my heart that future therapists are struggling with this due to the increased need and demand right now."

Basically there are two completely different lifes that I think of when look into the future. 

There is one where I stay with my GF who as I said in the title is the best woman that I can imagine. In this life I stay with her and we will marry and have kids and have our ups and downs. My GF is the most loving, kind and sweet person that I know and she will be an awesome mother. We will go on vacation once or twice a year and will live a kinda ""normal"" life.

The other life is what I am dreaming of. I always dreamt of working abroad and travelling around the world. I know that right now is the worst possible moment to do that cause of covid but this decision has to be made sometime and it's stuck in my head and I can't stop thinking about it.   
I am currently working in a company that has offices all around the world and they already told me that it is possible to work in a different country. So I basically just have to tell them that I want to do that and they will help me arrange everything and support me. So I am so close to achieving my dream and do what I always wanted to do. 

The problem is that my relationship would definitly break when I leave to work in another country. 6 months after I got together with my GF I was doing an internship for my bachelors degree in another country and she only stayed with me after I told her that I will come home every second weekend. It was only like 6 hours with the bus so it wasn't too bad but that's not an option when I want to work in another continent where I would have to take a plane for \~8 hours to go back. 

Kinda TL;DR  
So here I am with the best and most loving GF by my side that I can imagine with a dream in my head that I am so close to make real and I have no idea what I wanna do. Stay with my GF and have a nice and ""normal"" family life or leave my girlfriend and live my dream. Pls help me."

That being said, I have a final round interview coming up for FBU Engineering in early January (after my offer deadline). I'm not sure if I'll be able to extend my deadline so far as to know my FBU decision, and FB have said that they can't expedite the process. I know it seems like a no-brainer and I should take an existing offer over an interview-might-possibly-turn-into-an-offer (especially since one is SWE and the other is a frosh/soph program). For a couple reasons, I still have some hesitancy about accepting the offer:

1. How much does the industry you intern in matter? In the future, I definitely want to work in ed-tech and I'm slightly disappointed that I wasn't able to get an internship in that field this summer. For internships is it mostly about the technical skills you gain as opposed to the company?
2. How much would having Intuit vs. Facebook on my resume matter in terms of reputation?
3. The SWE internship is a full 12 weeks (as opposed to 8 weeks if I get into FBU) which means no time to go visit family. I'm international and haven't seen my family in a year, was hoping to go visit this summer :( Would doing an actual SWE internship be worth the extra 4 weeks?
4. This one is, if I'm being honest with myself, probably the biggest reason: I feel extremely intimidated by the prospect of doing an actual SWE internship, especially since I felt like my technical interviews went terribly, and I know I would definitely feel more comfortable doing FBU since I have some mobile dev experience. I don't know yet what team I'd be working on at Intuit which is kind of scary. How do you transition from doing guided assignments at school to working at an actual company?

Sorry if these seem like stupid questions. I’m definitely super grateful that I was able to receive an offer at all this year! Any advice/thoughts would be extremely appreciated as this will be my first ever industry internship. I would also love to hear about anyone's experience interning at Intuit—thanks so much!!

tldr: should I accept intuit SWE or wait on a potential FBU engineering offer? please help a girl out on her first internship"

Did some internships in banking during uni and last year but due to covid neither were extended. I have been applying for jobs since June and honestly havent had a single offer. I have interviewed with 11 different companies, mostly around finance but rejected in one of the rounds. Otherwise,
I have applied for consulting, programming even marketing, sales, operations, data science, data analysis and software/data engineering and whatever I think I could potentially learn and get my hands on. I have contacted relatives and close friend to get references but every company has basically either stopped hiring or reduced no. of intakes to minimum.I am literally loosing all hopes for my career in the future. I thought I had everything planned when I was at uni but finding a job this year seems extremely unrealistic. I feel that the more I look for a job the worse my unemployment gap becomes and thus the more difficult it is to get a  job. Honestly I have no idea what is going on.

Kind Regards, 
A lost 23yo"

Last year, I wrote a post detailing my new grad job search. Well, both offers I had ended up being rescinded due to COVID, and I knew I was going to go through the recruiting gauntlet again. I ended up deferring graduation, got an internship on pretty short notice (thanks to blatant nepotism), and started recruiting again at the start of August.

Now that this year's recruiting cycle is starting to slow down and I've signed somewhere, I wrote this partially to give some insight as to the sheer difficulty of recruiting this year (**really, it's not you, it's the economy**), but mostly to reflect on this year, and to gather some of my thoughts.



https://i.imgur.com/4pFk8jX.png

&amp;nbsp;

**Statistics:**

* Companies applied to: 155
* Responses: 30
* Hackerranks/Online Assessments/CodeSignal: 27
* Total Phone Interviews (initial and post-OA): 9
* Onsites: 6
* Total Offers: 3 (1 return)
* Withdrawn Applications: 2

&amp;nbsp;

**Summary/Takeaways From my Experience:**

* This post is really for the neurotic, /r/cscareerquestions dwelling, tech-hub or bust, TC or GTFO kind of person. If these don't apply to you, then this probably won't be too relevant, and I applaud your superior social awareness and mental stability.

* **Recruiting is extra hard this year.**  I had a higher GPA, more internships, more coursework, more skills
(well, you get the point - a stronger resume), but last year I had a near 30% response rate where as this year I
went down to 19%, a big chunk of which were CodeSignal requests, of which I would deem to be ""low-quality""
responses.

* The companies I applied to were also very similar
in profile to the ones I applied to last year.

* **Leetcode is pretty essential.** Note that I pretty much exclusively applied to Bay Area positions though (due
to personal reasons). I was asked LC style questions in every interview, many of which were medium/hard
difficulty.
* **DP does not come up nearly as often as you'd probably think.** All of the other ""standard"" topics (strings,
linked list, heaps, trees, intervals, greedy, sort, etc.) came up with pretty uniform distribution.
* **Passing or acing an OA does NOT guarantee an interview.** The extent to which this held true was probably unique to this year and maybe
next year. I had a CodeSignal of 838 and finished pretty much every OA with all test cases passing and plenty of
time to spare, but I converted these into an actual interview less than half of the time. Last year, acing an OA
almost certainly let me advance to at least a phone screen.
* **Virtual career fairs are garbage.**
* **Take this post with a grain of salt.** This is what worked/didn't work for me, and luck probably played a
huge part in a lot of my outcomes.

&amp;nbsp;

**For context:**

* I am Statistics major at CMU.
* My response rate was likely lower than that of a typical CS student at CMU.

* I had 3 internships and a programming instructor job as past experience.
* I had not interned at FAANG or at any similar ""tiered"" companies before. Although I dislike this concept of tiering, in this regard, my most notable experience was interning at a certain big bank, so nothing crazy. I apologize for not specifying exactly what my experience is, but I want to make it a little bit more difficult for someone to find out who I am, and the real message I'm trying to get across here is that I didn't have some insane experience.

* My GPA is OK (3.5). It was enough to pass pretty much any cutoff, but I don't think it was anything
eye-popping.
* I did not use referrals for any application.

&amp;nbsp;

**The actual job search/preparation**

I felt that despite the fact that I was getting noticeably less responses than last year, I still had a decent
""hit"" rate. However, this year, the obstacles I faced last year were exacerbated by the fact that there was a dramatic reduction in the number of openings and every opening was getting thousands of applicants. Last year,
there were so many openings that I couldn't apply fast enough; this year, I could go days or even weeks without
seeing a new job posted. In addition, I had multiple onsites that were cancelled because headcount filled up -
even though I had applied the day the job was posted and went through the process as fast as possible. This
really made me put in perspective how few slots there
were in comparison to applicants this year.

My preparation involved skimming CTCI (for behavioral only), grinding a lot of Leetcode, and reading the [Competitive Programmer's Handbook](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf) for more ""exotic"" topics like
graphs, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, obscure data structures, etc.. I did 260 questions on Leetcode
(with a split of 93/146/20)
over the course of 4 months. I believe that this was overkill; I was basically able to solve any
technical question thrown at me during an interview with little trouble. The online assessments, however, were a
different beast. I think this year they were abnormally difficult, as often I was being given insane assessments
that were essentially 2-3 Leetcode hards in 80 minutes. Prior to this year, I really only encountered this level
of OA with trading firms, but I was getting this level maybe half the time. Preparing this heavily
helped me a lot for this particular stage.

Honestly, I think [the Blind 75 List](https://www.teamblind.com/article/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU) is enough to handle most of your preparation. Of the online assessments that I've
taken, the only one I failed to complete was DoorDash's, and of the phone screens and onsites I did not pass,
the only technical question I failed to answer was a sorting question because I had a brain fart and forgot the
syntax for writing custom comparators in Python. I also failed a non-trivial amount of behaviorals; essentially
every phone
screen that did not progress to an onsite was not because I could not answer the technical question. This was a
little strange to me, because I usually have little problem with this stage, but I'll chalk that up to my social
skills deteroriating from not seeing anyone in the past year, and a generally much higher candidate bar.

&amp;nbsp;

I began applying at the start of August and sent 155 applications. I applied to almost exclusively the Bay Area
(around 5% NYC, 2% Seattle, 90% SF/Bay Area, and 3% other). I had a return offer to the startup (based in NYC)
that I was interning at, so I did not really bother applying to anywhere outside of the Bay Area because I was
more than willing to take this return offer.

This might seem contrary to a lot of what I see on the subreddit, **but I did not tailor my application to each
listing.** In fact, I didn't even have a cover letter; I'd submit a blank document if one was required. In my
experience, cover letters mattered more to smaller firms outside of tech-hubs, but when it came to jobs where
there were 2k+ applicants, I opted to shotgun.

&amp;nbsp;

Last year, I was interviewing almost everyday, and had interviews scheduled months in advanced. This year, I
rarely had interviews and had a very open schedule; I used to get emails requesting an interview pretty much
everyday and it was honestly quite discouraging to see that I would get an interview request maybe once a week.

Of the questions I was asked, I actually ran into a pretty even split when it comes to topics covered. Last
year, I had been asked mostly tree and interval questions, but now it was pretty evenly distributed. The more
interesting thing is that I was asked 0 system-design this year - but maybe that's because it's harder to do
these questions virtually. I'm not entirely sure; it could just be a coincidence.


&amp;nbsp;


My first onsite that wasn't cancelled was with Tesla. I'd actually like to give a special shoutout to
Tesla for giving me the worst technical interview
experience I've ever had. My interviewer came in 8 minutes late (to a 45 minute interview), didn't show his
webcam (probably not that big of a deal, but I personally think this helps to build some kind of relationship
because I was interviewing to join this person's team and he would be my coworker), didn't say anything to
introduce himself or what he did or even address the fact that he was late,
immediately pasted a question onto CoderPad and said solve the question, and sat there in absolute silence.
There was no collaboration, no conversation, and no feedback. When I finished the question, he said
thanks, failed to answer any questions I had, and hung up. I think I heard him talk for 30 seconds. I left with
the impression that he had 0 intention to hire me in the first place, but the experience was so jarring that I didn't even feel bad after getting the rejection email.

I ended up with 3 offers (1 return, 2 unicorns). I'm not entirely sure I want to give out the names of
these because the rest of this post is kind of personal, and I'm not sure I want to make it that easy to doxx
myself. I'm sure someone will figure out who I am and what they are, but I'll leave it with, they were 200k
offers, which felt pretty good since that was way better than anything I got last year.

&amp;nbsp;

kfzbwj,58,2020-12-18,failing to declare cs,cs70failure,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/kfzbwj/failing_to_declare_cs/,"I went into Berkeley super excited and really confident about CS. it always came naturally and easily to me. Cs61A I was loving—I was completely the projects, homeworks, and labs with no stress or sweat whatsoever. Come midterm one and I land myself in the hospital for a few weeks and can’t take the midterm that I had studied for extensively and was beyond confident about. Then covid. Then I couldn’t take midterm 2 because I was traveling. I gave up. It felt like the world was against me. Come the final I pulled a B+ (did extremely well on the midterm one content, pretty well midterm 2, and flunked everything past that. I was only a couple points from an A- but Denero wouldn’t bump me up). I told myself, well it’s ok, I’ll just do well in 61b and 70. I got an A in 61b over summer, and felt really good about only needing a B- into 70. Come 70 I don’t fucking understand anything. I drop another class almost a month in because it’s killing me, and end up having to spend a ton of time on a new class I added. As a result, I tank the midterm (-1.2 SD below the mean). No problem, I just study hard for the final, right? I grind all RRR week, I’m getting mean on the past exams with extra time and I feel genuinely confident going into the exam. Then, I get there, and it’s way more difficult than the practices were for me. I can’t do anything, I panic, start crying, and give up and underperform. I know I did horribly. Definitely sub 30% (I left all but 2 long answers blank, and looking at my short answer answers the majority of them are wrong. I can’t even look at it because I just start crying again).
I know I won’t get a B- now and I won’t be able to declare. Looking at the data science major requirements as I’m writing this and I’m just breaking down. I don’t have interest in these classes, I just want to do CS. I haven’t had an internship, UGSI, or research position so appealing is off the table. I am feeling genuinely hopeless and I just can’t get the thoughts of killing myself out of my head (I won’t do it, but it’s just plaguing my thoughts, I don’t really know how to describe it). I feel like I worked so hard for so many years towards this and just tripped and face planted at the finish line. ~~Once grades are in if I get a C+, C, or C- I’m thinking of emailing rao and asking him to drop me to a D+ so I can retake for an A-. Is this a good idea? I don’t have high hopes but shooting my shot is better than doing nothing, right?~~ (Edit: haha this was impossible queue another mental breakdown) Does anyone have any advice? 

Tldr; failed 70 and can’t declare. Don’t want to do data science and I’m just at peak depression.

EDIT: I got the B- :)"

Our department didn’t even know that Microsoft is retiring basic auth and we will have to be completely switched over by July to avoid complete chaos and lose access to Outlook.. We literally JUST finished setting up app passwords per user for 100 employees ... I was the one who caught it, had to write up the Epic, planning, and impact evaluation for it.. and now i’ll have to do it by myself along with everything else. I’ll also have to train the new intern they’re hiring sometime in February .. 

TLDR: Helpdesk intern who is now the only IT support in the entire office with only troubleshooting knowledge and an intern salary."

I’m a recent year 12 grad hoping to go to UNSW next year. I’m still debating between the three degrees above and was wondering if anyone could give me more insight into the coursework and career outcomes of the 3. Do they differ much in terms of teaching quality and learning materials? 

I’m hoping to go on exchange for at least a sem but have heard of the negatives of the comm int’l degree (missing out on internships, exec positions, etc.). Would the Comm int’l degree put me at an advantage when applying for what I’m assuming are more competitive exchange unis (like UPenn, Berkeley, Barnard, Cornell, NYU, Tulane, KCL, etc)? 

Also, I’m hoping to go into consulting/Private equity/HF/VC/IB or working for a start-up; I was wondering which degree would best prepare me for that area and which ones employers would like. 

Thank you so much in advance. Your insight would be greatly appreciated!"

I always feel high levels of imposter syndrome due to seeing all these people getting great offers but the common trend I see is they all come from wealthy backgrounds. I work very hard but since my university is not a target school (still top 100 - UDEL) I have never gotten an interview with Facebook, Amazon, etc even though I have many projects, 3 CS internships, 3.6+gpa, doing research. Is it something special that they are doing, is it I’m just having bad luck? Also any recommendations for dealing with imposter syndrome?

I am an international graduate student. Ever since the pandemic and lockdown started, my life was at its lowest ebb. My summer internship got rescinded, there were no flights to go back home so I was stuck, I hardly have any friends here in State College, and being a big gym freak, staying home and eating food as a coping mechanism really took toll on my physical and mental health to the point that I was even considering serious self-harm. 

But well, my friends and parents really motivated me to push through. Fast forward some four months- my thesis research is making great breakthroughs, job search is still dicey but I have made several important additions to my professional network, I traveled back home last week and got to see my family, and today I got all my grades on LionPath for Fall 2020 and scored all A’s!! Now I am motivated for the final semester of my masters degree and hopefully land a job before I graduate! 

I just want to extend hope and support to those who are reading this and are not in the best place in their lives right now. Just hang in and keep working at your pace, it’s all bound to be good eventually. If it happened to me, it can happen to anyone! 

Happy holidays everyone!!"

I have posted here before as I was in the process of moving to the UK where I got accepted into an university. I found a home and I am now searching for a job and a car.

The search for a job has been tedious, I'll admit I'm being a little picky. I've worked full time for a year in a grocery store in my country to get some funds to be able to live in the UK. It's been 2 months since I'm here and I'm pretty much dry. We've used all my money first, now we are using my girlfriend's (We had to pay 6 months of rent forward to get some credibility and that's how we managed to get this house, at least it's paid for the next 5 months).

I'm searching for a part time job, I'd prefer a remote job so I could avoid waisting time on commute (time which is precious for me to study) but I'm also searching for jobs that would be in the field of technology/computers which is my field of study, this way I could learn and earn money at the same time and I would be doing something I enjoy. 

The only reasonable thing I found was a part time internship at IBM but I would need to learn a little about quantum computers and Qiskit and I would work from my university's facilities. But right now I don't have experience in those. I also need to have experience in community building which I don't really even know what means, I've searched and I'm a little confused.

On another topic, searching for a car is also very demanding. There are many opportunities here in the UK. Many amazing cars at very reasonable prices. I've found a few but I'm not sure I know how to buy a car at all. What are the things I need  to have a car in the UK?

 I have an EU driver's license with 2 years so I'm sure I can drive. I probably need one or two lessons to get used to driving on the right side.

What worries me in a way is insurance. I learned about the insurance groups and how they go from 1E to 50E if what I read is correct. The issue is that I don't even know where would I get insurance. I believe there are many companies.

There are some calculators out there but none really asks about insurance groups and they take quite a long time to fill so I only did one for this 2008 Jaguar which was on sale just for repair or parts and it said something around 14k/year or more which is crazy and it was a 42E then there's this 2001 Jaguar really cheap which looks amazing and has a low consumption (although it's automatic and I never drove an automatic before and I don't really like the idea but whatever) but the insurance group is a 41E.

Are car insurances that high? Is there anything else I'll have to pay for? Apart from maintenance and fuel of course.

Thanks!"

**Interviews**

Counselor sent in an optional report after I submitted my ED application discussing a new research project I was working on (might've played a role?).

Reflection on High School: I focused a lot on grades, being dedicated to the few small things I did, and forming close relationships with people rather than doing all the insane stuff you guys do here. Probably should've worked more on EC's, get a paper published, more awards, idk.

I honestly have no idea how I got in other than my high stats. My EC's imo were pretty subpar, I had like 0 awards, my essays were mediocre at best.

The pay is about the same (Bloomberg has a slightly higher relocation bonus)

Pros and Cons:

**Bloomberg**

Pros:

* Higher Graduate pay (60-70k)
* Better location
* Mainly use C++ - could be better for HFT in the future
* Better wlb/culture
* Get to state a preference on which project interns work on

Cons:

* Legacy codebase/older tech
* Maybe less prestigious 

**Amazon**

Pros:

* More prestigious/easier to get into F/G in the future
* Better tech stack
* More interesting product (devices)

Cons:

* Worse wlb 
* Lower grad pay (45-50k)
* I prefer London over Cambridge

My goal is to transfer to the US in a few years and I've heard that Amazon US has extremely bad WLB which worries me too.

I got Amazon's offer after I already accepted Bloomberg so I would have to reneg. 

I'm leaning towards Bloomberg for grad $$$, would passing up Amazon be a mistake? How big of a difference in prestige is there? Would BB's legacy tech hold me back in the future?

Which one would you pick?"

**TLDR: With 0 savings coming in, you will be net positive within 4 years of graduating under modest assumptions. Please note this does not account for an economic apocalypse.**

Here are the results with 0 savings for the class of 2023:

[You'll be net positive in early 2027.](https://preview.redd.it/70gdevggy6661.png?width=817&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cf3f8824bb61089036d7acf49aeeff058322d62)

**Assumptions:**

**Y0**

* Cost of living is based on Haas' estimate (\~36k a year) but I've added in $15k a year for fun stuff + other unexpected crap who knows. I've prorated it down to 6 months in Y0, but this could be aggressive. I assume CoL goes up 2% a year (inflation) thereafter
* Tuition I've rounded up to 70k (international student)
* I've assumed any net debt for the year gets compounded at the cost of debt (9% is a TERRIBLE rate and is more international student focused)-- this is NOT accurate and an OVER estimate. I've done this to keep it simple and also demonstrate that even under these circumstances it pays for itself.

**Y1**

* 12 week internship @ 8k a month (Haas average internship for tech) netted at California's average tax rate (Smartasset estimate)
* Full year's cost of living @ 50k estimated (see Y0 assumptions)

**Y2** 

* 30k average signing bonus + 7 months of income @ 140k a year (total 110k income; average @ Haas for Tech) netted @ California average tax rate (Smartasset estimate)

**Y3 and onward**

* 165k total income netted @ California average tax rate; assume you can grow net earnings by 5% a year (not aggressive based on average career trajectory)
* Cost of living grows at 2% (inflation)

Et voila. You are in the clear and you will earn a positive IRR a few years thereafter. Reminder this is all based on Haas estimates (can you guess where I am headed?).  If you have any concerns with my assumptions / projections PLEASE LET ME KNOW!! This is definitely a sanity check for me as well.

Good luck and happy holidays everyone!"

C1 would be in Texas, paying $45/hr with $3000 housing stipend or corporate housing. Microsoft is in Seattle, playing $40/hr with a $7000 housing stipend. 

My Microsoft recruiter said I'd probably be placed on the team of my interviewer, but I didn't get the best impression from him. He talked a lot about how their team's turnover is fairly high because they've been outsourcing work to India and Prague; it all just seems like a red flag to me. I had the complete opposite feeling at Capital One, where all my interviewers came off as really intelligent and passionate about what they do. The pay's also a little better at C1--I can get a lot more bang for my buck with the lower living cost in Texas too.

Literally the only reason I'd take Microsoft over C1 is because of its name, but at the same time C1 isn't some obscure startup. The hiring bar at C1 did seem to be lower though, as it was application -&gt; final round. If I can still get interviews next year with FAANG/Quants/Unicorns, I think I'd pick C1. 

Everyone I talked to thinks I should take Microsoft, but it's a really hard sell for me.

edit -- I'd like to clarify that it's not the money that made me want to pick C1. The team at Microsoft I'd be working with seems generally dysfunctional, and my priorities for an internship are learning/contributing &gt; brand name &gt; money."

I transferred here from a large well-known university due to financial and personal reasons. My grades are solid and I've consistently made deans list. I have one co-op and one internship doing backend work and cyber security along with two projects. 

**Problem**: I'm getting no help from my college's career services department, I didn't expect this and I think it has a lot to do with Covid. I'm trying to navigate the job search entirely on my own which is exciting but confusing. I don't really know what to do. I started networking on LinkedIn which has been super helpful, but it can only carry me so far since my school has so few alumni in CS.

**Questions:** Has anyone else on here gone to a Liberal Arts College for CS and gotten a decent job as a new grad? What steps would you recommend for me to take to get my foot in the door at more well-known companies? Should I even bother applying to FAANG+ companies coming from a college like this? What was the job search like for you, is there anything you would do differently?

I'm not dead set on FAANG+ at all, I just love programming and want the best job I can get. I've been isolated in the woods at this college and I'm dying to really get into the industry. I also want to start my career off as strong as possible."

* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:**  
US purchase, hopefully under $600 or just over. 
* **Are you open to refurbs/used?**  
Maybe, but I'd rather have a new one to be safe. 
* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**  
1. Battery life  
2. Performance  
3. Build quality  
4. Form factor
* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**  
Important since I will want to take this everywhere I go. I currently do school, work, and complete my internship all online, and the lighter and more portable, the better. 
* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**  
15.6""
* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**  
Occasional photoshop, lightroom, light gaming (possibly), and a program called Deep Sky Stacker that is pretty hard on my current laptop. I also use a semi-hefty MIDI music software occasionally. 
* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**  
Not really into gaming, but it needs to be capable to handle astrophotography processing and music software (the instrument files are pretty big). 
* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**  
\-Preferably a SD card drive and back-lit keyboard. Will probably need at least 512GB storage (but probably not more). 
* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**  
It might be a long shot, but I'm hoping I might get some good suggestions here! I'm currently using an ASUS vivobook x510ua and it can handle everything just fine but not as well as it used to and it's getting worse."

Background -
Only recently graduated in softeng but been in the field for 3 years (got lucky with an internship in my 1st year and made good impressions), and currently work in a bank managing some internal COTS products. The pay is decent (~80k USD), culture is great as far as large corporations go but work has become unfulfilling. I am also afraid I'm wasting time specialising in products that will likely be replaced in 10 years.

As far as programming goes, I'm ""decent"" but at work it's mostly scripting/automation I've done, and I've never touched a big codebase. I have some big personal projects I'm working on but nothing speculator.

Right now I'm thinking I have a couple options -

1) Apply for a SWE job internally, move to a team where I work on .NET legacy code or JS frontend like React (/shudder), get my toes wet and move on

2) Apply for job outside the company, hope to get taken aboard as an inexperienced ""experienced"" SWE

3) Apply for an entry level SWE job, take pay cut, work my way up

Or I just stay where I am, likely get a promotion in 1-2 years of 20-30k, see no pay rises after that unless I move to management, enjoy an easy but boring life."

kgqti1,184,2020-12-20,O level to US Uni [O level],wereyena,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kgqti1/o_level_to_us_uni_o_level/,"Hello! 

As the title indicates, this post will be about the O level-US uni pathway post I will be making. I took O levels last year and am currently a freshman (taking online classes from Singapore) Please upvote so that more people can see this. Feel free to comment down below too if there is anything else I missed/anything you would like me to talk about :&gt; I apologise for taking so long with it (been busy after my finals)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**University**

*Name*: University of Illinois, Chicago

*Ranking* (QS): 231

*Major*: [Electrical Engineering](https://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/colleges-depts/engineering/ece/bs-ee/)

*Program*: [Academic Accelarator Program (AAP)](https://global.uic.edu/undergraduate/admission-aap/) (2 semesters/ freshmen year)

O level students go into AAP, A level students go into International Direct (ID), There isn't much difference between ID and AAP. AAP just has to take some workshops and is not allowed to choose classes for the first year. There are criterias to complete AAP (2.5 GPA normally, 2.75 GPA for engineering) (completion of ENGL 160) 

&amp;#x200B;

I chose UIC cause of the location (downtown chicago) and the ranking. Chicago's public transport isn't that bad and UIC's ranking is pretty decent (in my opinion) 

&amp;#x200B;

**Scores**

*O level*: Above 15 points (3.3 GPA)

*SAT (recommended)*: 1320 (English: 620, Math: 700) 

I studied in 2 weeks from scratch. Not a lot of new concepts involved, just need to get used to the way the exam works. [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/sat) is enough I think. I used The Princeton Review Cracking the SAT from popular (NOT the premium edition), but it was expensive and not really necessary, just do all the full-length practices from Khan (there's 10 i think) and you'll be fine

SAT is optional but take it if you can (if u don't want to take SATs, u will take ITEP (free) )  Aim for a 630 for English so that u can get credit for ENGL 160, SAT essay is not necessary for UIC

&amp;#x200B;

**Finances** (USD) 

*Tuition fees per year* (2 full-time sems) (as of 2020): $33,000

*Health insurance*: $2,000

*Scholarship*: $9,000 per year

Highest I have heard of is $13,000

*Final Total*: $26,000

&amp;#x200B;

[*Housing*](http://uic.wpengine.com/undergraduate/admission-housing/):

Housing is only necessary for Freshmen students. I got a waiver for it before COVID cause I will be staying with a family friend and my mom will be coming with me for the first 4-6 months. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Degree Info**

*Duration*: Typically 4 years 

*How it works*: 

Most people complete their degree in 4 years (8 semesters). There are 3 semesters in a year (Spring, Summer, Fall). Summer (12 weeks) is a short semester so its not considered full-time. Fall and Spring (full-time sems) (16 weeks each) are compulsory semesters for international students, Summer isn't. Most students take one or two classes in the Summer while doing internships.

Engineering degrees need 128 credit hours for graduation. In one full-time sem, u can take a min of 12 credits and a max of 18 credits (more than 18, department approval is needed)

&amp;#x200B;

**Online classes experiences**: 

Ey ya gurl got a 4.0 with 18 credits!!! so I'm super happy about that :&gt; Timezones can be a bitch tho, My sleep schedule in Fall 2020 was 3.30am to 11.30am. 3 out of 5 of my classes were asynchronous so my classes start and end timings varied daily. It was more assignments than exams and my god there are so so soo picky about citations it was annoying to get used to. But overall, it was good. I had friends who helped me with some subjects and I had helped them with others. 

Google docs is absolutely amazing. I love the document outline especially, I can just click to where I wanna go instead of scrolling up and down. The UIC email has 4TB of storage space too.

There are a lot of good online resources (slide templates, citation machines, math checkers etc...) . textbooks are very expensive lmao but there are sites where u can get them for free ;) (not all tho) (I'm willing to pass down my textbooks and notes too, if we have the same classes)

&amp;#x200B;

**Advantages over A level** (Personal opinion): 

You get to skip 2 years!! which I think is a massive bonus. most schools that accept O levels are not that high in ranking yes, but u can transfer to the school of your choice later in sophomore or junior year or take masters there. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Difference from Singapore**: (comparing to my experience from O level)

You are on your own. They will just tell you (this) and (this) exists. It's on you to read up on yourself. It's on you to find your own opportunities. Planning!! is super important cause you're supposed to chose your own classes (after AAP), u need to make sure you take the necessary classes in order so that you can move forward to your next classes (Most classes have pre-requisites classes you need to fulfill to take that class). And the fees are damn expensive so need to make sure to not take an extra semester

&amp;#x200B;

Uni requires more consistent work (homework, midterms, weekly quizzes all count toward the final GPA), and about 2 new concepts are taught every week for all the subjects so yea consistent work VS Singapore where you just cram for one final national exam 

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly I didn't work that hard for O levels (was also dealing with mental health and family stuff), But uni is like a whole different ball game ynoe? like its uni!!! I'm not the type that works hard for the sake of it lol which is why I didn't feel motivated in O levels, I didn't have a goal to work towards. But uni is sort of the final milestone (kinda) already so yea its either do or die (I also want more scholarships)

Edit: removed agent's info cause was not allowed 

Thank you for the award! Please do feel free to pm if u all have any private questions and do update me if anyone do decide to go to UIC :D"

This is my first time posting here and I am so happy today because I finally completed my 2 months internship as a Project and Campaigns intern.
  
I remember the first day of my internship. I had to call around 200 people in a day. Had to explain them the campaign guidelines and get more people to join the campaign. So basically I had to convince people on call. I was really terrified. 200 strangers? Somebody kill me please. And the worst thing of all. There were mentors who were appointed to monitor my work. My first 2 calls were BADDDD. I was so embarrassed because I was eating up words while speaking, I sounded scared and it was too horrible. I was overwhelmed and felt like I just don't want to be seen, make me invisible god please. The mentors said I did well and helped me calm down. I told them this was my first time working and there approach was very warm and friendly.
 
Eventually it went on smooth. There were a few idiots who hung up my call, were giggling and making fun of me while I was on call. But somehow I did my work well. My work was appreciated and was offered more important campaigns. And I finally survived the internship guys..

Thanks for listening. I am feeling great today!"

Could folks in the industry let me know what they think? Is it a good career to get into?

  


Also some secondary questions:

\- is it a lucrative field? What's the pay like?

\- what are the job prospects like?

\- are the skills you would develop in this position transferable? Meaning if I wanted to pivot out of DevOps what options would I have?"

This is already a semester late, meaning I will have spent 4.5 years for my undergrad. In order do you that I have to take an extra course this semester, and a full course in the semester after that. Which is very doable.

However I currently have no internships. I have one research, some projects, but no internships. I do have a couple interviews coming up for internships in summer but nothing guaranteed yet. 

I was thinking I should split up my courses causing me to graduate in April 2021, making my time as an undergrad a full 5 years. I would also take extra courses that interest me. These courses would be CS courses that have cool projects like building a scalable web application, data mining, computer vision etc. Along with Math Courses I always wanted to take like Differential Equations. So I would have a full or near full course load for all 3 upcoming semesters meaning full semester fees. 

Here are my current pros and cons:

Pros:

- More time to get an internship
- I can take more courses that might be useful
- More university life

Cons:

- I could start working earlier instead
- Extra semester to pay for ($3500 extra)
- I will have spent 5 years for undergrad 

Did I miss anything important? Based on this what would you do? I am worried about not getting a good job since I don’t have an internship. I go to a good ranked Canadian University, if that makes a difference.

Edit: If I do secure an internship this summer, should I still do an extra semester to pursue a second internship?"

But one thing Ive been worrying in the process: knowledge of programming languages. I see that students in there resume usually list many languages that they know. Im more drawn to front end development. So my questions are:

1. Should I just focus on Java right now and really know it until I move on to a more front end programming language such as HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

2. Should I learn HTML/CSS and JavaScript 
independently while learning Java in my courses at school.

3. Is Java useful in Front-End Development; was it good for??

Also, I've been hearing Java popularity is decreasing while Python is increasing, do u think Java will be useful as the years go on, or is there nothing to worry about??"

I was a transfer student from Collin and majored in Computer Science. I just graduated from UTD this semester. Over the past year or so I have been working on a Transfer Guide for people transferring in from Collin to UTD. I just finished my final edit of the guide this morning and wanted to post it here so others could see and share it.

[Transfer Guide](https://wearignoranceisbliss.github.io/)

The guide has info that will help transfer students and contains information I wish I had before transferring, but there is also plenty of info in there that regular students might find useful as well such as advice for finding an internship and other general UTD information.

I wanted to do this as a way to give back in some small way, so please feel free to share the link with anyone you think would find it useful.

I'm always open to thoughts or critiques as well regarding the guide, just reply here or send me a PM.

Lastly, /u/WillieCubed if you feel like this is something worthy enough to keep around feel free to throw it on the sidebar under related links or something. I think the info here could help future transfer students quite a bit.

Thanks everyone, good luck to current and future students. It's been an interesting ride.

EDIT: To anyone who is a transfer student and is a different major than I was (Computer Science) and would like to contribute to the guide, just send me a PM. It would be an amazing resource for even more students if we had sections for different majors with a similar format to what I wrote for the CS major, so if you are one of those different majors send me a PM if you're interested in contributing a section on your major for your fellow students."
kh1193,410,2020-12-20,How I went from no summer internship to Amazon in 6 months.,dmcandy123,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/kh1193/how_i_went_from_no_summer_internship_to_amazon_in/,"I want to start by acknowledging that I am incredibly lucky for so much of the opportunities in my life. I come from a good suburb outside of Atlanta and have parents who have helped me get to where I am. Right now, I’m a junior in computer engineering at the University of Illinois, which has provided me numerous great opportunities to develop my skills. That being said, I worked really hard to turn around from my shitty situation over the summer.

In March of last year, I was scheduled to go to Israel for an internship program called Onward. Obviously once COVID happened, my plans for the summer fell apart, and I was left with no real opportunities. I was crushed by this reality, but I chose to use it as a motivator to work harder. During the summer of 2020, I decided to start learning anything I could about software engineering by making a series of projects based on my skills and passions, while making money on the side by delivering for Uber Eats. I started by making a Spotify web player using React. This took me about 3 weeks as I was incredibly new to both front end design, but through this project, I learned so much about what web development really is. The next project I worked on was an augmented reality app for Android that turns sample textbook pages into interactive AR demos. I had some experience with AR from a club at my university that taught me how to use Unity and Vuforia engine. This project took me about 3 weeks to make, and I ended up with an Android app and an accompanying website.

From posting about these two projects on LinkedIn, a high school friend reached out to me in late June to help work as a front end developer for his startup. This company was tiny with less than 10 employees and had no products on the market, but I took the opportunity to learn how to work with a team. Even working at such a small operation, I learned so many implicit skills that would prove to be essential in software dev. 

When I came back to school in the fall, I was able to land a position at a company called AGCO working as an augmented reality intern. AGCO is by no means a tech company, but they were trying to reach into immersing technology like AR. When I got there, I did my work to prove what I was capable of until I got used to working at an established company. Once I was comfortable, I tried to use my confidence to propose new directions to take their projects. Having proved that I was willing to work hard and think outside the box, AGCO quickly promoted me to a lead intern role, where I could use my creativity to impact larger decisions on the direction of our projects. Within 3 months of working part time at AGCO, while taking some of the most difficult classes (like systems engineering) in school, I felt like I was ready to be a part of a top tech company like Amazon.

I was shocked when I landed an interview. Even after spending tens of hours practicing LeetCode problems to prepare, I was still nervous going into my interview. During the call, I told the Amazon employee honestly about my experience. I shared what had happened to my internship prospects last summer, and what I did to turn around. I did my best to convey my technical knowledge, talking about things I knew, without trying to seem like I knew more than I really did. When it got to the coding question, I really botched my code, but I asked my interviewer for help to reach a working solution.

I received my offer letter on Friday, and if I’m being honest, I still have to pinch myself every day to make sure this is real. I honestly never expected to land a FAANG out of college or even ever, but I guess the pressure I put on myself to do as much as I can worked out. If you’ve read this far (thank you btw), my advice is to take any anxiety you might have towards your career, and use that to motivate yourself. Don’t ever think you can’t land a job you really want. You’ll have to work incredibly hard to get there, but the day you reach your aspirations, it’ll all be worth it. 

TL;DR
I lost my summer internship in Israel because of COVID, worked on my own projects, and was able to land positions at two companies over the course of the summer and fall. From working hard and pushing myself to be better, I was able to achieve an internship at Amazon.

**Background:**

* Will not recieve any financial aid
* Dual Canadian/American Citizen, lived in US entire life
* Planning to recieve BS in Computer Science and then get a programming job in the USA

**Stats:**

* 1490 SAT, 3.7 UW, 4.6 W, Decent ECs + Essays + LoRs

**Schools:**

Now for a list of colleges that I have applied to.
This includes net cost (4 yrs including fees+flights+room &amp; board+tuition). Scholarships are factored in which I will list below.

* Case Western ($284,336.00)
* WPI ($235,200.00)
* Northeastern ($296,528.00)
* UMass Amherst ($119,452.00)
* University of Toronto: Scarborough ($84,665.11)
* University of Toronto: St. George ($84,174.04)
* University of Toronto: Mississauga ($88,018.13)
* University of Waterloo ($84,630.70)
* University of Florida ($156,104.00)
* RPI ($241,264.00)
* University of Alabama ($60,456.00)

**Scholarships:**

* WPI (14.5k/yr scholarship)
* U of Toronto: Mississauga (no scholarship)
* U of Alabama (full tuition for 4 years)

Haven't been accepted to any of the other schools yet.

**Other Factors:**

* I am applying for the PEY at U of T which is where you graduate in five years but get a 12-16 month full time paid internship (avg. $41,820.32 USD salary)

* I am applying to Waterloo for the CS Co-op program, graduate in ~5 years and get six 4 month internships over the summer


My main issue is I don't think it will be worth it to apply to any more schools for RD. I had a list including: 

* Cornell
* Brown
* Tufts
* JHU
* Georgia Tech
* U of Chicago
* U of Michigan

but, after doing the calculations the net costs for all of those schools will be ~200k+. That makes it seem like there isn't much of a point to apply when U of T: Mississauga is ~90k, ~60k if I take an extra year for internship. 

I understand that the University of Toronto is ranked #8 in the world for Computer Science on some websites, but I am unsure if that is just because of grad school or if employers will really value it that high. 

I think right now Waterloo would be my top because I could get 2x the internships and potentially pay off my entire debt. But, assuming I get rejected to the rest of my schools I am not sure if one of these really good RD schools would be worth it to apply to and pay 200k for, instead of going to U of T: Mississauga especially because I plan on working in the US after school. 

I don't know if applying to the rest of these schools would be worth it for safety? or if there is really no point and the schools that I have gotten into so far are good enough and cheap enough to out weigh the rankings and prestige of these top US schools."

**A Little Backstory:**

I'm a 2020 graduate. Since early 2019, I've been building up my skills in Android application development and I plan to start my career in it. Know a bit of DSA. I have an internship experience of 2 months. 

So, my internship ended back in October. Since then, I've been applying for jobs. I've been receiving calls from companies as well. However, the only issue is with my work experience. As mentioned, I have merely 2 months of experience, but most companies require a candidate with a minimum of 6-12 months of work experience in Android development.

I've been thinking about dropping my job search and looking for internships instead. My plan is to work on internships for about 3-4 months and then start looking for jobs again. By that time, I'll have the required experience to apply for jobs. 

What do you guys think about this? Or would you recommend a different route? Thanks!

N.B.: I've been following fresher job postings on LinkedIn and I saw posts about how companies like TCS are planning to start hiring freshers. I've heard that these companies train their candidates according to the projects that they receive. And I'm kinda hesitant to apply to such jobs because I love Android app development. I know that in the field of tech one should always be ready to learn new technologies, but I really want to start my career with Android application development.

I start working next month as an associate and haven’t established a home office setup yet. I remember as an intern, there was a system where we were able to order tech supplies to the office like monitors, mice, keyboards, backpacks etc. I was wondering if anyone knows if we can still do that, but have it delivered to our home instead?

Are we able to purchase monitors, desks, chairs, etc on behalf of the firm for our home offices? Otherwise, are there reimbursements for anything or do they provide any other sort of accommodation? 

One of my friends who started as a new hire a couple months ago told me PwC gave $250 to spend on “home essentials” and she used that to buy herself monitors. Will we be getting that as well? 

Any sort of guidance on what I should do would be very helpful, especially now with the holiday sales still going on! I tried asking my HR contact but he hasn’t responded. 

Also, any word of when we’re going back to the office? If it’s soon then I don’t need to go all out with buying things. Please feel free to share your home office setups as well."

I graduated in May and was able to land this job towards the end May and held it until the end of November. It was a small professional services company and I was the only employee of the company. I was completely taken by surprise because it was never discussed with me that I was at risk of being fired and I had thought all things considered I was doing great at my job and had shouldered a lot of responsibility. My ex-boss told me I was being let go for small mistakes (I.e forgetting to set the phone to answering machine at the end of the day sometimes or forgetting to check a certain box on a form). In the grand scheme of things I didn’t think these little errors mattered too much compared to the actual complexity of the work I was producing, and I have ADD so little errors like that are commonplace for me and have never held me back before. At the same time I don’t think my ex-boss was ready to manage an employee either. She never clearly explained job functions to me, sometimes I never found out I had a certain responsibility until after I was yelled at it. She also seemed weird about balancing how much control of her business she retained. When I first started my boss would be gone golfing 2-3 days a week and left me to learn new tasks on top of my hiring responsibilities like the marketing, basic accounting, talking to clients and vendors etc. which I had never encountered or learned about before. Then when she was unhappy with the way I had picked up how to do it she began micromanaging me which was actual tough for someone with ADD because I couldn’t prioritize tasks anymore, the way I needed to. 

However, being exposed to so many new operations made me learn so many new skills that I wouldn’t be able to advertise with any of my internship experience, so I’m not sure if I should leave this job on my resume. Judging from how she talked about her old employees (I had found out she had tried to hire then fired 3 more employees before me within the year and had made sure to block them from receiving unemployment) she might not give me a good recommendation if called upon. Not sure where I should go here."

If anyone has already done an interview for AFL, could you answer these questions?   

1) Did your interviewer ask you about your resume? How deep did they go?    
2) Was your technical question LC easy/medium/hard? What data structure were you asked to work with?    
3) Did your interviewer give you hints? Were they kind to you or snippy?

I’m much more interested in cs but also do enjoy cybersecurity, I just haven’t had that much time in it. From what I hear the C.S. market for new grads/junior devs is pretty saturated, and the AppSec (my masters specialization) field is extremely in need. I will have internships in both fields by the time I graduate. 

From some people in the industry and recruiters I’ve talked to, as an AppSec engineer, I will be heavily recruited right out of college, but should I take some time to apply to both C.S. and cybersecurity positions post grad and try to find something I really like, or take a position in cybersecurity right away and see where that experience and field goes?

To clarify, I don’t know if I’ll want to go into cybersecurity fully, as my masters isn’t exactly practical and the internship I had was nowhere near what I’d be doing in AppSec.

So, I've been lucky enough to get an ai internship (part time) for the winter semester and have a database programmer job for the winter semester for one of my professors (part time) aswell. 

For the summer, I'll be working about 20 hours / week for an ai startup in toronto, and i'll be working 40 hours per week as an intern during the same time aswell...

Now, my marks are not too bad but at the same time they're not the best.... i have an 88% average atm, and I expect it to fall to 86% after this semester (lol i know.... online school sucks).


So this has me wondering..... why are marks not that important in the industry? Wouldnt having a masters degree make you more marketable than a person with 7 - 10 years of experience, considering the individual with a masters degree has more advanced knowledge?

If my goal is to be a software engineer and eventually a manager, then should i focus on grades or work experience?


Thanks y'all!"

My college is offering both Java and C++. I am wondering if I should take C++ instead or stick to Java.

I’ve been in a rut for the past semester simply due to covid, family issues, as well as mental health issues. I just realized I missed out on multiple very important scholarships/programs that I had really wanted to apply for and I feel a weight on my chest. 

In high school, I was very competitive and did the absolute most in order to get into a top college/get a scholarship and I thankfully did. But I ended up burning myself out and ruining my health. It took me all freshman year of college to recover. I said never again and have been taking it fairly easy during my college semesters but now I don’t know if I did the wrong thing. I am still getting straight As and I’m involved, but I know this is not my absolute best. Do I have to keep pushing myself though, like why do I always have to be involved in every club, applying to every internship, working/ studying every interim with no breaks? 

I just started to get into looking into programs and internships and I literally couldn’t breath from being so overwhelmed by how many there were...memories of how physically, mentally and emotionally taxing my HS years were starting flushing back and I experienced what felt like ptsd. I don’t know what to do. 

Should I push myself more like before so that I can secure a top job once I’m out, even if it means being stressed all the time? Or should I take it easy, and hope for an okay job once I’m out, even if it means that it’ll be a lot more difficult to get a job, or make much money once I’m out? I’m so troubled, bc my family will be depending on me financially once I graduate, and I just don’t want to let them down. I think that is where my need for professional perfection stems from tbh. What do y’all think? Any insight is greatly appreciated."
kh98as,4,2020-12-20,HOT TAKE: I really wish people would stop recommending the A+ cert as a means to gain entry into an IT career.,ny_soja,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/kh98as/hot_take_i_really_wish_people_would_stop/,The title says it all. Anyone who knows anything about the A+ cert exam or has any real life experience in IT knows that CompTia is a HORRIBLE organization and the testing materials are often times based on outdated/antiquated information. There are so many other paths forward that do not include CompTia or a College degree. Microsoft certifications are way more valuable for getting an IT career started. Working with contract recruiters are often a much easier way to get your foot in the door with your first IT opportunity vs internships and if you are dead set on giving CompTia your money then a Net+ or Sec+ is a much better bet for anyone considering a cert from that path.

**Letters of Recommendation**

AP Biology Teacher: We talked regularly after school when I would swing by after XC practice. He wrote my rec letter which got me into my internship, so I believe it was very good.

AS English III Teacher: Didn't talk to her much outside of class, but we had a good relationship in the classroom. I helped out in the classroom by making equations to convert page numbers in different book editions and other similar things.

Counselor: I'm fairly close with my counselor and we get along well. I came to her when I wanted to take precalc over the summer to place into calc and physics, which she wrote about. I did that as well as self study Calc BC while taking AB in order to take the BC test. She saw my passion for learning, and I think her letter was strong.

Peer Rec: This was written by a friend that I've had since 8th grade. We're really close and he's a very good writer. He talked about my passion for science and my commitment to friendships.


**Interviews**

My interviewer was an engineering major, so we bonded really well over STEM classes. I think he really liked me, and we actually met twice, since he found my questions interesting. Overall, I think this was one of the strongest parts of my app.


**Essays**

Common App: I wrote about SCUBA diving and my passion for marine biology. I specifically delved into the deep sea to discuss the unknowns of the ocean. I think this was a strong, but not amazing essay.

Why Dartmouth: This was honestly mediocre, but not terrible. I discussed how Dartmouth had the campus focused culture I really wanted while retaining the ability to go explore off campus and around the world.

Quirky Prompt: I chose the prompt by Frida Kahlo. I talked about the constant change in the natural world as well as scientific theories and my own scientific interests. I really loved this essay and I think it was my strongest.


**Decisions**

*Acceptances:*

Dartmouth College ED; one and done


Additional Information: None



Looking at my application, I believe that my rec letters and ACT carried. Having a high score during a test optional year is what I believe put me ahead. Then again, I'm just a HS Senior, so I truly don't know.

I'm a senior studying CS at a reasonably well respected program in the US. I have worked part-time as a software engineer all through college and done full-time SE work (including internships) during the summers. I love math and CS. Even after full course-load plus part-time work, I still maintain hobby projects just because I enjoy it.

The problem is I'm losing all of my other interests. I used to play two instruments, play sports, write essays and short stories, and pursue a bunch of other interests in my free time. I've realized that none of these things are enjoyable anymore. I've tried resuming all of these hobbies at one point or another over the last four years, they no longer interest me.  I've tried picking up new hobbies with similar results.

It's not just hobbies either. I don't find video games, board games, or anything else fun anymore. I pretty much just write code until I'm too tired to continue, then watch Netflix. I maintain an exercise routine just to stay healthy, but even that's more of a slog than it used to be.

And Christmas is just making it worse cause all I hear is ""what do you want for Christmas"" and I just want my momma back, I would give anything to hear her voice, hold her hand, and just hear her say she loved me again. It just feel like I'm in a trance everyday I'm alive and I'm just going through the motions of my life before this year. 

I know this next part is alot, but I very much need to vent, and I'm sorry. 

My momma died this year in June from a motorcycle accident from head trauma, and my dad was in the ER for a couple days with all his ribs broken, nose, and facial bones. I had just turned 21 two weeks before, I hadn't even went to a bar yet or experienced how to be young adult. And then she died, and to make it harder on me a week before she was supposed to visit me in Florida while I was in college. We had everything planned, bought, and scheulded. Kayaking, trails, and I even had a whole nice dinner planned for her and my boyfriend. 
And I had to call and cancel everything, I had to plan her funeral, take care of all the court and paper work, and then the hardest thing of all choose what happens to all her belongs and claim her life insurance. And I never even got to say good bye, the last thing I asked her was if I should get warranty on something I was buying on Amazon. 
I turned 21 and in two weeks inherited 3 houses, 2 cars, and so much money that I contemplated putting a bullet in brain because of where it all came from, I never in my life wanted money that way( to clarify 2 houses and 1 car  from my grandma who died a year before my mom). It felt like I went to 30 and I still have no idea what I even want to do in my life.

I quit college with just my associates in Computer Science because I couldn't deal with everyone calling trying to collect her debt and talking about, my family members trying to take money from me, and all the Covid stuff making my classes online. And I feel like a total failure everyday, and I don't even know what I'm gonna do with my life, I feel like a reject. 

In November my life hit the fan even more, we lost our baby, my two of grandparents got covid and were high risk, one of them barely got through it was very touch and go for a while. And to top it off TODAY my last grandparent thinks he has covid, and he's also battling prostate cancer for the 2nd time and on chemo again with a pacemaker. 

So this Christmas I truthfully don't want to exist, and if I didn't have the loving boyfriend that I do I wouldn't be here, I would have put that bullet in my brain and I wouldn't have thought a second about it. I hate my life right now, and I hate this year. I don't know why or what I did to the cosmic universe to deserve this, but I would do anything to just have a normal new year where things work out for me. I had so much positivity in January, even a potential job or internship with Ubisoft or EA. And now I don't even wanna make video games cause I was doing eveyrhting for my mom, she took me to college, she paid for eveyrhting, she was my eveyrhting, and now I feel like I have nothing. And I don't want to feel that way anymore."

khjtia,1,2020-12-21,[US] How/When to ask for a raise?,UnsuspectingPotatoes,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/khjtia/us_howwhen_to_ask_for_a_raise/,"Hello! 

I work for a small (20 employees) tech company based out of NYC. I started Jan 2019 as an intern and transitioned into part time in Sept 2019 (I went back to school). When I started I worked on the tech support team and ended up automating a lot of their processes so when I transitioned to part time, I switched to the engineering team. I've stayed at the same rate ($15/hour, minimum wage in NYC) for the whole time but my hours have changed depending on the time of year (i.e. summer I have more availability, so I worked more hours). 

This last September, I know that my manager asked about a raise for me before to the higher ups (he said I bring value to the company etc. and he thinks raising my rate to $20 wouldn't be a big deal) but I guess that did not pan out since I'm still at the same rate. 

I am graduating university with my bachelors in May 2021 and the company knows this (they have given me a verbal confirmation that I may transition to full time next summer). I have not accepted the offer yet as I am keeping my options open. 

My question is should I go about asking for a raise again in Jan (2 year work anniversary)? How do I go about asking for a raise (do I ask my manager, HR, higher ups)? How do I say that I ""deserve"" a raise? Do I set up a meeting with my manager to talk about this or should I send an official email (who do I email and who do I CC)?

For more context, there have been other interns but since COVID hit in march, they have not hired any new interns. So no starting intern is making the same rate as me but if they decide to hire an intern for the winter term, they would be making the same rate as me."

I don't understand what's happening here; I've done everything that everyone has told me. I'm a sophomore at a top state school for CS, I've worked on small personal projects, I've had my resume critiqued countless times, I participated in a highly selective research fellowship last summer, my GPA is a 3.96, and I'm even a TA for a programming class at my school. Why can't I even get interviews, let alone an internship? I'm not even applying to many top companies; it's mostly just smaller companies in my state mixed in with some nationwide F500 or Big N occasionally. 

Maybe it's because I'm a sophomore, but nearly every sophomore I know at my school has oppurtunities lined up. Maybe it's because I only know 3 programming languages, or maybe it's because my personal projects don't meet anyone's standards, but this is ridiculous. Anyone else having this issue?"

This just happened 50 minutes ago, and I still can't believe it happened.

I  went for my usual check up to the dentist, and everything started quite  normal. My usual dentist was off sick, so they decided the intern  should get some hands on experience.

I  sat/lay down in the chair and waited. The replacement walked in and  started the usual ritual of poking around in my mouth. She was  scratching away at something on one of my bottom molars when she somehow  slipped. The little tool, slid off my foot and embedded itself in the  soft area between my teeth next to my tongue.

I  don't know why, but my dumb ass first reaction was to bite down onto the  thing causing my enormous pain. I bit into the dentists finger. Then  nothing.

Two seconds after that I  realized what had happened. I quickly opened up my jaw, allowing the  dentist to extract her now bleeding finger. I had punctured her glove  and skin and a few drops of blood splattered into my mouth She ran to  disinfect her finger. Only after a yelp from me did she realize she had  left her tool stuck in my mouth. She gently pulled it out, and I managed  to not take another bit. A few drops welled up, but nothing serious.   The intern quickly went to the doctor. I'm on my way home now, and it looks like we'll both survive without permanent damage

TL:DR: I tried to eat my dentists finger after she accidentally stuck a tool in my mouth."

I will graduate from a decent U.S. university in a short 5 months or so, and get my diploma of a B.S. in Informatics. I also minor in Computer Science.

During these 4 years of college, I actually feel pretty confident about pursuing a career in the field of Computer Science Engineering, IT Consulting, or anything that doesn't fall too far from my major. Currently I am actively preparing for technical interviews by studying advanced topics in Computer Science field, and hopefully will secure a job in the near future.

The thing is, aside from that part of my career pursuit, I have always been really, really interested in fields like arts, literature and humanity. I also am genuinely considering profitting from my language skills, maybe by becoming a translator for English-Chinese pair or vice versa (I am native Chinese but I am arguably more than fluent in English). 

However, as prevails both common sense and lesson learned from the job hunting, I desperately lack in any form or shape of work-related experiences should I pursue a career not in the IT/CS field. In comparison, for Computer Science and IT field, I have done multiple internships and am generally just in a better, more prepared shape for it, let alone the fact that I at least have a diploma for it.

I still have some time—5 months, 8 tops—before I actually leave college. I would really appreciate your wisdom and experiences, especially if you had been split between two drastically different fields before.

I would also thank you if you could provide any insight or inspirations.

And wish you a happy Christmas!"

khnflf,0,2020-12-21,CS Rant,JustAStudent12345,uofm,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/khnflf/cs_rant/,"1. CS students need to stop complaining about CS theory courses such as EECS 203 and EECS 376 and saying they are useless and shouldn't be required. But they are important, for example knowing reductions is extremely important for problem solving and interviews knowing P vs NP and cryptography is important for security. Computer Science IS NOT JUST CODING, if you want to just do coding then go to a bootcamp (nothing wrong with that). Computer Science is a science degree it is going to have theory classes and umich has much less emphasis on theory than other top schools already. Having a good foundation of CS theory is important if you want to do anything other than be a code monkey.
2. I have even heard CS students suggest that EECS 370 shouldn't be required. This is laughable EECS 370 is heavily slept on. IMO this is one of the most important CS classes. This takes away the some of the magic of computers and shows you how processors, caching, and virtual memory works.
3. Students here seem to be in denial about certain things and flat out lie to other students because they are too afraid to tell the truth. For some reason CS students will always push others towards CS even if it isn't right for them. I could post on here and say I failed EECS 280 twice and people would tell me to stick out CS. Even though this is horrible advice. I'm going to be real, if you fail EECS 280 once you should switch majors, even if you do pass a second time you will have to compete with 1000 other students for internships and jobs who are much more competitive than you.
4. Students also seem to be in denial about everyone belonging here. Now I know this is a nice thing to say but it's simply not true. There are 40,000 students some people are bound to have slipped through the cracks. It happens at every level of life. 
5. CS students in particular seem to have some sort of ego where they think the rules are personally putting them at a disadvantage and that they are actually smarter than their peers. The biggest example of this is projects and exams. Many cs students will say that courses should remove/reduce exams and make the projects harder thinking that they are actually smarter than their peers and would get a higher grade even though all the students would just grind the project harder. Additionally, I often see students say they failed an EECS exam/course with the curve and say how they  ""have a strong knowledge of the material but the exams didn't reflect that"". This is a form of denial, if you actually had a strong knowledge of the material you would certainly get at least a passing grade as you have to do absolutely horrible like 25% on an exam with a &gt;70% average to fail.
6. I believe that there has been significant grade inflation in the past year mostly due to grade masking but also because passing requirements have gotten easier, I don't even think minimum competency for courses is actually enforced (I have talked to people who passed below minimum competency). I feel that this is significantly devaluing Michigan academics and there is little distinction between someone who masks all their bad grades and someone who actually earned their grades. We are supposed to be the leaders and best not the maskers and worse."
khnwiw,5,2020-12-21,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (12/21/2020),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/khnwiw/weekly_job_qa_thread_12212020/,"Hi all,

Here is the forty-third installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

khqdgi,37,2020-12-21,I got my ten-year-son enrolled in a coding class. He almost turned everyone into zombies. Until he nearly killed himself.,Percybhowal,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/khqdgi/i_got_my_tenyearson_enrolled_in_a_coding_class_he/,"I signed my son Rohit up for one of those young, online coders classes that are so notoriously famous these days. You see, my neighbor Sharma had his son Virat do really well in the school’s Young Innovators’ project. The boy was just ten, but he had a real flair for building robots, gadgets, and whatnot. Even bagged a Gold medal in the science fair.

But what was *my* Rohit doing?

He just liked to paint pictures of women in their ‘natural form’. Whatever that’s supposed to mean. I mean, sure; his art teacher always kept going about what real talent he had, and how he could make it big as an artist.

But…painting pictures of nude women? Is that a real way of making money?

I had to disagree. After all, I did happen to be running a fast-food place of my own. *Bunty’s Burgers*\- *Where the cuisine is right up your food palette*.

Yeah, I was one of those passionate guys who treated their professions like art. Artist of electricity, artist of plumbing, artist of baking- yeah, artist my brown ass. I’d started on the food business 30-years ago, with nothing but raw passion to serve my customers the best food they would taste in their whole lives.

Fast-forward three decades later, and here I was, barely scraping by my decrepit, under-performing establishment. Bunty’s Burgers? I’d say even *Bob’s Burgers* was doing better than us.

Anyways, you get my sob story- I didn’t want my son to go down the same, sad path of self-employment. So, I looked for some good coding courses online- because let’s face it- coding is everything.

That’s how I came across *Capped Coders Inc* (CCI).

This was a US-based online, self-learning platform aimed towards *‘empowering young minds to code comprehensively’*. How young, you ask? Well, they recommended starting their app development courses around the time of sixth-grade. That’d effectively be 11-12 years in the Indian schooling system. And my Rohit was just weeks away from celebrating his 11th birthday.

Wouldn’t hurt to get a head start, I figured.

\*

I bought Rohit a course from the Capped Coders that would teach him to code in a variety of languages. The whole deal set me back by approximately INR 80, 000. Now, before you judge me- I’ll have you know that I watched all the child interviews and advertisements on their websites. I mean, who wouldn’t- they were all so damn impressive!

This one guy named Fox Kumar (weird name, but then I was called Bunty) was only 12 and had finished a course on Python last year. Now, he had landed an internship at Microsoft with a monthly stipend of USD 75,000. Then this other guy, Marcos Fernandez (11, Mexican), was making thousands of dollars every month at Tesla. All thanks to an Artificial Intelligence course from the CCI.

Can you imagine how much that kind of money means to a man whose idea for a fancy, Sunday night dinner is scrambled eggs?

I wanted Rohit to do well in life. Financially, and otherwise. So if I could virtually guarantee my boy a prosperous future at the expense of overtiming for a few weeks…I was gonna take the deal. No brainer.

So that’s how my Rohit started his courses. I’ll be honest- I didn’t, and still don’t have an accurate idea on exactly what all things he was learning. If I recall correctly, there was something about Python, some part Java, some C++, and…

Well, for as good a memory I have of taking long food orders, I didn’t have much aptitude for Rohit’s subjects. Like, at all.

Now that’s not to say I was an irresponsible dad, who left his impressionable, 10-year-old child all alone with the internet. I sat with him during his lectures, practicals, tutorials- even though I didn’t have the slightest idea what was going on-screen. I kept him motivated by serving him his favorite apple milkshake.

I just…wanted him to do good. Really bad.

And my Rohit did quite well! He scored consistent A’s and A+’s in all his assignments. His teachers were really impressed with his prowess. Hell, even the online answer-checking interface in the course videos cheered him on. Whenever he’d give a right answer, it’d flash a video of the CCI’s mascot- which was an owl wearing an orange cap- flutter its wings and squeak in its automated, pre-recorded voice:

*“Congrats, buddy! You sure deserve a big thinking-cap!”*

Yeah, that was kind of a hook CCI had going on. Kinda corny, but hey, the owl looked cute and made Rohit laugh.

But that was the other thing. There were a lot of things that could make my Rohit laugh, and he’d get distracted easily. I’d often take a break from my shift, only to find him playing Pokémon on his Switch…or doodling in his sketchbook…or be BB-gunning the hell out of the birds in the backyard.

I’d get worried. That’s not how my son was gonna land a white-collar job in the Silicon Valley.

I tried telling him many times; that painting women’s butts and bosoms wasn’t gonna sustain him for life, and that he was too old to live the Ruskin Bond fantasy life.

He’d nod his head in a silent approval. I figured he’d understood.

But the very next morning, he’d see hear the song of a magpie on his windowsill. That’d divert him again, and he’d ask me to take him hunting in the woods.

I’d sigh. Grooming my son was turning out a difficult job.

It was tough, very tough, but I had to be a strict father if I wanted my son to succeed. So, I started procrastinating his requests to go hunting. Every Sunday morning, Rohit would snuggle up to me on the bed, and use his baby doll eyes to lure me into taking him into the woods. I just kept changing my excuses; busy weekend, cricket-match, feeling under-weather…and he’d walk back to his room.

*Well, that’s a start*, I’d think to myself.

It took some self-control on my part, but it did work. With nothing much leisurely to do, my son was now spending more of his time studying coding.

But I wasn’t nearly as responsible for the coding-worm that my son would eventually catch.

That was all thanks to the Capped Coders. And their cursed thinking-cap.

\*

On a random weekend, we had this package delivered to our doorstep from the CCI. Inside it, was the said cap, a certificate, and a flash drive. The certificate basically congratulated my son for how well his progress was coming along in his courses.

And, it also made an offer.

The certificate informed me that my son was in the top five-percentile of CCI’s young coders program. So, they were interested in offering my son a project. The flash-drive featured a video guide that’d help him get started on an online app based around creating a virtual-world simulation. It was like one of those RPG video-games: Mario, Zelda, and Pokémon (don’t judge me, at least I’m aware of Nintendo. And I’m 47!).

Rohit would have to make such a functioning app, with a full interface of interacting characters, NPCs, environment modifiers, and stuff. All by himself.

But it wasn’t just a mere project…it was a whole online competition. Out of all the participants, the one whose simulation app would be the best would get a direct recommendation from CCI. A recommendation; to big tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Tesla, who were looking to hire child-geniuses like Rohit.

Yeah, that’s literally what the brochure said- they called my Rohit a child genius.

It was motivation enough for me to put the thinking-cap on Rohit’s head, send him to his room, and start churning milkshakes for my boy.

I know, I know, sounds super authoritarian. Even I felt a bit guilty for just forcing Rohit into this stuff, not regarding his wishes or opinions whatsoever. I felt bad too- and to think I was supposed to be the bad father in the story!

But then, when I did walk into the room…my Rohit- he was hooked on his laptop! He had his headphones on, CCI’s flash-drive plugged into one of his laptop ports, taking active notes on his notebook.

Heck, he didn’t as much as bat an eye while sipping his drink…the whole time, his eyes were glued to the PC’s screen!

It was, like, my ten-year-boy, had fallen in love. With his studies.

I don’t know what else can make an Indian father happier!

The next few days, I spent my time-off watching my brilliant son code. I was so mighty proud of him, of whatever he was doing- even though I had no heck of an idea what was going on! He’d just keep humming, and type one line of code after another on his keyboard. Seconds later, they’d translate into on-screen magic, as lush green trees would come to life in his prototype, virtual world. That’d make my Rohit hum even louder.

Watching him…it didn’t look like he was coding some hard-lined program, no.

My Rohit…with his bright orange Capped Coders’ thinking-cap and a backpack, grinding away at his laptop…

He looked like a coding artist!

My son was hooked onto his coding. I wanted to be with him, but I really had to compensate at the shop for all those education loans I had taken. Besides, as time passed, Rohit seemed kinda bugged by every stupid interjection I would have, like *“Woah, how did you make that pond’s water ripple?”,* or *“Wow, I can see the wind!”*

But I was fine. After all, things were going so damn well.

But then, isn’t that the exact time when all hell’s supposed to break loose?

\*

I’d keep Rohit asking about his progress from time to time. Sure, he was getting to the stage of becoming independent with his work, but God help me- I’m a curious father! He kept telling me how awesome his progress was coming; how all his trees, rivers, and mountains were just like the ones on his *Nintendo Switch* games.

Until one day, he hit a roadblock.

“The NPCs, dad. They are just so boring. I can’t think of any way to make them interesting.”

“Hmm…then why don’t you try modeling them after your real friends? You know; how they speak, what they speak, their mannerisms…that could be pretty interesting.”

“Huh. That’s actually a good idea. Thanks, Dad!”

Problem solved. Just like that.

Or so I thought…

“So I’ve added about 10 characters you can interact with all based on my real friends. But I think I’m gonna need more. I mean- it’s a virtual reality simulation after all. You want it to be as realistic as it can get, right?”

“I guess you do. Maybe you should try modeling some of the characters after kids other than your closest friends. That could be fun.”

“Hmm, I guess…”

But it didn’t turn out to be fun. In school, Rohit tried talking to one of his popular seniors, Jasprit, to get some ideas for his character. But that little shithead called my son a nerd and spilled juice on his shirt.

In front of the whole classroom.

Rohit’s self-esteem hit a real low. He came home crying, and told me how the other boys made fun of him for wearing his thinking-cap all the time- even though it wasn’t hurting nobody! They thought of him as a geeky loser.

I had a word with the school principal. While I couldn’t make that asshole Jasprit directly suffer for what he had done, I got him suspended for a week. A pretty severe punishment, if you think about it.

But the damage had already been done. Rohit’s confidence took a real beating from the whole incident. He felt like an outcast.

“None of the boys want to be friends with me anymore, Daddy. They think I lack personality.”

“Oh, come on, Rohit, you know that’s not true. And you can’t let those bullies get to you, son. You’ve gotta stand up for yourself. That’ll be the real test of your personality.”

But my son just kept staring into the plate of his pav-bhaji. I was gonna placate him when he said something that caught me off guard.

“Personalities are good for a person’s character, right, dad?”

“Of course, son. It makes you the strong-willed man that you are. Don’t you ever forget- “

“So people without personalities…they just. Exist. Without purpose. Like Non-Playable Characters. NPCs. Isn’t that correct, Daddy?”

“Umm…I guess.”

What an oddly specific observation, I thought.

That should’ve been the first red-flag I should’ve paid heed to. But I didn’t. Because a Karen-type customer at table number 7 kept bugging me to serve extra onions.

But I still had my chances. And I missed each one of them.

\*

I got a call from the school next week, asking me to visit on immediate notice. When I got there, I learned that my son had spit a wad of his sputum in one of Jasprit’s friend’s lemonade cups. Mayank had just taken a sip when Rohit started giggling…and after a prolonged exchange of “you wouldn’t be laughing if you knew what I did…”, the school authorities were made aware of what my son had done.

It was in the middle of flu season, so there was a genuine risk of infection spread and whatnot. They weren’t overly stringent, but it was clear that they were disgusted.

As was I.

“Why on earth would you do something like that, Rohit?”

My son looked at me dead in the eye, straightening the thinking cap on his head.

“I just wanted them to show I had enough personality, Dad.”

I had nothing to say. Except ‘Sorry’ to his teachers, and take my son back home.

\*

A week later, I got called again, and this time it was more serious. Rohit had bitten a boy called Shreyas while playing Kabaddi. He kept insisting that it happened on accident- and his teachers did believe him- but they weren’t gonna let two strikes slip by without consequences. He got suspended for a week.

I was much softer to my son this time. Mainly because he was crying.

“I just feel horrible, Dad. I didn’t mean to do it…my mouth was open, and when I tried to tackle him, his neck just touched, and I…”

“Hush, it’s okay, son, you didn’t do it on purpose. Injuries happen while playing, don’t beat yourself up for it.”

“I- I just don’t think that anyone will want to be friends with me anymore, Dad. I’ll just end up, like those boring, NPCs in video games.”

“Hey now, Rohit. That’s just stupid talk; nothing like that’s ever gonna happen. I’ll tell you what- next week, why don’t you invite your friends over to the shop for a tasty lunch? That’ll make them to like you, wouldn’t it?”

“I don’t know, Daddy. Lunch from you doesn’t sound like a tasty idea. Because you always serve healthy stuff like *Charchari* and *Karela* to my friends.”

He was fine now. Long as he was joshing my food, I knew he was fine.

“Oh, fine, I’ll serve you guys burgers! Happy?”

“What, like a brinjal burger?”

“No, proper-job chicken, mutton, and fish burgers, I- oh no, wait, it’s *Navratri* next week. Sorry, kiddo, I can’t serve meat, but I’ll cook up some juicy *paneer* and *aloo*\-”

“That’s okay, I can cook non-veg.”  
“Son, we’ve been over this, and- “

“Mom said I can eat whatever I want, whenever I want, remember? I’m still part Christian. Besides, no one’s gonna come to eat aloo and paneer!”

“Always the mom card, huh? You know, son, eating a veg-kebab once in a while ain’t gonna kill you.”

“Daddy, we’ve been over this, there’s no such thing as veg-kebab…”

\*

The day of the lunch came. I stayed as far ahead from the kitchen as I could. Dishonoring my religion was the last thing I wanted to do.

But I could still smell the waft of the meat patties my son was cooking.

Is it risky to leave a ten-year-old boy in the kitchen all by himself?

Absolutely. But when your boy has helped you manage your one-man food-franchise since he was six- and you can’t absolutely afford to offend your religious deities- you learn to live with these kinds of things.

And from the smell I was savoring, I could tell he was doing an amazing job. All his ten-twelve friends sitting at the booth, too, looked quite pleased with whatever was cooking.

Half an hour later, he walked out of the booth in his apron. A tray of sizzling, Mutton Galouti pavs in his hands. Bowls of mint chutney, tomato ketchup, and lachcha onions on either side.

“Bon Appetit, amigos!”

I watched those boys- my own mouth drooling- as they savored the succulent taste of my son’s food. The way they kept eating- from one burger at a time to three, even four…it was torturous, yet wild at the same time.

“Well. That oughta show them that you and your food, both have a lot of personality, son.”

“You say! That’ll show enough personality for a lifetime!”

Huh?

“Hey, dad, you mind watching the boys? I gotta take a potty break.”

“Yeah, no problem, go do your business.”

\*

My son had left. The boys were finishing off the last bits off their trays. Looked like some of them were actually arguing over who’d get to finish the final portions.

When did my Rohit learn to cook such amazing food?

I was just starting to head off to a different line of thought when one of the boys started twitching awkwardly.

I rushed over, but soon as I did, every boy in the booth started getting uncomfortable. They were all holding their heads to one side, almost like they were having a terrible migraine. I made them drink water, but it did nothing to ease their discomfort. I turned off the mildly-pungent air-freshener.

Still nothing.

Had to be the food.

I was just one digit away from phoning the ambulance. That’s when I heard the low, guttural growl.

When I turned back, I was faced with a dozen 10-year-old boys. Their eyes looking blank, their mouths open agape, their bodies…twisted in awkward positions.

And then, they began biting each other.

I didn’t have the vaguest of the ideas how to react. Until, I saw the trail of blood they had made on the floor…and found one of the boys eyeing me.

I ran out of the shop.

But it was much worse here.

The street was in total mayhem. Opposite to the shop, six-seven-year-old kids were literally mauling each other in the playground. One of them reached the footpath outside and sunk his teeth into an elderly jogger running by.

Moments later, the old runner had the same look of blankness in his eyes as the boys inside my shop did.

Soon, cars started crashing, and out of them, walked out these dead-eyed people to confront each other.

My whole city…it had become a zombie city!

Whole city, but me! And my ten-year-old son, who was locked in the bathroom inside the house.

I had to get Rohit.

I made my way through the backway of my shop to reach the backdoor. It was no time to make observations…but I couldn’t help but observe that none of these newly-converted zombies had really tried getting to me.

I frantically keyed open the door. Soon as I made my way in, I knocked down on the bathroom door, calling out my son’s name louder than an Azaan chant.

But when it opened, my son wasn’t there.

I scoured through every room in the house, desperate to get him out of this nightmare. And when I did eventually find him- he was in his room.

Sitting peacefully. Smiling, next to his laptop. Wearing his Capped Coders thinking-cap.

\*

None of this was looking good.

“Rohit. What- what’s going on here?”

“Huh? Oh, nothing…just the best virtual-world simulation project you can ever find,”. Something about his voice was unsettling. “Here, have a look.”

The laptop screen flashed with the familiar set-up of Rohit’s virtual world. Trees, rivers, cottages, mountains…just like he had shown me.

Except, not quite. There was one new entity, one that I hadn’t seen before.

Standing in the center of the frame, was a digital avatar of my son Rohit.

And next to him, stood a whole bunch of other characters. Each bearing a horrifying resemblance to my townsfolk. There was Jasprit, with his messy hair parted in the middle. There were Rohit’s friends from the shop, all huddled together.

And the longer I kept looking, the more characters popped-up on-screen. The kids from the playground. The elderly jogger. The owners of the crashed cars. All of them appeared…their 3D, virtual avatars hauntingly identical to their real-life counterparts.

In fact, if you looked closely, you could make an expression of terror on their faces. Arms waving, mouths open wide, bodies flailing in desperation…

Almost like they were trapped.

Inside my son’s virtual world.

“What…what have you done?”

“Well, dad. I really liked your idea of incorporating real-world personalities into my NPCs. But no matter how hard I tried…they were just as boring as ever! You can have all the coding knowledge in the world…but you just can’t control the personalities of non-playable characters. I mean, there *is* a reason they are called NPCs, right?

“But as it turns out, you *can* code real-world people. It takes effort, considerable effort, research, brain-work…but then you realize, no human is perfect! They are all mean, hateful, cruel, malevolent- heck, it’s like they are all flawed. *Bugged*, if we’re going for the more technical term. But not the kind of bug that you want them to have, no. That’s a bug you’ll have to incorporate yourself.”

I was stunned speechless.

“So that’s exactly what I did. I made my own bug. I propagated it- through food, through saliva, through my DNA…and I did it! They call it a virtual-world simulation, Daddy. But I- *we*\- call this a hive. And we- us child geniuses- at Capped Coders Inc…we’re the queens of this hive. We are everywhere, deploying our bugs onto our horrible species from every corner of the world.

“We’ll change them…all these humans; we will bend them into something good. Something much nicer than they are now. Something, that perfectly fits our virtual-simulation. A simulation, that will soon transform into reality.

“And they’ll all be damn perfect…just like they were meant to be. Not bugged and flawed like they have been all their lives. No, daddy…that’s just one bad memory- a husk, if you will. And these lifeless husks…these bodies will keep on killing each other. Like they’ve always done. And the more they do so, the more they’ll spread my bug. The more our hive will grow. So I ask you, Daddy. Are you ready to rule this hive with us?”

“Rohit… this isn’t you. The Capped Coders have brainwashed you. Please, let me talk, I- “

“You know, you’re right, Daddy. This isn’t me- Rohit Bansal, sixth-grader at St. Mary’s school. But then who *was* I, really? A worker-child, working to realize the dreams that his father never could? A wannabe artist? A ten-year-old child who just happened to be good at coding? Tell me, daddy. Who was I?”

It took a long while before I finally managed, “A sweet young boy, who was hard-done-by his failure father. That’s what you were, son. That’s who you are.”

“Well…I think I like this version better. Part of me, part of you, part of an innocent child corrupted by the CCI- like an upgrade? And here in my hive, I can make all the friends I want. See, Daddy? Jasprit from school is waving at me! I can actually make him good to me here. This here…is my hive, Daddy. And I’m not gonna leave it. Ever.”

“I’m not gonna let you do it.” I clenched my fists.

“Spoken like a true father. Lucky for me, I got everything planned already.”

No sooner than he had said this, and no sooner than I had made my move, did I feel two pairs of arms grab hold of me. Soon, I was pinned to the wall. The zombie old jogger from the park, and Rohit’s now-zombie school teacher held me on either side.

Soon, a whole bunch of zombie townsmen had broken into my house. They were all standing around the door.

Rohit was right- he really had bugged them. All of them had these big, metallic spiders going around their heads. Their spines guarding the skulls, their eight limbs piercing at different corners of the heads. And each of the people these bugs were controlling; these people, with their pitch-black eyes, and drooling, bloodied mouths…

They were all dead from inside.

\*

Rohit rose from his chair and started walking to me. “I’m disappointed, Daddy, you know. I had specifically programmed them to not bug you. I really wanted you in our team. Can you imagine, Daddy- we wouldn’t have to care about selling those stupid burgers anymore! We could’ve had the whole world to ourselves! Isn’t that something you’ve always dreamed of? For me- for *us*\- to do something big?

“Guess it’s just funny how things turn out when they actually happen. Oh well. I suppose the least I can do is to get you into this new world. I mean- better it be your own son than some random zombie- right?”

Rohit hauled his jaws wide open. The moment he did, the grips on either side of my arms started loosening. This was my chance.

I kicked my son in the nuts, yanked my arm as fast as I could, and prepared to dodge every single zombie in my path.

I had dodged and flailed about half a dozen of them undead; until they finally overwhelmed and pushed me back into the room. So much for my escape plan.

“Really, daddy?” my son sneered at me. “You *really* figured you could outnumber all of them? There are about 200 of them here, and you are just a single, helpless, aging man trying…”

Rohit’s condescending tirade was actually helping. Because the longer he kept going on and on about how dumb I was, and the more time these zombies spent approaching me… I could get my hands under his bed.

To grab the BB-gun that lay on the floor.

I had a last-ditch plan. Wasn’t gonna work, most likely…but I was gonna shoot at the computer. Maybe that was the whole system that had connected Rohit with CCI’s interface? Maybe bringing it down was gonna solve this whole problem?

I had to try. What other option did I have?

My son stood plumb in front of me. A distorted smile on his face, looking mighty proud of the Armageddon he was about to unleash.

Unless his father did anything to stop him.

So I pulled out the gun and shot right into the laptop screen!

Nothing happened. To the laptop; the pellet just harmlessly bounced off the screen.

But my son…I could sense something in his eyes.

“Is that…my BB-gun? Are we…you’re taking me hunting, Papa?”

I was stunned speechless. Was I… getting my son back?

The very next moment, Rohit started screaming, grabbing the edges of his thinking cap.

“The cap…daddy. It…controls. Me”, he winced through the pain.

“I’ll remove it, son. Just hold it there- “

“No…bug rooted deep inside. Need to. Kill.”

Soon as he said that, the zombie townsfolk started closing in on us. I stood up and dragged Rohit behind me, hiding him under the bed.

But he started crawling on the floor, making his way to the other side. To the common space. To the backroom closet.

Where I kept our hunting rifles.

It happened so fast; I didn’t even have the time to register. My son pulled out the gun. Undid the safety. And just when I thought he was gonna shoot at the zombies, he aimed the muzzle to his temple.

Right against his thinking cap.

I tried jumping over the bed, but one of the zombies grabbed my leg. Not like it would’ve helped, anyway.

BAM!

Because Rohit had already snapped the trigger.

I watched horrified; as my son’s body fell limp on the floor. But even after he had fallen, my son grabbed the bloodied edge of his cap and yanked it off with whatever strength remained in his body.

It came off with a sharp metallic KLINK.

I walked over to my son. He was unmoving. But the thing that was inside his thinking cap…it was twitching like crazy.

A spider. A big, metallic bug, looking back at me with its big, soulless dark eyes. A whole bunch of metallic pearl eggs hidden under its body.

Its body. Its silver-plated body…stained slightly red and pink on the edges. With the blood and brains of my Rohit.

This bug, inside this orange thinking cap. That had killed the innocence in my son.

I stomped it. It was dead in a single motion,

And then I howled into the night like the traumatized, failure father that I was.

\*

The gun-shot Rohit had self-inflicted had barely grazed past his brain. Doctors said the nerve damage he had done was irreparable. Doctors, who were no longer controlled by Rohit’s bugs. They were all dead once the queen bug was down.

In fact, everyone who had got infected by the bug threw-up big, pearl-sized, metal eggs once they weren’t bugged anymore. They didn’t remember nothing. Thought I was hosting some kind of restaurant special and wanted discounts. Course, once they saw what state I and Rohit were in, they rushed us to the hospital.

I would’ve much rather had them remember the whole experience that they were subjected through. Because no matter how much I try to explain them about CCI and its malicious plans, they just laugh it off like some outlandish story. “Stop selling burgers, and write science-fiction, Bunty,” they’d joke.

Then, they’d see my teary-eyed face and leave me to grieve by myself.

Rohit wasn’t lying when he was talking about the *Capped Coders* controlling a hive. Every post that I make against them; every expose that I try to do- it gets censored, blocked, or removed within seconds. I’ve also started receiving a whole bunch of threat emails and messages. *“The hive is watching you”.* That’s all they read.

I don’t respond to them. Don’t know what to say.

Speaking of selling burgers…I don’t own my restaurant or house anymore. All my money has gone into keeping my Rohit alive. He’s in a coma. The only thing that’s sustaining his life is a big, 32-inch monitor next to his bed, with a whole bunch of wires and dials.

“Mr. Bansal…you might want to be a bit realistic here,” the doctors tell me. “At this point, his brain is the only alive part of his body. And judging by his prowess, we aren’t even sure how long that’s gonna work. We…”

I don’t listen to them. I just watch my son and the pattern of lines that flashes on his monitor. Sometimes, when two of those lines cross, they kinda look like a woman’s legs spread wide open. Makes me think of all the beautiful, ‘natural-beauty’ sketches that my Rohit used to draw.

And then, I hear those familiar beeps and clicks of the machine.

And I’m reminded of my horrifying obsession…that has brought me and my ten-year-old son to this irreversible point of our lives."

TMI maybe but I just want an honest opinion. I just feel like I’m in over my head. The coursework comes easy to me and I do leetcode in my minuscule free time between internships and maintaining life...I love programming. I don’t know what else I would do if I didn’t pursue it but I feel so not ready to compete against these people who code 24/7. Any advice?

TLDR: should I give up my dream and pursue something less competitive?"

I'm a freshman at a relatively well-known university for CS (top 20), and I'm pretty late to the internship game. I haven't actually sent out any applications yet, but have quite a few (somewhat impressive) side projects, in addition to numerous hackathon wins. 

I'd like an internship for the summer, but I'm not really sure where to start looking, how to apply, or even if I can still get one. I know that a lot of the ""good"" companies have already conducted their interviews, which rules out programs such as Microsoft Explore and Google Engineering Practicum. 

Any thoughts/advice on this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much!"

I'm an undergraduate student considering going for an M.S. or Ph.D. related to my field, Computer Science/Cybersecurity. I've been looking at schools and it seems like a lot require around 3 letters of recommendation; not to mention scholarships, jobs, and internships that sometimes require them as well. So, if I wanted to apply to three schools I'd need ~9 letters of rec. I've never been the best at asking for letters (it just feels a bit weird to me), but I am friendly with a few professors &amp; professional supervisors that I could ask. However, that's not 9+ people. In this scenario, is it common to ask for multiple letters from one reference? Or one letter that I send to three schools? I'm not super versed in all this and am trying to figure it out, so I apologize if I'm showing my ignorance. I'd really appreciate any insights!"

I was looking at certifications and I saw the A+ but after inquiring more about it I've seen people both praise it and bash it. Apparently it helped people with literally no experience land their first job and for others it was a complete waste of time and money. Do I need the A+ if I'm in university?

khvahw,2,2020-12-21,Disillusionment,Throwaway820394,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/khvahw/disillusionment/,"This is a bit more complicated than your standard suicidal urges. I have underwent TMS and am on bupropion. I recently was taken off of escitalopram by my psychiatrist to see how I would do. It appears things have been getting worse, but I do not know if it is because I need the medicine, or if it provided a bit of false lightening to my mood. Much like a suicidal person may be more inclined to feel negative emotions, perhaps the medicine helped in that regard.   


Regardless of this, this virus has hit me hard in regards to my perception of life. I am American for context. I have a bachelor's degree in Biology and Chemistry, and have been trying my best to find employment. Despite my efforts, I have not found anything. No internships. No lab assistant positions. No entry level clerk positions. I apply for jobs requesting high school graduates and do not even get interviews. I tried temp agencies, and I do not qualify for the slim pickings they offer. I would do something involving fast food, but I am not physically fit enough yet, and am likely to get myself fired, worsening future job perspectives.   


I am considering doing Master's work online, but I wanted to do a job first to earn money for it. I qualify for a tuition waiver, but this does not cover rent or other utilities I need. Even then, would it really help? I was always sold this impression that following this path would have people begging me to work for them. I gave up on my dreams to be a historian because of this narrative. I was even selected for a high school program for sciences because they told me they needed STEM students so badly. If they are so necessary, where are the jobs? I could not get internships for college either. One big opportunity for second year students was given to a graduate of the university despite being this not being for graduates. The only work I could get was as a lab assistant. I did well and enjoyed it, but as it was a work-study thing, the hours I could work were limited.   


This brings me to the concern that no amount of education will overcome this problem. I imagine I will do the Master's program, successfully graduate, and still not qualify for anything. Then I will be instructed to get a PhD, where even on the off-chance I am successful, I do not know if it will lead to anything.   


I am 23, yet I find myself scrambling to get employment. I am a man forced to remain a dependent. My father seems compassionate, but I do not want to be a burden. The only thing that's kept me from killing myself is him and my sister. I asked him for permission to kill myself as an attempt to mitigate damage from my loss. I did not do this to upset him, but to help him come to terms with my passing. He told me my death would devastate him. So, I find myself stuck here. I have no sign that I can do a job where I can help people. I am dependent on financial support. My stepmother has a strong disdain for me because she does not understand the difficulties of the market now. My dad is also helping me seek opportunities, but each one I apply for has fallen apart. Everyone I worked with quite liked me, so I do not think being disagreeable is what's keeping me from getting employed.   


The discussions on people hating their jobs has also gotten to me. They work so hard only to become practically serfs, with work that has no net positive outcome. They are stuck at a point where their life lacks both meaning or joy. Meaning is something constructed by humans, but when those options are limited to survival, the ability to create meaning is stunted. It makes me want to not bother, using my corpse as a message against this system. Yet again, my sister and father keep me from doing this. I do not want this injury to pain them for the rest of their lives.   


What should I do to continue progression? To actually reach a point where I have meaningful employment, and I am happy with what I do? Do I need to leave the US? Seek a new degree? Find cheap training? These past six months have been dealing with a shattered reality. Can someone help me reconstruct the pieces? The mirror cannot be fixed, but maybe a mosaic can be made from the pieces."

What are some good things to do career-wise over the summer other than an internship? I've heard of some stuff like REU sites and Google Summer of Code, but they seem more selective than a traditional internship would be, not less. I could also take summer classes, but that isn't really necessary for me and I'd rather do something I can list as experience instead TBH.

I'm trying to prepare myself early for what is to hopefully come in the next couple years. Some background: This past week I received my bachelor's in Information Systems and am now working full time for a Fourtune 500 company as a sys admin (mainly handling virtual server provisioning and maintenance) after being an intern for quite some time. Though it isn't the job I want, the pay is great for someone my age so I took the offer after some negotiation.  (My desired job was backend development however I didn't have enough experience to be competitive)

I am now moving on to my Masters degree in Supply Chain Management and Analytics. My school has a very analytic heavy program which I hope to combine with my IT/development skills upon graduation.

My question: How can I start moving into the Data Analytics field now, without returning to an internship? Has anyone else gone a similar route? If so, how did you blend the skills of two degrees and use it to your advantage while only having job experience in one field? I'd welcome stories of people who also combined their IT degrees with others sectors such as accounting, and how you merged the skills.

However, in London, there are many nice Graduate programs whose requirements I fulfill and I think I were a decent fit for many positions I applied for.

The thing is, I constantly get rejected from the UK companies. I have applied to around 70-80 positions. I know I am not the best candidate, but I think that I should have got at least one online assessment or sth from the UK. An EU-citizen friend of mine experienced the same thing.

Is it possible that the UK companies avoid EU citizens due to Brexit?

For example, I applied for the same SDE new grad role in Amazon both in London and Berlin. Berlin sent me the online assessment whereas London rejected me the next week."

I’m new to this sub and was wondering if there are any decently well-paying jobs that are not as competitive to get as IB analysts. Breaking into Ibs that have lower acceptance rates than  Ivys seem like a waste of time for me. I think I could instead prepare for seemingly less fancy positions that are often overlooked by many such as boutique and banks? Again, idk much about the kind of jobs out there.

I generally think of myself as practical and detail-oriented. I’m not a people’s person and I’m very much working independently all the time. I can do some programming—thinking of minoring in CS. I’m also interested in stock trading, if that is something not many people have to compete to get. Getting an internship in the finance field seems like a good way to show employers that I can handle my work relatively well, but I’m not sure if they would hire a freshman with no experience, even if it is unpaid. Give me any insights into the financial world and good advices for a freshman. Thanks a ton!"
ki5xfn,16,2020-12-22,What are your experiences with mentors in CS/tech?,Dasmer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ki5xfn/what_are_your_experiences_with_mentors_in_cstech/,"**My background:**

I was uneducated (no GED) 3 years ago, struggled with some personal issues relating to addiction, and got a manufacturing job. I spent most of my time watching the machine code go by and trying to learn what they were doing. One of my leads noticed and showed me the tool compartment's guide. Everyone was very supportive and provided me the opportunity to grow both my technical and mechanical skills (both of which were minimal when I started, but I worked hard). I distinctly remember one of the leads from another department told me when I asked for career advice, ""Kid, you're young (I wasn't that young, late 20s), get out while you still can."" I didn't get it at first, but then...

I got another job closer to home, and it was the best and worst thing I could have done. The support I received from all the leads was gone. The support I did receive was from mentors who seemed to brag and jealously guard their knowledge. I realized that machining was not the way to go for me, as it's a small job market with some headstrong personalities. I was stuck until I was let go for ""lack of work"".

So I switched gears: First to telemarketing to get some experience working in a white-collar setting, and then as a customer service rep. I worked my ass off and got promoted and started a degree program online (take a wild guess which school) for Software Engineering. I didn't even realize why I loved it. At first, I just wanted something where I made something and solved problems. I realized later machine code are just variables, and what I was doing now was coding the variables. I loved it.

Fast forward to just before COVID, and I'm getting burnt out from my current position in customer service. I want to work with computers. I want to code. I want to problem-solve. I interview for a Senior position, knowing I won't get it but as a hail-mary to see if something more interesting or challenging will make the job tolerable again. During the interview, I mentioned that I'm currently enrolled in a Software Engineering program, and the interview changed gears pretty quickly. We're a small company, so having someone on staff that can do the technical side of things without going through our parent company or consultants is ideal. He tables it, COVID hits, and due to our industry, we're swamped for a few weeks, and then... Nothing. 

So I message one of the people in the tech department that I know and see if he's interested in some help. He was, and in fact, was pushing for me to help. This man, who was my trainer and new to his role, put his neck out for me. I wholeheartedly love this man. He taught me how to script our phone system, make and edit templates for our CRM, handle meetings, organize myself (still learning this one), and introduce me to our developer.

He left to go work for another company (don't blame him, far more money and more personality-driven, which he loves), and as a result, I was promoted. Now, I work more directly with our development ""team"" (a developer and a BA). The developer and I get along well, I think, and he's teaching me things about the phone system I didn't know, as well as saying he'd like to get me to do some JS/JSON work to train me up. 

I've been fortunate beyond belief with all of this, and I can't imagine getting into a career like CS/IT/tech without some form of mentorship from so many different people along the way. I also imagine a bad mentor can break this career for a lot of people. 

**So now the question proper:**

What are your experiences with mentorships? Did they mostly involve internships or less traditional mentors/peer to peer teaching? Have you been on the opposite end of this and been the mentor? What do you look out for in people that you take under your wing, as it were?

*(If you're reading this and know who I am, hoo boy, please ignore the first sentence and don't look at my post history. Granted, I am who I am because of my mistakes, and I'm not truly ashamed of them, just self-conscious about it hurting my career. Growth is often overlooked for easy judgment.)*"

When COVID wasn't a thing, I was able to use body language, questions, and facial expressions to make up for my ""boring"" voice. landed every job I had interviewed for when interviewing in person, both inside and outside of engineering. (I know careers are much more competitive than internships, but the point is I feel I interview well in person.) 

Since COVID is a thing, I'm having phone interviews and I know that I am not performing as well as I can. I do better in video interviews, but still not as well as in person. Has anyone experienced similar issues? Are there tricks to sounding more interesting over the phone? I still want to sound genuine and not go over-board faking my voice. 

TLDR: I have a monotone voice and can't convey my enthusiasm over the phone like I can in person, making my phone interviews lackluster."

I desperately need some career advice because I really feel like my whole life is just one big failure.

I finished my Matric (final year of high school) with straight As. Got into a great university, but dropped out after a year because I was desperately homesick. I'm not sad I left because I got to spend time with my childhood dog (I had strong attachment to the dog, I didn't have friends at school, just the dog), she died shortly after I got home. I went back to university 2 years later, but to a school closer to home so I could go home on the weekends. I graduated with a degree in Ecology, got my honours, secured a lucrative internship, which turned out to be the most awful experience ever. I was located in an office with 1 other person, my boss would only check in on us once or twice a week, and I could never find enough work to do to feel like I was doing something meaningful. I got a scholarship and went on to get a Masters degree in Ecology. I secured another scholarship to study towards my PhD, but I dropped out because I choose supervisors who I didn't click with and who I struggled to deal with. I tried for 3 years to get any kind of job, from teaching at a skills college for nature conservation workers, invasive species management, scientific writing editor, environmental education teacher etc. I didn't even get a single interview.

I decided that if I was going to have any chance of real employment, I needed to go and get my teaching certification, because there is always a shortage of teachers and for years people have told me I would make a great science teacher. I worked hard and got my certificate with distinction. But yet again, I have put out my CV to every school in my area, and applied for every single job I have found on the 5 teaching jobs groups I follow on Facebook. In all, I reckon I have applied to 75 different schools, and again not a single call back. 

I'm starting to give up hope. I have been on CV writing workshops, gotten professionals to look over my CV and cover letter and pick it apart. I edit my CV at least once a month to try and make it pop out of the pile. 

I'm currently working at a job a friend organized, but I'm pretty sure I'm going to be fired soon because I suck at this job (selling English education lessons).

What have I done wrong? I am beyond broke and owe so much money, so I can't just go and do another course. I thought I had ticked off all the boxes, got good grades, got a graduate degree, worked hard, but that hasn't seemed to have helped. I need some help finding the right direction."

Close to Giving Up on Everything,ShadoowManX,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/kicgmf/over_2_12_years_since_bachelors_degree_still_cant/,"Late 20s. I have a bachelor's degree, an associate's degree, a high school degree, and only 1 internship completed during my bachelor's degree as for ""experience"". It's almost 3 years since I completed my bachelor's degree, but I still can't break the ice into information technology jobs to get my career going.

\-I don't have the money (and I can't save up money) to pursue any IT certifications like CCNA, A+, Microsoft, etc. Can't even afford networking classes.

\-I don't have transportation to even get me to cities with better chances of finding tech work, and many want you to have your own car and license, but I'm not comfortable driving.

\-Where I live is a near ghost town for tech work, meaning I'll have to go out of town or go online. If I'm not making much, it costs me more money commuting than making on the job

\-Even with a few options, public transportation (if it's not to Atlanta) is still limited, and there aren't too many jobs below Atlanta.

\-I don't have the money and means to relocate to better cities

\-Not much of any volunteer opportunities within my hometown, and even then, there's nothing tech-related.

\-Can't really network or build a network of connections to advocate for me.

\-COVID is still going to impact the job market come next year.

\-Don't trust a lot of online positions.

\-Even trying to reformat my resume is a hassle. How can I even sell myself with mostly education and no work experience outside of 1 internship?

\-Even trying to get a shit job is a dead end. Last interview I had was for a customer service rep position, but the interviewer claimed he was overwhelmed with my resume and felt I wasn't a good fit. What's even the point in trying to look into a position if employers are so biased? Why even pursue a dead end job if employers can look at your profile and see you're not trying to stick around for more than 2 years?

And even then, there's no job security thanks to COVID. You might be on a job 1 week, but then you get laid off or furloughed because that company goes under. COVID has already affected the market, and it will continue to impact jobs next year.

I cannot deal with this frustration and stress any longer. I hate being inactive with no real abilities to do anything about because I'm stuck in a dead zone city. I've tried applying for everything within my hometown but have gotten nowhere. I've been trying, but I'm struggling, and I can't deal with this much anymore. If this keeps up into next year, it's really making me just want to give up on everything period. What's the point in pursuing a career in a field you feel passionate about if nobody's willing to give you a chance to start? What's the point in holding onto hope if it gets crushed at every turn? What's the point in dreaming if those dreams will also be dashed into dust?

These were positions I was looking into. Obviously, I'm trying to get into entry-level tech to get going.

I'm a third year aero/mech major, looking for internships over the summer.  I've applied frequently and often to many companies, but I'm not hearing back from many.  I know its pretty hard finding full time jobs without internship experience; I'm pretty stressed out about this.  I'm still applying and tailoring my resume to positions, but I'm wondering if there is anything else I can do.  I'm currently finding some local companies I might cold-call or just reach out to.  I just feel like I should be doing more or that I'm not doing enough.  Does anyone have tips or know of other resources I should be looking at. 

Secondly, I have research experience and I can most likely continue it through the summer if I can't land an internship.  If I do end up doing research with my professor over the summer would that put me in a good place for full time job applications? 

If anyone has any tips or advice, I would appreciate it a lot! Thank you and hope everyone is having a well-deserved break."

I am a senior at a university and I've been applying for internships the past few months. I received two emails with interview offers for two different companies. One (Company B) is scheduled for the first week of January and I just had the other one (Company A) yesterday and received an offer within a few hours. As Company B is not until two weeks, I felt as though I had to accept Company A's offer to stay on the safe side. 

My dilemma is I am interested in both, but I am also a full-time student (13 units for Winter Quarter). I already agreed to an interview with Company B prior to receiving the offer from Company A and I feel like it would look bad to backtrack on that. However, I also feel like I am wasting the time of the person that will be interviewing me only to say, hey, to be transparent, in the time when you extended an interview offer, I was offered an internship with another company two weeks prior to our interview. 

I really do not want to burn any bridges, especially since Company B is not guaranteed.  But also, if I do end up getting an offer from Company B, I am worried about time management, juggling two internships plus school but also putting my best effort in both. I feel like these are the only opportunities I have left as this is my senior year and a lot of internships require school credit since they are unpaid.

Should I still go through with Company B's interview?  Or should I shoot them an email backing out? Or should I possibly take on two internships at once (both expecting around 16hrs/2 days a week)? How would the two companies take that?

Thanks for any and all advice."

1. National Merit Semifinalist National
2. Big Questions Debate 3rd Place in State Tournament
3. Auburn High School Delegate for Alabama Boy's State School
4. Presidential Service Volunteering Award (Gold) National
5. Science Olympiad Meteorology 9th at Nationals National 9

**Letters of Recommendation**

Haven't read any of the letters, but I know that I got an extremely good letter from my IB English teacher. I also got ones from my engineering teacher/Science Olympiad coach and my debate coach, both of which I have worked with closely and I have known for a long time. I sent in one from my internship at Johns Hopkins. The professor told me I was almost doing research at an undergrad level, so I feel that the recommendation letter was also really good. Counselor super high tier.

**Interviews**

Submitted a really cringey video profile. Talked about my wide range of interests and why I wanted to study biology.

**Essays**

Wrote my personal statement on how I grew from being a pure science nerd and bookworm to embrace debate, public speaking, and connection with people- pretty normal introvert to extrovert story.

Simped hard on Why UChicago essay- compared them to different highly selective schools on different types of traits and said why I exclusively wanted to go to UChicago. Referenced some of the online mock class sessions I attended and why I thought that their careers in law &amp; Metcalf internships were exactly what I wanted to pursue my dream job. Oh yeah, and I included a sonnet.

I had fun writing my Uncommon Essay (chose divide by zero prompt)- basically made a parody of LOTR and did some ""pseudomath"" to prove that ""a thing"" can be divided by zero. Not anything life changing, but I thought that it was interesting and quirky.

My counselor and my English teacher both gave their thumbs up- counselor said the Why UChicago one was really well written.

In COVID section (Common App), I talked about how I made COVID safety videos for the school news, advocated on the city council meeting for masks, and emailed the principal with COVID safety recommendations that I researched.

TL;DR

PE: 6-7/10- normal stuff

Why: 8-9/10- pretty good

Uncommon: 6-7/10- not really sure how to rate this

**Current Decisions**

**Accepted**

University of Alabama Birmingham- Rolling, accepted, full tuition president scholarship

Auburn University- EA, accepted, still filling out Scholarship app

University of Georgia Athens- EA, accepted, little bit of aid

**Waitlist**

none

**Rejected**

Uchicago :(

**Extra stuff for feedback purposes (not in template)** \----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Why I Think I Got Rejected**

\- Class rank not in top 1%

\- Didn't do a varsity sport or play music (large percent of applicants according to UChicago website)

\- Not enough community impact (did lots of community service, but not enough impact)

\- Essays and video were to cringey, dreamy, and not what they were looking for- should have been more concentrated into my interest a a specific personality

\- No big hooks or spikes (well rounded, but not particularly super duper passionate about doing one specific thing; middle class/lack of challenges in life maybe- though the latter is probably just an excuse)

&amp;#x200B;

**Where I Plan to Go From Here**

Time to grind. Plan to aim a bit lower (at edge or outside of T20 schools)- CMU, Rice, etc.

Honestly it still hasn’t quite settled in and it all feels rather surreal. This has been a work in progress and I’m finally seeing the fruits of my labor.

I’m basically self-taught, since my schools CPE major is heavily focused on EE. Unfortunately by the time I truly found my love for software, switching to CS would’ve accrued far too much overhead. So for the last two years I’ve been learning incessantly by reading books, following online courses, building personal projects, and leetcoding really hard towards the end. 

Before I discovered the wonderful rabbit hole that is software, I had been aimlessly getting by life on cruise control. At the time, I arrogantly believed I could just walk into my schools career fair with a shitty word template resume and leave with an offer. Obviously I didn’t get anything, but til now it’s the best decision I’ve made in my life. That same day my heart was broken, I realized just how naive I had been. I was used to simply getting by doing the bare minimum but now I had hit a wall and my character would be tested. I took off my tie went to the bathroom and broke down crying in frustration and resentment towards my own idiocy. Not one to admit defeat too easily, I wiped my tears and went straight to a Barnes n Nobles. There I bought a book called Python Crash Course, and went home unsure where the impulse even came from (I had never heard of python before, shit I didn’t even know how to program). After a few days working through the book, for once in my life I felt a fire under my ass. I had real goals and aspirations. I had found my path in life.

Just wanted to share my story because I know just how tough it is right now. I promise if you stick through with this there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. Wether you’re just starting, looking for an internship, new grad role, pivoting, or whatever it might be if you believe in yourself (as corny as it sounds) you will persevere. It’s incredible what you’re capable of when you truly dedicate yourself to a goal. For some these goals might seem distant, but just little steps everyday will get you there eventually. 

Thank you for taking your time to read and I wish you all the best on your journeys."

kiink0,132,2020-12-22,Applying to College: University Highlights: Open Curriculum Style,eccentricgalaxy,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/kiink0/applying_to_college_university_highlights_open/,"Hi everybody, I hope all of you are doing well and staying safe!

For those of you who follow my college highlight posts, I normally tend to talk about a particular university.  However, given that ED/REA/EA applications have mostly ended and that many of you all are focused on RD applications, I wanted to share a post highlighting all the universities that have an open curriculum, primarily because I remember how it seemed like open curriculums are quite rare.  Although most schools do not have one, more schools have curriculums like these than it seems.

**Q: What exactly is an open curriculum?**

Generally speaking, it means that the school has very little or almost no general education requirements meaning that you can essentially pick any courses you wanna take as long as they have space and you meet the prerequisites, and you can graduate on time.  As you may notice later in the table below, every school's ""open curriculum"" does have a ton of differences, meaning that certain schools such as Smith, Hampshire, Amherst, Grinnell, or Brown allow far more freedom in choosing your courses while others like Wesleyan, Kalamazoo, or Hamilton tend to be a little more rigid.  However, all of these schools are definitely far more lenient with how they align their curriculum compared to many of their peer institutions such as Columbia, UC Hicago, Yale, Williams, Pomona, Harvey Mudd, etc. especially as Columbia and UC Hicago have a Core Curriculum.  (By the way, a similar post like this for schools with Core Curriculums will be published soon!)

**Table of Open Curriculum Universities**

&amp;#x200B;

|School Name|Required Courses in the Curriculum|Need-Blind for Americans?|Need-Blind for Internationals?|Meets full demonstrated need?|Loan free need based financial aid?|Merit aid?|Application Fee|

\* It's important to note that at Grinnell, no more than 48 credits can be from one subject and no more than 92 credits can be one division with the divisions being Humanities, Social Sciences, and Laboratory Sciences.  Generally, an ordinary semester course at Grinnell is 4 credits.

\*\*...to be eligible to be a honors student and join Phi Beta Kappa, you are required to take nine general education courses.

\*\*\*...important to note that the world language requirement can be met if you pass a Vassar language test, get a 4 or 5 on the equivalent AP, a 600 or higher on the SAT Subject Test, or similar.  You can read more on their website [here](https://catalogue.vassar.edu/content.php?catoid=38&amp;navoid=6763) and scroll down to their world language requirement.

\*\*\*\* Important to note that only women and trans women can apply to Smith College.

\*\*\*\*\* At Wake Forest, students have to apply for the open curriculum program, but you can apply at anytime even as a first year.  O[therwise, the requirements are similar to peer universities](https://newstudents.wfu.edu/academics/academic-success/curriculum-requirements/) with a first year seminar, writing seminar, a 200-level international language course, health and exercise science course, divisional requirements, and cultural diversity and quantitative requirements.

\*\*\*\*\*\* Unlike many of the other schools on the table, UVA Echols is essentially a program at UVA where around 5% or so of the College of Art and Sciences students are admitted.  Unfortunately, you cannot specifically request to apply for this, and only UVA AOs decide.  Students can apply in future years at UVA, though, once they are a student at UVA.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\* Like with UVA Echols, NYU's Gallatin School is a separate school a student needs to be accepted for, but you get to choose to apply here if you wish.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* While a very wonderful school, it is important to note that the school has had some trouble staying open.

&amp;#x200B;

**Honorable Mentions**

Although many do not offer an open curriculum, there are some noteworthy universities which introduce more flexible plans.  This is a list to shout out any colleges with these interesting plans.

* **Swarthmore College:** All first year students during first semester take courses pass/fail and can take anything they wish as long as they meet prerequistes and do not need to worry about fulfilling any requirements, which is super nice if you're interested in interdisciplinary study, want to try a subject without worrying about your GPA, and/or you're undecided on your future academic study.  In addition, Swarthmore in general is a lot more flexible with the curriculum compared to peer schools like UChicago because you can generally pick within each field what you would like to study.  You can read more about their curriculum [here.](https://www.swarthmore.edu/advising-handbook/requirements)  Swarthmore also offers a Honors Program, which is not common at most peer LACs.
* **Oberlin College:** Oberlin offers an ""Experimental College,"" where even students can teach the material they are interested in and design their own curriculums.
* **Williams College:** Although Williams does have some distribution requirements, they offer the Oxford style courses where you are put in a class with just one other student and a professor, and the three of you together can explore any topic you all agree upon.
* **Sarah Lawrence College:** The college offers biweekly student-faculty conferences, which is extremely unique to them.
* **The Evergreen State College:** Instead of majoring in something specifically, students can mix courses from different fields if they would rather.  They also offer some very unique majors, such as Culture, Text, and Language in World Societies; Literary Arts and Studies; Media Arts and Studies; Political Economy; and many others.
* **Bard College:** Although there are distribution requirements, you get to create any project you'd like for your senior year, and you virtually have free choice in what you take your junior and senior year.
* **Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts:** Other than two writing courses in your first year and a capstone program required in your senior year, you can create any major you would like and draft out what it will look like.
* **Dartmouth College:** While Dartmouth has a lot of distribution requirements, they offer the ability to design your own major, and with the D-Plan, there is way more flexibility in terms of when and how you take your classes as you can study abroad or even take an internship or research opportunity during the middle of the school year if desired.
* **Bryn Mawr College:** Similarly to Dartmouth, you can design a major of your choice, however, Bryn Mawr is open only to women.
* **Cornell University, Southwestern University, James Madison University, Berea College, Elon University, Spelman College, and many others also offer the ability to design your own major like Bryn Mawr and Dartmouth.**

Hope this helped!

To all the seniors on this subreddit working on RD applications this week for Jan. 1, I wish you all the best of luck!  I'm really rooting for all of you.  Similarly, I root for everyone who is still waiting on EA/REA/ED decisions.  I'm hoping it works out for all of you.

Have a nice day!"
kik164,363,2020-12-22,The Elevator People,MrClarenceWorley,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/kik164/the_elevator_people/,"I have a close friend who’s a psychiatrist (please don’t read too much into that.) She mostly just teaches these days. From a textbook that she wrote, no less. But back when she was still practicing, this friend’s specialty was the treatment of specific phobias. You know, patients with an irrational fear of heights or needles or spiders. Fun stuff like that. That's why I lovingly refer to her as “Doctor Scary”, a nickname which she absolutely adores, no matter what that lying bitch tells you.

One night when we were both especially turnt, I asked Dr. Scary if she ever encountered a patient with a phobia that managed to scare even her. We were seated directly beside each other on the wooden bench-swing suspended from her back porch, but Dr. Scary didn’t look at me when she replied. Her gaze remained fixed on the shadowy expanse of her well-manicured backyard as she scoffed and slowly nodded.

And then she said…

""The Elevator People.""

When this particular patient (a 39 year-old medical supply salesman who we'll call “Simon”) first showed up at Dr. Scary’s office, he had listed “fear of elevators” as the reason why. Needless to say but if that was an accurate summation of Simon’s issue, we wouldn’t be here.

It all started almost a year prior, while Simon was at a conference in Las Vegas. He was there with his sales manager, scoping out the latest innovations in pacemaker technology and hoping to find a distributor willing to haggle. The trip really was all business too. Simon had never been much for gambling and the live shows gave him a headache. The conference might as well have been in Boise for all he cared.

Simon noted that the initial elevator ride up to his hotel room that night had been perfectly uneventful. Though his flight into McCarran had been delayed, of course. Simon had barely made it to the hotel with enough time for a quick shower and change of clothes before the meet-and-greet in the lounge at 8pm. It was five after when he finally re-emerged from the room in a flurry, tie still untied and his blazer draped over one arm.

As Simon hurried over to the bank of elevators at the other end of the hall, he got a text from his sales manager, who sounded annoyed and was currently waiting for him down in the lobby. Simon hit the button to call for an elevator as he began to frantically tap out a response text explaining the flight delay.

There was a mechanical *DING* as the middle elevator’s metal doors slid open in his periphery. Simon started inside the elevator as he finished his text and hit “send”. He looked up to smile politely at the other passengers onboard and that is when Simon went rigid, his half-formed smile freezing in place as a tingling surge of fear temporarily overroad control of his body.

To his right, a naked and skeletally thin old man stood grinning back at Simon. The man was completely hairless; his malformed bald head was the shape of a used pencil eraser. He didn’t have eyebrows or facial hair or even pubic hair to hide a fraction of the small yet noticeably erect penis jutting out from between his shriveled legs like the head of some hungry, flesh-colored turtle.

To Simon’s left stood a woman in a tattered gray dress. She appeared to be hairless as well and had a similarly deranged grin stretched across the front of her similarly bald and oddly shaped head. She sported a pronounced hunchback and had glimmering feline eyes. Simon’s bewildered gaze darted from the naked man to the female hunchback, then down to the bald child peeking out from behind her.

The woman shoved the child back out of sight as the naked man attempted to grab Simon by his face. Seeing those grimy fingers darting toward him was enough to finally snap Simon out of his shock and he just barely managed to evade the naked man’s grasp with a single leaping jump back out of the elevator.

He hadn’t moved like that since college and every joint and tendon in Simon's legs was currently screaming at him. Fortunately, at that moment adrenaline was making it impossible for Simon to register much of anything aside from the elevator doors sliding closed in what felt like slow-motion just as the lunging naked man was about to reach between them.

A dumbstruck Simon was still standing there, quietly panting and staring at those same closed elevator doors a full minute later when an attractive blonde woman approached from the other end of the hallway. She gave Simon a wave as she neared but he didn’t even seem to register her presence. The woman’s expression went from confused to annoyed as she noticed that the button to call the elevator still needed to be pushed.

Simon shook off his daze and managed to take the next elevator all the way down to the lobby without further incident (if you didn't count several awkward glances from the attractive woman who rode down with him.) He was only fashionably late for the rendezvous with his sales manager, who was already busy talking up several of the reps waiting in line for the meet-and-greet.

The open bar and inane conversation helped Simon put what had just happened to him out of his mind for the moment and, to his surprise, it actually turned out to be a rather lucrative evening. So much so that about an hour in, Simon’s manager gave him a pat on the back and announced that he was going to officially clock out for the night to quote “start focusing on who I’m a'fuck.”

Still feeling a bit jetlagged and generally exhausted from his earlier encounter, Simon decided to take this opportunity to get some much-needed rest before tomorrow when the real work needed to get done. As he exited the hotel lounge and made his way back across the lobby, Simon spotted a pair of Vegas newlyweds forcefully making out while they waited for an elevator. A wave of relief washed over him when Simon realized he wouldn’t have to ride back up to his room alone.

An elevator arrived a few moments later and Simon hit the button for the tenth floor as he entered. The couple followed him on and the young guy leaned away from his better half just long enough to poke the button labeled “3”. Simon's stomach began to churn as he realized he was going to have to ride for seven whole floors by himself. When the car stopped to let the couple out, he was tempted to exit with them and take the stairs the rest of the way. But the love-birds had seen him hit the button for ten already. Following them off now without looking like a weirdo would be rather difficult.

Simon just barely managed to suppress his urge to sprint out of there and took a deep breath as the elevator doors slowly slid shut with him still enclosed behind them. The elevator resumed its ascent and almost immediately, the overhead lights began to flicker. This prompted a tired eye-roll from Simon as he muttered, “You’ve got to be fucking kid-”

And that’s when the lights switched off completely. He could feel the car continue its climb as he reflexively spun around and pressed his back to the cold steel of the elevator's inner doors. Somewhere just passed the oppressive darkness now enveloping him, Simon could hear movement.

He held his breath in an attempt to better discern the sound’s location. As Simon’s eyes began to adjust to the darkness, he glimpsed what at first appeared to be the silhouette of a massive spider crawling toward him. But this was only a trick of perspective. What he was actually seeing was merely a hand reaching out to grab Simon by his face.

There was another *DING* as the doors he was leaning against finally slid open, sending Simon spilling out onto the hotel’s gaudy patterned carpet, landing face-up and looking into an open elevator that currently appeared to be both well-lit and noticeably empty. It was that moment right there when his fear of “the Elevator People” truly took root.

Since the inciting incident was tangentially related to his job, Dr. Scary’s first instinct had been to examine Simon’s work-life. He claimed he couldn’t have been happier on that end. He liked the job and made good money doing it. Simon even liked the people he worked for, despite the fact that his sales manager was five years younger than him and a womanizing prick. He was a young, womanizing prick who knew the market and stayed out of Simon’s way.

At that point, the only negative aspect of his job stemmed from his recent inability to easily move about tall buildings. That may not sound like much of an issue to those of you who don’t live and/or work in large cities but Simon did both. Granted, being in sales meant he spent most of each workday away from his own office but the majority of that time was usually spent visiting other people’s offices in different, often taller buildings.

As is typically the case with phobia patients, in the beginning Simon tried to solve the problem by developing various workarounds for his sudden yet crippling fear of riding in elevators alone. He started scheduling a lot more lunches with prospective buyers. He offered to take clients golfing, anything that would get them to meet him down on ground level.

He even volunteered to train the new intern because it gave Simon someone he could drag along with him on cold-calls. But there were still the annual conferences, which were always out of town and often involved staying in hotels. And there was also the mortgage on his high-rise condo apartment, which his husband Ronald absolutely adored.

Simon had confided in Ronald about his fear of the Elevator People pretty much as soon as it became an issue. The whole thing had been rather difficult to hide from him, given the circumstances. Of course, Ronald was totally understanding and most nights, he was able to meet Simon down in the lobby when he got home from work so they could ride the elevator up together.

Of course, no system devised by humans was ever truly perfect. Eventually, there came a day when Ronald had to suddenly go out of town to assist his cousin with an extended family emergency, which resulted in Simon having to sprint up fifteen flights of stairs to narrowly avoid crapping himself because he had scheduled three different lunches with clients earlier that day and two of them were at the same Mexican restaurant.

It was actually this very bathroom mishap which finally convinced Simon that he was going to need professional help for his phobia if he wanted any chance at living a normal life. Though, in a rare and rather humbling turn of events, Simon’s case was the first one in a long while that had Dr. Scary feeling wholly and truly stumped as to how she should proceed.

She had asked about Simon’s relationship with Ronald (he was the greatest thing that ever happened to him), Simon’s parents (both still alive and super accepting of their successful gay son), and the likelihood that this was all stemming from a traumatic childhood event Simon simply failed to mention (apparently not very.)

“I grew up in Connecticut.”

Dr. Scary must have looked disappointed by this answer because Simon followed it up with, “Not a big fan of the Constitution State?”

“I’m just worried you might be schizophrenic.”

It was now Simon’s turn to look disappointed as he took a moment to consider this. Then he said, “Isn’t that a hereditary condition?”

“Typically but not always. There may be no documented cases in your family history-”

“There are,” Simon replied with a nod. “My aunt. And my grandmother.”

Dr. scary held up her hands in a “slow down” gesture and said, “Okay, back up… For starters, symptoms of schizophrenia typically start to present in men by their early twenties. Plus, that was pure speculation. It’s just as likely we simply haven’t located the right stressor yet. There’s still plenty of stuff we can try.”

“Like what?”

“Are you familiar with the concept of exposure therapy?”

Dr. Scary typically didn't like attempting such a drastic treatment this early into the process but she clearly wasn’t getting anywhere just talking with Simon. *Doctora Aterradora* thought that if she could watch him react to the source of his phobia in real time, it might tell her something that Simon couldn’t. So she decided to make their next session a house-call.

It was just past 1PM when Dr. Scary arrived at Simon’s high-rise condo complex. At that time on a weekday, his husband Ronald (like most of the building’s tenants) was still at work. This, of course, had been intentional. They required an empty elevator for the exposure therapy and Simon didn’t need to feel anymore self-conscious about this than he already did.

“It doesn’t have to be all fifteen. ONE would be fantastic. Ride one floor down by yourself and look,” Dr. Scary gestured at the smartphone in Simon’s hand. She turned her own around to show him that the two phones were currently FaceTime’ing each other as she continued, “I’m going to be here with you the whole way.”

Dr. Scary gently grabbed Simon’s arm and guided it up until his phone’s camera was aimed at his face. “RIGHT here. Perfect. Now… We’re gonna get started, okay?”

Simon didn't respond but it was clear from his expression that he wasn’t exactly psyched about exposure therapy (no phobia patient ever was.)  But then finally, Simon glanced at her as he lifted his shoulders in a nearly imperceptible shrug before returning his gaze to the elevator’s closed outer doors.

“Okay,” Dr. Scary repeated. She then casually hit the button to call for an elevator as she turned to head inside Simon’s condo. She leaned her back against the door to shut it behind her as Dr. Scary held up her smartphone to address Simon through the screen.

His uneasy expression had transformed into something more primeval by this point. He looked like a wild animal sensing an approaching storm. Dr. Scary tried to comfort Simon by saying, “Remember I’m right here.”

Simon’s eyes stayed trained on the elevator doors as he eventually replied, “No, you’re not. And there’s nothing you could do anyway.”

Tears began to stream down his cheeks. Dr. Scary attempted to say something in protest but was suddenly cut off by the familiar *DING* of an arriving elevator. She heard the metal doors slide open and then Simon let out a sudden, thunderous gasp.

“Oh-fuck-no-god-no-Jesus-please…” He frantically muttered as he started to back away.

“What? What are you seeing?”

“LOOK!” He screamed and then turned his phone around so Dr. Scary could see inside the elevator. The interior wasn't well-lit and it was hard to make out most of the details through Simon’s forward-facing phone camera, but Dr. Scary swore she saw two figures inside that elevator.

They were both bald. The one on the right was skeletally thin and appeared to be naked. The figure on the left was shorter and had a pronounced hunchback. And just before Simon finally dropped his phone and sprinted inside the condo, Dr. Scary glimpsed a much smaller figure behind the first two, lying motionless against the back wall of the elevator.

She said this smaller figure resembled something somebody had crumpled up and tossed aside. Like “the balled-up piece of paper you find next to a trash can. But instead of paper, it’s pale skin and broken limbs covered in bite-marks.”

“Bite-marks?”

Dr. Scary nodded and replied, “Big red bite-marks.”

I waited for her to continue but she remained silent for several moments. Then finally Dr. Scary turned and, for the first time since starting her story, she looked at me. Her mouth was twisted into a somber, humorless smile as she said, ""After that, Simon stopped showing up for his sessions. He killed himself a few months later.""

Caught off-guard, I reeled back and replied, ""Good god, woman. When was all this?""

Dr. Scary's sad smile got a little sadder and she said, ""Right before I closed down my practice.""

Another long and much more awkward silence followed. Then, as if she could sense the one question I was still too afraid to ask, Dr. Scary added…

""I never saw them again after that. Though, I'll be honest. For a while, I was genuinely scared I might. But what happened that day was merely a prime example of the power of suggestion. Simon's fear of the Elevator People made them feel so real in that moment, it's actually not surprising I saw what I did.""

I thought this over and then shrugged as I said, ""Makes sense.”

""Though, of course there were the dreams.""

“You had dreams about the Elevator People?”

Dr. Scary slowly nodded while avoiding my eye-contact. She exhaled a sigh and then said, “It actually still happens occasionally. It’s the weirdest thing too. Most of the time I’ll be dreaming about nothing especially terrifying, you know? Like visiting my sister who somehow now lives at the summer camp we used to go to as kids. Mundane shit like that. And then, out of nowhere I’ll get hit with this…”

She tensed her fingers into a claw-like gesture as she motioned at her chest and said, “…overwhelming sense of hopelessness. That’s how I know they’re close.”

Dr. Scary glanced over at me again and I saw that her eyes were now brimming with tears, yet her tone remained almost unnervingly even as she continued…

“And that’s when I’ll realize I’m standing at a bank of elevators and I can hear one approaching from below and that creeping hopeless dread is now so palpable, I can literally taste it in my mouth. Like dirty copper. I turn and try to run but my legs feel like they're encased in cement and I can hear the elevator doors opening behind me. I don’t wanna look but I know it won’t matter. The worst part, though? ...In the dreams, they know my name.”

I put a hand on Dr. Scary’s shoulder in an attempt to comfort her and she suddenly turned to glare at me, a morbid grin where her somber expression had just been as she nearly shouted, “Do you wanna know what they tell me?!”

I opened my mouth but before I could stutter out a coherent response, Dr. Scary started blinking and her creepy grin reverted to a confused frown. She said my name like a question and asked if I was okay. I lied and told her I was fine and thanked her for sharing such a fascinating story. And yet at first, I thought there was no way I was ever going to tell it to anyone. Sure, it was creepy enough to have potential but in the end, it just left me feeling sad for my friend.

So, I put the whole thing out of my mind and for a while, that was that. Though yes, much like Simon, I too technically live and work in a major city but my place is a duplex and my job is at a bar. So, I don’t typically encounter a lot of elevators in my own day-to-day life. But then my dentist retired and the new guy my insurance switched me to just so happened to work out of one of the CBD’s taller high-rises.

And even then, I managed to get all the way across the building's otherwise vacant lobby and hit the button to call for an elevator before Dr. Scary’s story finally came rushing back to me in vivid detail. It was the first time I had even really thought about the Elevator People since that night. I remembered the look on her face as she described what she saw during Simon’s exposure therapy session. The way she had grinned when she said, “Do you wanna know what they tell me?!”

I was outside in the courtyard bordering the front of the high-rise and trying to steady my hand long enough to light a cigarette before I was even fully aware that I had left the building. It was about then that I decided two things almost simultaneously:

1.) Twelve flights of stairs would definitely count as my cardio for the day…

2.) If I have to worry about this shit now, I’m taking the rest of you with me."
kikfup,2,2020-12-22,Anxious about internships?,CollectionMediocre68,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kikfup/anxious_about_internships/,"Currently a third year undergrad student, switched to CS major at the start of my sophomore year, so far I’ve learned the basics of coding and some languages and have also taken one algorithms class. I’ve dabbled with a few other things like HTML and SQL but not enough to remember what I learned. Somewhat of a slow learner. Also just got a job tutoring kids with CS and am starting in a couple weeks.

I felt it was relevant to describe what I’ve done with CS so far because I am terrified about applying for internships. I don’t really know how the process goes, and I’m also starting to apply at a very late time (at this point I’ll take whatever I can get because my main objective is to learn something), but most of all, I feel incredibly unqualified for every job I look up and I freak out. Most require experience in some field or proficiency in multiple languages, and while this is something I do want to pursue, I don’t feel confident enough in my skills to know if I am ready for an internship or not. I feel like I’m supposed to have one soon because I’m an upperclassman.

I’d greatly appreciate any advice or help with this, as well as possible websites I can look for internships on (that are not LinkedIn or Handshake)

Thanks!"

After two interviews last week, I got a call today with an offer.

I was extremely excited. As an iOS developer, Apple fanboy, and 3-year WWDC scholar, this is the kind of killer resume addition I have been wanting.

The recruiter told me I was the **top candidate** and first call for the position!! It really felt like an amazing milestone that I have dreamed of since high school.

However, the recruiter asserted that they could not meet the compensation of my other offer (which is understandable, but unfortunate as it was considerably lower).

Then the recruiter told me she needs a decision **BY TOMORROW** because they are going home for the holidays until January 5th, and they would like to move forward with the next candidate if I can’t decide by tomorrow. 

I would love to work with Apple at some point in my career, so I’m not going to complain too much. But that was a lot of pressure to put on a candidate. It’s unrealistic to decide in one day. I am sad that I won’t intern with Apple, but at the end of the day, I have a better offer and it wasn’t worth the pressure.

But maybe if they interviewed me months ago when I applied, and had given me a reasonable time to consider the offer, this would be a different story.

Anyways, I’m a bit sad, but I know it was the right decision."

At the moment, I am thinking about trying to learn some C++ programming to add onto my resume. I have forgotten almost everything I have learned throughout my courses as well and I am worried that I will be tested on that knowledge should I get any interviews. Am I just wasting my time at this point trying to learn other skills to add onto my resume instead of focusing on applying to jobs? I didn't have any internships while in undergrad, so that makes things even harder. I had tried searching for jobs that are located near my area, but it just seems like there aren't that many jobs to begin with.

kil8td,27,2020-12-22,I Received an Invitation to the Worst Christmas Ball,soonafterdark,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/kil8td/i_received_an_invitation_to_the_worst_christmas/,"I was alone last December. I placed a wreath on my apartment door but that’s as far as I went with holiday cheer. I had a falling out with my family and recently moved across the country. I wasn’t successful in forming new friendships. So, on Christmas, I planned nothing but to eat a frozen pizza and watch summer themed films.

It snowed on Christmas. I still wasn’t used to snow and ice so…when I stepped out, I moved slowly over the frozen ground. I wanted to make a snowman but, after a moment of squeezing snow in my gloved hands, I decided I didn’t want to do it alone. Snow wasn’t as beautiful as I once thought. It was…too cold and annoying.

Around dinnertime, I had my pizza in the oven and about 5 minutes left on the timer when there was a knock at the door.

“Who is it?”

“My name is Hattie…I have a surprise for you.”

I opened the door and saw a young woman dressed in a long, white lace dress. She handed me a piece of paper. It was an invitation to a Christmas party at a mansion.

“Why am I invited?”

“We hand out a number of invitations to people who are alone on Christmas, as told to us by the friendly authorities in town,” she said, “The lady of our home, Mrs. Blanche Baring, has a wish…that no one be left alone on Christmas.”

“I’ll think about it,” I told her, “But I don’t have anything to wear…”

She smiled. “You can wear anything.”

After she departed, I spent an hour on my couch barely paying attention to the movie before I decided to give the Christmas party a try.

I tried my best to dress up and I departed. I found the mansion on the outskirts of town and at the end of an isolated road. There was a moment my car slid on ice. I almost crashed…so I was relieved when I finally made it.

The home’s staff guided me to a ballroom with golden garlands strung from the ceiling and trees covered in golden ornaments in the corners. Most people in attendance were wearing ballgowns and dancing to some kind of waltz music. Hattie found me, grabbed my hand, and pulled me over to a girl who appeared 14 or 15. She introduced her as Blanche Baring…the lady of the house.

“You look so young,” I said, “I thought you were maybe Blanche’s daughter…”

Blanche and Hattie laughed uncomfortably. “No,” Blanche then spoke in a stern voice, “I’m an adult.”

“Nice decorations you have here,” I said afterward, breaking eye contact.

Soon after, I was introduced to the other chosen poor people. I recognized their status before meeting because none of us had ballgowns or tuxedos, though one lady had a relatively nice cocktail dress.

Throughout the night, we kept to each other. None of the wealthy guests spoke to us or asked us to dance, except Hattie a few times. She attempted to make us feel comfortable and included. Sometimes we were introduced to people but the conversations were cut short. We tried to dance with each other or took turns trying the food and drink…especially the drinks.

At some point the wealthy people stood together and sang what sounded like an old Christmas song. I later looked it up with the few words I remembered. What’s strange is they replaced “Jesus” with another name.

*Roland our brother, strong and good,*

*Was humbly born in a stable rude,*

*And the friendly beasts around Him stood,*

*Roland our brother, strong and good.*

I got drunk faster than expected…and more woozy than expected. Then, I blacked out. I woke up in a bed…a bed with drapes of silk. My head was pounding hard…and I had a strange sensation in my chest, like my heart felt weak. I opened the drapes to find it was morning. The curtains were closed but I could see bright light seeping around the edges.

I tried to exit the room but discovered it was locked from the outside. I banged on the door and finally one of the staff came to open it.

“Why was I locked in?” I asked.

“I’m sorry. That’s the only way this door locks. We thought you would prefer to have it locked,” he explained.

“I don’t prefer that…” I said and I looked around. I had no clue which part of the mansion I was in. “Could you help me to my car?” I asked.

She explained I was invited to breakfast…and I realize this is when I should have insisted to leave. But I didn’t. A part of me wanted more luxury, even if it was uncomfortable. I wanted to see how nice the breakfast might be…and I still felt like I was in control.

She led me to the breakfast…where I found two of the fellow poor guests.

“Why is it only us?” I tried to ask the staff but they walked out of the room.

I tried to ask the others if they’d been locked inside of rooms…but they shook their heads and told me the staff woke them. They seemed fine and didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary so…I let it go. 

The breakfast wasn’t that great. We were given a porridge and fish…cooked nicely but underwhelming. We were next brought a tray of fresh fruit which was nice…but still underwhelming.

Then, we were led into a dark room in the middle of the house. Candles were lit around the sides. In the middle, there was a large tree, which was also covered with lit candles. There were three presents under the tree.

Hattie emerged from behind the tree and welcomed us. She handed one of the presents to each of us.

“Congratulations,” she told us, “You have been selected.”

We opened the gifts. The box was large but inside there was nothing but a single check. I picked up my check and saw it was for 500 dollars. Nice but, again, underwhelming considering hid it in such a large box.

We smiled and gave thanks but Hattie added, “It does not end there. We would like to offer work for each of you.”

“To join the staff?” asked one of us.

“No, no,” explained Hattie, “You will be interns for Mrs. Baring’s company.”

“Is this a paid internship?”

“You will receive a salary after completing the internship and we promise it will be very high.”

Two of us, a man named Fred and I, accepted. The lady with the cocktail dress did not accept. I was given a room on the property and was able to move all my belongings. It’s hard to explain what led me to accept…everything was underwhelming and uncomfortable and yet I’m a fool when money is dangled in front of me.

I’d fallen for job scams before…not to the point I’d actually been robbed but to the point where the scammers acquired my resume and all my contact information. I tried not to beat myself up about it. It’s getting difficult to distinguish real job ads from fake ones on certain websites and I was simply desperate. 

After I moved in, I was told “the internship will begin soon” but the start date continued to be delayed. I spent a lot of time in the library looking at old books with beautiful binding and gilded edges. I loved how the books smelled and I liked being completely alone there. I felt so free from worrying about living expenses…from worrying about living in general. I began to dread the start of the internship. I enjoyed my freedom in the mansion and the break from regular day to day life.

Fred and I rarely saw anyone other than the staff during the day. Blanche, her family, some of her friends who lived there, and Hattie were either busy or on trips most of the time.

Every morning I woke up with a pounding headache. As time went on, I was becoming dizzy and unsteady. One afternoon I was alone outside on the snow…and I collapsed. One of the staff members found me there and brought me inside.

I saw Hattie that night. She explained that she came from a family of doctors. She tossed a bag onto a table next to me and brought out a stethoscope and a blood pressure cuff. She carried out a normal examination…until she pressed her fingers hard against my wrist. She was squeezing my wrist too hard and seemed to be getting excited by it. She rarely smiled but shot an eerie grin as I squirmed and pulled away from her.

“What were you doing?” I asked.

“Your pulse is wonderful,” she said, “Don’t worry. Everything is well. I think you might have some mental strain. It must be from…confining yourself to the library so often.”

“You don’t want me in the library?”

“I never said that,” she said.

Even so, I tried not to go there alone as much. I spent more time wandering the mansion. There were many locked rooms…but I always tried to open them, even if it might have gotten me in trouble. Day after day, the same rooms were locked…until finally one wasn’t.

The room had boxes of random belongings. Watches, pearl necklaces, and…that woman from the Christmas party’s cocktail dress. I picked it up and examined it. I recognized a stain from wine the woman had spilt. I noticed it after she departed with one of the staff after refusing the internship. I looked inside the dress…and outside. There was no sign of anything else…but I knew, of course, something was wrong.

That’s when I heard someone lock the door. I ran to the door and banged on it. I shouted, “Hey! I’m in here!” but there was no answer…and no way to unlock it from the inside. I tried hitting it, I tried kicking it, and I was unsuccessful. 

Eventually I became hungry. I tried listening for passersby. I thought, “Stay calm…someone has to open it someday…”

I slept, woke, fought hunger, had to pee in a vase, amused myself with my imagination, and…finally, the door opened. I tried to run away but was caught by Hattie. She dug her nails into my arm and pulled me. Her grip was too strong and I was so weak. She brought me into the basement. At this point, I was shouting for her to stop and to let me go. She slapped me so hard I fell back onto the floor and then she pulled me deeper into the basement.

It was freezing in there. I was shaking from the cold…and then…I saw a scraggly, bearded man sitting in a chair. The chair looked like a throne. The carvings on the wood were deep, elaborate, and the chair had golden edges. The man was pale with thin skin and the thickest, bulging veins all over. Though it was so cold, he was dressed in nothing but a white loincloth…and he didn’t appear bothered. He had no expression at all…but I sensed he was wise. At some point, I felt like I could hear his thoughts…and they weren’t in a language I could understand but the tone…it sounded like a lecture.

Hattie chained me to a post in front of the man and then she left. I felt increasingly drained and dizzy. All he did was stare at me and force his thoughts at me…so I closed my eyes. Soon, I lost consciousness. 

I woke up in my bedroom. My morning headache was worse than before. I struggled to sit up and, as soon as I got up, there was a knock on my door. It was one of the staff.

“You’re finally up,” she said.

“Yes?”

“You were screaming and shouting during the night…like you were having a bad dream,” she explained.

That’s how it was. They pretended that nothing out of the ordinary had happened…and that I’d only had a bad dream. Even being locked in that room with the cocktail dress…it was only a dream. They took me to that room, opened it, and there were no boxes…and the wallpaper was different. 

But I knew what I’d experienced was real. It couldn’t have been a dream. I was bruised and scratched from everything I remembered.

I tried to ask Fred if he’d noticed my absence. He admitted he hadn’t seen me but, “it’s normal for us not to see each other, especially how you’re always going off by yourself...I don’t keep tabs on you.”

“But how have you been feeling since you got here? Do you feel ill too? Do you get headaches in the morning?” I asked.

“Yeah,” he said, “I get a lot of headaches but…I had problems with migraines before I came here.”

“No, there’s something wrong,” I tried to tell him but he shrugged and dismissed me.

He told me, “Hattie was telling me…the jobs they’re going to offer us…we could make $500,000 a year.”

“Sure,” I said, “I don’t know if those internships will ever start.”

“She said they’ll start a few days from now but…she says it’s going to be long days, even long nights of work. You’ll need to be productive and earn that opportunity to get that salary. You won’t have time to lazily lounge in the library anymore.”

I nodded. “Sure Fred.” The exchange reminded me why I avoided spending time with Fred in the first place.

I tried to ask the staff for my car keys but, as expected, they delayed and “forgot” to give them to me.

So, I speed walked to my room, put on a coat, and bundled up as much as I could. I tried to exit the mansion unnoticed. When I inevitably ran into a staff member, I told him I was only stepping out for a walk to get fresh air.

Instead, I headed out on the road away from the mansion. It was freezing and was miles from any other building or even the main road…but I decided I would rather die out there than by whatever was going on in that mansion. I figured they would come for me on the road so I tried to cut through the forest. It was thick and without established trails. I struggled to lift my weakened legs over obstacles, fallen branches…and there were times that I slipped and fell over the icy ground. My extremities were going sore, numb, and then felt like they were burning. 

I lost consciousness at some point…and, when I regained it, I heard steps in the distance. It was night…so I could barely see but I understood from the sound that someone was pursuing me. I dragged myself up and managed to conjure some energy within…to get me moving away from whoever followed. I don’t know how long it took me…at some point my mind fell into a zone where my only focus was to summon energy to push forward…as the person who stalked me moved closer and closer.

Until, they were only a few feet away from me…and I could see the main road through the trees. I pushed through…and I was fortunate enough that I was near one of the gas stations. I sprinted to it with erratic breaths and about to collapse. When I got inside, I looked out the window behind me…and I saw Hattie. She was wearing nothing but a thin, silk nightgown, which was then partially torn and covered with dirt. She was barefoot too. She shook her head at me, turned around, and walked back into the forest.

I called 911 with the gas station’s phone. I was taken to a hospital. Meanwhile, the police went to the mansion. 

Later, my car was returned and I was told that no one was found at the mansion except for a lone caretaker who claimed not to know me. He told them I drove there, that I seemed confused and demanded to be let inside of the mansion, and that he didn’t know what happened to me after I was turned away.

I told them that was wrong and that I’d been living there for weeks. I told them Hattie pursued me through the forest and that they could probably find evidence of it. I even described the interior of the mansion to them. I told them about my belongings in the mansion. I told them about my bruises. I told them about Fred…but they didn’t seem to care enough.

“Isn’t this your job?” I asked…and I was told to get more rest.

So, I searched for other evidence. I looked through my car for the invitation I’d initially received…but it was gone. I went to my old apartment and asked for them to check the security camera footage from Christmas…but they claimed there was no footage of a woman matching my description of Hattie. I asked the management to tell the police of when I moved out and the conversation I had with the landlord but…that achieved nothing.

I later found that Fred was listed as a missing person and I tried to offer information…but…nothing resulted.

I moved back to my home state. I made an effort to reconnect with my family over the last year and, while things are better than before, the relationship remains strained. The pandemic arrived and threw me even more off balance. But I was lucky to find wonderful roommates and we will celebrate Christmas together this year. No Christmas parties, no mansions, none of that nonsense."

Throughout highschool, I couldn't emotionally put myself into the task of working and studying because of this anxiety, and barely got good enough grades to do CS in my university. The first year went totally sideways because I couldn't put myself to work, and having to redo it again this year, I have found myself to not be able to focus on work, whenever I don't understand something that is explained in class, I grow incredibly stressed out and just distract myself, every time this happens it becomes more intense and I even totally give up on attending to class because of how much anxiety it brings me. Even for studying for the finals that are about to take place in less than a month, I can't put myself to study more than a few minutes before I go back to procrastinating and become stressed out for the rest of the day. I have attended psychiatric help since a year ago, even though I haven't had a solution for this, also being diagnosed with Asperger's. I can't keep on failing on uni assignments, else I will get expelled. What can I do to all of this?"
kim9sg,1,2020-12-22,I am an extreme opportunist. How can I break my habit before I end up drowning in stress?,cabbage-soup,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/kim9sg/i_am_an_extreme_opportunist_how_can_i_break_my/,"Honestly just need some advice. I think I am addicted to seeking opportunity. I love applying for jobs and I’ve been lucky enough to get a job offer from every place I’ve interviewed for. It gives me such a rush and intense feeling of success that I keep doing it.. like I can’t stop. Likewise, literally every time an opportunity comes my way, I say yes. Like, how could I not? Every opportunity leads to new experiences and opens the door for more opportunities. Saying no would feel like I’m limiting myself in a way that makes me feel uncomfortable. 

What I have on my plate now: I am a full time student majoring in Interactive Design with a minor in Marketing. I am currently working in IT for a school district and just accepted a part time winter internship in marketing that I will be doing at the same time as my other job, until it ends in February. I also just accepted a full time summer internship as a front end developer. I also am apart of at least three organizations, maybe more? Some are apart of school and some are not, and they all involve monthly meetings. One is a competitive team for cybersecurity and my professor seems to rely on me for a lot since most of the team has graduated, this also can take up quiet a bit of time as 30+ hours of practice and preparation go into each competition (we rank nationally).

I guess you could say I’m not great at prioritizing. I’m normally a straight A student but I’ve actually given up on focusing on school altogether. It seems like my experience is paying off a lot more and virtual classes are hard to focus in anyways. That being said, my grades are still fine. I guess I’m just stressed with everything that I’m balancing. But I don’t really want to drop anything.. I’m not even sure what I want to do in life. Which I think is why I’ve been on this opportunity seeking lifestyle. I can pursue whatever I want as long as I’ve got the experience for it. I know whatever I do is usually involved with technology, but honestly screens are starting to kill me. Could also just be my stress making me think its the screens.

Any advice for how I could get my life back to sanity and to stop saying yes to everything without fear of holding myself back?"

**Demographics**

* Gender: Male 
* Race/Ethnicity: Central American 
* Residence: Midwest
* Income Bracket: Upper Middle 
* Type of School: Public, semi-competitive
* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): URM

Intended Major(s) - Undecided 

**Academics/testing:**

ACT: 29 English / 35 Math / 35 Reading / 32 Science --&gt; 33 Composite 

\-GPA: 3.8/4.4

\-school does not rank

\-will have taken 13 AP's by the time I graduate. 5s in both European History and Human Geography. Did not opt to take AP tests due to them being online, and will not be taking any this year. 

**Extracurriculars/Activities:** 

1.) Hundreds of hours throughout high school volunteering for various organizations throughout my community. Was recognized by one organization as being one of the top volunteers for numerous years. (9-12)

2.) Sports referee since the start of high school (actually started in 8th). Estimated 12-15 hours per week for 8 months per year. 

3.) Cross Country and Track. (9-11) 

4.) Part of the leadership team for NHS. Currently planning this year's induction. 

5.) Normal other Honors Societies (Spanish, Science, etc). 

**Awards/Honors:** 

\-honor roll at my school during 10th and 11th grades 

**Letters of Recommendation(s)**

\-I did not read any of my LOR's. One of them was one of my math teachers. She was one of my favorite teachers throughout high school, and I think she really enjoyed me as a student. We chatted a ton during my Junior year, and we had a great relationship. My other teacher was my history teacher. I loved his class, and I genuinely enjoyed attending every day. Not as close with him as I was with my math teacher, but during first semester I was probably one of his top 3 students. Was normally the only one of his students (in my class) that bothered to participate in class, and normally ended up answering 80% of his questions. Overall, I believe I got strong LOR's from both teachers. 

**Essays:**

\-Common App: Didn't know what to write about, so I wrote about Fantasy Football. I enjoyed writing it, and after editing I think it painted a good picture of who I am as a person. 

\-WhyUChicago: Honestly I focused on how I really don't know what I want to study, and how UChicago allows people to find their passion with their core curriculum. Also mentioned the advantages of their internship program, the city of Chicago, and the specific parts about the housing system that appealed to me. 

\-UChicago creative: Chose to write about how much wood a woodchuck could chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood. Was one of my favorite essays to write, and really spent a lot of time talking about woodchucks as a species (habits, size, etc). Basically outlined a bunch of parameters, and then ended up stating that the woodchuck could chuck exactly 47.5 lbs. 

(Also, I threw in how woodchucks take weekends off, just like all of us at the very end)

**Additional Information:**

\-mentioned how I opted out of sports this year due to Covid. Did not utilize the space to write an esay regarding changes that occurred because of Covid. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Results:** 

Acceptances: 

University of Iowa - Accepted (EA) 

University of Kansas - Accepted (EA) 

University of Chicago - Accepted (ED 1) 

&amp;#x200B;

Rejections: 

University of Kansas - Honors 

&amp;#x200B;

**Reflection:** 

Looking back, I would have definitely done a few things differently. I would have not written all my UChicago supps at 3 in the morning, and would have edited them more than once. Another thing is I should have started my other applications much sooner (shocker: I didn't). All I had done) as of yesterday - 12/21) were my applications to my safeties. I got incredibly lucky getting into UChicago ED1 and I feel so blessed by it. I mean, I got rejected from a local school's honors program a few weeks ago. When I think about it, the odds of me even attending college were slim to none when I was born, and now I am heading to my dream school. I did not have the perfect application by any means. My test scores were good, but certainly not the best. I could have definitely have had more EC's, but I chose to continue with what I enjoyed doing throughout high school rather than pursuing something new. In all honesty, I do feel a bit of imposter syndrome considering the quality of applicants that got either deferred or rejected. But, it's my belief everything happens for a reason, and that I was accepted for some reason (whatever that may be). I hope this provides others hope that you don't need the perfect application for top schools (although it does certainly help), and that you do have a chance! If you have any questions feel free to ask away, and I'll try to respond within a timely manner. If it's too personal, I will ask to take it to PM's. That's all and I hope everyone has a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!"

I have roughly 30k secured in seed money and I want to go to other parts of my friends and family for more. I'm looking for some help to prepare. 

**My qualifications in this company:**  


*  I'm mid level full stack developer that has developed everything on my own. If I was working for a company and had the right mentorship I could probably be a senior level developer in a year or so. If I specialized in a specific aspect of development it would take less time for me to rise up.
* I have project management skills. I was able to source small aspects of this project very efficiently. So far I have spent roughly $1k on sourcing a senior UX/UI developer to design my app from my wireframes, about a $100 on graphic design, and $150 on getting small snippets of code from various developers. Over this whole thing I probably have a network of 5 solid people that are highly competent.
* I was the marketing manager in 2012 for a small company and helped them gain about 150k in Facebook likes (from 30k), and gain thousands of new users. I also managed interns, dealt with advertisers, and conducted market research.
* I've owned a small business and conducted market research for both that company and other companies.
* I've written 3 business plans, one of them good enough to obtain loans. 

**I also bring:**  


* My sister who is an accountant
* My dad that has experience in traditional business and went to a high up bus school. 

I can get as much free work as I need for both of them. I might also be able to get help from family members who are lawyers.   


**Why did it take so long for the MVP? (You don't have to read this section if you don't have this question)**

1. Writing the backend for a SAAS SPA alone is a lot of work. It took about a month and a half just to write the basic features that most apps have. 
2. I will be dealing with extremely private data and have to be extreme with things like encrypting the database and other security. I have to act like this app is a bank, or it could be devastating. What I'm saying is top security practices were a must and it took a LONG TIME to deal with that. Probably a month alone.
3. This is my first SAAS SPA. I made a lot of mistakes and I really had to up my game on the frontend side of development. 
4. The UX presented problems that were complicated to deal with. 
5. The front end was a major head ache. I was able to get such a high end UI guy because I was very flexible with his work schedule. I would get different areas of work in at different times and it could be hard to deal with that on a project management level. I had to go by a motto of Always Be Working, but it wasn't the best since while I was working on different things I would create bugs inadvertently. Also the way that the features were laid out by the UI guy were more time consuming since they were a little beyond my skill level, and various other things.
6. It's ready for mobile. It has an API, and I am I'm competent with React Native and Angulars Ionic. 
7. Lack of money.
8. I had to do a rewrite. It sucked.

Other things others have said to me: 

You over built this app.

No I did not. It has the ***basic*** features. That's it. Apps are now bigger, and I have to argue that the days of that lone Mark Zuckerberg developer making an app in a few weeks is either over or few and far between. You're now indirectly, or directly, competing with multibillion dollar mega corporations for attention and millions of small SAAS apps. In my market there's two competitors. 

My point here is calculated risk has entered the game. My risk was my time, and my old skills in marketing helped me calculate those risks. I've hung around the start up world a bit, and I noticed very quickly there were people pushing badly duct taped together apps, calling them MVPs, and then moving to the next idea. 

Even though I'm gunning big for this to work, if it doesn't I can use all of the features I have to pivot or create a new application that is strongly built. I kept this in mind the entire time.

**The last thing before questions**

My living expenses are small. Even though being an adult living with your parents and driving an old car sucks, I don't have high expenses. Barely any debt as well.

**Question and guidance:**

1. I plan to approach my friends and ask them for money. Is it better to do it individually or gather them all together?
2. I'm thinking of going to a web firm and asking them to offer me a cost evaluation for them to build my app. I would then use that to determine share ownership for investors. So let's say the evaluation for what I've built is $50k and I have an overall target of having a $100k of assets to start this company (App itself, and 50k liquid investment), then I would get 50% of the in share ownership and the other 50% would be divided up between the investors. Does this sound like a reasonable thing to do?
3. Instead of just doing a pitch deck, I want to have a full fleshed out business plan with a market analysis and financials. Is this overkill? I'm 100% certain I could do a decent job with this, but it might take me a few extra weeks to compile. I really think it would be worth it though.
4. I've never heard of anyone using loans for a tech startup, but there are loans in my country of up to $250k. Some of them interest free. Should I go down this path?
5. How much time do I have to focus on funding? I know this sounds like a dumb question, but I have to divide my day between this, programming, and marketing. It's all day, every single day. What percentage of time should I put towards this.
6. What do I have to do follow up wise once I do get investors? I'm pretty sure I have 4 locked. I think I can get another 8 to 15. Do I send them financials every quarter? Do I email weekly newsletters? What's the upkeep like here?
7. How am I looking so far? Do I at least sound like my head is on straight? (Dear god please tell me yes lol)
8. I've never had a company with investors. When should they expect returns? 
9. If I take on another technical partner what's the best way to figure out how much they should own? 
10. Any other guidance or audiobooks you can suggest me? Honestly, I'll learn more about this while I'm cooking my dinner, and exercising at the gym. 

Thanks in advance guys"

I knew from the start that I'd have to put myself through college. Had top 97th percentile test scores and a 4.0, got into every college I applied to, but took a full scholarship from a local, regional state school. Commuted to school for 5 years while working multiple jobs on the side. Graduated debt free without a penny of help besides living at home while still paying for all my stuff. 5 years later, still working at my ok-paying but overall dead-end entry level job in my field in the same area I grew up in.

My question revolves around the feeling that I've been at a constant disadvantage since youth. I could have gone to a great school like University of Michigan (was accepted) but didn't cause I couldn't afford it. I couldn't do fancy study abroad trips or internships in the big city cause I couldn't afford it and had a job back home I needed. Everywhere I look I see people who came from every advantage: affluent metropolitan city growing up, private high school that costs more than the median US household income, elite private university or highly respected out-of-state school. These people are EVERYWHERE.

I'll just give you an example--I follow a lot of people in ""Marketing twitter"" because I find it very interesting. There's a marketing media outlet that's particularly intriguing called ""Morning Brew."" They make great content and seem to present themselves as a no-nonsense, everyman's media outlet full of smart hard-workers. This may be true, but as I looked into the people running this operation that I respect and look up to, I've found out that every single person that works there (20+ ) went to an elite private college on the East Coast/California or a flagship state school not in the state they grew up in, and around half of them went to private high schools that cost 20k/year+, and virtually none of them didn’t grow up in the Boston/NYC/DC corridor, Chicago, or Los Angeles. The two dudes who founded it when to private high schools in New Jersey and then to University of Michigan (a school notoriously overrun by rich out-of-state kids).

Obviously, this is just one example, but this is a repeated thing I see over and over and over and over with people of influence who I respect and look up to. I mean seriously, just think of your favorite politician, entertainer, journalist, tech mogul, or ""influencer,"" now look them up and see where they came from. Chances are it will be the exact background I just talked about. And I'm not just talking about famous people. Seemingly ""regular"" people who have cool jobs doing cool things in cool places ALL seem to come from this EXACT. SAME. PLACE. Is this confirmation bias? Maybe, but this is starting to be WAY more consistent than any sort of coincidence. I mean these days, when I look up someone I admire, I'm actually SHOCKED if they aren’t from the northeast/DC/Silicon Valley/LA and went to a public school in the state they grew up in.

It's really, really starting to mess with my head. I didn't notice it much growing up cause I lived in a bubble here in small-city Midwest where we didn't have ""dream schools,"" we all just kinda went to the place we could afford and hoped to come out with a degree and as few loans as possible. There were a few advantaged kids but 90% of my high school went to public or community colleges within 40 minutes of home. I never felt like I was doing anything wrong at the time, but now in my late 20s, I feel like I screwed up completely and that I'm completely screwed for life because when I was 17-20, I didn't have the knowledge or insight to look into ways to find more opportunity because I was too busy just trying to make ends meet while working 30+ hours a week and attending college. 

I know they say no one cares about where you went to school after you graduate, but with constant evidence that the people who went to the name schools are the ones getting the good jobs, it's pretty damn hard to believe this is actually the case, and obviously it's not JUST the name, but all the other things that come with a school like that (internships, connections, alumni networks, etc). I never cared about any of that stuff at the time cause I was just a broke kid trying to get my damn degree, but everyday it just feels like I messed up, and being from the rural midwest as opposed to a giant coastal metropolis permanently stunted my opportunity. Furthermore, as I wasn’t the benefactor of family money in my education, I also won’t be receiving help on a down payment for a house as is common among people my age, I won’t be getting a big inheritance, etc. This isn’t a pity party for me. I want to move past this feeling. Overall, I’m fortunate. I know there are tons of people who would love to be in my current situation. But for me and my own personal goals, when I look at where I want to be (not here) and then look at who gets the jobs/opportunities to make that possible and housing prices, it just feels so dire and absolutely rigged in favor of those who were heavily advantaged from the second they were born.

I've had one heck of a fall semester submitting applications for graduate school and fellowships. I'm relieved that it's finally over and happy to be heading into a pretty relaxing Winter break. I'll still be conducting undergraduate research, but will have plenty of time to enjoy my break. However, sitting here and relaxing today got me thinking about what is to come. I am hoping to start an engineering PhD program next Fall and was wondering what others' experiences were in terms of yearly school breaks. COVID-19 has really halted a lot of my plans for travel this year and I was hoping to go through with them in the preceding years. However, I am aware the life of a graduate student is often busier than an undergraduate. 

My question is: do you have time to travel for extended periods (1-2 weeks), do attending research conference allow for some travel leisure, and if not what are you doing instead (research, internship, etc.)?

3. In regards to question 2, is it necessary to let the company know that you won't be located within 100 miles of the office you are listed to be working at if you are gonna be doing remote work anyways?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks this is my first post on this page and I am little intimidated with the whole situation due to the idea that we are in a pandemic and I am looking to go for my first job with no experience."
kipzx8,13,2020-12-23,What are the best data analysis programs for social science majors?,Socratesonweed,dataanalysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/kipzx8/what_are_the_best_data_analysis_programs_for/,"I've already posted a similar thread on r/PoliticalScience but wanted to know your guy's opinion. 

I just graduated from uni with a BA in political science, a  minor in International Law,  another in Civil Society and have done a  number of internships and published works.

I  starting looking for jobs on multiple sites and found that many of them asked for skills in data analysis or at least some knowledge about data analysis programs. Problem is that I don't have any but I wrote down the languages they asked for such as:

SPSS

Excel

Access

HTML

CSS

Drupal

SQL

Stata

R

3 of these I obviously know but would be a hassle to learn and master (Yeah HTML is for web creation but some jobs want it). But aside from that when it comes to quantitative data and data management in the social sciences in general what are the best choices to start with (Or does it really depend on what I'm gonna work with?)"

Also, if you’ve done an onsite interview for the Internship role, what types of questions should I be preparing for?

kirmi1,0,2020-12-23,Some noob freshman questions :'),Aoyona,nus,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/kirmi1/some_noob_freshman_questions/,"Sorry if some of my questions seem dumb! I'm still a little lost on some matters haha

On minors / 2nd majors, are they simply just like fulfilling UEMs but instead of taking random modules on different topics you take modules that are more specialised in an area? I'm a Life Sciences major, if I choose to take a minor, am I allowed to choose any minor, eg from this site : [http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/academic-information-policies/undergraduate-students/special-programmes/minor-programmes](http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/academic-information-policies/undergraduate-students/special-programmes/minor-programmes) ? Or are the minors I can choose limited, eg psychology and forensic science? I feel like I keep hearing these specific minors when talking about Life Science students, so I'm not sure if all minors are available to choose. Also, any senior who have taken biomedical engineering minor before?

&amp;#x200B;

I've often heard about exchange programmes, and it feels almost like a tradition that everyone goes for it? What is it really about? Is it simply visiting another school overseas for a semester or do you get to fulfill some MCs as well?  I feel quite clueless about it, so any information or your experiences would really help :)  

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, when do people usually start going for internships? Is it only in the final year? I feel like I've come across people who have done a few before final year, how does that happen?

&amp;#x200B;

Feel clueless about many things but don't wanna remain clueless haha. Thanks in advance for answering any of my questions! Truly appreciated :))"

Published original NLP research work in IEEE,
Did a few hackathons (5000+ applicants), was a finalist (top 10) handled the whole ML stack .
Small internship as a part of my degree.. made android apps.. and some web dev stuff.
Got good recommendations from CS profs.


Do I have a chance? What more can I do to increase my odds?

Thanks!

Been in operations for 10 years at two prominent healthcare companies, looking for the next step to accelerate my career


Bit if background as I appreciate additional perspective.  I am asking for your take on my background and where you would see my experience fitting in medium and long term.  Long backstory incoming!

My current and former companies are both F100 and were at one time, merged into one.   I studied industrial engineering with a minor in supply chain management.  In college, two internships in supply chain management at the original(company X).   After graduation, was accepted into company x’s 2-year Leadership Development Program(4 roles over 2 years plus one international in Germany).  After LDP graduation, worked as a reliability engineer for 2 years, more generally, an internal consultant leading operations excellence initiates across all of our global manufacturing sites.  Networked and worked closely with a plant in Ireland and was offered a 2 year expat assignment as a sr. Reliability engineer focusing on manufacturing plant specific opex initiatives.  After assignment moved back to Chicago as a lateral into supply chain mgmt as a sr. demand planner for 1 year.  Hated the move after Ireland, felt as though the company didn’t value expat experience and that I needed to go in a different direction. 

Decided Project Management would be a great way to tell my story about different experiences woven together. Got my PMP and applied to the other company who had recently diverged from company x, company y as a manager level project manager in R and D, managing early stage oncology research projects (operationally) and a team of scientists.  Not sure still how I got that role but learned a lot about our R and D operations and importance to the company.  Decided r and d wasn’t meant for an engineer and networked into commercial operations, managing our sales force platform as part of our digital tool portfolio as a digital tools manager. 

All of this leads to my current role and next steps.  After a year in the saleforce role, a colleague reached out about moving onto our largest product to manage the sales force alignment and call planning process.  I wasn’t happy with my last manager who was known as a blockade to career growth due to incompetence and ego so this new opportunity presented itself with the most respected manager in commercial operations. It was a lateral move again to be the manager of the field deployment for our most prominent brand.  Managing Roughly 1200 sales reps, managers, directors from a territory alignment and call planning perspective generating over 19billion in revenue. I was thrilled at first and am getting great feedback about my work and my manager is thrilled(working 60 - 70 hrs a week). However, she announced she is looking to move and some work responsibilities that were performed by consultants now will now fall on my already heavy plate.  I am concerned with scope crepe and responsibility ambiguity in addition to a potential manager vacancy 

I am feeling a bit lost with my path and feel as though I’ve had great and unique  experiences, they don tie together well to propel me into a higher position, internally or externally.  Looking for advice on where you would focus short and long term in addition to if looking external is appropriate(is consulting or small pharma).  Three lateral manager moves has me thinking how to position next but luckily, the three have been quite different experiences 

Compensation has gone from $59k + 6% bonus to 130k + 28% bonus 

I’ve also considered a part time mba but feel an emba program may be a better fit down the road , especially working significant hours in my current role. 

That’s it, looking for some perspective"

I attend an HBCU and it has been one of the coolest experiences ever. They're very fast paced but very accommodating and everyone is asking to help. If you're looking for internships especially in cs research apply for air force on top of that they can help pay for college.
kiwdec,4,2020-12-23,I'm stuck spinning my wheels and don't know how to get out.,StantheTrumpetMan,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kiwdec/im_stuck_spinning_my_wheels_and_dont_know_how_to/,"I'm looking for any advice on my current situation.

I finished classes in spring of 2019. I spent the better part of the next 9 months unemployed and looking for a job in my field. During this time I applied to around 250+ positions, resulting in a combination of in-person, online, and phone interviews about 5-8% of the time. Some went well, some went awful, all resulted in rejection emails (except for one unpaid position in Chicago, no thanks). During this time I was focused entirely on internship positions. Funny thing about where I went to school is, they won't let you graduate until you've held an internship/co-op position for at least 3 months. With literally no warning this last June, I got my degree in the mail. Turns out because of covid they were waiving the internship requirement this year because almost every one of the intern positions students usually were obtaining suddenly vanished. They forgot to mention this to me when I got grandfathered into the new plan, and I graduated a month before I even knew I had. 

Since last spring I've been floating around a few jobs in my home town that have nothing to do with CS in the slightest. I was applying to a few places in the past few months but was met with mostly silence or rejected because of reasons related to covid. 

I've lost all motivation in attempting to apply to any positions. Since I couldn't even land an internship it feels like trying for an actual permanent position would be a fools errand and a waste of time. I was actively applying for positions since the beginning of 2018 and have had zero offers. Most if not all of my classmates from my senior year had all landed positions so I know it isn't related to the school or program I was in. My final GPA was 2.9, and the degree was a BS in Computer Science, and Game Design (the only difference between this degree and Applied Math and Computer Science was some of the higher level math courses were replaced with game design related classes).

I'm also out of practice and have immense trouble trying to work on any kind of personal projects now because they just remind me of spending 5 years working at a degree that I haven't been able to use.

I'm frustrated with every aspect of all of this, and at this point I'm honestly considering just throwing the whole idea of ever using my degree out the window. 

Any one got any thoughts on this?"
kiyce3,22,2020-12-23,6/6 PhD CS acceptances spring 2021,[deleted],gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/kiyce3/66_phd_cs_acceptances_spring_2021/,"Bit late to this but now that everyone’s applying for fall, I just wanted to say have hope and don’t be down on yourself! I never thought I’d make it to a PhD program let alone get accepted to everywhere I applied to. 

I come from a small private school that is not known for CS or math at all. I am a math major and graduated this semester. I started college with a 3.1 gpa as a bio major and switched to math sophomore year and got 4.0s every semester after. My cumulative ended up being a 3.825 and major GPA is 3.95. I took a lot of CS classes but because I skipped two intro courses, I was a couple credits away from a double major and couldn’t have it count as a minor. 

What got me accepted into 6/6 programs? Contacting professors. I had zoom interviews with every single one of the professors and ultimately just talked passionately and admitted any shortfalls I had or knowledge gaps I had with the professors research. Be humble and be excited about your work and the professors work! It really goes a long way and makes you stand out. 

I applied to 6 PhD programs in CS for spring 2021 including: USF, Iowa State, Oregon State, Arizona State, Tennessee, and Stony Brook. The research labs were a mix of ML, mobile computing, and explainable AI. Ultimately I chose to go to Stony Brook because of a lot of factors including overall rank and rank in mobile computing and proximity to family. 

I did submit GREs for some schools but half didn’t even want my GRE or care about the score. I got a 161 quant, 159 verbal, and 5.5 writing.

kiyeoy,5,2020-12-23,Would it be beneficial to go through course materials ahead of taking the class in order to prepare for internships?,shiiiiiiiiiet,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/kiyeoy/would_it_be_beneficial_to_go_through_course/,"Due to circumstances, I will only be able to take 1 class per quarter until the beginning of the next academic year, which is when I will be bumping up to two classes per quarter. I plan on taking 161, 162, and 225 for these quarters. But I'm worried about being ready for internships by this time next year. I am coming into this program with little CS experience, having only dabbled in Matlab and Assembly for my previous degree and done some self-learning of python.

So what I've been thinking is - while I'm taking the classes listed above, I can also go through materials for another class following the syllabi I am able to find online. So I can potentially do 161+225selftaught, 162+(maybe 261 but I know 162 is a prereq), then 225+(Maybe 325 which I know is supposed to be a difficult course). I've heard Data Structures and Algorithms are important for preparing for interviews so I wanted at least be familiar with them by the time I'm applying.

Would this be a good idea, totally unrealistic, or would I be fine just taking those three classes and applying for internships next fall?

Thanks in advance!"
kiyn64,3,2020-12-23,Do I still have a chance at quant research (or similar)?,Leader-board,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/kiyn64/do_i_still_have_a_chance_at_quant_research_or/,"Well, as the title goes.

**Background information**

Final year undergrad student studying Computer Science and Mathematics in the UK (expecting 1:1/first).

**The story**

As someone studying CS and Mathematics, I was looking into graduate roles that would combine my interests in computer science/programming and mathematics, and quant research/trading (and similar roles in this domain) appeared to fit the bill very well. I didn't mind going to a different sector (having had no previous experience at all in finance), and was genuinely interested.

A brief note on location: it does not matter for the most part. However, since I am not a U.S citizen, the US market is off limits to me solely because of the difficulty of getting a visa there. I've mainly applied to EU.

Note on internships: I've only had research-based experience in CS (did not manage to get a ""traditional"" interview). While fulfilling and interesting, has no relation with finance.

**The issue**

I've had no success breaking in. I know that the fact that I realised the value of such a field this late is perhaps a detriment (plus the lack of relevant experience in internships), but the problem is that at this rate, I am most likely looking at being unemployed for this year, which is not something I'm looking forward into.

Below, I give a brief overview of *some of* the companies and roles I've applied to, and the status of failure:

* Optiver (Quantitative Researcher): at the technical interview stage. Unfortunately, this was my first interview of this nature and I severely underperformed. Felt this was the most promising opportunity that I blew, perhaps fatally.
* Tibra (Graduate Quant Trader): passed math/HackerRank exam, failed at HR interview, no feedback provided.
* DRW (Quantitative Researcher): failed at entrance exam, unfortunately the questions got the better of me this time.
* Goldman Sachs (Quantitative Strats? At least I did the CS/Maths HackerRank exam): got 100% on CS portion, did well on Maths, got thrown out without interview.
* Jane Street, GSA Capital: thrown out without interview.
* most other companies I've applied to haven't replied, and I'm essentially treating them as ghosting

**My questions**

* Is there still a chance for me to get a quant research/trading role for FTE (Fall 2021)? I have a preference on one that is equally (as much as possible) mathematical as well as computational. Most of the roles I've seen are either in the US (which is off-limits to me for reasons explained above), are ones I've already applied to, or require a masters for some reason.
* In the event I do not succeed in my aim, but somehow get a traditional SWE role (which is 100% software, no maths/finance at all and not something that interests me as much), will this be detrimental to my career prospects if I try to switch to quant after, say, a year? I've heard that it is much harder to go SWE -&gt; quant than the other way round.
* Is there something else that I should be doing that I haven't?

Thanks in advance for any help you can provide. I could be misinformed in some of my thoughts, so please feel free to correct me there as well."

I’m glad I finished but I can’t help but feel disheartened by the abysmal results of my job search so far. 

For context, I been working towards a specialty on data engineering. I wasn’t great with school so I avoid details about that but I have plenty of projects (both personal and through school) and an unpaid internship. I’m from Southern New Jersey and live close to Philadelphia PA. I am an Information Technology major. [This is an older version of my resume (about a month) but almost all of the information is current.](https://imgur.com/a/uOIItud)

After 250+ Applications since September, I had a handful of phone screenings, one interview, no offers. For this past summer, I had sent out over 170+ applications for internships and got 2 interviews and no offers. I couldn’t even get many responses for unpaid internships. 

I’m don’t want to wait past the end January to be employed because:

1) I don’t want to stagnate and develop a gap between employment history and graduation.

2) Money. While I am supported by family, I don’t want to be searching until loan payments start like I know many people are. I’m also looking to move out within the next 18 months. 

I’m thinking about giving up on the SWE/Data Engineering positions for now. I’m thinking of applying to adjacent positions such as Data analyst (this is top priority because it is likely the easiest transition into Data engineering), DBA, or QA and working that kind of job first and maybe after a year try the market again. Not that I look at those jobs as lesser, but I think my chances are much better there since the requirements aren’t as difficult and the competition isn’t as crazy.

Is this a good path or should I keep trying to look for my desired job?"

After 2 years, I got promoted from Associate SWE to SWE I. 

I do like my current team and boss, the work life balance is great, and it’s also very flexible. Since I moved back in with my family I was able to pay back all my debt and am in a good place. 

Now I’m 26 &amp; at a little bit of a crossroads as to what to do next to increase my salary. I love to study &amp; learn outside of work and am trying to figure out where I should expend that energy.

Option: 
1. Work on improving more skills around my current job (working on communication skills &amp; public speaking, maybe new technology, side projects etc) in an aim to trudge towards the next promotion (which I probably won’t get for another 2-3 years, we get about 2-3% merit increase a year, &amp; got 8% increase after my last promotion) 

2. Start looking for a new job. I’ve read here multiple times that a reliable way to increase salary is to job hop. This is particularly hard for me because I do love my current job &amp; hate the interview process, but again it is my first job so I have nothing to compare it to. I’m a risk averse person so I like to stick to what I know, but I also would like a pay bump if possible.

3. Start working on getting a masters. I am a bit interested in Machine Learning, I graduated as a Math-CS Major and am missing working on more math-y stuff. I’m not sure about this though in that I also hear getting a masters in this industry is not AS necessary as it is in other fields and I may do better studying Machine Learning on my own &amp; then signing up for a masters mainly to make connections with professors after already having had some experience/knowledge with it. My current job does have tuition reimbursement &amp; so I would pay probably nothing out of pocket if I went this route.


Should I - 
1. Look for a new job for the pay bump &gt; Look into ML on the side at my new job &gt; Get masters once I’ve learned it a little on my own 
2. Stay at current job &gt; Get Masters &gt; Look for a new job with ML degree

I’m choosing between Ross with a total 80k scholarship vs CBS with likely no money.

NYC post grad is a must for family purposes 

Other factors:

CBS: I currently live in the city and like it a lot here and can live with SO (will live in a studio that’s under $1k each so rent cost isn’t a factor). Ivy League has always been a dream of mine. In term internships are a nice plus to try life in a startup

Ross: 80k is really appealing from Ross and the students seem really down to earth also. Might be nice to get away before settling down with gf. Downside is I went to another big 10 school for undergrad so kind of feels like a repeat college environment."

I recently pivoted my job interest to data analytics, PM type roles which is more out of the realm of business analytics (my current major). I know most of these jobs are looking for a computer science student, and I'm aware that may be a large factor in my failure thus far. However, I do have plenty of data science/analytics experience, although it is mostly self taught. I am really passionate about the field, and I wish someone would take a chance on me and recognize that passion and realize how much I want to learn (which is what internships are for, right?)

I have gotten dropped from literally all of them, even the companies that I made it to the last stage of interviewing. The companies I asked for feedback all said I'm a great interviewee and seem really confident and smart and they want to stay in touch. The only negative feedback I have gotten was that my answers should have been more structured.

At this point, the rejections are starting to really get to me. It's like I wake up to a rejection email every single day. It's starting to affect me mentally - I feel like I have lost my self confidence and I feel pretty pathetic. I don't have any hope for me getting a job at this point.

A.S. I may be utterly wrong on a lot of things I say here, so please, you are encouraged to argue with and correct me.

**Background:**

* Sophomore
* Interned at FAANG prev. year
* \~4 years experience (as hobby), 1 year accumulated professional experience, almost entirely in back-end dev.

**Problems:**

1. I want to get to know more about CS and do more rigorous (not necessarily lower-level) work – compilers, databases, HPC, graphics, distributed, ML, etc. I am absolutely certain I want to do research-oriented/heavy work in the future, and pursue a PhD.
2. Even not taking (1) into consideration, I feel like JS as a language itself and the community around Node.js isn't pushing/challenging me as a *back-end developer*, either.  It seems like 99.5% of community resources are focused either on using Node.js to serve the front-end (which I'm not interested in), or on building CRUD REST APIs using Express or another framework on top of it. Of course, it's totally my responsibility to develop myself as an engineer and not rely on the ""community"", however, I find it much easier to push myself closer to performing cutting-edge work when there are others ""around"" me doing the same.
3. Node.js doesn't have a large corporate following. I can't even work on it during my internship; Google doesn't utilize Node.js, neither does Amazon, nor any other Big-N.

**What do I need help with?**

I am extremely lost. Browsing hundreds of reddit posts and blogs raised only more questions.   


What language do I learn now to improve myself as a developer **and** be able to advance my career further? What field of CS do I look into that would both challenge me **and** be in-demand? Do I pick a field and specialize in it, or acknowledge myself with as many fields / technologies / languages as possible, and only then specialize (while obviously being behind those who chose to specialize from the very beginning)?

In 24 months I will be transitioning out of the Army.. Im 26 rn. I figure eventually ending up in a federal cyber job and buying out my 10 years of service will net me a better retirement than staying in the Army. My wife and I paid off our cars, zero debt, and have started saving in preparation for the transition. No kids yet. Willing to take a pay cut when I leave the Army if I have to, but would obviously like to maintain a similar lifestyle. Making like $67k w/benefits right now in Georgia.

First coding project was a relatively successful mobile app using Dart/Flutter that a few hundred soldiers use for training on the daily. Working on learning more Python right now for the eJPT prep course and expanding my app. No professional IT experience. Studying is my whole life right now though, willing to put in extreme hours/effort.

Do you guys have any advice on career or education choices from here?

The pay and the prospects though is not very good and I’ll lag far behind my peers if I choose Job A.

Job B on the other hand is a permanent role at a big company. It pays much more than even the GES 75th percentile for my course, but is in a totally unrelated field (IT related). I have near-zero experience in IT except for being semi-proficient in programming. I think there’s a chance that I might seriously not like Job B, but the numbers make much more sense and it will be a stable career unlike if I choose Job A.

Is there any reason to choose Job A? Or should I do the intelligent and pragmatic thing by taking Job B?"

About 2 weeks ago I applied for an internship at a well known company in my industry, and I am genuinely interested in the industry, role, and have decent experience relating to the role. 

I got a quick response from the recruiter after my initial application to do a phone screen, and she was super nice and casual, and set up a meeting with the team I’d be working with.

I thought the interview went fairly well, they said my resume was impressive, said some of my answers were good, and one time said “this is what your internship will be like”. They also asked questions specific to my resume and experience, not just general questions.

They said they were hoping to make a decision before the holidays and I’m wondering if since the holidays are already here, should I just assume I didn’t get it? I’m sure things could’ve gotten pushed back from people being out of the office, finishing year end projects, just being busy. But again I’ve never worked for a big company in a corporate role so I really don’t know.

I know it’s not good to get attached to certain jobs but I really felt like this one was perfect for me and made the mistake of getting excited about it, it’s my own fault.

Do I hold out hope until the new year? (I also already have a part time job, I just am not as passionate about it as this internship)"

I recently graduated with my undergrad in accounting, currently pursuing my masters and CPA. I spoke with someone last week about an accounting internship who does primarily non profit accounting. They said to follow up if I was interested. I sent an email and phone call telling them I was interested in discussing it further and we scheduled an in person meeting for next week to discuss logistics (in person versus at home, see the office and workspace, etc). It is a smaller company so it’s a bit informal. They said they would be interested during our first phone call and to call if I was interested and wanted a follow up meeting.


Since scheduling this meeting, I spoke with someone else about another internship who would like an answer by next week. This job pays more, is at a more established firm with many experienced CPAs, and is much closer to home. I’m worried that I gave the impression that I was 100% going for the original internship. In all honesty I was really excited about the original offer and really like the person. But after my meeting today this person offers a lot more services and opportunities. They also reviewed my resume and were very impressed with it which I appreciated. I hadn’t mentioned that I was speaking with anyone else (to the first person) and now wondering if I should have. I really wish that I waited to make that follow up call until after I spoke with the second person.... 


I’m concerned that I didn’t handle this correctly or gave the first person the impression that I would definitely be starting. I don’t want to miscommunicate or waste anyone’s time... I didn’t expect to want this second internship but the person made it sound like a very attractive offer. I am thinking I will treat our second meeting like the final stage in the interview process. I am thinking of bringing up the other offer during our in person meeting (kind of like, okay yes thanks so much, when can I get back to you by, I appreciate you meeting with me to talk more about the firm, I do have another firm I have been in touch with, I will get back to you by the end of the week if that’s okay). I haven’t signed anything yet but worried I jumped the gun or miscommunicated. 
Any advice is welcome and appreciated!"

i just graduated from a big 10 school like a week and a half ago with no job offer and no internship experience. i've been applying to like 5 jobs a day and a recruiter reached out to me on linkedin for a contract for a big shipping company that seemed like a sure thing until i took the hackerrank which i bombed spectacularly.

i'm 26, it took me 8 years to get through undergrad. i failed out of mechanical engineering and the university twice because of struggles with bipolar disorder, BPD, ADHD, and addiction. because of that my overall gpa is poo and i didn't make a ton of friends or connections in CS and my last chance to do so got rona'd. my cs education has been so spotty and spread out over the years that i just feel like i don't know how to program.

my last semester i stayed clean the whole time and ended up getting a 3.5 gpa in like the hardest classes i've ever taken, but that gave me zero time to grind leetcode or read the crack book. i look at all these 20yr olds that have internships at FAANG companies and feel like i can't compete at all.

I have also read somewhere that employers want you to be a more “well rounded” person. So picking a minor completely different from your major shows that you are able to think from another perspective.

The scandal is still unfolding in real time, so I won’t out the specific state until I hear their response (though even the district archaeologists know what state it is at this point).  
&gt;  
&gt;Below you will find why the $365k-model is useless, and then a description of why — to my reading — this happened. The second part is definitely the most important, so feel free to skip ahead.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The Seeds Of The Bitter Harvest**  
&gt;  
&gt;A few years back, a DOT got visited by some Good Idea Fairies, who instructed them to create a statewide predictive model for prehistoric archaeological sites. Naturally, they ended up partnering with one of the large engineering firms who has to pay for archaeological surveys all the time.  
&gt;  
&gt;A cynical person would wonder why some company that has to pay for surveys on a regular basis would be commissioned by their regulator to provide a model on where they don’t have to survey, but I prefer to read the situation more charitably.  
&gt;  
&gt;For the measly sum of $365,900.70 of taxpayer money, this firm agreed to provide the shiniest of all shiny models, complete with a GIS overlay that SHPO/DOT could make available to archaeologists.  
&gt;  
&gt;This model would later (and as of writing, still is) be required to be utilized on most DOT projects and all large projects that require cultural resource surveys.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The Delivery**  
&gt;  
&gt;After working on this model from middle of 2013 to around the new year for 2015, the contracted consultant had managed to deliver a model and 7 volumes of documentation to the DOT.  
&gt;  
&gt;Unfortunately, no one seems to have read the documentation until now. The model likely spits out nonsense numbers. A very simplified discussion of why is below.  
&gt;  
&gt;The consulting company used all the unsurveyed land of this state as the negative data set.  
&gt;  
&gt;Note how known sites = 1 and unobserved background land = 0  
&gt;  
&gt;I hope this makes you say, “Wait. Isn’t that the very land we want the model to make predictions about?” Congratulations. You could have saved this state from a 1/3 of a million dollar mistake.  
&gt;  
&gt;The environmental background is not a negative data set  
&gt;  
&gt;Using the null data at all in the models (a mixture of regressions and Random Forest) is generally not appropriate anyways. And it certainly shouldn’t be used as the negative data. But even if the null portion of the data was in the independent variables instead of the dependent one, you can still wreak havoc with your models.  
&gt;  
&gt;The way they checked their work did not utilize best practices for handling data.  
&gt;  
&gt;Why didn’t the consultant’s data scientist realize they had goofed up at Step 1 before toiling away for a year and a half? It has to do with how they checked their work.  
&gt;  
&gt;Normally the gold standard is to hold back a randomly selected portion of your model. Then, once you’ve trained your model, you can see if it actually performs when given real-world data.  
&gt;  
&gt;That was not done here.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now, there is a reason why. It’s because the data scientist did this type of validation within each model. Unfortunately, that’s not enough. We won’t get into the technical reasons of why, but you want nested layers of validation — you want to check your work both inside the model and outside.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now, having used up the entire store of data by running the models, how did the consultant check their work? Basically, they used some arcane statistical methods. And they probably should have worked. But they didn’t.  
&gt;  
&gt;They treated the known sites as a product of random sampling.  
&gt;  
&gt;We all know that even within a project area, not all land is sampled at the same rate. Just to use shovel testing (because STPs are easy to count), let’s assume you have 100 acres of land. You consider 50 acres to be “high” probability and 50 acres to be “low” probability, and you test them at different intervals — 15 meters and 30 meters are common.  
&gt;  
&gt;This means that 80% of your testing is done on the high probability land — because you can fit \~16 shovel tests on an acre at 15 meter intervals vs \~4 at 30 meters. So you need to find 80% of your sites on the high probability portion just to establish that both areas have equal probability of producing sites.  
&gt;  
&gt;So. You have a bunch of known sites. But they weren’t discovered from a random sampling of the landscape. They were found by looking where we thought we’d find them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Intuitively, most archaeologists know this. Why does it matter here? It matters because the distribution of the independent variables for the known (positive) data set was used for these arcane statistical tests. And that distribution was biased in ways the data scientist didn’t know and had no way of accounting for.  
&gt;  
&gt;See, this is kinda the reason why we hold back a last tranche of data.  
&gt;  
&gt;But wait! We haven’t hit the scandalous part yet!  
&gt;  
&gt;I could delve deeper into the modeling and why it cut some corners, but some guy making a mathematical mistake isn’t what’s the big deal. No, it’s much worse than that.  
&gt;  
&gt;The question isn’t why the model was made incorrectly — it’s why that wasn’t noticed until the last gasps of 2020, when some random person (me) happened to be reading the documentation as part of a background review of models in use at different agencies.  
&gt;  
&gt;Where was this guy’s boss?  
&gt;  
&gt;You’d think that for $365,000, you’d not throw one guy into a room alone for a couple years and then let him hand over the finished product without looking it over.  
&gt;  
&gt;There clearly was no “second set of eyes” on this project. All the way back in early 2014, in the third volume of documentation delivered to the DOT, the fatal mistake had already been made (using null data as negative data).  
&gt;  
&gt;Did this project have no oversight? You can’t even write a fiction story that’s 100+ pages without an editor. Why did a highly technical GIS-and-machine learning model not merit the gaze of someone else, either colleague or superior, before charging a DOT hundreds of thousands of dollars?  
&gt;  
&gt;Where was the DOT’s due diligence?  
&gt;  
&gt;Upon being delivered the documentation, who at the DOT was reading it? My guess is either nobody or nobody who understood it.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is pure speculation on my part, but I’d be willing to guess that the documentation was read, but not thoroughly, and not by someone who felt they knew enough about the technical side that they felt they could comment.  
&gt;  
&gt;Given the basic nature of the biggest model-breaking error, anyone with an undergraduate statistics course under their belt should have been able to pick up on the problem. But as a friend pointed out, very few programs steer archaeologists into math classes, and so very few archaeologists are comfortable criticizing smart people about complex methodology.  
&gt;  
&gt;Why wasn’t this tested in the last half decade, since it’s used to guide fieldwork plans?  
&gt;  
&gt;The SHPO forwarded me a short white paper from 2017–2018 where they’d attempted to at summarize, if not evaluate, the model and real-world data.  
&gt;  
&gt;The thrust of their data suggested that they didn’t understand how to evaluate the model, and to their credit, the SHPO author and the intern paper it was an extension of, stated as such.  
&gt;  
&gt;I did manage to pull enough data out of that one paper to look at a sample of 133 reports for 2017 across three regions of that state to give us some idea, though, of the model’s predictive power. Note that the numbers below are my own calculations, since I have not seen nor been told of any quantitative attempt to evaluate the SHPO/DOT model.  
&gt;  
&gt;The sample showed that each probability tier held the following sites: Low: 11.76%, Med: 5.88%, High: 82.35%. This would lead to a naive estimate that one should expect the Low areas of these regions to contain around 11% of the sites. Most archaeologists stop here.  
&gt;  
&gt;But adjusting for the fact that the Low area is 67% of the land in these regions and was only about 39% of the land, we end up with a weighted average of Low: 34.16%, Med: 8.02%, High: 57.82%.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now, I didn’t adjust for anything else — like more sampling per acre of the High area — since I didn’t have that information. But note how the expected number of sites in the Low areas went from 11% to 34%, and all I did was account for the under/over representation of each probability tier in their sample.  
&gt;  
&gt;The less intense sampling per acre for the Low area vs the High area will definitely push the expected sites in unsurveyed Low area higher. Note that as you approach 67% of sites expected in the Low area, you are doing only as well as a coin flip (since 67% of the total land in those regions is Low).  
&gt;  
&gt;And how about the Medium area, huh? That’s 23% of the land by area, and only expected to contain 8% of sites based on this sample? This is a great time to point out that probability tiers shouldn’t be named things like “Medium” because it could actually end up with the lowest probability.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The TL;DR Takeaway**  
&gt;  
&gt;This wasted $365k of taxpayer money. It shows a cavalier approach to quality control at both a major company and the DOT it sold this model to. It also shows that a broken model is currently used for large, significant projects. I hope that it has never played a role in route selection for eminent domain projects.  
&gt;  
&gt;And honestly, if you want a predictive model, get something for about 3–5% of the cost of this one. Keep it simple, so you can update it and test it yourself. Complex math does not perform better than simpler math, even without the raft of quality control issues with this model.  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m currently awaiting the SHPO and DOT responses, as I informed them only late last week. I should note that I do not work in this state, nor have any plans to do so in the near future. I have not been paid or otherwise compensated to lay out this critique to the DOT and SHPO. My motivation is mainly that I am professionally embarrassed by the lack of numeracy/oversight that led to this model being used to guide policy.  
&gt;  
&gt;I am available to make suggestions to and look through more of your data — within limits — for those who work within these organizations (they know who they are after my initial email was disseminated, I believe)."

I graduated with a B.S. in Finance in August this year with a not-so-stellar but okay GPA at around 3.35. Since graduating, I've been taking time off to relaxing but I'm definitely ready to start my career.

I had one FP&amp;A internship during my undergrad at a fairly large company that I really enjoyed. The work I was involved in was right in line with what I wanted to do. Some of the work was bland and a bit confusing to understand, but I truly put in 120% effort and displayed great work ethic.

However, I was never offered a position once I graduated, which I thought was kind of expected as long as you did what you were supposed to. And I did. I put in a lot of effort into whatever they threw my way. I didn't ask about a return offer either though, so I may have shot myself in the foot on that one. On top of that, I think some of my social anxiety gave the Vice President who hired me a bad impression of me that I didn't like it there. But that simply isn't true.

The good news, is that I did get reached out to by their HR recruiter, asking if I'd like to come back to intern for Summer 2020. She was pooling together candidates who she wanted to ""pitch"" to some of the teams that were having interns and I was one of those she selected. She could've just sent every past intern an email, Idk. *However*, I was taking 4 courses this summer so I could graduate quicker, so I chose to respectively decline.

I don't know if I should even bother reaching out.  I want to, but again I feel like the VP got a bad impression of me. A wrong one. The job though is the type of work I really want to do though and I know it's not easy to get into FP&amp;A right out of undergrad.

Do I reach out? What do I say?

I’m a high school freshman in northern VA. I’ve done a couple of CS classes on Edx and Coursera the previous summer break (Cs50, Cs50 AI, and the Andrew Ng Machine Learning class) and I really enjoyed them. I’m looking to maybe get an internship next summer. There’s one in particular I’m looking at that’s at MITRE. So far I don’t have any prior work experience or standardized test scores (I’m in 9th grade so I haven’t gotten a job yet and my 8th grade SOLs were cancelled) but I think I’ve made some cool enough projects. How the Mitre internship works is that it’s for early high schoolers (9th and 10th graders so I won’t be going up against OP juniors in seniors with published research papers and shit) and there are multiple pathways one can apply to (you can apply to at most 2), of which I’m applying to Computer Vision and Machine Learning. I’ve made some past ML projects including a COVID mask detector, a brain tumor detector, and a stock predictor. (These were all made with Tensorflow). Currently I’m also doing the first course in the Coursera AI for Medicine specialization (AI for Medical Diagnosis) and I should be able to finish it before end of winter break. I’ve also recently gotten to silver division in USACO (the us computing Olympiad). Does this sound decent, or is there anything I should try and do over winter break like a project or something to improve my odds? Application due in like Feb so I don’t have enough time to do too much, maybe another ML project or something."

Just because of the classes I've taken and how my schedule shakes out, I could add another year and double major in computer science (assuming the deans don't try and make me graduate in 4 years), or I could apply to graduate programs (probably a Masters) in CS.  Any advice on which one to choose?  My general idea of this so far is that I could add a year to my UG or I could do a 2 years Master, and they'll probably cost about the same for me.  My career coach at my university's career center said that ""it's not uncommon for non-CS majors to go to CS grad school"", can anyone speak to that? 

Just for reference, for my computational sciences minor, I'm required to take Intro Programming, Data Structures, and Digital Systems, and I might take Discrete Structures just because it seems interesting.

Would it be a valid option for a first job?,throwaway-fightbpd,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kjt4se/soontobe_cs_graduate_considering_job_for_family/,"For context, I'm set to graduate with a bachelors in CS this April from a Canadian university. I've no internships and - aside from retail - my only slightly notable work experience was a TA job I had in Fall 2017. I have little for projects outside of school, but there is a course I'm doing next semester that features a group project with a real-world client so it may help a little.

 I'm only starting the job search now as I frankly just left it too late. I've been struggling to manage severe anxiety/depression these past few years and I let myself get complacent leading up to graduation. With only 4 months to go before grad, I'm trying to find a job with what I currently have while trying to add some half-decent side projects over the term. I'm also seeking therapy and trying meds to manage my mental health.

My dad recently suggested that, if I'm without a job after graduation and am looking for work,I could take a position at his business (ski hill) doing IT and dev work. 

Specifically, I'd be maintaining and implementing new features for the company's website and database backend. It'd be a full-time position in which I'd receive some training on how to work with the existing codebase and I'd be given deadlines for completing various tasks. There's also some freedom to refactor existing code and potentially upgrade different parts of the stack to use more modern technologies. 

It's a small business and I'd be essentially the only developer aside from him. It seems like a nice opportunity for some work experience, but I'm concerned about whether it'd be presentable to future employers seeing as its a family-run business and the experience wouldn't be comparable to jobs with team of developers or with larger companies.

Working at this position for a year could yield some additional opportunities like doing consulting work for some of the ski companies in the same network. I'd also be working on side projects while trying to learn whatever I can to stay competitive. 

If I'm unable to secure another job either by graduation or for several months after, would this job be a viable option for gaining some work experience in the meantime? It could last for 1+ years, but I'm pretty sure that staying for much more than a year would be detrimental."

kjv6eh,2,2020-12-25,How can I end this friendship?,throwra101913,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/kjv6eh/how_can_i_end_this_friendship/,"Sorry for the long post!! Tw: suicide

I have had this friend (we can call her Alicia) for 8 or so years now on and off. We originally met online and shared interests in music, and have sporadically kept in touch through social media and texting (we have never met!). I was fairly close and opened up to her when I was 12-13 but have since talked far less to her (21 now).

It hasn’t been very consistent because I have grown out of this friendship. I did pretty quickly. The relationship has always been a bit uneven in that Alicia seems to enjoy talking to me more than I with her. While I was lonely and enjoyed talking to her when I was younger, I’ve met people who are more similar to me and more of a positive influence on my life over the years. The same has not happened for Alicia and I feel guilty that I’m not an active friend, yet it’s hard for me to talk to her anymore.

We did not talk often for many years (a few texts a year maybe through much of high school and college) but all of a sudden Alicia is texting me a lot. For the past few months, I’ve heard a lot from her.

Like I said, I’ve met some friends that I’ve grown close to, including my boyfriend of almost 4 years. I also go to my dream school with great financial aid and am living comfortably doing tutoring and website/social media work (2 small jobs, an internship, and am working on an honors project). I’m very busy, but I enjoy what I’m doing right now and find time where I can for hobbies and loved ones. I have struggled with depression at points in my life (rough childhood, won’t go into it) but have been really happy recently and have been doing well in school. I’m excited for what’s next.

Alicia lives a different life. From what she tells me, it seems like she has a very uncomfortable family situation (hates both parents, lives with one). She has a boyfriend but has never told me anything nice about him. She seems to really dislike her school and the work she does there, and hates the retail job she has even more. Her mental health has declined and she reaches out to me when she feels suicidal. She goes to therapy and takes medication but tells me it doesn’t work.

I understand that I am lucky for what I now have and I feel bad for Alicia’s situation. I listen when I can. However, I don’t know how much more I can take of this correspondence. She constantly tells me how unhappy she is. If I say anything about myself, she makes me feel bad (ex. I told her I was accepted into the honors program at my school and she shat on the fact that I go to a liberal arts college that allows me to do that).

It’s come to where the only thing we talk about is how bad her life is. She’s even asked me how I am and, when I say what I’ve been up to, it becomes something like, “Wow I wish I could do that but I hate my job/school/family and want to die.”

This doesn’t feel like a friendship to me at all. Maybe we talked a lot in eighth grade, but I don’t feel like we have the foundation built up for her to keep telling me all of this. She’s certainly not obligated to tell me only positive things, but she drops a lot of weight on me that I don’t know what to do with. When I try to offer encouragement or help, she’s rude to me and will guilt me for how my life is going. If I suggest trying to find a way to make change in her life (ex. I once asked if she should break up with the boyfriend because she said she doesn’t love him), she gets upset that I don’t know how hard that would be for her.

I know I can not understand what it is like to be her, but when I ask any questions, she makes me feel bad for living in a different situation and not understanding. I also stop texting her sometimes and she’ll pull me back in by messaging saying how unhappy she is or how much she misses me. I don’t feel like this relationship is healthy for either of us.

I can’t be her therapist, nor did I sign up to be. I do not consider her a close friend and have not for years. When we were close, it was in an “I’ll complain about the kids at school to you over Snapchat” type of friendship that I did not take very seriously. I feel bad that I am apparantly all she has. I think that she really needs someone to depend on, but I can’t be that person, especially when it feels like she’s falling on me rather than leaning. I am trying to be as sympathetic as possible due to her precarious mental state but, again, I’m a busy working college student and I genuinely can’t help her. The advice I give cannot be good no matter how hard I try. I’m just really bad with talking about emotions even in a better circumstance (it’s something I see a counselor about at school but I’m away from campus atm and have never even mentioned Alicia to her). If she just wants me to listen, that also takes a toll on my own mental health that isn’t warranted by the way she treats me. I have suggested that Alicia tell all these things that she tells me to her therapist or someone who is there for her in person and she gets more upset.

How can I constructively tell Alicia that, at the very least, I’m uncomfortable with how she reaches out to me? At this point I do not want to be her friend at all and my end goal is not being in contact.

UPDATE: thanks to everyone who gave me advice! I stopped responding after Alicia sent me a text complaining about how my state’s economy is better than hers (for context, I had responded to another text about hating her job that a couple of my friends recently got part time jobs that they enjoy in food service and fundraising and asked if there were any opportunities like that around her). That made it pretty clear that it’s less about her wanting to get into a better situation and more about her trying to spread her unhappiness and bring me down. I get it’s hard to find a job but responding as if it’s somehow my fault that my state’s situation is different (my friends I referred to don’t both live here but that’s neither here nor there) wasn’t constructive at all. This was the message that prompted me to make this post, btw.

Alicia didn’t reach out again for a few days (I hoped she got the hint after I ignored that) but a couple of nights ago sent me a text while I was asleep saying she wishes she was dead. It’s pretty standard for her to reach out very late at night and expect me to be there for her.

I told her that it’s not helping either of us that she is telling me that and not a therapist or someone else that’s qualified. She responded acting like that was obvious, but her therapist is on vacation so that’s why she told me (that doesn’t make much sense considering how often she sends me this kind of stuff). I quickly said that I’m not a replacement for therapy and that this is an unhealthy friendship. I don’t plan on texting back again if she replies, as per the advice given, but it’s been a day with no response so I’m optimistic (usually she’s very quick to respond, especially if there’s a way she can disparage my input). I’m still kind of nervous about blocking the number for some reason, but I will if she keeps reaching out!

Thanks again for the help, all!"

Because of some personal reasons, I failed school for so many times. Long story short, I graduated in August with an Econ degree with a CS minor and Im 28 now. Started Job hunting since Sept until now. Got a few phone interviews and 2 second-rounded interviews but failed. Besides, I feel like being a non-CS major would get screened out by HR easily.

Im so frustrating now because Im not sure if I should keep job hunting or should I try to go for grad school. My concern is that my gpa is around high 70s with a publication (done as an URA in my last 2 terms. cs related) but my transcript doesnt look good at all because of the prolonged years (around 8 years).

I really want to get a CS master in Canada/US but the tuition fee is kinda a problem. I assume if I could get a TA/intern, I could try to persuade my family to support me for this but it is still an unknown factor.

Would it be easier for a non-CS major to get a master in US than Canada? cuz I think the grad school in Canada is really strict about this. (CS major / working experience which I have none.) Would it be better if I could get a master in US and find a job there?

Finally, I only got 1 project, 1 URA experience, 1 non-NA software developer internship (4 months), 1 publication on my resume. I started to grind for 2 more side projects, leetcode and hope I could get more interview chances. I also got the AWS-SAA last week (althought Im not sure if it does anything useful). Would there be anything that I could do to stand out among applicants?

I am sorry for the long post and I have alot in my mind that I might have forgot to say it, but I really need some advice in this. My goal is to work at FANG if I could.

kjwnk1,237,2020-12-25,I got an SWE internship without Leetcode Grinding,robin1007,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/kjwnk1/i_got_an_swe_internship_without_leetcode_grinding/,"This still feels really surreal. TLDR: You don’t need to be a Leetcode expert for some of the Mid-Tier or government companies, just be able to talk about your projects, be decent at coding simple programs, and communicate wellI! 

I got an SWE internship offer today with a mid-tier software company owned by a top 5 private company in the US according to Forbes. Everyday I would see someone post their successful internship hunt journey and never thought I’d be one of those people considering the pandemic, and the fact that I go to a less popular school in California. I probably applied to over 200 different companies ranging from startups, small companies, mid tier, and some FAANG. 
After failing to get an internship last year as a sophomore, I had two options: 
1. Do the “Leetcode grind” that everyone seems to worship
 2. Actually learn a tech stack and do personal projects relevant to that.

..long story short I went with option 2. I hated just sitting in front of my computer googling everything because CTCI didn’t make sense a lot of times, and just doing a bunch of problems that didn’t feel interesting/rewarding...I really loved web dev, specifically the front end, so I took the time to really learn HTML, CSS, JS and then went all in on ReactJS....by the end of the summer I had some decent projects to put on my resume instead of some basic C++ projects I made from school and I also used a Latex resume template to help it get parsed easily. Then I started to apply like crazy once school started! By October my resume was looked at by a small company with about 3k followers on LinkedIn and they were willing to interview me for an UNPAID internship for 3 months starting ASAP. I interviewed and took the opportunity. I know unpaid internships are frowned upon, but I made sure to update my LinkedIn and resume, milking the heck out of the unpaid internship. (Never mentioned it was unpaid) Within a week of updating my LinkedIn profile a recruiter for the company I applied to and got hired into this summer, reached out to me saying she was impressed with my profile and wanted an interview! The rest is history from there. First round was a simple behavioral, made sure to sound enthusiastic and asked lots of questions. Second round was a technical interview where I was asked 3 simple coding questions that you probably did in your first CS class like make a function that can return the result of an exponent. Since the position I was interviewing for was a frontend dev position, I was asked lots of questions about HTML, CSS, JS like what would output here? And also explained some of the code in my projects, so literally everything I did over the summer paid off. Thank you for making it this far and reading my story, not everything has to be FAANG or some company that only does Leetcode heavy interviews...a big reason I went with option 2 was because it seemed like less risk. Knowing valuable frontend skills and targeting “lower end” mid-tier companies where my chances of actually being interviewed by a human being was higher, and the technical interviews were not Leetcode heavy. 

Happy holidays guys, take it easy, don’t let rejection or the internship hunt consume you, take breaks, breathe, play video games with friends, and God bless!"

Hei, I am CS graduate with 2 internships and now I landed a junior java role in a big company. I enjoy learning and since I am the beginning of my career, I would like to continue to pursue this Java path.

I have basic to intermediate understanding of Java, but I would like to understand better how it is working under the roof. Like, understanding exactly what is going on during compilation, runtime, what is binding, what loading of a class means. I already have a basic understanding of this, but I still feel like have to read more to understand better.

So do you have any recommendations regarding a really good book that might meet my expectations and give the information I need: How is java working deep inside?"
kjx1pv,1,2020-12-25,Not allowed to do a voluntary internship in Germany?,scruffy1055,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/kjx1pv/not_allowed_to_do_a_voluntary_internship_in/,"Hey guys, I asked the foreigner's office (the Ausländerbehörde) whether I am allowed to do an internship in Germany (I am a non-EU citizen and I came to Germany to study so I have a student visa) and they said that I am not permitted to do an internship if it is not an absolute requirement for my study program. But I read online and saw people saying that if the internship is unpaid or something and under 3 months then I can go ahead and do the internship and not inform the foreigner's office or something.  
So is there any chance/possibility to do a voluntary internship as a non-EU citizen without violating any laws?

Many thanks in advance :)"

I have working experience in the industry before entering Culinary School, then had my internship abroad. Like any other fresh grads, I have plans. Sadly, the Pandemic happened.

Now I'm thinking of applying to the BPO industry, Voice account or Non-voice account. Is it true na one day hiring process lang sila, then you'll know if you're hired or not? I have a restaurant job now, just started 2 weeks ago, and if I will resign my position, I have to render 30 days before leaving the company.

I got sick on my second week sa work, and needed to Swab test just to be sure (negative!). So I'm thinking now of my safety na din since restaurant work still does AM- PM shift and can easily be exposed to COVID.  BPO industry is what I only knew that has WFH set up without looking for a BPO experience. 

I'm hoping to go back to the Culinary world din naman after ng pandemic. 

Hoping for some of your tips. Thank you"

I am an international student stdying CS and planning to do remote classes in order to cut down my cost during the pandemic. I am applying for summer internships from here. I hope to be back in the US in the summer but it is uncertain at the moment. I would like some advice regarding a couple of things.  


1) If I put my international phone number in my resume will it be problematic for tech companies to reach out to me?

2) Did anyone do a remote internship from another country. Does working in a different timezone create a problem?"

I’m trying to decide on a career path at the moment! 

I’m already in the field (fresh out of undergrad) and have had internships where I’ve only ever needed to do 2-3 sets of tasks on the day to day and I really like that pace. 

I’ve been noticing this entire year that smaller to mid sized companies not only put the wrong job title for the job description they’re looking for, but they also expect one person to do about 5+ different domains (jobs) in one role. I do not like that because the fewer tasks I have the better my work. 

Considering IAM, digital forensics, and GRC. Please provide job suggestions, your day to day tasks, etc.

I should also mention that I LOVE repetitive tasks and boredom is not something I feel often with anything."
kk2ajg,444,2020-12-25,"Unpopular Opinion: People need to stop treating college like some sort of ""end of the road"" and actually evaluate them for what they are",oidoid124242,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/kk2ajg/unpopular_opinion_people_need_to_stop_treating/,"Hi all and happy holidays,

Anyway, I was just browsing around and there seems to be a lot of self-negativity and general sad vibes around here. Just wanted to put out some of my sentiments as someone who went through the admissions process (I'm a sophomore right now)

1. College is not the end of the road and college admissions are essentially just a mock trial for the rest of your life where you'll have to essentially repeat the process multiple times over for internships/jobs/etc
2. The entire admissions process is literally a for-profit business no matter what people say; not to mention the countless 'admissions consultants' who essentially make hundreds of thousands off of our misery every year. This is probably the main reason for the importance of college and college admissions (where you go) is so inflated—if no one cared, there wouldn't be any money to be made. In reality, there is minimal impact. 
3. ""T20"" schools this sub is obsessed about are literally 95% luck. After you count the legacies, shoe-ins (children of the wealthy/influential, Olympic medalists, ISEF winners, actors, etc.), and recruited athletes, probably &lt;50% of the slots are left. This means \~700-1000 slots at each T20 for over 15,000 applicants that are all well-qualified and most likely pretty damn similar to each other
4. Stemming off this point, trying to find things to blame for not getting into said schools is redundant—it's essentially complaining about not winning the lottery. Stop projecting your rage onto test-optional policies and other admissions policies because they are definitely not the reason you did not get in. 
5. The top 10% of students at any decent state school will end up in the exact or better place than any T20 graduate, most likely far beyond and better than the bottom 50% of the students at the latter school. Going back to the first point, college is literally not the end of the road and there are hundreds of kids at T20s who end up with terrible GPAs (for a variety of reasons) and end up having to take extra years of education (masters, for example) to bring that up, or they just end up settling for a default job 

Anyways, some advice for college students/incoming freshman regarding career prospects that are often overlooked on here:

1. Get on top of ECs immediately. If you thought college admissions was competitive then you're in for a big, fucking massive surprise (not to scare you). For example, the importance of internships and experience in CS and Econ/Finance is vital. The worst possible position that you don't want to find yourself in is as a 2nd/3rd year who forgot about the experience, has great grades, but then realizes they will have to spend 1-3 years at a low-level shit job post-grad because they have zero internship experience and can't compete at top firms. 
2. There are going to be a lot of times (especially at top schools) where nepotism is rampant and you just have to deal with it. Sometimes you'll have a friend who does not give a shit about anything, parties all the time, but then get a top internship ""because they know someone.""This is the reality of life, but also emphasizes the importance of your network. Make sure to be friendly with everyone and do your best to be more social if you were an introverted clown like me during high school....trust me it will pay off

Cheers"

During a hypomanic phase, I decided I could take on 3 internships at the same time, despite not even being able to handle my majors classes very well. The internships just confirmed I don’t like this field and I’m not good at it (my major is a web design/dev &amp; graphic design mix).

Coding makes me frustrated + the demanding deadlines even though I’m not getting paid is taking a mental toll. I’m being told to learn things I haven’t been taught in a rly short period of time. I just can’t. I’m getting high anxiety to the point where I vomit. I can barely grasp any of the concepts. Graphic design is also just starting to not be fun anymore. 

I just wanna drop out and do something else. Not sure what but something has to be better than this. What sucks is i’m already 3 and a half years in (with 1-1.5 years left) so it would be dumb to change majors, and my family is rly anticipating me graduating (especially my great-gran, who put most of her money into getting me through school)."

I got super lucky as both the technical interview had basic coding questions that were not that difficult to solve and in the second one I wasn’t even asked about time/space complexity. In both interviews we spent more time talking than actually coding. I’m still really happy I got it but feel like if I was asked coding questions that were harder I definitely would have failed and I feel like the reason I got it was just luck and not because of my skill. I know the internship is where you learn a lot and become a better engineer and might now have this feeling later on but right now it feels like I’m not that deserving of it.

Also, I have noticed that some programs are ""Open Admission / No Admission Restriction"", does that mean as long as I fulfill all the requirements I can for sure get in?

Thank you very much for your insights and comments!

kkb6ai,1,2020-12-25,I (24M) can't forget about the bad things which happened in the past. How I can get rid of bad habits and improve the quality of my life?,Interesting-Set6096,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/kkb6ai/i_24m_cant_forget_about_the_bad_things_which/,"I live by myself since I was kicked out from my parents house, the main reason was my older brother (26 at that time). We are not in the same page since forever, we had pretty ugly physical fights when we were growing up. The reason I was kick out, was because when I was 19 years old I couldn't help my family financially and he kicked me out, my mother was just looking at me during our arguing and I could see in her eyes she agreed with what he was saying. After understanding the situation I left the house, with my backpack (12 days before Christmas)

For my lucky I had an internship at the time and a 100% scholarship for my college degree. I slept for two weeks in the company which I was doing my internship for almost 1 year. My boss schedule a meeting from nowhere and in the title was ""Performance review"". I was so afraid, but some angel or something else took care of me that time, I had the perfect news for that difficult time. They hired me in the third week which I was ""homeless"" and by the end of that week all the papers were done. I was so happy and made sure my boss knew that. He didn't even know, but he saved my life. I could finally rent my own place and didn't need to sleep / hide anymore in the office.

I'll cut some of the details, to not make this too long. I graduated in the next year and I'm still doing well in my job.

After all that nightmare with my family, I have trouble trusting anyone enough to share my personal life. I can't get into any relationship, every time someone is getting closer to me I push them away. For 5 years I spend Christmas and New Year's evening alone. Every year when Christmas comes, all those memories comes back... my worst bad habit.

This year with all the pandemic problems, living alone without being able to see any of my friends. I built some new terrible bad habits  ... the only joy I have now is eating. I gained almost 80 pounds this year. I'm overweight now, very unhealthy and I can't stop eating. I tried to stop multiple times this year and failed and I don't do any exercises anymore.

I think I'm depressed, all that shit in the past comes to my mind more often. I work almost 10 hours per day, sleep for 4/5/6 hours, drink 2 liters of diet soda and eat everything I can every single day.

I'm not suicidal at all. I never was even in the hardest time ... I never thought about giving up.

I just really don't know all the meaning of this shit and what I can do to help myself.

I really would appreciate some advice.

Thanks, sorry for the long text ..."

kkda3z,1,2020-12-26,Connecting with the interviewer for my dream internship,agirlnamedyeehaw,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/kkda3z/connecting_with_the_interviewer_for_my_dream/,"Long story short, I interviewed with an animation studio for a production management-like internship and got rejected. From my understanding by the rejection email, my two interviewers (one being the boss) were very impressed by my resume and experience, but they went with a candidate with slight more interest in the position than me. I think it’s because I said that my favorite part of the production process is editing, which isn’t rly what the position entails... oh well.

Anyways, the problem is that the main interviewer offered to zoom with me next week and basically network/connect with me. She wants to give me advice and insight on the animation industry and answer any questions I have. She said she knows people at “big companies” with editing roles that she could connect me with which would be beneficial for me in the long run.

The thing is- I’m really embarrassed and humiliated that I got rejected. I hate that I’m taking it so personal. I’m like- what’s wrong with me? What did the other candidate have over me? I really felt like I had a shot of getting this internship and I thought I had it. I’m 99% sure I was possibly the “runner-up” for this spot. Ugh. I’m so grateful that she even offered to connect with me, but part of me just does not want to zoom with her. Maybe it’s my stubbornness, maybe it’s just my pride- but I really don’t wanna speak face to face with her knowing that she didn’t want me for the role. I got my rejection email on Monday and I don’t know why but this specific rejection from this specific internship is REALLY bugging me. So these are my internal feelings, but I’m still going to speak to this woman next week.

Does any have advice on how to process these feelings? Have any advice on how I can get through this zoom call and not break down and cry? How do I maintain professionalism when I’m still feeling sad about being rejected? Literally I’ll take any helpful advice. Thank you in advance :)"

So I was applying for internships and realised a pretty big weakness in my job application. I wanted to get into ML and Data Analytics since that needs math and coding, and I can do them both. I started working in various places pretty early, and was able to get decent work experience. 

However since I'm not a masters or PhD student, jobs here in the States are much harder to come by in those fields. How can I get SWE internships and jobs when I have no work experience in those fields per say.

Soft skills?,HumbleAnalysis,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/kkggmk/about_to_start_my_phd_in_chemistry_not_100_happy/,"Hello guys I just turned 25 and I am looking for some advise. First of all, I studied chemistry in a german university (3 years B.sc) then I did my masters in the same university (2,5 years). For my master thesis at a research facility I moved to another city and just before the start of my master thesis (6 months) I had the opportunity for a 6 month internship in the industry in the same city.

Now I am moving again to another city for my phd and I am not 100% happy with my decision since I loved the last city I stayed in. I have met new people and a lot of friends. Yet again I have to leave everything behind like I did before the start of my industry internship/master thesis. Here in Germany the start of my phd is at least a guaranteed position for 3 years and, in my case, a good payment which is why I’m gonna do it. The topic is also interesting (battery research) and this research facility is one of the best in germany regarding the topic.. but I am tired of “research” I’d rather have a “normal job”.  However, I kinda fell in love with the last city lived in but with my knowledge in battery chemistry my chances are not good to go back there since the main chemistry related fields there are about organic/polymer and pharmaceutical industry...

So I was thinking that I could increase my chances by doing some extra work teaching myself soft skills during my phd. I started with programming (Python) and maybe I could do something else like an MBA maybe? I thought about cancelling my phd but 1. there’s no chance for a chemist to find a job during the pandemic and 2. Companies are usually looking for phd’s. 

I am sorry for the confusion in my text and somehow i feel like I lost my path since I am doing things which I actually don’t want to do. Maybe someone can help me out or had/has the same problem...

I am graduating from a renowned university in India, and I have a 2 months internship from  UK based company.

My undergrad is from the field of Information Technology, (engineering) but I have covered majority of the modules needed for masters in computer science

So, I googled and asked around my professors and friends for good universities and i narrowed down these for MS in CS:

&amp;#x200B;

1. University of Stuttgart - particularly it fits well considering the majors they are providing, also job prospects looked good to me. I am not really sure whether i will get in or not catering to the gpa which is considerably less as of now
2. University of Passau -  The subject areas offered were of interest to me, since the start of the application is around April, I will have the final sem 8 results of my degree, which i am expecting to be somewhere 3.2 CGPA according to the grading scale of my university, also i will done with my final year project by that time.
3. University of Bonn - Modules were looking good to me
4. TU Berlin ( undecided) - I went through the course structure, but i feel my chances of getting admitted are less, i went through quora and read through alot - do not know if i have a chance.

If anyone knows any other masters in CS which i can look into and also if i have a chance at these universities?

Edit: Do you think my bachelor in IT could be a cause for rejection?"

I worked in a handful of companies and the same BS applies, most colleagues come out like seniors while they are not, they overpriced themselves and procrastinate at least 80% of the time while employees starting their career or cheaper are way more able. I've been there myself and saw it happen way too much.

When I started I was earning 4x less and working 4x more than my colleagues. The learning curve was sky high rocketing, all so called seniors were always skipping tasks and redirect to me while procrastinating and I was working super hard. When I realized this I asked for a raise, got it but was told that I was earning too much because I was a junior while others were seniors. With the raise, I was earning the entry value companies pay on my field! I knew that I would quit soon.

I saw a guy getting hired without doing any task (IT) claiming to have over 25y of expertise and got the highest salary of the company immediately..he used to take a month to do what I used to do in a day and he used to make questions I never even saw an intern do or lack of knowledge of. But the dude ego sold it!

I used to see those seniors say ""that task is not possible, it could take years"" as excuse just not to do something boring or that they did not felt like doing.
Recently I saw that a guy I used to work with, a senior with 3x more years of experience than I had was actually less experienced than I was. He just was able to sell himself really well and added ""fake"" LinkedIn years of experience (added 4years of experience in his field but that was unemployed time between school and first job...). I'm sorry, 4years making doodles at home does not qualify as work experience... No wonder he never added anything to my knowledge every time I tried to discuss work subjects!

I am so full of ""impostors"" at work! I need to be more confident (we need!) and do not underestimate myself ever again."

I worked and travelled all over Europe and also in Africa. I am young but I worked as a project manager and project coordinator for some NGOs and charities. I contacted some in Canada through LinkedIn or even Indeed. I also contacted private and public firms since I am open to new opportunities to learn and better my skills. Some of them never answered and others just said no. 

I just want my dream to come true. It’s been 6months I am looking and I am starting to loose hope... Can someone please explain to me if I did something wrong or if there is any NGO or firms in Toronto or GTA that would be ok to hire a foreign intern for 6 months just so she can get her international relations master degree ?

I’m posting for life advice and hoping I could get some reassurance from people who have maybe experienced the same things. I’ve hit bottom in just about every way.

It all started about five years ago when I went back to school after getting out of the military. It was so tough! Lived on nothing and worked my ass off. But I graduated last year and landed an amazing internship. It was at the top company in my field. After three months, they offered me a full-time job, which I accepted. I did this instead of marrying my fiancé. I ended the engagement in August of last year.

I did this for many reasons. We had a bad history. Very toxic. And because staying together meant my moving to a very small town six hours away where there would be little work for me. He didn’t want children. No family or friends nearby. He wouldn’t allow me to have my cat. I really wasn’t gaining anything (I was losing everything) and there was no compromise. The worst part... I’d already lived there before and he wanted nothing to do with me then. He was a typical fuck boy. He dumped me (2011) and dated another woman with whom he had a child with. Since moving away (2013), he’s basically harassed me. Facebook, Pinterest, text, calls, LinkedIn, different numbers, etc. begging to get back together despite blocking him on most all outlets.

So, after ending the engagement, I worked with my new company. Ex was still trying to contact me (sent a pic of woman in a wedding dress to me on Pinterest - he’s sick) and I gave in. Found him on a dating website and it went to hell from there. I cut him off again and when I say I struggled, I mean that. I could hardly work. I was a complete wreck and started seeing a therapist who verified my ex was a narcissist. Then, COVID happens in March of this year. I fled the city and headed for my family back east. Worked remotely for about two months until I was furloughed.

Since then, I’ve been on a sabbatical. Visited a lot of old friends and family. Couch-surfed like a pro. Worked on a ranch in Montana for a bit. 21 different states this year. It healed a lot of old wounds. But then guess what? Ex came back again. Promised me the world and that he loved me; wanted a life with me more than anything. A family. A new life in Florida. We started talking and a month later he decided I’m not the same person he fell in love with because I believed in “therapy” and I’d caved to my parents (I’m living with them and they asked me not to travel anymore because of COVID, which I agreed to). 

I’m crushed that I was willing to overlook so many issues yet those were his trivial reasons to end things. I’ve leveled with the fact he’s just plain fucked in the head. Most of all, I’m crushed and ashamed I let him back in my life. I knew better. I’ve known better this whole time and I’ve done this to myself.

I’m grateful for my family, friends and my health. But now here I am. Single at 32. No job. Living with my parents. No direction. It feels like I hit a wall no matter what I do. I promised myself I wouldn’t chase after things (jobs and men) that aren’t meant for me. I need to be building a life for myself instead.

So, I’m taking it day by day. I’ve decided to stay close to my family (New Orleans) and just find any work I can. Been applying to jobs like crazy. I’ve been trying to remember who I am and what I enjoy. I workout several times a week. I’ve been taking horseback riding lessons again. Reading. Considering therapy again, too. I feel a huge sadness and void. I wish I could replace my ex and all the bad memories with a healthy relationship. But it may never happen, so I’m focusing on what I can control.

What else should I be doing? Did you or do you know of someone who pulled themselves out of a slump? What helped you? Where would you start?"

I would like to build webapps that can be used on all plattforms (Windows/macOS;Android/iOS). Currently I know some HTML and CSS and build some websites. 


I would do this as a hobby/work experience kind of thing, since next year I want to start an internship at a small webdeveloping company and I want to show them that I am willing to learn programming.

The order of leraning would look like this:


* 1. Javascript 
* 2. Typescript
* 3. Node.js 
* 4. SQL/Postgress
* 5. NGINX
* 6. Lambda (Node.js)
* 7. Electron

I would move from one point to the other once I feel confident enough with the topic, and have done some projects. The goal for me would be to build a whole webapp by the end of this journey. 
For the timeframe I am not really sure. Do you think I could be ready in like 5 years time?

Thanks for you help."
kklcgh,1,2020-12-26,Starting a new journey.,ConsciousCog1,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/kklcgh/starting_a_new_journey/,"Hey guys, so I just wanted some advice if anyone has it. Next week is my last week at my job I’ve had for almost 11 years when I started right out of high school. I put myself through an information systems degree at university, and will be taking my last class coming January. I’m also starting a co-op in January full time as a software developer. I’ve taken a few coding classes but still feel like I haven’t learned much because my school is pretty terrible at teaching coding. I got this competitive co-op at a really good company and just feel like an imposter. Like I convinced them I’m better at coding than I am just because me and a classmate did a project on React and I’m helping make a website for the IT club. I don’t do much on my own, I don’t see the point when there seems to be an app for everything, but I’m still slowly working through The Odin Project and really enjoy it. My question is, has anyone had experience in a co-op? It’s a lot more than an internship cuz apparently I will be dropped straight into a team and be a full team member. That’s what scares me. I don’t feel like I know nearly enough or have nearly enough experience to even be in a co-op. I don’t even really know JavaScript. Do you guys have any suggestions on things I can do to hopefully be an asset to my team rather than some school kid asking questions every 5 minutes? I don’t want to be a burden. Thanks."
kknayy,34,2020-12-26,I can’t imagining being successful at any career because I make SO MANY careless mistakes no matter how hard I try to concentrate and double check everything.,TripleTyrant,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/kknayy/i_cant_imagining_being_successful_at_any_career/,"I’m 24 and have been diagnosed with ADHD primarily inattentive type since I was about 12. It’s pretty severe, especially the in attentive symptoms. I’m on medication and try to manage it in other ways — therapy, breathing, excersise, sleeping 8 hours a night and eating healthy — and it helps, a lot, but I’m still, compared to the average person, extremely forgetful and “careless,” even when I am trying very hard to not make mistakes and double check my work. 

I’ve been scolded so many times by so many supervisors and coworkers over the years, as well as friends and partners and parents and other random people I’m working with, even when they know about my ADHD. Sometimes it’s not a big deal but other times it really has bad consequences! 

I am very aware of this and try so hard to not mess things up. I’ve tried checklists and slowing down. But I still seem to mess up and frustrate others more than is acceptable. And when I slow down to the point where I feel I can be accurate and not make mistakes people are even more annoyed and frustrated. I am trying to find a middle ground right now but every day I come up feeling like crying. 

I leave things open, accidentally do stuff in the wrong order, add number incorrectly or just write the numbers out of order and even when I slow down and try to be purposeful I still make way more mistakes/forget things way more than the average person. I am talking about very simple things. Like leaving the car door open. I think it comes down to an absolute inability to multitask even in the slightest. So unless I’m 100 percent focused on closing the door every single time I get out of the car, and I don’t have any other responsibilities or things to remember, there’s a chance I won’t do it.

And even when I do think I’m completely focused and  un-distracted I still forget things or mess up. Because nothing is just a single thing. There is no task, no matter how simple that doesn’t have multiple parts.

If I were to methodically go through each part of each task it would take a long time, which is fine with me, but not any employer I have ever worked with. Even my mom and friends become annoyed with how slow I go, when I am trying to focus and avoid making a mistake, and yet also at the same time get frustrated with me for making careless mistakes. I get it. And ADHD employee like me is making more mistakes and working slower. That is literally the opposite of what an employer strives for. Still it’s so frustrating because I can’t help it, and I can’t find a way to make up for it, which just leaves me feeling worthless and honestly like the worst employee who isn’t fired just out of mercy. 

I am not dumb. I’m an English literature major and a fairly successful student. I have won prizes for analytical literature and philosophy essays. Aside from that however, I fear I’ve got no skills and I have no idea how I could ever succeed at any job. My mom has ADHD too and even she can hardly stand working with me and gets so frustrated because I sometimes make very stupid mistakes or forget obvious things. 

I can’t think of a career or job where attention to detail, working memory, and ability to multitask (at least a little) is not important and I cannot see myself significantly improving in that domain, at least enough to where I will not significantly frustrate others and potentially cause actual damage. 

So far I’ve worked as an intern for a non-profit, at a museum, as a waitress, as a bartender and in book sales and I struggled a lot with all of them, made too many mistakes, and frustrated my bosses and coworkers."
kknci8,2,2020-12-26,I am an American student that got their bachelors degree abroad because I couldn't afford university back in the US. What should I do next when I graduate this year?,myintrospective,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/kknci8/i_am_an_american_student_that_got_their_bachelors/,"
Hello I know the title may sound strange but if you don't mind reading my story you would understand how I got here. My hopes for this post is simply trying to find my next steps into what I should do next. 

So, for starters I am a first generation american immigrant who will be the first in my family to obtain a degree. My mother works for insurance and my dad passed away when I was 15 so I didn't really have any direction in life regarding how to pursue my education. The trauma kind of made me just want to flow through life. 

So I started working at 16 while going through school. I know after highschool I didn't have the option to afford going to a university so I continued my education at a community college while working various jobs at the same time. I chose to study business still not really knowing what I wanted. 

So I study, work, support my family for 3 years and found one of my first passions in life through travelling. I never traveled abroad before but I got into contact with my college's study abroad office as their intern for a semester and they hooked me up with their study abroad internship program in a European country the following summer (they gave me a scholarship that paid for the whole program). I interned for, of course, a business related internship, came back and finished my AA degree in business management. 

I still didn't have enough to afford transitioning to a university so I talked with them and they just started this partnership program with a grand ecole business school (something like a private university) in France to get the equivalent of a bachelors degree.

I take the opportunity. I am getting a partial scholarship and it is the most affordable option for me and my family's situation to continue an education. For those that don't know, the cost of a degree in other countries is sooo much more affordable than the US. 

So I go and live there, discovering SCM, completing their program, learning French, happy to say I enjoyed living life for the first time honestly. I just completed my bachelors degree in International Business with a focus on Supply Chain/ Purchasing Management from a French business school and now I am planning my return home.

To clarify again, my degree is French, but I am not very fluent. I know what the value of an american degree means in the US and as an american citizen getting a degree from a country outside the US some might look at it with skepticism. 

On top of that, just starting out in the industry, the problem I keep running into trying to find a job  abroad (for not just companies in France) is that they cannot sponsor international visas at this time (Covid).So really, my only option is finding work back in the US. 

I don't know how employers will look at my resume when I go back home. If they will be curious, interested, even consider me..

My life hasn't been the best, but I tried my hardest with what I had. I look into reddits like these to find guidance but my situation is definitely unique so I made this post to see if anyone can give any insight into what I should do next when I get home or give any tips on how to market my resume in the US? I am sure I won't find any work in France yet as I am not fluent. As well as general how to break into the industry tips. Are there any companies or career paths that look favorably at international backgrounds that I should look into?"

The profs/departments hiring you are aware that you are in school &amp; must give you time off during exam weeks. You can also filter by hours/week on CLNx and select positions based on the number of hours you are able to work.
* **Remote:** UofT has SO many different departments that hire for a wide variety of roles (research assistant is most common) &amp; the silver lining to you current students is that all work-studies are remote, so you can take a job at any of the 3 campuses!
* **Explore Different Fields:** Low-commitment option to let you explore various fields. Like may of you, I didnt know what I wanted to do once I graduated, but how would I know what I want to do before trying it? Apply to a work-study in that field! My various work-studies in different departments helped me identify which area of work I was really interested in &amp; helped showcase my interest during full-time job interviews. 
* **Gain Work Experience:** You gain practical work experience which will set you apart from students from other universities who were part of clubs (work experience &gt; clubs if you're looking for FT straight out of undergrad for sure). Yes, internships are also great. However, way more competitive than a work-study (which is only available to UofT students). And you can leverage your work-study positions to get internships later on (which is what I did!).
* **Yes, its paid:** Yes, its min. wage for undergrad students.

And lastly, its not \*that\* competitive. Most of my classmates who graduated alongside me havent even heard about work-studies, so as long as you shoot your shot &amp; apply, you will likely end up with at least 1 offer hopefully. I got my first work-study with 0 relevant work experience. 

How to apply:

* [https://clnx.utoronto.ca/myAccount/jobs/work-study/](https://clnx.utoronto.ca/myAccount/jobs/work-study/)
* There is only a specific period of time in which you are able to apply for these positions. Fall/Winter work studies are already over.  **Student Application Period For the Summer:** April 30 - May 29, 2020 ish.
* Use the advanced search feature to filter by position type, hours available, relevant skills you want to obtain, areas of interest, etc. 

Hope this helps some folks out there! I know this year has been tough on everyone's health &amp; their GPAs, hopefully you can wow your future employers with your spectacular work-study experience :) 

TLDR; Take a work-study position if you are able to. Trust me."

I think that along with my internship being cancelled because of COVID is causing me to get ghosted by most employers. 

Today I got an email from a health care company that heard about me through my university job link page, and they're offering me $42/hr to do part time remote graphic design work until Jan 21st when they say that I will be able to transfer to any department I choose.

Is this a good idea or am I being stupid by not continuing along the path of software development immediately? I actually have some experience with graphic design and I kind of enjoy it but my passion is coding, specifically front end development. I had been thinking that it might be better for me to find an internship in the realm of software development, but I also know that won't pay nearly as well and as a new graduate money is definitely tight.

What do you all think?"

I’ve been offered an internship as an operations summer analyst at a respectable bank. I’m currently a finance major and am a junior, so this is the big internship. Ideally, I want a front office finance role, however this is the only offer I have at the moment. I’m afraid of rejecting it, because I know it is very late and I might not get anything else.

kkuo1g,7,2020-12-26,Retaking a Course (Again...) &amp; really want advice for it and for my performance overall,Blueberryfeelds,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/kkuo1g/retaking_a_course_again_really_want_advice_for_it/,"Hi,

I've done some reflecting on my academic performance in the last 2 years and really need some advice. I'm really tired of being mediocre and having to worry about if I am even doing the bare minimum. 

I'm in my third year now of Computer Engineering. I'm moving towards the more specialized programming type stuff now, which is good for me. I'm actually pretty good at that end of stuff (even logic and hardware design) and in those courses I've done pretty well. However, in the courses that are more on the EE side (Analog Signal Processing specifically), I'm extremely poor. I feel I understand the concepts in the class but I just can't translate that too the tests. I also am finally done with physics courses but those really took a toll on my overall GPA. I think finally this semester, I raised my GPA above a 3.0. It feels so hollow though. I really don't think I can even feel happy with it. I have to retake this Analog Signal Processing course AGAIN, as in I've retook it once and did awful, and have to do it again. 

I just really don't know how I can feel confident about this upcoming semester. Courses are more in that vein of CE, and I'm better at those, but the courses are also harder. At some points when I think about this I wonder if I've damaged my transcript to the point that it's not worth trying and that I should quit. I feel like it's gotten the point that nobody would want me as an intern or employee.

Recently a lot of my friends have gotten straight A semesters, and while I am happy for them and they don't brag about it whatsoever, it really made me feel like I'm not doing something right. I don't know what something is though. I feel like a lot of times I just do awful on tests, and I feel that may be because I don't fully commit to doing the homeworks and just wing it, so I definitely will work on that, but I'm wondering if there's any general advice you all have. Yes my first two semesters I goofed off, and my third and fourth I patched the leaks in the ship, but now I feel this third semester is just casting doubt even if my GPA is going up to where most people are already as a given. The thing that hurts the most is that I feel like I am capable of doing this, and that I really did put in time this semester, but I feel I may have misappropriated that time into the wrong places in terms of review. 

I guess the TLDR of this is, what do I do to stop being mediocre in this school. I do good in some classes, but I do abysmal in others, and I worry that due to my previous performance I may not be able to pass this class again even though I understand the concepts generally. I just want to be able to feel good about myself in school and not feel like Im even more stressed after the semester ends."
kkux5w,46,2020-12-26,"Completely discouraged. Worked really hard to hopefully get a decent raise, ended up not getting one at all. What should be the next steps for me?",lethalsid,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kkux5w/completely_discouraged_worked_really_hard_to/,"Hey guys,

Sorry for the long post but a lot happened this year to lead up to the grand finale of not getting a raise and I'm genuinely trying my best to figure out what to do next in my career.

A basic summary of my current position and moments that lead up to my year end review where I ended up not getting the raise I asked for from my company.

\- Side note, My company environment is really toxic, we have about 5-7 people quit EVERY year. Our team has never grown more than 15 people since I've been here. I started working here beginning of February 2019 so I've seen this turnover cycle twice so far but I've been told it happens every single year. Company is 10 years old. The team is great but its mainly management doesnt know how to make their employees happy / doesnt pay them a decent wage which is why tons of people usually find better jobs with better pay so easily. I've come to realize this turnover has affected me over the years and I'll be explaining why. We basically garbage benefits as well.

Started off as a junior web developer intern straight out of college luckily, working on learning html, php, css and javascript / jquery.  I worked on several wordpress projects where we basically built custom themes for clients as well as our own site. I was an intern for about 6 months until a BA (Business Analyst) quit so I was ""Promoted"" to a full time employee, taking on his responsibilities as a BA as well as continuing my Web Development tickets as well.

TimeLine pay - Intern $20 an hourAfter ""promotion"" - $24 an hour / $48k salary

At the time, I thought nothing of it I was just happy I was going to be working full time as well as getting a promotion but not so thrilled being a ""hybrid"" as they called it. So here I am, a web developer still working on wordpress projects as well as BA work like generating reports on Excel, going to client meetings, helping them out on their CMS sites etc.end of 2019 comes and I get my year end review. Again I didnt think nothing of it but it should have been a major red flag. They told me nothing but positive things about me other than obviously being a junior dev I still needed to work on becoming a better dev.

TimeLine pay end of 2019 - $48k salaryAfter Year end review - $49k salary

Start of 2020Work was really slow in the first two months. I literally didnt work on much and spent most of my time studying at work, waiting on clients to reach out to me in case they needed help. Around March is when the lockdown happened for COVID and LITERALLY 5 minutes before our CEO announced that we were going to be working from home, she ""let go"" a family memeber / fired a dev because there simply wasnt enough for him to be billable. Everyone's worried about who else is going to be let go so moral took a huge nose dive. This person is the first of many who ended up leaving the company.

August  - 2020Another BA quits and convinces our lead dev to join her company so thats 3 people gone already. Since this dev quit, my manager had a meeting with me and basically said I need to step out of my junior role and become a full stack dev working on our SaaS product which this dev was a major part of. This meant I had to learn C# / [Asp.Net](https://Asp.Net) Framework / SQL / Entity Framework / Knockout.js ,Etc. Here I thought, okay they clearly only do these kinds of promotions or whatever you call it whenever someone quits. I was obviously excited to learn like a real programming language in depth like C# as well as the [Asp.Net](https://Asp.Net) Framework so I could become a full stack dev which I wanted to be already. I agreed with my manager that this would be a step in the right direction for my career and I'm excited to take on these new responsibilities. I asked if I was going to get a raise since I'm obviously learning / taking on more responsibilities. My manager said not yet because I would need to prove to them that I would be able to handle these new tasks as well as teaching myself these new technologies after work hours / weekends so I could do my job properly ( news flash, I was able to). I was like uhhhhhh so im not getting paid more but I will have more responsibilities? Okay fine whatever.

December - 2020End of year reviews are coming up and I was really excited to see what kind of raise I will be getting since I've been working really hard as well as taking  care of my tickets that are handed to me. To be fair, my manager has been filtering the tickets that were handed to me. I was not getting any ticket that was on the board but more like ""Hey I think this would be a great ticket for you to learn X"", ""I'm assigning this ticket to you since you're great at Front end UI / UX"", ""Hey this would be a great ticket for you so you can learn how this section of the app works."" The tickets were catered to my skill level because I was still learning. They were challenging but do-able for someone like me.My boss sends out an email stating ""Please send your list of accomplishments to your manager for the year end review."" Two more people have quit so five people have quit by the end of 2020 but we hired 2 more people to take their place.

Current Salary - $49kRaise I was asking for - $75kMy manager and I went over the list I created where I list out everything I've been doing over the year as well as helping out other BA's and receiving great compliments from our clients as well as other managers whenever I do some side BA work. Here is where I told my manager how much I was asking for, going from $49k to $75k. I understood that it was a big ask but I felt like as I was slowly stepping out of my junior role and more into a well rounded full stack dev I thought it was a fair ask.My manager literally said ""I'll be very happy if you got this raise and I will fight for you to make sure you get it, just keep in mind it is a 50% raise basically. Don't worry though, your salary is definitely going up I've seen everything you've done and I am really happy with how you've been handling the tickets handed to you . You've been learning a ton since August"". We end our discussion and he emails this list of accomplishments to our CEO for review.

Wednesday - Day Before Christmas - Year end Review Happens -Our meeting was only supposed to be 30 minutes but it ended up being a 2 hour long discussion where he basically said my raise will be $0 at the moment unless I get better as a dev. He said effective immediately I would be placed under a 90 day plan where I would try to focus on my weaknesses like how I dont have my programming fundamentals down, I tend to go over the estimated timeline for the ticket, my co workers have had to help out on some of the harder tickets. I was literally furious, my heart was pounding so hard and I ultimately I felt betrayed. Assuming everything went well and I did end up completing the 90 plan and coming out a stronger developer, I would be granted somewhere in the low $60,000's raise as well as being backpayed from January 1st to end of March ( 90 days ). I have tended to be a quiet individual but I ended up raising my voice and explaining how this was completely unfair and wrong. I stated

1. everything I've done over the year to meet their demands as well as how I've been studying since August in order to take on these tickets.
2. About how I basically inherited more responsibility since because they lost a very strong dev but didn't receive a raise .
3. How I literally quoted my managers words on how ""Don't worry though, your salary is definitely going up I've seen everything you've done and I am really happy with how you've been handling the tickets handed to you . You've been learning a ton since August""
4. How I'm only ""promoted"" because people quit but I've worked really hard to help the team.
5. how I've become the ""front end master"" and have handled front end tickets with speed and efficiency.

The call ended with my raise totally to be $0 but I did get a 3k bonus for ""all my hard work"" and having a 5 day weekend to think about whether or not I'd agree to take on the 90 day plan as well as the backpayed salary of somewhere in the low $60,000. not even close to $75k I asked for

12-26-2020I've been thinking about what my next moves should be. I obviously want to get the hell out of this company and hopefully find another job where I would feel more valued or atleast paid a decent wage.I can't help but be discouraged with all the hard work I've done only to have this happen. I've decided to continue studying really hard and learn C#/ Entity Framework / [Asp.Net](https://Asp.Net) Core / SQL and more over these next 3 months as well as trying my best to job hunt. I'm aware of how the current job market is right now which is why I'm worried I'll be stuck with this company longer than I want to.

You guys have any advice on how to proceed? Is there anything in particular I should be doing? or maybe this is all normal and I should get used to it.

TL;DR - worked my way up from an intern to a full stack C# / .NET dev but still have a long way to go in terms of skill / learning to do. I asked for $75k salary from my current $49k but was denied because I wasn't good enough yet even though my manager stated I was doing great considering I started learning full stack tech from August to December of 2020. Year end review ended up being a plan of 90 days where I will be back payed from January 2021 to March $60,000 ish IF I end up getting better as a dev.  


Any advice will be greatly appreciated, Thank you.

Edit\*\* - Thank you all for the comments. I definitely understand now that this isn't the norm when it comes to tech companies and that I should leave asap.   
Is there anything in particular I can do to stand out in terms of applying? I have completely updated my resume as well as created a portfolio showcasing all of my work I've done while working here.   
Second question - Is there anything in particular I should be focusing on in terms of the .NET stack? Should I try to focus on my C# skills instead of the framework itself? things of this nature I'm a bit conflicted on because I want to make my study time as efficient as possible since there's a ""timeline"" in place


Second edit** Thank you all for the additional comments. I know what lies ahead now and I think I'm going to go full speed on applying to hopefully get the hell out of here. I just hope I can find a decent job before I get fired in 3 months."

However there are some things that trigger a red flag in my brain. For example they called me through my personal phone. They did not even set up an interview  but they went ahead and called me and asked if I wanted a job instead. Saying that they found my resume and cover letter showcasing my abilities and thought I was a good fit considering the position. 

Second is is that they really wanted me to get through the hiring process as quickly as I can for a new year; they preferably want to me to start orientation on January 4th. I just thought it was all so rushed and quick and thought maybe I am just crazy?

I really want this internship and I want to keep an open mind; but at the same time these events keep going running through my mind.

1. My resume is filled with software development internships, but I really want to work in ASIC design/verification to start with. I know that any experience helps but I feel like recruiters will pigeonhole me into high-level software dev or embedded systems roles. Not that these are bad by any means, and I would still be relatively interested. But once I start down one career path, especially if it's in a high-level software or web dev role, I know it will be harder and harder for me to do chip design.

2. I've applied for grad school, trying to study computer architecture, and haven't gotten acceptance/rejection notifications yet though I am assuming at least my undergrad uni will take me back next fall if I want it. I am honestly just trying to use grad school to get into the industry though, and I have no real interest in academia. So I'm conflicted on this as well. Ideally for me I would like to find a company that will let me do my master's while working concurrently but it's looking extremely unlikely.

3. With covid and things being how they are it feels really hopeless trying to apply for jobs. I'm constantly applying online whenever I see new jobs pop up but I have no idea if my applications are even being read or if they're just being filtered out, and if they are being read I have no idea when the company will get back to me. A constant thought I have is is it even feasible for hardware-oriented positions to be hired right now? I would really like to speak to a recruiter directly, but I'm not sure how to go about that or if it would even be worth the effort.

So I guess my questions are:

Am I getting unnecessarily anxious? How much is covid playing a role in this? How much is not having a master's playing a role? I would really appreciate an answer from someone who's been in a similar position or currently works full-time in the industry. I really feel like I missed opportunities while I was still a student and while there was no quarantine, like gaining useful connections and trying harder at career fairs.

EDIT: Thanks for the advice everyone."

Why I think this strategy works: Assuming all CS students are good candidates to a certain percentage of internships, if you just keep applying to internships the numbers will work themselves out eventually. What did I have going in my favor? Disregarding a very average 3.3 GPA, I was a unique candidate. I was the captain of the jump section of my track team and was pretty personable in interviews. I also had a  web scraping project to my name that was complete minimum viable product.

My biggest tips:

* Get an internship even if it isn't your ""dream internship"" during your sophomore summer or junior summer if you plan on going for a senior summer internship
   * This is going to really give you some leverage for the next internship application cycle
   * If you happen to not get your dream internship the next year then you have a good backup spot and some leverage for when you apply to real jobs
   * This will give you some pay leverage whether at internships or jobs
* Focus heavily on being personable
   * I can't tell you the difference it made that the manager hiring and I felt like we had a good connection. These people are going to be spending a decent amount of time with you, so they'd prefer to enjoy that time even if you're not the most ""prestigious"" application
* You can really stand out with unique qualifications
   * By the time I graduated I spent over a year as the president of track and field at my school
* Start early (September/October)
   * I have a suspicion that many internships don't get as much attention in the first week or two postings have been up if they're really early in internship season

I used this strategy again the next year and now have a total of over 500 applications submitted, although it's easier the second time when you have an internship on your resume. Hopefully this will inspire people to stop taking leet/coding challenges so seriously and to focus more on diversifying their skill sets!"

I previously worked at Seoul National University (back in my home town) as a research intern and as a NLP developer for UIUC technology services. I have a decent? GPA 3.45. Those positions were the only opportunities I had so far. I do not know if it's my lack of skills/competence or the fact that I'm a F-1 student in US that makes my job hunt so difficult.

I do not even pass the resume screens like 95% of the time. I received coding challenges from Hudson River Trading and DRW, and even though I thought I did pretty well, I got rejected from both pretty soon.

I'm fairly confident with my coding ability and data structures/algorithms knowledge (although I try to improve by solving more challenging problems) but it's getting more discouraging day by day especially when I'm just getting straight rejected after a resume screen.

I was wondering if anyone had similar experiences as an international student in US and share some advice or his/her success stories. I'll really appreciate any sort of help."

Over the past year, I have had a hard time with a lot of things. I haven’t been motivated to do anything, especially very important things like applying for internships or taking important exams. I’ve just been doing the bare minimum at the last minute. Everything feels like it sucks all the energy out of me, even just replying to a friend’s message feels like a big task. It’s gotten hard for me to get out of bed in the morning. I will lay there for an hour or two after I wake up and just look at my phone or lay there. I can’t fall asleep at night unless I lay there for a couple hours or stay up very late. Some nights I sleep for 10 hours. Other nights I only get 4 hours of sleep and feel amazing the next day. I’ve lost almost all interest in the hobbies I used to enjoy such as playing instruments or doing painting/art. Also, I have a hard time focusing on things now. I used to be able to read a book for hours and now I’m lucky if I can focus my attention on an online article. Even watching a new movie I will find my mind wandering away. 

This all makes me feel so lazy and stupid and have some self resentment. I keep telling myself that I need to pull it together and accomplish goals, but I never end up doing it. I make lists and then by the end of the day I tell myself I will do it tomorrow. Life just feels like an endless, pointless cycle most days. Some days I feel numb about everything and just zone out a lot, and other days I feel on top of the world (as stupid as that sounds). I used to really struggle with anxiety and have random anxiety attacks, but I never went to a doctor about it. I haven’t had an anxiety attack for about six months now. 

I genuinely do not know what to do, and it is so frustrating I got to this point. I don’t know if I need professional help or if I’m just being lazy and need to figure myself out. The good days I have really make me feel like I'm faking the bad ones. I would really appreciate any advice, support, or anything that could cheer me up. Hope you all are doing okay."

As a junior with a previous SWE internship, I applied to 210 companies and got accepted to none. Eventually I offered to work for free for a startup (my university offers funding for unpaid internships), and that's probably what I'll be doing this summer. Here's a visual summary: https://imgur.com/a/9o6grlE.

After some reflection I've decided to pursue medical school, which is something I've wanted to do for a long time but decided against because it seemed too hard. I've realized, though, that programming is also hard and much less meaningful to me. Envisioning my future as a software engineer leaves me completely unmotivated and unexcited about my future, but envisioning my future as a psychiatrist gives me, well, a will to live.

That would be it, but I'm probably taking a gap year before applying to medical school (which means at least one free year afterwards). I could work as a research assistant during this time, which would make me somewhat more competitive for med school. However, I could also try to find a software engineering job. This could let me save up some money to pay for med school and give me a career option in case I don't get in. But it would also require time and effort that I could spend preparing for med school, and I'm not confident I could find a job. I really don't want to repeat the torturous Leetcode and application grind with no payoff.

So I guess my main question is, how hard would it be for me to find a SWE job to do during my gap years? Otherwise, I would appreciate any advice on whether I should keep doing SWE or focus on premed stuff/research."

I'd really like to step away from McDonalds - it's relatively easy work, but after dedicating so much time getting certifications, four years of school - I just feel like I've outgrown it. 

My options are (and please add on if you have better suggestions):

* Continue working at McDonalds
* While continuing to apply to jobs, claim unemployment (providing there is still COVID relief)

I really don't know. I'm conflicted. I've even considered looking into some trades relating to IT. Like, working for the local ISP installing cabling, etc. What do you guys think?"

Hey everyone, last fall I got a summer internship that I worked at full time. I was always on time, never missed a day, got good reviews at the end of the summer. I performed well enough during  that my manager let me work part time throughout the school year. For some more context: I work at a DOE contracted company, won’t disclose which, so they’ve invested money in me by clearing me. Once this past fall semester started I was just so slammed and overwhelmed. COVID semester was a nightmare, I really struggled with finding childcare for my 2 year old, one of my family members who is high risk had and still has COVID. I’ve just been so overwhelmed I’ve barely been able to put in hours. I’ve told my manager about me struggling to find a new source of childcare and about my family member. He always emphasizes to me that I put school first and just to keep him updated, which I feel like I could have done more of this semester:( 

the last 2 weeks of the semester and 2 weeks after I was fucking fried. I busted my ass studying for exams, doing lab reports, lost sleep and valuable time with my child. I was in complete survival mode just to get through finals, but I did well so it was worth it. At the beginning of this month I had said “I’ll be on later this week to reschedule our 1 on 1” that was supposed to take place on 12/7 (we have them monthly and he says I’m free to cancel or reschedule) I just haven’t gotten to rescheduling it. He doesn’t mind if I take time off but whenever I catch up with him I end up over committing and not really being realistic as to when I will be working. I’ve worked really hard to get this job and I already signed an offer for a full time position after I graduate, idk if I’m just projecting my anxiety or if I’m genuinely dropping the ball here. 

Now that Christmas is over and I have more mental clarity so I’m definitely gonna WFH on Monday and shoot an email with updates and restructure my time, it was just so hard before. I’m just afraid I’ll log on and he’ll say I’m fired. D: 


TLDR: I was so busy with school and life hurdles (COVID, no childcare) that I haven’t been as proactive about communicating in my job and I’m afraid I’ll get fired."

Production: Internship, Starting club projects/school chapters, Research, Competitions.

It seems like in general, way more people value production. All my peers were focused on production, something they could show at the end. They applied their knowledge to have something to show. I, on the other hand, mostly just liked to learn from college lectures and problem sets. I never ""applied"" my knowledge, but rather just expanded it. I just wanted to understand more math, more computer science. I didn't care about ""making"" something. I feel like it's never time to produce, because there's always more to learn out there. Yes, I know you can learn from production, but I always preferred input. However, I feel like to colleges, this isn't acceptable. I have nothing tangible to show at the end. Learning from input takes a lot of time and practice. Inevitably, it doesn't seem like production gets that breadth, depth, and understanding of concepts(maybe there are some cases). Some kids won competitions, published research, and started organizations with thousands of members. I sat at home reading books, thinking, and watching college lectures. I'm sort of a perfectionist, I want to know everything that I possibly can.

Regarding the entirety of the high school process(school, testing, extracurriculars), is (mass) input a waste of time? I know for projects you have to have some base understanding, but it seems like from my experience, its a lot less understanding than you gain from mass input. I am finally starting to produce the end of my senior year, with a cool project with a local university.

Are people that just read books and learned math screwed for the admissions process? Is it more advantageous(in the college application sense) to just produce produce produce?

tldr; is focus on input (as not a means to an end, but as the goal in itself) a waste of time in high school(with regards to admissions)? I am finally starting to produce the end of my senior year, with a cool project with a local university."

I come from an OOP background of Java and my favorite C# (yes .NET is just awesome!). But no matter how mane standalone or mobile apps you make, web-apps are the future, I get it. However, on the web you one get to code in Javascript (or in Typescript which I much more prefer). And it is not only the front-end, it keeps growing! Now with NodeJS you get to code your backend with JS as well! And obviously if you can code you front and back end with the same language AND store you db data with the format this language created and understands perfectly, why would you use anything else? (Rhetorical question asking from a business perspective) AND not only that.. Now there is Electron! Hell yeah even your desktop applications can be in JS as well!

The growth of this language would make me so happy if actually liked it. But I just can't. For almost a year now I try to like it. I made an Angular project (as my internship) and have several React side projects (I think I like React a bit more.. I'm not even sure) and write my backend whenever I need one with Node. For almost a year now I write almost only in JS (TS to be more precise), and I can't like it. Random errors pop out from random places, autocomplete not working because variables don't know their type, functions as variables (ok I kinda like this one) and not being able to write nice, structured code because something is not working if do it the way I'm used to (mvc). At this point I'm getting tired of writing code, because JS is the only thing I have been writing.

I would just stop using it or use like python, as a scripting language for small projects, but as I said it's huge! I don't have a job yet but I want to get one. And what if I get one where I have to write in JS? I know I could search for a job where I have to code with a language that I prefer, but.. paragraph 1!! I can't be a developer who can't (or doesn't like) web development.

I am mostly afraid of graduating with ~$50k in student loans and not being able to pay them off until I’m 40 (currently 20) with a MMET major’s salary. I’ve been able to raise my GPA but I know that the other majors are still fiercely competitive and will have a ~3.1 after the spring semester if all goes well.

Such concerns came after interest in internships I’ve recently discovered that as a MMET I will be able to do that same things as a ME but earn around $20k-$30k less than a ME whose starting out. If I switch majors it will add another year to my degree plan. Would it be recommended to attempt to switch if possible or should I push on and hope for a higher paying job as a MMET in Texas after graduating?"

I didn't have control over the lucky parts, but I did have control over my actions when I did get lucky. 

I was lucky to be born into a middle class family, that is financially secure, and didn't have to work or take a loan to go to college. This allowed me to focus on my studies (mechanical engineering) and get a good gpa. I still wanted to work though, and applied to be a teaching assistant for my university's first year engineering courses. I took the job seriously and did my best and was kept on from my sophomore through senior year. 

One of my co-TA's had a contact at a company that was in need of an intern. I was interested (read: desperate), she put in a good word, I got in contact, and they decided to hire me the  summer of my senior year. I worked hard, took it seriously, and put forward my best effort.  

I was planning to get my Master's (also in mechanical engineering), and the company I interned at welcomed me back for another internship in the summer. At the time I didn't necessarily envision working there after I got my Master's. But I still made sure I did my best. 

Going back for my Master's wasn't a hard one because A) I thought it would make me more desirable to companies B) higher starting pay C) my parents were going to cover it (and tuition was relatively low) D) there was a 1-year program and my gpa qualified me for it. 

There were three main things on my resume when I was applying for jobs: the two internships, being a TA, and being a team lead on my schools FSAE team (also my senior project). Between August 29th 2019 to May 22nd 2020 I applied to ***616*** jobs. In total, I heard back from ***18*** of them. ***7***  phone screeners. ***1*** request for a in person interview that I declined because it was in the middle of nowhere Texas. By the time the pandemic started, I had ***3*** active contacts and they all dried up.

April 16th I emailed the company I interned at asking for a job. Despite the economic downturn and the on going COVID struggles, they saw the value in me and agreed to hire me. It was supposed to be an hourly job for 3 months. 3 months became 6 months. And last week I accepted their offer for a salaried position starting in January. 

I was lucky in my financial situation, to get a job as a TA, to meet that co-TA with a contact, and to be given a chance at employment in the middle of the pandemic. But it was the hard work in between that connected those lucky events."
kleilr,23,2020-12-27,At peace with the idea of dying,kermit54,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kleilr/at_peace_with_the_idea_of_dying/,"It’s weird but Im honestly kind of just done with living and wouldn’t view me as dying as being suicide. I could never see myself doing it simply because I don’t think I have the courage to go through with it.

To give some background, I have aspergers (high functioning form of autism) and just can’t seem to get my own identity. Seems like whatever I do or say is associted with it. It’s totally breaking my family apart tbh and I feel it’s best just to leave now. I was happy in late high school but for the past four years it seems like God is just playing tricks on me and is telling me it’s my time.

My aspergers really began to impact me when I was realizing how much I was struggling with job interviews and befriending new people. This was very tough for me but I eventually came to terms with it and started this “campaign” about how just because you have aspergers doesn’t mean you’re only nerdy and can despite being awkward you can break out and do whatever you want. A big part of my push was that I didn’t like the preconceived notion that all Aspies are just okay with being introverted and left out and just geeky. I knew God was starting to speak to me now looking back at it because maybe a month after that is when all those Autism shows (such as atypical and the good doctor) came out. All of it reinforcing the stereotypes that I was trying so hard to break and just making them 100x stronger. Aspergers had had very little representation in media prior and nowhere near an entire TV show on it. Yet as soon as I start this campaign is when suddenly this comes out.

About a year and a half later I pull myself up (now my junior year of collehe) and decide that I’m not going to let my aspergers hold me back. I apply for a ton of internships and get practically no interviews (all of which I don’t get a call back for) and find out later that because I checked yes to the disability question (since autism was listed) that I didn’t get many calls. This again set me back a ton! I think another sign God was telling me it’s time!

I’ve finished my senior year and my dad got me an internship at his company. I’ve been working three months now saying “prefer not to answer” on applications and still no responses the next step is to I guess say no but I just have trouble with that. Like I’m completely surrendering any type of backbone I have.


There’s a lot more to the story of the last four years, including how I couldn’t seem to form ang new relationships and all my old friends left me. My parents aren’t having much sympathy for me and not realizing the efforts I’m putting in to be better socially, they just look at the results.


I’m in a weird feeling. I’m not wanting to leave life because I’m miserable per se. I also make no quaints that my life isn’t awful and people have it much worst, money for example has never been an issue for me as of yet due to my family. Ive just kind of realized though that I have no real purpose left in this world. So I really don’t even view it as suicide anymore, moreso ready to transition. I’ve gotten everything I’ve wanted here and have accomplished everything there is to and staying here would just be for the worst.

It’s been this way for four years of kind of just not really getting anywhere in my life. Before I was mad but now I’m kind of just content that it’s my time to leave. 

So IDK if this is the appropriate sub. for this but has anyone else felt like they want to die not because they’re mad but because they were previously mad and now content.


I’m hoping assisted suicide for aspergers/autism will happen here in the states. I don’t have the courage yet to follow what God i feel is telling me.



Another piece: my mom suggested finding jobs that don’t ask the disability question and apply for them. For reference, even most hourly jobs and it. I really don’t feel like doing that though. Not because I’m lazy or above it but because I don’t see the point. Even if some hourly job happens to not ask it, there still is no purpose in my life in this world."
kleorp,13,2020-12-27,How to get over the anxiety that if I don't get an internship that I'll be unemployed 5ever after undergrad?,BreakNo9063,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/kleorp/how_to_get_over_the_anxiety_that_if_i_dont_get_an/,"I'm a junior in college, graduating Fall 2021, and while I get interviews I usually do badly in all of them rip, both behavioral and technical (cases, math-based interviews in business). I don't do badly in all of them but I do badly in most.

I've started mock interviewing with friends who are more experienced, as well as strangers who are in the same boat, looking for internships. 

However, I'm worried that I won't land one for the summer, and as many of you know, internships your junior year often convert to FT offers in some industries, such as mine. 

I know that just because you get an internship you're not necessarily set; I had a friend who got IB internships and still doesn't have anything because the bank could only afford 45% of conversions. I considered him like a god in business because he knew so much about networking and interviewing but now we're sorta in the same boat, me obviously in a worse spot. I know a friend who interned at Apple and didn't get a return offer for whatever reason. 

I interviewed with a consulting firm in Sept. and the person who interviewed me did an unpaid internship their junior year summer and started there FT, so I know it's possible to get a good FT job without an internship; I just don't want to be the person that'll just assume shit will work out without serious effort and planning. 

I've looked at posts on r/recruitinghell and r/LifeAfterSchool and sometimes it can be really dark, like seeing people who haven't gotten a FT job after years of searching. I see an internship conversion as a way to prevent that. 

Moreover, I've worked with people at a tutoring business who have never worked FT despite being 3-4 years out of school. I'm not looking down on them, just saying I don't want to be in that position as the pay at the tutoring gig is not that great and I don't want to live with my parents forever after I graduate. 

So I mean, is anyone in the same boat? I'm trying to cope by just doing what I can (preparing more for interviews and applying to everything with the strongest app I can come up with) but like in the recruiting process, you're just not in control of everything."

klhlj8,2,2020-12-27,I’m about to finish college and I feel like I don’t know anything (network administration),tilex05,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/klhlj8/im_about_to_finish_college_and_i_feel_like_i_dont/,"
Hello, for the past year I have been doing my college studies in computer network administration. The thing is that it will end in like 3 months, and to be honest I feel dumb. I feel like I don’t know anything about networking. Of course, I have some basics, but not more. We haven’t really had the chance to practice with real equipment, everything has been only theoretical and reading PowerPoints and it has gotten worse with online classes since March. I have always been a good student, So far, I’ve always got good grades on my networking exams, I’ve always been good at solving problems on a computer (I have a computing support degree), but somehow I don’t feel the same about networking. 

As examples, I’m not even sure to understand what are DNS reverse and forward zones (but I know what DNS is), I don’t even think I would know what type of VPN to configure to allow people to work from home (and how to configure it), how to link 2 locations, but using the same domain. I’m not even sure to understand proxy servers either, why getting a dedicated firewall instead of just using the Windows firewall etc. 

Whenever I look at photos of server rooms, I’m so confused because it has so much cables

I try to Google and watch tutorials as much as possible to learn because I want to understand and because I still like networking and IT in general, but I don’t always find answers to my questions.

And I’m scared because I don’t even know what employers will expect from me. Will I be trained enough by people at my workplace? Will I be the only one person that will be asked to figure out my workplace’s network? I don’t fu**** know

Moreover, when I look at the IT technician/network administrator at my school, he is amazing. Like me, he did a computing support degree and that’s it. Now he manages our school network in such a good way! I don’t even know if he learned all by himself or if he got trained. By looking at him, I know it is doable, but I feel like he knows way more things than I do and I’ve been following a dedicated networking class. I might be wrong thinking this, but I think I maybe should be supposed to know more things than him? (No hate on him at all, he is excellent and I really like him).

 One last thing, a few people have told me that I would learn much more things when beginning to work in the field  as an network admin in an enterprise (my only IT experience is an internship as a computing support technician and it went very well). Is that true? I’m aware that I obviously need to know some basics, but I find it hard to believe that we really can learn networking just by working as a network admin or by being trained.


Any others network/system admins here that could reassure me, give me some advice/tips? Or am I screwed?

Thank you."

I just wanted some perspective on the situation I'm currently in. I'm in a coop program at my university studying Electrical Engineering. I have an 8 month work term starting January 1st and ive given 6 interviews but none of them have led to an offer. I might have to continue studying and finish up my 3rd year and find an internship for the summer. The issue is that if I do have to take this path, I'll end up graduating with only 3 internships and only 1 of them being Electrical related. 

I see this is a massive issue in terms of my chances to find a job when I graduate. Maybe I'm overthinking the whole situation but I feel kinda disheartened. What are some things I can do to make up for this lack of good internship experience? I know this whole covid situation is messing people up and im definitely not alone but I just wanted to see the situation from a different set of eyes. 

Thanks and have a wonderful holiday break!"

Hope you are doing safe and sound.   
I was hoping if any of you can help me set up my mind on applying for a master's degree in Computing Science and Engineering.

### Questions:
1. what is the normal career path of CSE graduates (is it only research?)
2. How hard it is to find a job after graduating?
3. Is it well-paid and do you know a range of salaries? (In Europe specifically)
4. What is the best European for this career? 
5. Given my qualifications given below, what are my chances to get into TUM CSE masters?
6. What are the normal fields where I can apply my knowledge? (I see that almost all of them are in scientific simulations, but is that it? Aren't there any other applications for CSE?)
 


### About myself and my qualifications (if you need to look at it and give a better judgment)
- I am a senior engineering student. I major in Information engineering. In my last year, I took a course called ""Parallel and Distributed systems"" that's why I got really interested in the topic as I learned threading, MPI, OpenMP, OpenCL (just a small intro)
- My GPA is 3.55 / 4.00 
- IELTS: 7.0 overall and 6.0 in the writing section
- No GRE
- I did 2 internships in Deep learning
- Worked as a tutor and freelancer (deep learning engineer) for the last 2 years (but the freelancing part wasn't that consistent.
- Hopefully, After 6 months or so I should have a research paper published.
- I have done over 30 projects mostly in Deep learning - Computer vision - Big data.
- Programming languages I use regularly: Python - C/C++ - sometimes (Julia) - used MATLAB for several years but not in the last couple of years
- Also, I am somehow sure I can manage a full/part-time job in the next few months and work before the next fall (just in case this matters)

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated with my MBA in May with a grade point average of 3.58.  I have been applying to jobs and for some reason I can't even receive an interview.  All I have is letters of denial and it is starting to get to the point of frustration and questioning why I even decided to pursue my MBA.  I thought it would lead to career advancements and more opportunities but it has been everything but.  I currently work in at the same retail place that I worked at when I started my masters degree.  My program did not require an internship and I'm wondering if my lack of experience is the reason why I can't even get an interview.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any opinions on jobs I could be looking for that would give an MBA graduate with little experience a chance?  Looking maybe also for an entry level job that would be good for my future career and would give me the experience needed to land some interviews in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

I just know that staying stuck working retail isn't giving me any experience needed (unless I get promoted to management).  I am starting to feel like I should have just got an entry level job and work my way up instead of schooling.  School hasn't lead me to the opportunities that everyone seems to tell you it does.

Thank you for your input."

Personal ordeals are combining with academic and work stress. Considering quitting job. 

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize in advance for the rant-like format of this, but I need to get some stuff off my chest. Any advice you could provide would be really appreciated.

**College Background:**

I entered college studying neuroscience with the goal of pursuing a PhD. I've worked in 3 labs during undergrad (one being just a summer internship). I find the field (specifically computational and systems neuroscience) fascinating but have accepted that the day to day of academia is not for me. However, early on I discovered the value of computer science in research and began taking relevant courses. I even tried making my own major so I could take the exact blend of courses I wanted. I feel I am an academically minded person and honestly have poured over course catalogs for hours trying to build the perfect schedule. Unfortunately, my major didn’t work out and now I’m a Computational Biology major with minors in neuroscience, applied statistics, and CS.

I was growing increasingly less fond of the idea of academia even before the pandemic hit. I turned down a research internship at UCLA this past summer in lieu of an SWE internship in my home city because I felt it would be necessary to have CS industry experience in case I jumped ship on a PhD.

**Personal Struggles:**

I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression since high school and when the pandemic hit, they both got worse. So, when that internship was unfortunately canceled due to the pandemic, I took a couple classes, played League, got out of bed at noon, and gave everything the bare minimum. I try not to hold it against myself because the whole world is in crisis mode, so I’m allowed to be as well. 

Luckily this Fall, A friend helped me get an SWE internship at a startup he worked at all through college. However I still had classes. I knew it would be tough to balance working 9-5:30 MoWeFr with school, but felt like this was my last shot to keep on track with finding a job after graduation. 

Then, I lost a friend to suicide. It hit me and my circle at school pretty hard. Because of the pandemic we could only really see the same 10, now 9, people each week. Since then, I’ve had an incredibly difficult time with motivation. I withdrew from one class, and am still making up work in two more. My grades suffered in the others. 

**Work problems:**

They told me from the start, this internship was going be a lot of hands-on/learn-it-yourself type stuff, but now I can’t get passed roadblocks. I go entire days without talking to anyone unless I’m at the scrum where I usually pretend to be working through things. I feel so unproductive. My code reviews have all gone well and I’ve heard that management is impressed with the work I have actually completed, but I just have so little to show for the 13 weeks (\~25 hours each) I’ve worked here. Now that the semester is over, I’ve lost school as an excuse to be behind. I’m considering quitting and accepting that right now, this job isn’t the right fit for me. 

Yet recently, I picked up a personal project; a chat bot for my friends group’s GroupMe. And suddenly I’m able to work 8 hour days on my weekends and feel incredibly productive. I feel capable on this project despite never having done something like it before. But, when I open the massive codebase at work, I stare at the screen and can’t type anything. I just don’t know where to begin on nearly everything I’m assigned no matter how small. The one assignment I felt good about was a proof-of-concept REST API because it was so self-contained. I wrote all the code myself and didn’t have to dig through 15 files trying to understand how the pieces interact. I think its tied to my anxiety and how I view work now. I got into a pattern of helplessness during this pandemic. But at the same time, taking a remote job at a startup, was always going to be difficult to get acquainted.

As I struggled to balance work, school, and personal issues, I fell behind on job applications and have no prospects but my current job. I’m not sure I could even maintain my previous work schedule (MoWeFr) going into next semester given the added workload of classes I’m retaking. So, I might have to quit regardless of whether or not I feel this job’s right for me. 

**The future:**

I eventually want to transition to data science. When I worked in research, my specialty in the labs was doing data analysis in Python. I’m looking into Data Science Masters programs in the NYC area (moving back home after I graduate) to begin Spring or Fall 2022. I’m worried I won’t be qualified to get into a good program or that I won’t be able to find a job after graduation. Ideally, I could get a job in data science before my masters to not only gain experience, but also keep myself busy for the 9-15-month gap in education. Fortunately, I have a decent amount of money saved up and basically no college debt, so I have more options than most. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mostly, I needed to just get this off my chest. I’ve been keeping a lot inside and am very stressed out. I’m just feeling so lost lately. Any advice you might have would be deeply appreciated. Thank you to anyone who read this far. If there are any other subs you recommend I share this in, please let me know."

QLED from board are orange (ram).

What i did so far:
Tryed to Flash the Bios to be sure that it supports the ryzen but the flash process will not start (after pressing the flashback button on the back with the fat32 usb-drive nothing happends).
I tried the ram in other slots and even a single ram, but with no luck.

What i dont know but would like to know:
1. Can my Motherboard run the Ryzen and/or how to Flashback the Board that the cpu works for sure?
2. Is the RAM working or are the specs wrong from the beginning?
3. What else could cause my half-boot-with-black-monitor?

Hope you are safe and sound.   
I was hoping if any of you can help me set up my mind on applying for a master's degree in Computing Science and Engineering.

### Questions:
1. what is the normal career path of CSE graduates (is it only research?)
2. How hard it is to find a job after graduating?
3. Is it well-paid and do you know a range of salaries? (In Europe specifically)
4. What is the best European for this career? 
5. Given my qualifications given below, what are my chances to get into TUM CSE masters?
6. What are the normal fields where I can apply my knowledge? (I see that almost all of them are in scientific simulations, but is that it? Aren't there any other applications for CSE?)
 


### About myself and my qualifications (if you need to look at it and give a better judgment)
- I am a senior engineering student. I major in Information engineering. In my last year, I took a course called ""Parallel and Distributed systems"" that's why I got really interested in the topic as I learned threading, MPI, OpenMP, OpenCL (just a small intro)
- My GPA is 3.55 / 4.00 
- IELTS: 7.0 overall and 6.0 in the writing section
- No GRE
- I did 2 internships in Deep learning
- Worked as a tutor and freelancer (deep learning engineer) for the last 2 years (but the freelancing part wasn't that consistent.
- Hopefully, After 6 months or so I should have a research paper published.
- I have done over 30 projects mostly in Deep learning - Computer vision - Big data.
- Programming languages I use regularly: Python - C/C++ - sometimes (Julia) - used MATLAB for several years but not in the last couple of years
- Also, I am somehow sure I can manage a full/part-time job in the next few months and work before the next fall (just in case this matters)

Thank you! :)"

klzdnb,8,2020-12-28,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (12/28/2020),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/klzdnb/weekly_job_qa_thread_12282020/,"Hi all,

Here is the forty-fourth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

km0bde,1,2020-12-28,Updating skills,Federal_Amphibian568,AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/km0bde/updating_skills/,"Hi There,

I am looking for practical advice on getting my feet wet with programming again after having travelled for two years. Two years ago I graduated with a bachelors of computer science at an applied college in Canada. I worked an eight month internship at a bank during my last year as a web developer. I worked as a web developer doing front end development using a little bit of angular 2.

Other than a resume with minimal experience, I don’t have a lot to show (I don’t have a git repository with any of my projects from school).

So I guess I have two questions:

1) What is a good way for me to update my skills -  how can I make myself more desirable /employable. Are there particular certifications, online courses that might help me out getting back into programming.  

2) What type of position would it be possible for me to break into having minimal experience? Are there any entry level positions in the software world that companies might be willing to train me and accept my last two + years travelling? 

If my question’s are not specific enough please let me know. I should add that my degree was applied and we learned a good amount of software engineering fundamentals, most of which I feel I can still rememberer.

I appreciate any advice that could help steer me in the right direction. I am open to any and all advice."

I’ve been reading about cloud computing and it seemed interesting so I started taking free courses offered by AWS and seem to really enjoy it so far. I wanted to know if there would be any value to obtaining the certificates? I should be able to pass the practitioner exam within the month. 

If I were to obtain these certificates would it help open up doors into transferring to more traditional tech consulting roles for FT as opposed to risk. Tech consulting seems more aligned with what I want to do. If not, would it make me more competitive for tech consulting FT jobs at other Big 4 upon finishing my masters in MIS (concentrating in Data Analytics and BI) next school year?

Any insights or advice about how cloud computing skills are viewed at the Big 4 would be appreciated."

Hello all. I just turned 18 a few days ago and have really been reflecting about my soon to be future and have been thinking about life in general. I don't have a plan at all and am always stuck thinking about a bunch of ideas or things I could do but ultimately just brush off for later or as something I might do.  

Right now I'm a senior in highschool and just need to finish the rest of the year to graduate with my diploma and I have all my credits and such so I'm fine high school wise. However, ever since I started 9th grade, I've been really tired and done with and bored of living with my parents. My parents have always been very strict and don't let me go outside the house or with my friends (only very rarely), won't let me get a job (so I would be able to save up money to move out and not be stuck at home all day being useless), and they keep me stuck at home all day doing chores for them. I'm fine with the chores and all as I'm thankful and grateful for the house and good life and love I'm provided with, but I'm just tired of living in this house for 18 years of my life and just want to move out and move on independently with my life and obviously visit my parents every once in a while and help them out and say hello and such. Also, my parents are very kind and loving people when they aren't being worried, helicopter parents. I also get along with both my brothers and grandma quite well. I don't hate anyone in my family, I'm not a hateful person, but when I meet a person that is toxic or hateful to me, I just tend to avoid and never speak to them much and not argue.

Also, I want nothing to do with college. I'm a very relaxed and chill person, but when it comes to school and all the work I'm bombarded with, I turn into an angry, pissed off mess. I've hated all 4 years of high school because the work was always boring, the constant and hard homework I received daily was absolutely useless stuff to learn about, and it all felt like a waste of my precious time. The only thing I liked about high school was my amazing, loving, funny, and supporting friend group, and I have a very close friend I could really trust as well and could rely if I'm in a tough situation. Anyways, I feel and know very much that college would also be the same experience and a similar stressful environment and situation like high school to me all over again. Although I consider myself a fast learner and intelligent person, I hate the part about school that makes me do useless and so much extra busywork after I get back home from school when all I want to do is relax after a hard long day of learning at school and my brain is pooped. I know that won't happen with whatever job I get, no extra work to bring home. Also, I don't want student loan debt and don't want to waste 4 years getting a degree I might not even want after 4 years of college, it would be a waste of time for me. I just don't want to risk getting a degree in college and being forced to find a job of that degree which I might not even find or will be bad or I might not like at all because I tend to change my mind a lot and that doesn't go well with college and my money situation as I would have to fully pay for college myself. I'm not lazy and will do whatever it takes to get a good job and interesting career ultimately that won't require college. I just despise the busywork I would have to do in college when I'm fully capable of teaching myself things on the internet or from getting taught how to do things such as getting work experience from the job I want or internships.


TLDR: 

I just really need some advice on if moving out of my parents house is a good idea especially since I live in California which is quite an expensive to live in. Because I really believe it is a good decision personally as I really want to move on with my life and have a place of my own and live my life out however and whenever I want without my parents telling me how to live anymore. And I need advice on what types of decent paying (50-70k a year) and fun interesting jobs I could find without a college degree. I'm also considering joining the Air Force and want some advice if that is a good choice for someone like me in my situation."

I quit my job out of fear of being fired (long story). And my license expired and my car suffered as a result. And now I’m not sure what’s gonna happen! My grandparents and I plan to straighten this out before they leave in April or May! Here’s hoping that it happens sooner than later!

This current moment is the most stressed I’ve been in a long time!

My love life is kind of non-existent

I’m not exactly great at talking to people both online and in person. I’m getting better, but with COVID and the nature of online dating, it hasn’t been doing to well!

I don’t consider myself all that attractive. I mean, [look at me, you be the judge!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11vD9aIazWsW8ksb0MmVRh8aesf-IZpTu/view?usp=drivesdk)
 I’m not buff, I honestly feel no motivation to work out (nobody to train with), I think I might be balding (hopefully not), etc

In the end, I fear That I’ll die alone or be forced to have a relationship with someone I’m not attracted to  just to have SOMETHING or fit in with society!

I feel distant from my friends. And most of my friends don’t really try to interact with me. Whenever I open up to them, like when I talked with my friend about her wedding (of which she didn’t invite me, of course), she hardly seemed to react more then “oh, thanks”!

Maybe I’m just expecting too much, but when I open up to people, I do wish people would actually engage a bit!

I also feel like I don’t really fit into my generation. I don’t use Tiktok (I don’t hate it, but it just doesn’t interest me), Concerts and Parties would probably stress me out more than anything due to the loud noises and flashing lights, I’m not necessarily interested in politics unless it’s something important to me. 

I’m the guy who’d rather draw and write for a few comic books I want to create, research things I’m interested in, read a book in a bookstore or library, spend a day at a Natural History Museum, Zoo, Aquarium, or Nature Park, and just have an adventure sometimes! Biking through a rural area with nature and agriculture all around! In fact, I feel rather relaxed and more akin to my true self in those cases. Hell, I actively talk to people whenever I’m at a zoo and am more than happy to give some facts and information! (“Ma’am, that’s not a crocodile, that’s a gharial! A close relative of the crocodile that is native to India and mostly eats fish!”) (so this is why my family thinks I should work in a zoo)

But I don’t know all that many people who enjoy the things I do. Especially around the Zoo Part, considering how divisive that topic can be with some people (most of the folks I know are either neutral or are like me when it comes to zoos. admittedly, I may be a little obsessed with the topic to the point where it’s honestly a little unhealthy and stressful. I want to respond to every single commenter that I see on YouTube and other platforms that have no idea what they’re talking about. Which is most of them!)

So if you can’t tell, I’m extremely paranoid, nervous, unsure, and a bit upset!

But I know that sitting around being nervous isn’t going to help! So I suppose thats why I’m here talking about it! And some possibilities are on the horizon!

Me and my family agree that now would be the best time for me to return to school! Here, I’m hoping to get into Biology and Zoology, with a particular interest in Animal Husbandry and Zoo Management, which a college nearby offers courses and internships on! I’m hoping to open my own wildlife park someday! It will focus on threatened, temperate climate animals that don’t tend to get as much attention! I’m hoping to breed the species I house and reintroduce as many as possible into their natural habitat!

Plus, hopefully, I should make some friends there who may be more then welcome to work with me on that! Plus, I may just meet someone special too!

So things can get better! I just hope I can sort this out, and gain some new insight from this post!"
km31oa,2,2020-12-28,Seeking IT career advice and life advice in general,Maverick270x,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/km31oa/seeking_it_career_advice_and_life_advice_in/,"To start, I've been in college for way longer than expected. When I was just signing up for community college, my advisor printed out a list of prerequisites for working towards my BS in Information Technology. After finally making it to university, it seems the prerequisites were either changed or they mistakenly gave me a list for Information Science as the prerequisites are very similar to what was printed out for me years ago. I am now finding myself pursuing a degree in Information Science with a concentration in Information Security as I am nearly done as opposed to pursuing a BSIT which would take significantly longer to accomplish (a lot of the seemingly new prerequisites were not offered at my old community college).  

The thing that is having me second guess my decision is that it seems like not many IT jobs and internships are seeking an individual with this career path. The advisor initially made Information Science seem like an ""IT-lite,"" but I'm kind of questioning that now. 

Some of the job opportunities listed on my university's website for my concentration are as follows:  


* Cybersecurity Analyst
* Information Security Analyst 
* Security Architect; SOC Analyst 
* Information Security Officer

I've looked tirelessly and cannot seem to kind any internships or just jobs in general where my degree path is a requirement. They all list BSIT as the requirement. All I'm really looking to get out of my degree path is some sort of career in IT. I've always had an interest in technology and that's what I have a passion for. 

I guess what I'm asking is, to what extent is this degree useful? And if it's as useless as it is starting to seem to me, what are some steps I can take to ensure I have a career in IT in the future?  


tl;dr: I've been in school for a while, originally wanting to major in IT, but switched to Information Science for time reasons. BS in InfoSci is seeming useless in terms of looking for a job. Kinda just lost in general and looking for any kind of advice I can get."

km66kv,3,2020-12-28,Incredibly Lost on Internships/Future Career as Current Cs Major,lostcsmajortw2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/km66kv/incredibly_lost_on_internshipsfuture_career_as/,"Hello, 

Sorry for what might just be an entitled rant.

I am currently a sophomore majoring in CS + a liberal art thing at a target CS university. This last recruitment season has been incredibly discouraging, with my hundred plus applications getting only a bare handful of responses. Hackerranks get no followups, the only final rounds were from referrals, and had what seemed like enthusiastic interviewers then ghosting me, etc. Most referrals from friends literally end up with not even a coding assessment. It feels like I ended up wasting a bunch of effort going nowhere.

I realize that the problem is probably with my resume. I have a bit of research along with sizable school projects, but am not sure if I should just be learning the mean stack on my own or something like that. The only personal project I made was personally interesting, but just not 'practical' in any shape or form. I like theory, but just cant get myself going on personal projects: to make some mobile app that will never see the light of day other than if my interviewer deigns to glance at my github. Not sure if I just don't fit with the ""live and breathe CS"" culture that seems to have become the expectation in industry, or if it is just me being burnt out from a shitshow of a semester/the whole pandemic thing being awful for internships in general or perhaps all three, or maybe I just complain too much.

IDK, am I doing ok, or should I just suck shit up and get to work on my personal website/personal app/idk what even is a personal backend project. Frank responses would be appreciated."
km6c3r,2,2020-12-28,"Graduating in spring, probably horribly behind, need some advice moving forwards",redmomba,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/km6c3r/graduating_in_spring_probably_horribly_behind/,"So I'm a canadian student about to graduate with a majors in CS, I have been in school bouncing between subjects for approx 7 years now, finally graduating. Don't have a great gpa.  I haven't had any internships and I dont really have any meaningful projects apart from a couple school projects which have been mostly in Java and C++ and some basic web/database work with HTML/CSS/PHP. Currently have been studying/grinding leetcode problems. 

Pretty sure I should already have applied/should be applying so I am probably in as rough of a spot as you can be but I want to grind my next 4 months (and beyond, would be thrilled to even find a job in 2021 period) 

What should I be doing for the next 4 months to hopefully get to a hire-able level? Is this even remotely reasonable? if not what should I be doing for the next 8-12 months to get into a hire-able position. Not sure if I should be learning new tech stacks or trying to create more complex projects with the languages I am already familiar with? 

Also if anyone is from Toronto, could you give me some insight into the job market here?"
km6yjc,67,2020-12-28,"Course Reviews For CS170, CS61C, and EE126",jjww8888,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/km6yjc/course_reviews_for_cs170_cs61c_and_ee126/,"I remember seeing a few course reviews posted here after last semester and I found them useful (and since I'm bored) I thought I would continue that tradition also.

**CS 170:** **Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems** (Vazirani, Tal)

**Summary:** As one of the first upper-division courses most CS students take, 170 feels like a logical extension of the material covered in 61B, namely the algorithmic parts, but also using proofs and other material (namely modular arithmetic, graph theory, and some probability) from 70. I felt like the overall pace of this class was perfect, spending approximately 2-3 lectures on each topic.

**Workload:** The workload of 170 is concentrated in the homeworks. Every week, there's anywhere between 3-7 problems, mainly algorithmic design ones. They aren't really long, but they are definitely very challenging and take a decent amount of just thinking before you arrive at the answer. I think on average, I spent anywhere between 6-12 hours on the homework depending on the length. Other than that, there's also a coding group project at the end of the semester where you try to tackle a NP-Hard problem. Our group probably spent around 20 hours on it and placed around the 85th percentile in the class.

**Difficulty:** Personally, I actually found the material itself not too difficult to understand, mainly due to the lectures and textbook both being pretty good. The actual problems given out on homeworks and on exams are quite a bit tougher and involve more thinking beyond just understanding the algos covered in class. To prepare for exams, I usually first carefully read through the solutions of homeworks/discussions to understand what types of detail they are looking for in our answers (this turned out to be really helpful as for both MT1 and MT2, there were always 1-2 questions that were similar to HW). I also did anywhere between 2-4 practice exams. After that, you can usually notice some common patterns that solutions tend to take (ex: for graph problems, making copies of the graph, adding a vertex, reversing edges are common approaches), which will help a lot for tests.

**Overall Thoughts**: I really liked 170. Walking away from the class, I feel like I truly understand a lot of the algorithms and why they worked that I didn't quite understand from 61B and grinding LeetCode. Definitely a must-take class if you are a CS major.

**Rating: 9/10**

**CS 61C: Great Ideas In Computer Architecture** (Garcia, Nikolic)

**Summary:** 61C covers a wide assortment of topics relating to computer architecture and serves as a gateway course/prerequisite to EE upper divisions and a lot of important CS upper divisions, like CS162.

**Workload**: Surprisingly, out of the three classes, 61C ended up taking the most work. Most of the work isn't really that particularly hard, but there is just a ton of it. To start, there are four projects (the last 3 partner), which increase in workload/difficulty as the semester progresses. The first project took me \~10 hours, but the last two probably took like 20-30 hours each. In addition, there are around 11 homework assignments, each of which took between 2-4 hours to complete. There are also weekly labs, which takes a few more hours. Also present this semester are clicker questions to complete for each lecture. Another unexpected source of time drain: wasting time being confused since OH queues routinely takes 4-6 hours. The relief policy implemented midway through the semester helped lessen the workload a bit.

**Difficulty**: Material wise, the content in 61C is probably the easiest to understand out of the three, particularly since Garcia's pre-recorded lectures were very well-made and well-explained (Bora's weren't nearly as good, but still not bad). That said, the class covers a lot - you learn to program in C and RISC-V and there's a ton of other material (number representations, circuit stuff, datapath, cache, virtual memory, performance programming, etc). To prepare for tests, I found looking through the lecture slides and discussion answers, as well as doing 4-5 old exam questions per topic to be helpful and sufficient. New this semester was having actual coding sections on both the quest and the midterm, which was a pain.

**Overall Thoughts**: As evidenced by the many 61C posts this past semester, there is a lot of room for improvement for how this class can be run. That said, I actually found the material to be quite interesting a lot of the times since I've never really thought about how computers truly worked until this course. Parts of the projects are also pretty interesting, but they are definitely frustrating and stressful. For the Garcia rendition, you can have project partners, so make sure to pick someone reliable that is also taking for a grade if you are.

**Rating: 7/10**

**EE 126: Probability and Random Processes** (Parekh)

**Summary:** EE126 is an extension on the probability portions covered in CS 70. In the first month, we do a speedrun of all of the probability concepts covered in CS 70, followed by MT1. The rest of the class covers more advanced concepts, with a particular emphasis on Markov chains (infinite and continuous) and estimation (MAP, MLE, hypothesis testing, LLSE, MMSE, Kalman filtering). The class moves very fast overall.

**Workload**: Similarly, the workload of 126 is concentrated in the homeworks. Every week, there's around 6 problems and they usually take me anywhere between 8-13 hours. There's also weekly Python labs where you apply concepts learned in class that take 2-3 hours. We were blessed with 3 HW drops and 3 lab drops, which helped a lot in the weeks I had midterms/projects due.

**Difficulty**: Out of the three, 126 by far has the most difficult to understand material. The lectures are quite abstract and just zooms through a ton of proofs and theorems. Parekh was a decent lecturer, but the material was just hard and the textbook honestly wasn't that useful and was even harder to understand. That said, the actual homework and exam problems are doable even if you don't 100% understand everything covered in the lectures. I personally found just doing/looking over 4-5 practice exams before each test to be really helpful as the problems are more application-based rather than proof-based and after doing a few, they start to click.

**Overall Thoughts:** Overall, I liked 126. The material felt a bit dry at times, but I think the class definitely helped build up my ""mathematical maturity"". That said, I'd only recommend the class if you felt you did well/liked the probability part of CS70 because it does move pretty fast and if you didn't like 70, you probably won't like 126. Definitely make sure you have the probability and markov chains portions of 70 down cold before taking this class.

**Rating: 7.5/10**

**Conclusion:** As expected, taking these three together, along with a breadth, turned out to be quite exhausting. I ended up surviving and got A's in all three, but I essentially had to spend almost every waking hour on studying or working on problem sets/projects. I didn't end up spending nearly as much time as I would've liked on recruiting for internships and, once again like last year, have not managed to land anything. I would only recommend taking the three together if you are a strong student/don't have much other time commitment, but I definitely feel I learned a lot this past semester."

I'm curious, if recruiters see open source contributions on my cv, will it really make a difference?

Recently I have made the decision to work on getting my associates at my local CC then transferring it to get my Bachelor's of CS. I've been a cop for 3 years now and am looking to leave once I get my bachelor's. I have a background in high school in programming/tech (Java, C#, and Obj-C) and have now started adding Python to my list of languages.

I was originally looking at Data Analysis with ML, but I have had at least four people, one being a former cop, recommend Cyber Security as a good transition and fit from Law Enforcement. I originally wanted to enter this field when I got out of HS, but now here I am.

I want to know what path I should take as far as setting myself up for a career in Cyber Security. I've seen a thread on here that talked about there being a lot of jobs, but not enough qualified people to get them. I know which certifications I should get based on research and that I need my Bachelor's, but past that I don't have a clue. Does my LE background help me? There is no way I can do internships as I'll holding my cop job while going to school full time. Thanks for any info I get."

I plan on improving my studying for the future, but I was wondering how these grades impact my ability into getting CS clubs like ML@B/Launchpad/Codebase and getting the opportunity to do impactful research (like through urap/cold emailing professors)? I have a genuine interest in creating AI projects and am worried that potential side projects cannot be ""proven"" unless they were part of such well know orgs. Of course, I would love to meet new people and have a great time working on truly interesting projects if given the chance at these orgs (applied to ML@B and Launchpad; got rejected from ML@B and didn't get past the coffee chat interview for Launchpad for some reason :() I also have an interest for research as well and heard that professors don't care as much about individual course grades than they do about the passion and interest one has in the project- is this true? 

I will still try to apply but would like to know my chances. Also what do most CS freshmen do during their summers? Is it expected for us to have a CS summer internship?

km9h65,1,2020-12-29,I’m so tired,Real_Cockroach_5277,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/km9h65/im_so_tired/,"This is going to be a long post so sorry in advanced

Basically this all started a few years ago. I met a group of friends online playing some games, it was great I never really had many close friends especially in the few years leading up to meeting that group. Over the year or so we were friends I was pretty well liked etc, but as always dumb drama with some people and the main leader of the group leaving kinda caused us all to fall apart.

Which sucked but it wasn’t awful I was still pretty good friends with a few people I met there. I’ll call the 3 I stayed friends with N, J and T

J and I are still friends but we weren’t ever that close normally just hang out when we have nothing better to do

N became my best friend over the year before that group broke up and I still consider him to be today.

And T well, I didn’t know her super well when the group broke up, had talked to her a few times and it was fine but never got to know her.

Anyway, after the first group kinda dissipated I started spending more time with T, and with N to the point that the 3 of us were all pretty good friends. It ended up being so that basically for several hours a day every day I would hang out with one or both of them.

Another year and a half past and I was very close to the two of them, I realized I had developed more then platonic feelings for T, and I’m not talking about a crush, I mean straight up full on romantic/long term love. Keep in mind for over a year we spent 3-6 hours a day talking messaging or playing games watching movies shows etc.

Anyway, so we finally get to about a year ago. N had some... not great stuff happen to him so he wasn’t around much for a good 3-4 months as 2020 started. Then I made the mistake of bringing it up to T that I liked her. Not in a fully honest way just asked if she could see me in an anything but platonic way. The answer was no, which is fine. But obviously sucked.

After a few weeks of feeling terrible from the rejection things kinda went back to normal for a bit, but as my semester hit its halfway point COVID stuff happened and my uni went fully online. The transition wasn’t pretty and I ended up having to drop 2 classes I was doing fine in before the transition and it sucked. But near the end of the semester N showed back up so was nice having my best friend back to talk to etc.

Still it was a very stressful semester.

Then summer hit, I had a internship. And it sucked. Sooooo many hours, so much stress. Not worth it imo was on the edge of burn out half way through the internship and then N when MIA again for another 3 months. I considered quitting so many times after that. I ended the summer more stressed out and burnt out then anyone should ever be tbh.

Then 3 days after the internship ended the fall semester began and I was in a lot of classes none of which I was interested in, I ended up dropping 3 classes and failing the other 2. I’m so burnt out by this point I don’t even care that much about the Fs (and they are my first Fs ever.)

But during that semester N showed back up again. But also I ended up losing touch with T entirely which sucks because I still care for her a lot, but over the end of the summer and this last semester she found new friends, people to replace me with.

Even down to the watching some shows with people that she had said she wanted to watch with me. Which just sucks.

But regardless 

Now I can’t contact T without feeling very anxious. N is gone for a 3 time in a row, and I’ve tried meeting more people online/making friend but I can’t. The first group I really liked but they ended up ghosting me because one of the was jealous of me, and the other one I’m not sure why. So I fell out of that attempted friendship. And then another 2 groups in the last few months I’ve tried to join. But I just doesn’t stick it’s not the same.

So basically in the last year along with having to deal with covid, I’ve had my social support structure removed, got rejected by someone I was deeply in love with, lost said person I was in love with too a new friend group, who I guess are just better than me apparently.

And then have been living the last 8 months in burn out, had the 2 worst semesters of my life, had my best friend disappear 3 times after talking about being suicidal, got rejected by a girl I had a crush on like 9 months after that whole first thing, got ghosted by her and her friend who I really enjoyed talking to etc

Then tried and failed to fit in with 2 other friend groups.

At this point I’m just hoping N is alive, and that T is happy I guess.

I honestly don’t think I’m going to be able to make friend again. Much less ever meet someone I’m romantically interested in

Better yet I keep having days or weeks where I feel fine, then an afternoon or 3 where I’m so depressed or anxious that I don’t know what to do

One of my only like 3 remaining friends says I should get psychological help cause prolonged stress+the rejections and ghostings have gotten to my self conscious level somewhat. Sadly I don’t have the money for mental health aid and won’t until at least this next summer when I have a second internship lined up.

I just don’t think people are supposed to feel like this. 

I’m so lonely, and even after the semester is over etc just anxious and worried kinda a lot, and I think the stuff with T etc has kinda left a scar like it’s been months since we had an actual conversation but I still care for her and want to talk to her, but even the thought of actually talking to her again causes me extreme anxiety.

Doesn’t help I’ve been suffering from insomnia either like. Lastnight I was up until 7:00am

I’m on 4 hours of sleep over a lot of hours of awake currently 

I’m just stressed, and burnt out to the point that I barely care, I shower like one a week maximum even tho I know I should more.

And I’m just so tired.

I legit don’t think I’m ever going to meet someone in a romantic way, and I kinda think it’ll be hard to become even more then friendly social acquaintances with someone much less close friends or partners with them

I honestly feel like something is wrong with me. And that all of this is my fault

I don’t know if it’s my personality, or my voice, what I look like. Or what. But it has to be something. There has to be some reason.

2020 sucked so much."
kmagj4,4,2020-12-29,The Story of the Fraudster Software Engineer &amp; The Consequences Which Follow It,MagicCart,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kmagj4/the_story_of_the_fraudster_software_engineer_the/,"Hey wonderful people of the cscareer community. 

First I apologize for this kind of post. I just don't know where else to put this and unfortunately I am nothing short of a character who constantly requires validation or condemnation for his actions and past doings. I have attempted to consolidate this.

&amp;#x200B;

I suppose a bit of history is in order (and I'll spare you the boring details). I went into college like most people not knowing exactly what I wanted to do or be in life. I just knew that the thought of ""struggling"" post-grad greatly ruled me completely, especially as a person from a low socio-economic background. What was advertised to me was not to do what you're exactly passionate or good at because let's face it, ""Rent's due on the first of every month."" Well after jumping between undeclared, (hey you have time) , accounting, supply chain, kinesiology, my uncertainty finally led me to ""majoring""at computer science.

I do believe there was a bit of love at first sight or perhaps- lust at first sight...when I first discovered how to make my first smily face turn from upside to downside. However, my first clue at how abusive Computer Science could be to a person like me, should have been in my first Python course which involved a lot more functional programming  &amp; scripting. Well- I decided to ignore the ever helpful and accurate feedback loop from hell about my true 'love' for programming. 

Well ladies and gents fast forward three years from that point, I've struggled through data structures and algorithm courses as well as the typical typical last year curriculum core courses. I had tanked my GPA completely so the it now sat at a 2.3. I had deployed more cunningness and deceit tactics than actual computer science principles to progress through this role. Safe to assume that I lacked any real programming ability a potential graduate should possess. The only thing which saved me was my ability to conceptualize most of the concepts within the discipline. Nevertheless, many will still marvel at what I am to describe next.

Upon reaching my 5th year  at University the Computer Science department finally allowed me to graduate with a Bachelors of Art in Computer Science, but before that, I remember struggling immensely in a systems programming course, and shamefully employing someones freelance service via Upwork to complete all of the programming assignments. Even typing that now I feel great shame and self-hate...probably because it's all finally catching up to me. Well, finally a professor was smart enough to put two and two together and asked me and my co-conspirer to demonstrate this adept programming ability we seemed to acquire out of thin air. My accomplice was able to do this but I on the other hand continuously bucked under pressure and revealed that I had no knowledge of how abstractions in the code I had allegedly developed worked. It was clear as day I had plagarized  and I knew I was bound for expulsion if I revealed the work wasn't my own. So through desperation and a bit of last minute cunningness which has allowed me to make it this far in our post, I learned how to program just intelligibly enough to convince my professor that the code was in fact my own work. He gave up trying to report me to the dean and concluded that I had displayed enough ""programming prowess"" to show that most of the code was mine despite having received ""tutored help"" on it. In the end, I was only lying to myself when I walked across that stage.

Well...I owe being employed right after college nothing more than luck and incessant prayer which I personally hold in high belief which is ironic for how much I deceive people and in general, myself.  I had interned at a bank  the year before I was supposed to graduate college. Unfortunately, I am something akin to a pathological liar or at the very  least a pathological embellisher. When I interned I had even went as far to do my homework on the kind of personalities, hobbies, kids, martial status, of all the people who would participate in my employment process. It  is only until now that I realize how psychopathic this mental framework is...at least to the extent which I performed and obsessively organized the information. Again cunningness and deceit was deployed then my actual capabilities in landing this internship. It is true that soft skills will account largely for one's prosperity within a career but one is a ***grand fool***  if he assumes that it will last him. Moreover, I was able to persuade (let's call him Bill)  out of all the mangers I interviewed with, to hire me and so I spent the next 4 months chasing tail within the institution instead of building up my reputation as a technologist. Deplorable huh? Stick around.

Well as an intern I was learning more politics than programming. The concept was quite elementary to grasp actually and it was that, ""Everyone has a shoe to lick"" I accidentally let this slip with a manager later down the line which I believed placed me in disfavor permanently...stirring up something akin to resentment and hatred against me for revealing such an obvious and universal fact. This wasn't entirely useless since after observing how confronting people with the obvious truth dispels their current reality- I opted to refrain from doing this. 

Throughout the internship I appeased people and seemed eager to learn which was enough for Bill to call me back in the middle of my 5th year (so you see where my motivation came from?) to offer me a full-time job in a program which allowed new graduates me to experience three different roles in a span of 12 months. I was astonished but I wasn't...you can generally predict the response of something if you set the parameters well enough apparently. I accepted and after graduation I started my first full time position as a Software Engineer set to rotate through three different roles within the intituion . Honestly it was quite a lucrative deal...and if not for my lack of technical prowess, I could and should have made quite an impression.

First off...Bill if you are reading this by any chance, I am sorry. Although I am certain my apologies are completely meaningless and induced by guilt; a kind of guilt that fills the heart only after you've discovered how good something was such as engaging in an affair and being discovered by your eternally faithful wife. You are truly a good man who took a chance on me...I remember watching Mr. Robot and equating his kind of persona to Giddeon Goddard who (semi-spoiler alert) got the short end of the stick throughout the series. Well I actually was in a very high level programming job which utilized a GUI to automate business flow within the bank. I'm sure  the comedic irony at the end of this pitiful story (which this has suddenly become despite my promise to consolidate, apologies) will provide someone a source of entertainment and great enjoyment so stick around you beautiful sadist.

Anyways my performance in my first role suffered despite countless 1-on-1 reviews with Bill indicating that I was average at best with my technical hand if that's what one could call it. Perhaps the better term would be green hand because of how greedy my personality was at this point. Again, the feedback loop from hell (and shout out to Mark Manson for coining that brilliant term) was letting me know that I didn't have long in this  particular capacity I was feigning. Yes, I ignored it too? Why? Because I had accrued $30,000 dollars in student loan debt despite being on a residential scholar at my university. So you see what I mean by greed? Well it's the color I most commonly used out of the crayon box when I was younger so maybe I was determined to be such a scumbag when I grew up.

Anyways, the rotation for the first position expired just as the others would after a 4 month period elapsed. My reporting manager had completely dissociated himself with me after I took an immense amount of time in competing a rather trivial project. The next position won't be mentioned since really the only thing worth mentioning is the similar ending was owed only to mutual laziness and poor work ethic shared between a manager who had no plan on managing in the first place (which I knew after meeting him the very first time), and an employee who accepted that passivity was better than revealing how actually useless I was in this capacity as well. The only thing to be mentioned at this point for those reading is that both my managers had left a mid-year review highlighting that I had yet to demonstrate a ""coding ability"" in this position. Thinking back now, they probably conspired to unionize their reviews based off the proximity of their offices (they both worked for Bill) but managed different teams.

Well this brings me to my last position where I currently reside in as an API Developer. It's comical how given the reviews I had one would keep me up until this point but I suppose they were waiting for the star to finally shine. Trust me...I would if I could and how hard I tried to do this in a last attempt to earn some reputation back. This time I had a different manager. A manager that has not dealt with people despite my lack of business etiquette, poor performance, and constantly late stories. I imagine the only thing saving my job is my EO who is testifying, ""That I just need more stories."" Sorry Alyssa...you are a good woman but this isn't what I need. **I need to be removed from this position because I've lived like a fruad up until now.** Well, whenever that occurs, I am sure the greedier person that lives within me will revolt and drink himself into oblivion when that happens but...it's like I said. One can can generally predict the outcome of things well enough if the parameters are set in place. However, I should have added and forgive me for omitting this because I wanted to create some kind of reassurance one might stick with me through this ordeal: **It doesn't mean you're going to like the result**. Well if I said that perhaps you might've stopped reading altogether..or perhaps not. Maybe a persons self-loathing is the best kind of Schadenfreude. He had to be sure.

Well if it was the latter, I am happy to have tickled a fellow sadist funny bone. However, if it's anything otherwise, then perhaps this will serve as a vital lesson for some young fellow who reads it. Firstly, what I did was not unique nor impressive. People have been doing this for ages. Getting close to there masters and then warping just enough to be in their favor. Secondly, these are the consequences which you can either postpone or discard...there is no alternative. If only I made up my mind to commit to programming and obey the ends to a means philosophy as advertised in a book I can't quite recall right now, then perhaps it might have turned out differently, but perhaps it might have turned out the same? Either way you're still in a **shithole** and based off your current parameters you can anticipate the end...you can see the result. It doesn't take an Einstein of any sort. Someone else can see it too. Spoiler alert that someone is called human resources.

Lastly, I am sorry to the people of this sub-reddit who apply themselves day in and day out to be hired in such trying times as we're currently experiencing. I was lucky enough to have swindled this job pre-covid-19 and I am confident that such a deceitful plan as this would have been inspected a lot closer or disregarded altogether due to the saturation of legitimate engineers that are beginning to flood the job market. You might see me as a phony who has all which is coming to him earned and I would agree with you. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes right? I suppose what inspired this was being rejected by a hiring manager I was able to win over that replaced Bill after I discovered he was let go. Again I saw another opportunity to start anew or rather, another opportunity to deceive. I had estimated the likelihood of my employment to this position which was the SAME exact position I had first started out in the instituion as low as (8%) after a HR recruiter refused to communicate any kind of receptiveness to my enthusiasm for the position despite meeting with the hiring manager. It is safe to assume my current performance in past positions contradicted the glorification which existed on my resume.

It took being struck with COVID to write this post but I am glad I did...some sort of cathartic energy sits around me now. If I wasn't so much of a coward, I would forward this reddit post to my employer and HR team tonight. Or maybe due to some unluckiness they're already reading this. Although still employed, I estimate that I won't be for long since if any person with wit who is reading this has deduced, I am entirely incapable and possess an unwillingness to dedicate any further effort in being a software engineer at least at this point in time. Perhaps, one day I might start over and apply to one of the FAANG companies. The likelihood of this...is low. My propensity for deceit, desire to practice cunningness, and greed is something that requires extensive reformation. However, now that I have paid off my student loan completely through a year of employment which I am eternally grateful to the position for, maybe I spend some time finally being....instead of always becoming. God...I'm so tired from doing nothing.

I am sure this post will hover between a positive, negative, and neutral disposition. All of which are completely justified and understandable. Lastly, if there are any fellow fraudsters out there I leave you with this: It may be ten days, ten years, or even a hundred that you may live, but eventually you die before you actually start living. Sorry that my attempt at being witty / ""deep"". I'll leave you with the man who provided more foresight before my deplorable existence.

A young thor'vaxian intern was running through the ship starting from the sensor room but while he rushes down to the bridge lets give a description of his race. the thor'vaxian people have short fur forward facing eyes indicating predatory evolution a tail as long as they are tall ending in a point looking like a very long fox tail, the average height of a thor'vaxian was 7-9 feet tall as they are from a lower gravity world but average on the galactic scale but this thor'vaxian was near 12 feet tall his fur is orangish with brown accents indicating hes of the warmer climate area of his world.

But enough of the description hes there on the bridge, the thor'vaxian bursts through into the Main bridge near the center of the collossal ship which dwarfed even moons this thorvaldr capital ship had nearly 150 million souls on board and was simultaneously a construction ship yard, base of operations for the military of the Thor'vaxians and their vassals and a communications outpost but what it is not is a first contact ship but i digress.

The captain was having a bad day already 3 of his favourite harem members got sick and had to be taken to the nearest medical planet. The other 4 members were all being condescending about how they are on a ship that is singlehandedly the most powerful in the galaxy if not the universe and has so much protection itd make black holes cower to near it but somehow the man with the highest amount of sway and power on this ship and 3 of his 8 wives got sick. The 8th wife his first and his most beloved was giving him the silent treatment and cold shoulder because he forgot a meaningful gift for her birthday which he repeatedly told her he hadnt forgotten the gift was still on its way to the ship but alas she refuses to listen. The captain nearly had his composure smashed like a pint across a drunkards face when the intern barged in.

The captains patience wearing thin stood at his 8'8"" height to look at the freakishly tall intern and asked with malice and anger dripping from his words said. 

""What is the manner in which you plan to explain yourself before I have you dragged at the back of this ship through 4 light years of travel.""

The intern even though he was taller then most if not everyone on the ship cowered under the predatory gaze of someone who knew how to direct their predatory rage at an enemy no matter what they were. The intern tried to speak but it was like something was keeping his words from leaving his throat out of fear the captain might pounce. The intern finally swallowed his fear and spoke his reasoning. ""Sir with the respect of the 12 i have come with news about the surrounding systems."" 

The captain only seemed to get more annoyed at the mention of the 12 as he growled. ""So why am i being informed shouldnt it be the scientists or the gatherers."" 

The intern then shakes his head much like a human would to indicate no with his tail mimicking the action. ""Sir its a space faring species one we have never seen before.""

The captains posture went from one of malice and looking for the perfect chance to strike his prey to one of calm and interest but he still had confusion on his face. ""Alright thats better but still i must ask why have you come to me in person instead of over my data pad.""

The intern allows a weight on his shoulders to be lifted but then goes to explain. ""Sir this species has an empire with as many vassals as our own and twice as many allies they take up nearly as much territory as the entire galactic community combined. This species we know nothing about them yet but they have contacted our scout ships with open arms and friendship in our own language before we could even hear a single word of their own language."" 

The captains day seemed to be turning around hed get to go on the entire galactic net for being the first contact of a undiscovered species. Then he had to open his mouth with another question and get the news that would strike fear into even the seemingly immortal qwar'far. An entire galactic empire that rivals the size of the entire galactic community he tensed in fear but not allowing any of his emotions move through his face or his tail especially that tail the traitor even started to move to indicate fear and worry at the same time but he stopped it. When he heard they opened with peace instead of war or an attack the same weaight that was holding the intern down seemed to be lifted off him. ""Ah I... uh d-do we have a view of them or anything about their biology."" 

The intern shakes his head. ""No we made contact with an allied race to the main species but when talking about their lead species they spoke with both fear and admirable driven words but sir do you understand the height of the main races technological capabilities if a vassal race was able to translate and speak our language at first contact even for the gorxians it takes days if not a week to fully translate a language but this race got everything even down to our figures of speech.""

The captain faced with a choice between contacting people with better qualified and experienced people or meet them himself and gain the glory or infamy of making peace with a people that would utterly destroy the universe for fun or make peace with a ally that could rush them into a new gilded age.

The captain opens his mouth to answer then he closes it to think again until finally he says. ""I will..."""

A bunch of these saddled with the obligatory 'Unpopular Opinion' tag. However, there's one topic that really sticks out to me: Why do colleges expect so much from it's applicants? Certain things that fall under this topic require clarification.

Now let's set one thing straight, you don't need a lot of the things this subreddit may make you feel like you do.

You don't *need* a 4.0 GPA. You don't *need* to have conducted research. You don't *need* to start a non-profit. You don't *need* phenomenal essays. You don't *need* an internship. You don't *need* to have won any awards.

If colleges couldn't find anyone with achievements like these, I'm certain there'd be no pressure to earn any of them. They're boons and nothing more.

The bar for academic and overall excellence is constantly rising, not everyone who *should*, or wants to, will get in. MIT declined a kid who'd built a fully-functioning nuclear reactor. They had their reasons. If you get rejected from your school of choice, they'll have their reasons.

My point is: a lot of you are trying to outdo, or merely contest with the competition rather than actually get admitted. If you feel too much pressure, like you can't possibly keep up, step away. These institutes may not be for you.

You want top college? College wants top student."

I think I have a good resume but I still am not getting a lot of interviews of replies.

I know Im on the sub of people looking for jobs, but the job market seems bad and only getting worse for us. I’ve noticed Youtube videos discussing OAs are getting lots of views so hundreds of thousands of people are applying for these jobs and preparing for interviews. 

CS also seems like the field everyone is trying to learn or switch to. With stories of readily available 6 figure jobs, after just 6 months of teaching yourself. It’s also the hottest degree, applications and admission averages for CS are crazy high. Since it considered the ‘least regrettable degree’ on every site and video, I feel like people are getting into it just for the money and sense of security, which is cool because it is a career after all. But it’s discouraging seeing something you love being taken over by people for money and no passion for it.

I love CS, it’s what I wanted to do since Junior High. I get to solve problems and create cool things and learn everyday. But i’m scared that I will not find a good job in the field and regret following this path. 

Also I have cousins graduating highschool, and are deciding between traditional engineering or computer science. I showed them how cool comp sci was but didn’t mention jobs, and would feel guilty if I made them pursue a degree in comp sci and they get no jobs, when they could’ve done something like mechanical engineering. Which one is better for jobs?"

If so, how?",secretlyti,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/kmft6j/should_i_23f_quit_my_new_job_if_so_how/,"Hi, I hope this is the right place for this. I graduated with my bachelors’ in psychology and sociology in May of this year. I have been gaining experience as an emotional support specialist at a call center and have recently gotten a new job as a bachelor’s level mental health counselor. 

There are several red flags with this job including that I started on November 30 (2 weeks prior but this was my start date) and have paid $300 in pre-employment fees (CPR cert, background check, drug test, tb test, and optional therapy website subscription) but have yet to receive any form of income. (Hopefully I’ll get paid on the 1st!). I don’t get paid for mandatory weekly supervision meetings or for once a month group meetings. I don’t get paid for the time spent learning/preparing for sessions. I don’t get paid when clients cancel meetings or don’t answer. Out of 9 clients, only 3 have been reachable so far. Since they’ve canceled a few times, I’m looking at about $50 on my first check. 

My office manager encouraged me to reach out to my clients via my personal email when I inquired about my work one. She said the IT guy was on vacation, and do I even need to email clients. Uhhh... I thought I was supposed to send worksheets, schedule zoom meetings etc and no I will not share my personal email with my clients.. I also had to insist they have my bank information before I start seeing clients. I hadn’t filled out a w2 (w9 actually), given a voided check or anything! My office manager said if I had started when she told me to (using personal email and without way of getting paid) I would’ve gotten paid on Dec 15th, but since I insisted on professionalism (lol), I won’t be getting paid until January 1 :/ hoping to get paid tomorrow.. don’t see a pay stub online.. thought this would be a source of income but will only be making like $50 anyway..

But the biggest reason I think I should quit is due to lack of educational knowledge. Providing emotional support is very different from teaching basic life skills and I’m realizing that my skill set is not developed enough for this role. I’m used to answering phone calls when callers are in crisis. Doing suicide risk assessments, reflecting feelings, creating safety plans. I have no idea how to conduct a therapy session or teach skills! 
I do have weekly supervision where my supervisor guides me on what to learn about next (history of CBT, DSM-5 criteria etc). Im interested in what I’m learning and I definitely see the value in the educational component I’m receiving. However, I don’t think I should be seeing clients right now. I’m not equipped to hold my own counseling sessions and I’m rushing to learn skills so I can teach it in my session!! Idk what I’m doing! These ppl have problems and are coming for help, but I don’t feel competent enough to provide this service rn. 
I’ve decided to pursue a master’s in social work, so I’ll *learn* the skills and interventions to help but I don’t know too much now. I spent a lot of credits pursuing internships in lieu of taking traditional courses. Idk if that has put me behind or if this job is too advanced for any bachelor’s level psych/Socl degree holder but either way, I don’t think I’m qualified for it rn. 

Should I quit? I’m just feeling guilty about letting my (2-3) clients down. I don’t want to let the ppl at my new job down or burn a bridge. 

What do I do? How do I leave after only two months? My bf said if I don’t get paid on the 1st, I should quit. But what if I do get paid? It won’t change the fact that I’m not qualified."

I began taking classes at community college a couple years ago and just completed my AS in CS with a 4.0 GPA. I've been accepted into the local 4 year college for next semester but I am suffering from sticker shock and the reality that I still have 3+ years left as a part-time adult learner. 

Last semester, with my kids doing virtual school, I had almost no time to work on my portfolio or concentrate on anything else other than cramming for tests. I hardly retained anything I learned. Next semester has the same outlook.

I'm considering deferring or quitting and completing a 1 year certificate in programming (with coordinated internship) at the community college, or even potentially applying to bootcamp. I just want to start working. 

I understand that dropping out of 4 yr school is a waste of money when your young, but I'm old and 7k for 3 classes is literally making me feel nauseous.

Would the combo of my AS, certificate, and portfolio be enough to land me a job? Did anyone else get the AS and change their trajectory with any success?"

Last month, I accepted an internship offer from a company. But, this offer is contingent on my background check and drug screen. Since I am a foreigner, I need to get my SSN to clear myself in the background check. But, right now, the SSA office is closed and I need to make an in-person appointment by phone. It seems I need to wait for one more week to get my SSN. I am afraid that the company will revoke my offer and find another candidate.

Since in the last call with the HR manager, he said my offer was on hold, I was really worried about it. And, I talked to my recruiter and she said she totally understood this situation and might push off my start date. And the start date is within one month.

So my questions are: 

1. Will they find another candidates who could pass the background check soon?
2. Many people told me that offers are at-will, so companies could revoke offers at any time. This scares me, so I was wondering how to make sure I get a firm offer.

Any answers appreciated!"

I am very excited! However, I am also at the final security clearance stage with the federal cybersecurity agency. For security reasons, I don't want to disclose my country but assume it's one of Five Eyes other than the US (i.e. not the NSA but its counterpart). My understanding is that the security clearance is the last step for me as I have already passed the other requirements, and based on what I know about myself, I am almost certain that I will receive an offer.

While I'm grateful to be in this position, I am not sure which one is the better choice for me at this point in my career. This will be my first tech internship. I would appreciate some advice. Here are some pros/cons for each:

Pros/Cons for the cybersecurity internship:

* Pro: It was my dream job when I was younger. Maybe not my dream job anymore (mostly because of the salary compared to careers in the private sector) but still very high in the list.
* Pro: Unique and cool experience. There aren't that many national cybersecurity intelligence agencies one could work at and not many people get this experience.
* Pro: There's a small possibility of deferring to Summer 2022.
* Con: There's a small chance there might never be an offer.
* Con: It will for sure be work from home which is the biggest con for me.
* Con: I don't think I would be allowed to specifically state the agency's name on my resume in the future so that might mask the ""attractiveness"" of the experience for future applications and recruiters.
* Con: I might be mentally hyping up the actual kind of work I will be doing in a SWE/cryptography role at the agency.

&amp;#x200B;

Pros/Cons for the FAANG internship:

* Pro: I think this would be a better stepping stone if I want to get a job in Big Tech post-graduation. Not sure.
* Pro: Much better pay.
* Pro: It's in a different city that I've wanted to visit. And since they pay for housing and relocation, it will be kind of like a free summer vacation. I'm assuming and hoping work from home ends by then but I need to confirm that with the recruiter.
* Con: No possibility of deferral from what I understand.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: formatting

EDIT2: In addition to future career prospects, do one of these jobs have an edge over the other in  in terms of grad school applications to math or CS (MSc or PhD)? That's an option I'm considering for 2022."

My friends who are SWEs say to ""just start applying"", I have a CS degree, ""just go for it.""  I applied to 30 or so software engineer positions and got one interview with a small mid tier company.  I've been doing leetcode steadily along the way.

Here's my analysis paralysis: Do I continue to apply and grind leetcode/CtCi along the way?

I've been scouring the internet about what a reasonable balance of time would be between myself studying as a Civil Engineering undergrad and being an intern as well. I'm currently in my sophomore year and so the connotations to that (to me, at least) are that my classes will be a little more difficult (I'll be taking classes like Differential Equations with Matrix Theory, Mechanics of Materials, etc). That being said, I feel like I'll be dedicating more time to studying than I usually do.

So my main concern is that there's an opportunity for me to apply for an internship - internships have been emphasized a lot to me by advisers and actual engineers alike, so I was hoping to land one during my sophomore year. Before I forget, all my classes considered, I'll be taking 16 credits. Would a 10-20 hour internship be reasonable for me?

Next year I will begin college and pursue a degree in CSB- Computer Science &amp; Business (accredited by both AACSB and ABET) at a non-target. 

Background: I'm not too sure what career I'd want yet, but I am interested in Tech Consultancy, Risk, and FLDP's. I am NOT interested in IB. Big4 recruits heavily at my school, and the middle of the pack grads from my major often work as technology consultants at PWC or EY. I will be going to fall/spring career fairs at my school just to get a feel for interacting in them.

**I want to know what I should do during my freshman year and freshman year summer to set myself up early to apply for internships and/or diversity programs(I'm Hispanic) for my sophomore year summer.**

There are many business/finance/consulting related clubs at my college, so I plan to join many and then stay active in 2 or 3. CSB has a mentorship program so I will be in talks with upperclassmen throughout the year who have a lot of experience within the industry. 

I've read about interning as a freshman in a local PWM or search funds since their requirements are laxer and pay is little. I guess some experience is better than none. Would an experience like this be worthwhile? I will be doing work-study my 1st year but that will probably just be something unrelated like library assistance. 

So basically, things I plan to do my freshman year:

\-keep a high GPA, attend career fairs, talk with upperclassmen in my major with industry experience, join clubs and hopefully have some responsibilities in them, do work-study, and POSSIBLY do a PWM/search fund internship.  

Is there anything else I should do during freshman year to prepare for recruitment for internships in sophomore year summer? Any advice is appreciated, thanks!"
kmlek0,4,2020-12-29,Advice on internship hunting,sat_is_meh,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/kmlek0/advice_on_internship_hunting/,"I know that many of us students are always panicking to find an internship in computer science. That's fine. It's a competitive field, but I'm here to share some insight on what worked for me. Now, the first thing you really need is some projects. They don't have to be very complex, but the point of projects is to help land you an interview because they show your passion for the field (even if you don't actually have a passion for the field). 

The second crucial factor is networking. Going to career fairs and talking to recruiters online or in-person is easier than just sending your resume into the digital void just to be ghosted. Recruiters are more likely to help you get hired if they get to know you better as a person and a developer. 

In my opinion, projects and networking go hand in hand as you need some sort of portfolio to help you get attention from recruiters. When looking at opportunities for an internship or job, make sure that the people you talk to are knowledgeable about what they're doing. If they're not familiar with the technologies that they're hiring for (e.g., MongoDB), then it's probably not a good fit. 

Developing projects can be difficult without practice. If you want to learn how to develop professionally (not just for fun), check out some online tutorials. Here's an example: [https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web/](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web/). The important thing to realize is that projects and networking are both crucial for landing a good internship. They help show your passion and interest in the field, which helps you stand out from other candidates and gives you a slight edge on the competition."

I've been thinking about changing careers to engineering roles such as MLE or AI engineer. I've been doing MS CS part-time and I've been thinking maybe it would be a good idea to quite my full-time position this summer and do an internship in MLE role since I don't have an actual experience as an engineer. The field I'm interested is in CV which I haven't done much at work but I have a handful of personal projects that I've worked on, mainly implementing algorithms from papers and that's why I'm thinking maybe it makes sense to pursue an internship.

I'm thinking

1) Leetcode and interview prep from now to summer / fall

2) Do an internship during the summer, 

3) Look for a full-time position during / after the internship.

Families thought we were young and not ready but were okay with the relationship. I was going to soon graduate to become a teacher, he had an internship at a fancy hotel as a recent graduate from a well-renowned hospitality program in our state. I went to work at a special needs camp where I was treated poorly and was surrounded by an environment of toxic positivity and that I should want to ""do my job for free"" to see the joy on the camper's faces. I enjoyed working with campers but it was a very difficult job for $3/hour. I was miserable and became very bitter that summer. At the same time, my fiancee at the time was finding that his hotel internship was not as glamourous as he thought it would be and was cleaning rooms. He wanted to work the front desk, but realized that in hospitality it is all bout working your way up from the bottom. He also realized that his work did not care for his health and that they let him go for taking too many sick days (he did get sick a lot. He sees a physical therapist now, a lot of it had to do with stress on his body from poor posture and form). He was stressed. Before he was let go, he felt like his career was in question and was miserable. Through the confusion that he never wanted to talk to me about (out of fear that it would freak me out), we were looking at venues, talking about wedding budgets, etc. I even bought a dress. Through all of this, he was stressed because I slowly became a very bitter but self-assured person that he didn't recognize. He felt like he had a lack of control in life, I guess.

This part requires context: before and during all of this, we were waiting until marriage to have sex. At the time, I was nervous to be that vulnerable with anyone else other than my husband. We still would engage in sexual activity, but I was really nervous going all the way with someone that will not be a lifelong partner. He has been supportive and okay with it. At the beginning of our relationship, when I was 19, I was very insecure. I told him I would be okay with an open relationship on his part because I felt as if I was controlling him or I would make him miserable since at the time I was told that no man would ever wait until marriage. He told me no and that he would ""never want to do that with anyone else"".

One night I was beginning to plan things with him. Out of the blue, he told me he wanted an open relationship. Over the years, I became more confident and more self-assured and told him that that was bullshit, bringing back what he said years ago. I was hurt. I took off the ring. I gave him an ultimatum to either stay or leave. He silently left. He later told me that this was not his decision, but because he was so stressed that he had to leave the building and that he couldn't handle it. He didn't expect any of this to happen. He tells me that he was too nervous to actually talk to me and tell me he needed space. He told me that he was stressed about his career, I was becoming different, and that he needed some space to think. He told me (rightfully) that I would immediately take this as him wanting to break up with me. He never wanted the engagement to be on the line. I asked him how he thought and the open relationship would accomplish space and he kinda answers along the lines of ""I figured that you wouldn't want to know about anything like that so it would put some distance between us"". I asked him if he actually wanted the open relationship, and each time he answers with a very genuine-seeming ""no"".

Fast forward a year later:

We are living together (and yes, having sex. Homegirl cannot wait for another few years. This mess is getting ridiculous). We happily cook together and live together in a messy, overfurnished apartment (due to his parents dumping old furniture on us lol). My parents really don't like him (understandably), but also my parents are also toxic and have lots of deep complexes that I am happy to be physically distant from. He changed careers to work in a grocery store, where he works his ass off. He says he does it for me and our future, that he wants to do everything he can to make up for what he did. He is known to work hard at work but it seems like his career progression is going to be very slow. He regrets going to college for hospitality and wishes he just went straight into the grocery store out of high school.

Knowing the context of everything helps. But objectively, sometimes I feel like an idiot. I tell him this. He listens and looks so sad that he hurt me. He said he wishes he just told me how he felt in the past.

I just can't help to feel like I won't really get to have some of the most precious moments that couples enjoy (a proposal, a happy wedding with supportive families) without some feelings of it being the second time or doubt from loved ones. I had to take back the dress. I had to explain everything to the family. I had to even explain everything to people that I barely know around town since I grew up and lived here for my entire life. He moved around a lot as a kid, so he doesn't share this experience.

He is doing the best that he can. I feel materialistic for saying this, but I just wanted happy memories of just a normal proposal and wedding. Facebook advertises me rings and... it feels like something I can't get excited for anymore. I dread the judgment from my very judgemental family (they were judgemental before anything with him, just in general) and my judgemental ""high class"" town. I told him I don't want it to happen for years, and when it does, to not expect me to be happy and excited. I am honestly not looking forward to the first few moments of us being together. I told him this. He just tries not to cry and promises me he will do his best when the time comes. I'm excited about a life with him, but I just feel like the parts where you're supposed to celebrate and be happy with loved ones aren't going to be possible/the same anymore, and I'm frustrated that I have to compromise my dreams of some of the most precious moments in my life. I feel frustrated that I've had to explain myself so many times to judgemental eyes. I don't have him pay for me or treat me like a princess. I just wanted a couple of days to feel special. I guess when I get to the root of it, I feel thrown away still.

I have really tried to forgive him because I know there are only two options: to stay or to leave. My parents are not easy people, but they have a good reason to not like my boyfriend. Part of me knows that they are unlikely to be happy with anyone else, but it's because I know that they have good reason to not like him--that bothers me.

    Part of me wonders if I could be better off with someone who doesn't make a dumbass mistake like this and someone that my parents can like.   

My boyfriend seems to think that parent approval isn't a big deal. I'm not sure--I think it can cause lots of problems in a marriage once they're your kid's grandparents.

What do you all think? I'm excited for a far future with my boyfriend, but I know that the initial engagement and marriage will be really rough. I really need some different perspectives on this. Thank you so much for your time and for trying to help me.

TLDR: Boyfriend and I got engaged. Both of us were miserable at our jobs. He needed space. He remembered back to when I was 19 and said we could have an open relationship on his half since I wanted to wait until marriage. Years later, I thought I was insecure and stupid. Instead of asking for space, he mentioned he wanted an open relationship (thought I would freak out if I asked for space). I gave him an ultimatum, he left the room out of stress since he didn't think he would put then engagement on the line. I took off the ring. Engagement is of but the relationship still survived. A year later, he switched careers and is working hard so that we can build a future together. We are happy together, but my toxic family rightfully does not like him. This bothers me. I feel objectively stupid. It sounds like he made a really sincerely stupid mistake, but this mistake costs me some of the most precious moments that I can no longer look forward to. The advertisements for rings and dresses bring me to tears. He knows this, feels super bad, feels dumb, and recognizes this could have all been prevented if he could talk to me. He was afraid to because I was in a bad place and was very bitter and thought I couldn't handle his doubts about his career and stresses about the engagement without jumping to conclusions. I know my options are to stay or leave but are there any perspectives that can help me come to a decision or any wise words to help me get to the root of the problem that you can offer?"

At first, the company seemed great. They had a payroll system, a corporate bank account, raised pre-seed money, and other stuff. The interview process was rather tough and had a take-home assignment that has to be done in less than 24 hours. I managed to do pretty well and was hired and offered about $4k/mo. It was good money for me since I didn't have much experience (I live in HCOL tho).  
Today, I got a call from my manager saying that they can no longer play me because the quality of my code and speed of delivery is unacceptable. At first, I couldn't believe it. I was working 12 hours/day because the expectations were really high. I made 5 pull requests on tasks that weren't easy at all. My job expected me to know AWS, Apache Kafka, Java, Python, Javascript, SQL. I was not sleeping at night and worked really long hours including Christmas. I understand my code wasn't perfect, and I did make mistakes. I asked for help but they didn't bother to call me and at least explain what exactly needs to be done. They offered me to leave or work for free, what should I do?

Edit: I left this toxic job and I feel better now. It was really hard for me to understand that this is not my fault and I am not a horrible engineer  (imposter syndrome kicked me really hard). Thank you everyone for advice and support!"

Because of covid, currently there are plenty of WFH internships opportunities and I think they are here to stay.

In future, I am considering doing multiple internships at a time to financially support myself and build a long term career from this, something like a free lancer. The more I work on this the more experienced and versatile I'll become, thus qualifying me for more future projects.

WFH will allow me to have down times whenever I need. They can be for medical reasons or any personal endeavour I have taken or to have a work life balance. For eg taking two internships instead of three and working for 5 hours instead of 8.

Secondly, hypothetically a organization likes my work and would give me a WFH job offers. if I'm able to complete assigned work, will it be acceptable to continue doing my internships alongside?

Thirdly, just out of curiosity, is it acceptable to take two WFH jobs when the person is able to manage both of them?"

kmqbnu,2,2020-12-29,A New Life,s3xysocialist,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/kmqbnu/a_new_life/,"I (23 F) just graduated college with a BS in Engineering. While I always imagined graduating college would open new doors, I’ve never felt more lost or hopeless in my entire life. 

Background -
I’m fairly liberal and deeply passionate about sustainability and environmental conservation. I’ve spent most of my life trapped in small Midwestern towns and all I want is to escape. I want to move away to somewhere with more progressive like-minded people. I also have to have a job that I’m passionate about so I need to find a career that will allow me to make meaningful change in the world, ideally in the realm of environmental conservation. 

Despite my passion, I have yet to find any opportunities that fit my interests. Ive gone to a million career fairs and even had internships in the past. Unfortunately the more I learn about the real engineering world, the less interested I become. My inability to find any meaningful opportunities has severely impacted both my mental health and my outlook on my future. 

The point and purpose of life. 

I am not religious, nor do I come from a close-knit family or tight hometown community. For the longest time, I have not had any real home, allegiance or ties to anyone or anything. For most of my life, I have been a free agent. I had always thought that this was a blessing. I had the unique opportunity to go anywhere, and do anything without really leaving anything behind.

However, during my time in college I found a boyfriend and we have been dating for the past 3.5 years. Aside from dealing with my mental health struggles, we have had a great relationship. We love each other very much, and have been more or less inseparable the entire time. Our problem is that we want different things in life. He, being from a small town, has always wanted the traditional lifestyle - get married, buy a house, settle down and have children. He is a few years older and has already found a great job he loves in the nice outskirts of a large city. A place with lots of opportunity that isn’t too far from home. I, on the other hand, have always dreamt of going away, working for a cause, and making a change. I have never really wanted children and I don’t know if I could ever be satisfied settling down so close to home. 

We entered the relationship with the understanding that it probably wouldn’t work out in the long run, but we both liked each other so much that we figured it was worth a shot. He knew I wanted to get out after college, and he had always assumed that his degree could take him anywhere, so he was willing to travel as well.   However now that he’s been at his new job a few years, he’s found that he really enjoys it and doesn’t really want to move. This leaves us with a huge decision to make.

I have two lives laid out in front of me. 
The first, is a happy life with a man I love. Any young women would kill for the life I could so easily have with him. Two engineering salaries, a good neighborhood in a great community with lots of opportunity, not far from home or your alma matter. It’s all there. If I decided to stay I would no doubt have a beautiful engagement ring within the next few years, and a nice beautiful home within 5. The American dream. 

But it’s not my dream.
Despite a loving relationship, I am unhappy and dissatisfied with my life. I always have been. I’ve spent my entire life working hard to finally be able to escape and find a way to change the world. Now I finally have that opportunity but I am so incredibly torn. What if I never find such a career? What if I move away and (in a socially distanced world) struggle to make connections? What if I never end up happy?

My boyfriend and I have recently decided to split up. It was the hardest decision I’ve ever had to make. When it came down to it, I knew that we wanted different things. I felt that I was holding him back from creating the family he wanted, and we both knew that I would never be happy living that kind of life. Despite both agreeing it was probably for the best, ending on good terms was perhaps a million times harder than any bad breakups I’ve experienced. Walking away from someone you love for a new life that’s not garunteed is terrifying. 

I feel like I just threw away the best thing I’ve ever had. Yet at the same time, I know I’ll never be completely satisfied living the life he wants. Am I incredibly naive, throwing away a promised future while chasing a dream life and this illusion of happiness? What is more important, love or purpose? 

What do you think? Is it for the best? Is happiness real? Is the world going to end?  Should I just make the most of it while I can?"

kmsrfb,2,2020-12-29,Graduate in 3 years vs 4 years,Hour-Report-27,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/kmsrfb/graduate_in_3_years_vs_4_years/,"Hi, I’m a freshman at a semi-target university in California. I want to major in business administration, or economics in case I don’t get into business school. I was initially not going to have a minor, but I figured out I would have to take 4-5 electives to fulfill the minimum graduation units anyway, which is almost the same workload as getting a minor. So my major would be either BA or Econ + computer science minor.

As for graduating early, my main reason is to reduce the cost of tuition. I’m an out of state at a public university, so I can’t help myself but feel that I’m at a disadvantage compared to in-state kids. (I lived in CA until I was a high school sophomore too). The opportunity cost of not working for an entire year also comes at a play. I’ve already started investing my savings in the stock market, which means the earlier I start working, the more capital I get to further invest.

Tuition cost per year: $44,600
Room &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; board: $16,000
Personal expenses: $6,000
Annual total: $66,600

Summer session: $2,500-$5,000

(My parents only paid me for my 1st year)
(Returning = resume offline learning)

- 3 years (returning next fall): $66,000 x 2 + $5,000 x 2 = $142,000
- 3 years (not returning until graduation): $44,600 x 2 + $5,000 x 2 = $99,200

- 3 year average: $120,600

- 4 years (returning next fall): $66,000 x 3 = $198,000
- 4 years (not returning until graduation): $44,600 x 3 = $133,800

- 4 year average: $165,900

It is technically possible to graduate in 3 years at my school, given that I earn 90 credits before the fall of 3rd year and attend 2 more semesters as a senior. It would require me to take max units/semester + 2 summer semesters (additional $). This also means a tighter schedule to balance while working in internships. (I heard most financial interns recruit juniors?—will this mean it’s impossible to get a full-time job even if you’re a junior who have graduated already?)

A 3.5 year plan seems to be not worth it due to the ambiguity of applying for a job in winter when not many firms are recruiting.

So it’s either the traditional 4 year undergraduate or a year. Both options have their own benefits and drawbacks. Which one seems more optimal to you?"
kmt3bp,10,2020-12-29,Any CSAs here? What's the best path up to cloud solutions architecture from the desktop support level in 2021?,ShaolinShade,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/kmt3bp/any_csas_here_whats_the_best_path_up_to_cloud/,"I've been working various help desk / desktop support type roles (primarily Windows hardware and software, with some Android and iOS) for the past 7 years, struggling to figure out what I want to do next and specialize in (no degrees or certs at the moment, I spent 2 years studying IT in college before my internship turned into full-time work and I haven't gone back yet). After lots of research into the various roles available, what kind of work they involve etc., I'm pretty sure that I would enjoy doing Cloud Solutions Architecture.

But I have no idea what the best path up to this role is from my current level, especially now coming into 2021. The information I've found looking into it seems to vary across a spectrum - there's a consensus that you need knowledge and/or experience in a number of different areas, and it makes it seem like there's no clear best route into this role from a base IT level. When I first started looking into this at the start of this year, my idea was to get my Net+, Sec+, MCSA, then move into a junior sys admin role, get some experience there while learning a bit of python or JS/node.js, learn cloud formation, and get my AWS solutions architect associate certification, and hopefully be able to land a role in cloud solutions architecture with AWS that way.

But with the MCSA retired, that path isn't an option so much anymore. I've been thinking of maybe switching focus to the Linux side of things instead (so Net+ &gt; Sec+ &gt; Linux+), but the more I learn about CSA roles and requirements the less clear it seems to be just how deep I need to dive into any of these topics in order to move into solutions architecture (preferably, as soon as possible). It seems like getting the aforementioned 3 CompTIA certs is more likely to just end me up in a Linux sys admin role, and I don't necessarily need that experience in order to become a CSA. It seems you just need a base level of knowledge of networking, security, linux, server administration, cloud formation / other software and methodologies used in solutions architecture, and coding supported by the platform (again, likely python or node.js), in order for an AWS solutions architect associate cert to have any chances of landing me a CSA type position.

But what does this mean for me as a desktop support technician? It seems getting certified in any of these areas is likely to just lead me down that specialization path (sys admin seems to move more directly into sys operations on the cloud side, for instance, and coding seems to lead into the dev ops side). Is it possible to just learn the basics of what's needed through the cloud certifications alone? Maybe self teach just enough of the other components (networking, operations, coding and tools) in order to build some cloud projects in a portfolio I could show off to an employer?

Still, jumping straight from desktop support into cloud solutions architecture, regardless of certifications, seems unlikely. So I guess I'm just not really sure what the best next step is. For the moment I'm studying for the Network+ as that's the safest bet on a starting point I can seem to come up with. But I'm not really sure where I'll take it from there.

Any advice or insight is greatly appreciated.

Edit: A couple more things probably worth mentioning:

1) It seems a certain amount of business operations knowledge and experience is also needed along with the broad list of technological abilities. This is another area that I'm not sure how I would go about learning, and how deep I would need to dive into it

2) While my coding knowledge is fundamental at best at the moment (just what little I remember from the coding classes I took in college), I have an idea for an app related to a passion of mine that I would love to develop. From what I can tell, I could use a cross-platform framework to create it after learning Javascript. This seems like it could potentially allow me to gain the knowledge and experience needed to do CSA work without ever working a development position, since I could then use my JS knowledge to learn node.js and then build cloud projects for the portfolio from there, but maybe I'm mistaken"

I don’t know if it’s just me, but everything that I’ve done/found out related to my CS career was through my efforts only.

So, I applied to a good number of universities here in Canada for Computer Science and I received one early offer so far and I'm confident I'll get into all of them (some doubts about Waterloo CS, which if you don't know of, is one of the best CS programs worldwide - hopefully I do!)

I know it's the end of December, and deadlines are literally around the corner, but do you guys think I should apply in the U.S.? It's something I have thought about for a while now but the chaos of applying within Canada first took up some time so I'm just now coming back to it.

Here are a few specific questions I have which I still can't find an answer to:

1. Are there schools that have deadlines later than Jan 1st?
2. Do I need to have my SAT completed already? My guidance counsellors said that we only host the exam in the spring (March), so would that become an issue?
3. Is being a CS student in the U.S. worth the money, distance from home, and change? I hope to be able to pursue a stable career within FAANG companies or ones like TwoSigma straight out of college (after an internship and some experience of course).
4. Do I need to get a reference letter to apply? Or is that only for scholarships?
5. Do you think the pandemic will have any impact on any international student's chances of acceptance? Should I keep this in mind if I apply?

ANY insight would be so appreciated! Please DM me if you have any questions specific to my situation:)"

As of the past 6-12 months, that growth has stagnated.  I've become quite complacent in my position and truthfully, bored.  The same love and passion I once had is no longer existent.  I hate to see myself continue to go to the same job everyday and not feel invested.

I built a great relationship with the owner, who I admire greatly.  However, I no longer am interested in the position and found myself applying to other jobs.  I currently have two job offers on the table and need to make a decision in the next few days or the companies will move on.

Another fear of mine: Mentioning that I want to talk, sitting down to have the conversation, and then regretting it half way through - wishing I could turn back time and not say a damn thing.

Also, another very scary thought is: What if I quit, start my new job, and hate it?  That would make me feel even worse and regret everything.  

Obviously, there are uncertainties related to switching jobs but I never wanted to be in a position where I'm scared to take chances, try new things, and gain new experiences.  However, I hate feeling like I'm in too comfortable of a position and becoming lazy/unmotivated.

The only person in my life that I would talk to regarding an issue like this is my current employer.  I don't have anyone else to bring it up to, so I find myself here asking my next best option.

Anyone have specific examples of something similar or maybe some words of advice/wisdom?  How would you go about this situation?

kn2nkr,0,2020-12-30,My personal rant about about the current state of what it means to be a programmer,Idontknowmyoldpass,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kn2nkr/my_personal_rant_about_about_the_current_state_of/,"Hello,  


This is my experience of being a programmer for the last 5 years. Take of it what you will and I hope your reality doesn't add up with mine but at least where I live this ""journey"" of being a programmer is way too common to leave it up to chance that this is just my bad experience.

  
From when I was an intern (my first job)  
My first job didn't come easy. In fact I would say it was the hardest one to get. I got my first job 2 years into my CS degree after finishing many reputable courses in my country with certificates to back up my skills. I had even made games for Android that were on the APP store and had an active player base albeit small.  The selection process for the internship program was very long in duration and hard in demands. The process involved a one on one interview with a senior programmer from the company about why I want to start working as a programmer, what projects have I done as I was learning etc. The second part was 10 tests. That's right. All on different aspects of programming. QA, Devops, Frontend etc. It might seem weird if you think about it how can they test me on 10 different fields in the programming world? Well here is the catch. They hire you for what they want you to be. In the end even though in the job offer it said back-end developer you could get an offer to be an QA programmer. Very scummy move especially considering this would take you about 3 months worth of your time waiting to get an answer back and maybe putting other offers on hold for the duration only to get an offer like that. In my case I got accepted as an back-end developer so this didn't affect me but it still made me aware how scummy these companies can actually be. After the internship program started they basically wanted us to make an in-house app for them. Almost zero help from anyone at the company. Just a bunch of interns with the task of building them an app they would use later even if they didn't hire us. This lasted 6 months and we managed to finish the app just barely in those 6 months. The internship program started with 10 people. At the end they picked only 5. I have no clue why or how they decided that this was the right move. We all did a lot for this project. If you ask me every single one of us deserved to be hired. I was one of the 5 that got hired. I would quit this company when they basically tricked me into accepting to work for a project that would put me in a QA role because they lacked that type of personal. Again zero respect for my career choices or my desired choice of field in the programming world. In the end of the day they put you where they need you without considering you at all. As a side note overtime was constantly asked of us.  


My second job  
Again the job was advertised for a back-end developer. Well upon me starting my job there I was tasked with front-end work with angular exclusively. Three months later I have no had a single task involving back-end work and at this point I am a front-end programmer practically. The code base I had to work with with such a mess that even if I was the best programmer in the world I would not be able to fix it. This is backed up by the fact that when I left I heard the company dropped this project as everyone that worked on it quit shortly after. Keep in mind this project when I joined had been going on for at least a year. Anyway the takeaway here is that this company basically lied to be. But my only option was to quit. Imagine in how much of a better position the companies that are hiring are than us  the people applying. A company can straight up lie about the job offer and they can't legally be charged with anything. This is of course in terms of the distinction of the different fields of programming.

  
My third job

Same shit a different company. You don't have a concrete field you are going to specialize in. You are going to be a one man show because companies want you to be that. I am writing tests, programming, doing devops work and design. Overtime is again just as normalized as ever. If something doesn't get done it's all the programmers fault even though they agree on impossible deadlines. My first project had a deadline of 2 months for a software that had to process payments, personal data and other high security features. This of course in 2 months including the business analysis and everything else our client can think of that he wants. It was impossible. I feel like they knew too. But the guilt trip they put us on didn't seem like it. And yet again we are forced to work overtime almost constantly and bend to their every whim. People can't even take their paid leave for the holidays.  


All in all my experience of being a programmer is nothing short of slavery. People don't care about you or your career. They don't care about your free time. They don't care about your pay. In the end they will use you until you have no will left and just leave for another company hoping that this time it will be different."

Any tips on prepping for it? Or any experience with this internship interview process to share?

If you've worked as a Solutions Architect (intern or full-time) I would also love to know what the job really looks like and the knowledge required to be good at it.

I usually have to walk down this hall to get to my office. 

One time she look at my direction and quickly look away. I didn't take any notice of this and continue to use this hallway. Several weeks later it dawned on me, sitting there fully expose you, and it's quite difficult not looking straight ahead where she's sitting, she might have thought I was staring at her. Should have taken a detour, to avoid this situation.

Another time where we were alone walking towards each other she kind of looked everywhere except at me, and we awkwardly pass each other without saying a word. But other times where there are more people around, she doesn't look like she's bothered that I'm around. 

Till this moment I have never spoken to her, and it eats me inside knowing that she might think that I'm a creep. Cause I hate being this kind of guy, and if she talked to the other office girls, I might be in trouble. So am I just over analyzing the situation or is she just weird and shy?"

Hope that's okay.

So I am CS Junior, but I've been feeling like I haven't been doing much skill acquisition, like projects or internships. Part of it is due to the fact that I really do not know what subfield or work I should be aiming for, but now is a better time than never to do *something*. I have noticed that I really enjoy classes that get into how computers really work, without having to work too closely with physical hardware. For example, Computer Architecture and Organisation, Assembly Language, Operating Systems, especially C and Linux shell. Basically, low-level without using a microcontroller. 

I do not enjoy programming high-level software that much, like web development or software, though it's something I can deal with if I have to. 

So, first question, **what jobs should I aim for?** I do not know what to look for, for which I can prepare my skillset. I've heard terms like ""Jobs in Linux"" or ""Sysadmin"" or ""Systems Engineering"" but either those terms are vague or I'm not 100% sure it's what I am looking for. I also need to know the terms so that I apply for relevant internships.

Second question, **what should I do to get them?** I am thinking of either using Arch Linux or LFS to educate myself on how Linux works and understanding how an Operating System really works beyond my exam questions. Will that help me? What else should I do?"

kne5p2,24,2020-12-30,How to Pick a Career?,MrSixStrings,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/kne5p2/how_to_pick_a_career/,"Hello! I (23M) think am in a vicious cycle of overthinking and need some help.

So firstly, some background. I grew up in an unstable household, with a father who left when I was 12. Neither of my parents had much education, stable jobs or really any career drive which means I've never had a role model or an adult for advice when growing up. I always imagined myself getting a good, high paying job and supporting my single mother. I was fortunate enough to enjoy school and did well, despite problems at home. I got into one of the top universities in the country (UK) and finished in the top 10% of my class, winning scholarships and awards for achievement along the way. A professor noted my ability and threw a funded PhD in petroleum engineering at me, which I have been doing for the past year and 2 months. All sounds good, right?

Here's the problem. I absolutely hated my undergraduate degree. I nearly quit half-way through, I found most of it boring and it completely put me off a job in that field. I didn't pay any attention to what career I wanted, I would attend lectures and return to my dorm to watch netflix and forget about life. I didn't get any internship experience in the holidays - instead I chose to relax and recover from what I deemed a depressing environment. At the end of it I had no idea what I wanted to do, but the petroleum engineering PhD offer was on a topic I was kind of interested in and the industry links through the professor would be excellent. Having said this, I didn't think I would enjoy it (although I hoped I was wrong). I did it because of the potential job at the end, to buy more time, to be a student for 3 more years and for the title at the end. You can see where this is going...

Yes, I hate the PhD too. I'm not motivated to read on the topic, I'm not excited by any work I produce and my productivity is abysmal because I (literally) prefer to lie on the floor and stare at the ceiling than do work. In a real job I'd have been fired long ago. I feel like I'm being dragged through it by my supervisors. They claim to be happy with my work, but I'm not because I know it's not my best effort. Three months in I brought up that I didn't think it was for me but was persuaded to stay. My mental health has really suffered at times (spontaneous crying is a thing?) and I've felt like I'm drifting the entire time. I've given it a year and I'm still not enjoying it, so it's time to look for a job. I want to leave ASAP as I can't really take much more of the mental ups and downs I currently experience. Covid obviously hasn't helped any of this, but I can't imagine it'd be much different in normal times either.

**Now to the question**: How the hell do you pick a job when you're not sure you'll like it or be good at it?

I've ruled out the fantasy ones that everyone has — I'm not going to be a rockstar or a famous athlete.

I've ruled out those passions that I'm not qualified or suited for — I love animals but can't afford to train as a vet and the remaining jobs are poorly paid. I love health and fitness, but personal training seems unstable as a career and retraining as a physiotherapist is financially unfeasible. I always wanted to be an RAF pilot, but my eyesight is poor.

I thought about what I like doing, and teaching seems appealing as I have enjoyed being a private tutor. But I researched the job and it seems 50% of it isn't actually teaching, most say the work life balance is poor and the pay doesn't reflect the commitment. I like working with numbers and so accounting seems like a reasonable option, but I have no idea whether I would find it boring or if the work/life balance is manageable. I have some ability computer programming, which I could develop further, but it's not enough to be employed without training and in any case I'm not sure I truly enjoy it.

**How have you fully functioning adults managed to navigate this?** Do you just apply for things that seem to suck the least and hope for the best? What if you're not entirely sure you can even do it (programming, in my case)? It seems so hard trying to balance what you like, what you expect your salary to be, where you want to live etc etc. Any clarity is appreciated, thank you if you got this far! :)

I'm trying to avoid higher level classes, since I might get a lower grade and I'm not sure if I want to take intro class for some other major to boost my GPA. Any insights would be appreciated!"

knflma,1,2020-12-30,How do I go about getting letters of recommendation from professors I don't know very well?,PathalogicalObject,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/knflma/how_do_i_go_about_getting_letters_of/,"So, I screwed up badly. I didn't get to know many of my professors very well, I never ended up doing any internships or research. 

My goal for the next year is to get a predoctoral research position in economics. A lot of these programs and openings require letters of recommendation. I realize that I don't know any of my economics professors particularly well. 

I'm not sure what to do. The obvious thing is to simply email some professors asking if they could write me a letter of recommendation. 

One problem is that I'm trying to apply to a variety of programs, and it seems strange to ask these professors to write me a letter for every single one. I also plan on going to graduate school later and feel like I'd need to either bug the same professors again or find some way to re-use the letters they wrote for me. 

I just don't know what to do. I feel so dumb for not just continuing with computer science. It would have made post-graduation plans a lot more straightforward. Instead I decided to switch to math because ""I liked it more."""

I'm a current junior in undergrad (graduating spring 2022) considering applying for a graduate program in Statistics for fall 2022 and was hoping for some feedback and general suggestions based off of my current background and experiences.

Some info about me:

* Math major (3.71 major GPA, 3.84 cumulative) with minors in Stats and Data Science
* Potentially relevant coursework includes Theoretical Linear Algebra (proof-based), Single- and Multi-Variable Real Analysis (proof-based, Math Masters-level), Probability, Statistical Inference, Data Mining, Predictive Analytics, Big Data Analytics (CS Masters-level), Computational Learning Theory (proof-based, CS PhD-level), and another Probability course this upcoming semester (proof-based/measure-theoretic, Math Masters-level)
* 3 independent studies with a grad student mentor in topics of personal interest like Parametric Time Series Analysis, Stochastic Calculus (w/ Financial Applications), and Causal Inference (w/ Applications to ML)
* 2 summers of research (one in HS, one in undergrad) with a Stats professor at a public university
* 1 semester of research at current university with a Stats professor
* Super informative summer internship working in Data Science for a US government regulator
* (Hopefully) interning as a Statistical Analyst or Data Scientist this upcoming summer to gain further experience
* No GRE yet

I’ve really enjoyed my coursework/research in Statistics thus far and would love to pursue it further.  Any and all feedback into what sorts of programs are worth looking into or whether I should pursue a Masters before a PhD (leaning toward the latter) given my current background are really appreciated - thank you!"
kng6yc,66,2020-12-30,The Swamp Rex,BoxGoblin,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/kng6yc/the_swamp_rex/,"My older brother Mark disappeared when I was just seven. The last memory I have of him comes from a lazy Saturday afternoon in the Summer of 2008. He was on our backyard porch with a bunch of his high school friends, eating ice cream cones and arguing about horror movies or something. I don’t know. I never paid much attention to their conversations. But I do remember they were excited about going to their first “real party” later that night. I came outside to give Mark a gift, a charm bracelet I’d made for him from a series of strung-together Lego blocks. “For good luck,” I told him.

Mark looked at the bracelet. I’d scrawled letters on it in Sharpie, one letter per block. Together, they spelled out “Mookie,” my nickname for him since I was a toddler. Mark just laughed and pocketed the bracelet. “Thanks Smelly-Elly,” he said, tousling my hair. I remember yelling at him and growing red-faced. Then I ran back inside. “Don’t call me that,” I yelled. 

Those were the last words I said to my brother. 

Mark and his friends were headed to the Swamp Soiree that night, a tradition at Bartram Forest High School. Each year, a group of popular seniors would throw a big end-of-the-summer bash on the outskirts of the Okeegobee Swamp, a massive wilderness area in North Florida, about an hour from our home in suburban Jacksonville. The Soiree was basically a big kegger with a bonfire where everyone got drunk, smoked pot and hooked up in their cars or, if they were really wasted, in the mud. The area was remote enough that no police ever came by and there were no locals to piss off. The party’s exact location was kept secret, shared only to those “fortunate” enough to be invited. 

Swamp Soirees were known for their lethal amounts of alcohol and drugs. The kids who threw them always came from wealthy families. They brought multiple kegs of Blue Moon or Stella, handles of top shelf liquor, bags of “dank ass weed” and occasionally, cocaine.

Mark and his friends arrived early that night, before most others had shown up. According to his friends, some douchey baseball players pressured him into doing a 20-second keg stand. Shortly afterwards, Mark told his friends he was going to take a piss. “He looked pale and sweaty. Like he was going to throw up,” his friend Eric told me years later. The last time anyone saw him, Mark was stumbling around in the darkened woods, headed deeper into the Okeegobee Swamp. 

Two hours later, his friends drunkenly searched the same wilderness, calling out his name while sinking halfway into the mud. Two days later, my parents searched the area with local law enforcement. Two weeks later, a 400-person search and rescue operation combed the Okeegobee Swamp, equipped with helicopters, jon boats, and multiple foot teams. And two years later, the final official search ended, this time with cadaver dogs. No one ever found anything. It was like Mark had vanished from existence entirely. One moment there was a smart, sci-fi obsessed teenager who wanted to design robots that explored distant planets, get married and raise 3.5 kids while living in Miami. And the next moment… Nothing.

I never participated in an official search for my brother. I was too young. But years later, when I was in college at Florida State, I applied for a summer internship at the Okeegobee National Park, in part to look for anything that might’ve been missed. 

I’d always been interested in the wilderness, even though my parents never let me go camping or hiking after what happened. They wouldn’t even let me play in the woods of our backyard. But that only made me long for such places even more. Mark loved being outdoors. Being in the wild was one of the only ways to keep his spirit alive. One of my earliest memories was of us hiking together on the trails at Guana River State Park. We’d run out ahead of our parents, till it was just us in a wide green world full of sprawling oaks, wide marshes and endless mystery. As kids we fantasized about running away to live in the woods, like a modern-day version of Swiss Family Robinson. We’d never have to go to school. We could stay up as late as we wanted. It would be total freedom. 

When I went in for my interview at the Okeegobee Park headquarters, the head interp ranger George Craig saw my last name and raised his eyebrows. “Ellie Brooks?” 

“I’m the little sister of Mark Brooks,” I said, answering the question that was forming in his bald head. 

“I helped lead the first search party for him,” he explained. “Really sad. I’m very sorry for your loss.”   

“Thanks.” I told him I was using the internship as a way of coping with his loss. 

He hired me on the spot. 

The job was simple enough. Most of it consisted of manning the park museum/gift shop and talking to visitors. They would come in to browse the dioramas on swamp wildlife or peruse books on birdwatching. The park received visitors from all over the country, but most were locals from the nearby town of Oconi (Pop. 604). They were usually older folks who were retired, stopping by day after day just to talk. These locals had all sorts of crazy stories about the Okeegobee Swamp. 

It turned out Oconi was known for two things: its massive paper mill, which gives the area a noxious fart smell when the wind blows North to South. And its town mascot, the infamous Swamp Rex. Oconi sits along the eastern edge of the Okeegobee Swamp. It’s the only human civilization within fifty miles of the wilderness. As such, the town has experienced many unusual animal encounters over the years. Everyone who’s ever owned a swimming pool there found a full-grown alligator floating in it at least once. Water moccasins sometimes coiled up on the town’s roads to catch warmth in the Winter. And locals loved to say how the deer population vastly outnumbered the human one. 

But not all creatures could be explained. Since as far back as 1889, people in the area talked of an eight-foot tall humanoid alligator that roamed the Swamp at night, killing anyone who littered, polluted, or otherwise “disrespected the natural ecosystem.” They called it the Swamp Rex. Most reports stated the creature had glowing green eyes, a long, powerful tail that could break bone and an elongated head full of spear-like crocodilian teeth. The Swamp Rex would hunt at night, then return to its mud hole somewhere deep inside the swamp where no one feared to tread. 

I first learned of the Swamp Rex from my older brother. As a child, Mark was fascinated with cryptozoology, the “study” of unverified creatures like Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster. He used to tell me campfire stories about the Rex when we were little, how it was millions of years old and would travel throughout the swamp via a series of underwater caves. The stories scared the bejesus out of me, but I loved every second of them. He told me once that he wanted to go on an expedition into the heart of the Okeegobee to find the creature. I was the only other person who wanted to go with him. It sounded like the perfect adventure, like something out of my favorite movie, *Jurassic Park*. Mark and I never went on that expedition. He lost interest in “stupid fake monsters” by the time he was a senior in high school. I doubt the Rex was even on his mind when he attended the Swamp Soiree that fateful night. 

Mark never saw the Swamp Rex, but many others have claimed to have seen it over the years. Even though the legend dated back to newspaper articles in the late-1800s, it didn’t really become known until March 1989, when Oconi sugarcane farmer Bill Howard noticed a “tall man” wandering the edge of his property late one Autumn evening. Howard lived on a remote farm on the outskirts of town, right next to the Okeegobee Swamp. “If it was a man, he’d have to walk miles through mighty thick woods to get to my backyard,” Howard told reporters. Keeping his eyes on the figure, the farmer grabbed his 12-gauge shotgun and a camcorder he’d recently got for Christmas. “I knew right away somethin’ wasn’t right about it. It stood like a man, but it had this big tail and it moved with a kinda animal grace,” he said. 

Instead of aiming his gun, Howard raised his camcorder and shot the first known footage of the Swamp Rex. The creature only appeared for five seconds on screen before fleeing deeper into the woods. It was somewhat hard to make out, given the footage was shot from a hundred yards away and during twilight. But even with a low-resolution 1980s-era camera, people could see the figure had a tail and an elongated head, just like the Swamp Rex stories of old. 

Soon afterwards, Bill Howard’s footage aired on the local news and, gradually, spread throughout the country via cryptozoological outlets like the *Weekly World News* and nascent Internet forums on the paranormal. Eventually, the creature made its way into greater pop culture. In the 1990s, the X-Files aired a “Monster of the Week” episode loosely based on the Rex and The History Channel did a special on it for its *Monster Quest* series in 2009. Over time, tourists started showing up in Oconi, hoping to catch a glimpse of the creature themselves. Various gift shops opened, selling all kinds of Swamp Rex merchandise, from T-shirts to mugs to alligator hats, even Swamp Rex IPA Beer. People came from all over the country. Most were skeptics just looking for another wacky Florida story to tell. 

But some were true believers. Many even believed the Rex was involved in real life disappearances tied to the Okeegobee area. Since 1980, over 50 people have gone missing in or around the Swamp, including my older brother. The most famous case happened in the early 1990s when a wealthy land developer named Jerry Flagler vanished after witnesses last saw him in the Okeegobee area with some business partners. “He was going to illegally cut down them trees,” Oconi’s town historian Mary Madrigal told reporters. “But the Rex took ‘em before he could.” Like Mark, the authorities never found Flagler’s body. 

By 2019, when I was working at the Okeegobee National Park, the Swamp Rex had become a vital part of Oconi lore. A cartoon version of it was even featured on the town sign. Though they didn’t know my relation, many of the locals who visited the park would tell me stories about “what really happened to Mark Brooks.” Most of them believed the Swamp Rex took my brother because he was “disrespecting the land” by being at the Swamp Soiree. 

“How come it didn’t take anyone else then?” I would ask innocently. There were at least a hundred other kids at the party on the night of Mark’s disappearance. 

The locals usually didn’t have an answer to that question. Or they’d make up some bullshit excuse like “well… maybe he was the only one littering.” 

*The only drunken high school student who littered? Sure…*

My brother was officially pronounced dead on January 12th, 2012. His cause of death was listed as “probable drowning,” the only theory which seemed reasonable. The area where Mark was last seen had a lot of deep pools of water connected to the Oconi River. Given his level of inebriation at the time, it was easy to assume he’d simply fallen into one such pool (Mark never learned how to swim) and then his body was later washed out to sea via the river, which runs from the Okeegobee Swamp to the Gulf of Mexico. Even though I didn’t believe the Swamp Rex theory (like Mark before me, I’d come to a realization that the “monsters” were always a hoax or a case of mistaken identity) I still couldn’t quite live with the drowning explanation. I needed something more... 

Another part of my job was something called “roving,” where I walked the trails and boardwalks of the Okeegobee National Park, talking to visitors and looking for anything suspect. I did this a few times a week. I didn’t carry a firearm. That was for law enforcement (LE) rangers only, not interp ones and definitely not someone doing a college internship. But I did have a high-powered radio that could contact an LE in case of emergencies. And I always wore a “flat hat” (something you’ve probably seen from many Smokey the Bear ads) so hikers could spot me a mile away. Sometimes they asked about wildlife and the history of the swamp. Most of the time they came to complain about the lack of certain facilities, like trash cans. 

I roved the wilderness of the Okeegobee Swamp for one reason… I was determined to find something, anything… any remnant of my brother’s existence… even if it was just the stupid charm bracelet I’d given him the day he disappeared. I knew all the search parties before me had covered the same ground, but there were still plenty of stories of someone finding clues in the exact same location people had searched years earlier. It was possible. It had to be possible. 

A few months into my job, I was roving the North Boardwalk when I saw something out of the corner of my eye. A flash of movement. It looked like a lanky teenager. The figure dashed into the surrounding cypress trees, disappearing in an area that was usually flooded. I half expected the runaway to sink waist deep in mud, but this was late March and it hadn’t rained in a month. The land was as dry as it would get. And the mysterious individual had moved expertly through it. 

I reached for my radio, planning to call in the incident. “Someone’s gone off the designated trail,” I would’ve said. In most situations, this is something an LE ranger would handle. But something made me put the radio down. A lingering feeling… *That kid… Was it a boy? He almost looked… Mark.* I should’ve taken it as a warning sign. I wish I’d just radioed the LE ranger. 

Instead, I stepped off the boardwalk and started into the woods… 

There was nothing in the area where the figure was headed. My NPS map just showed a blank spot on the northern edge of the swamp. Because of its extreme density and “uninhabitable terrain,” almost half of the Okeegobee is uncharted. Most of its “land” is hidden beneath four feet of murky brown water and another five feet of black muck, too difficult to walk through for a detailed survey. I looked for the kid in the cypress trees ahead, but couldn’t see any movement. I did see the occasional shoe print in the mud however. It looked like a Converse shoe. Definitely not something you’d want in such terrain. The intermittent tracks led deeper and deeper into the swamp. I came across one every ten to twenty yards. 

At one point, I stopped to take a drink from my Nalgene bottle and was shocked to see a full two hours had passed. It was almost 5:00PM. “Shit!” I was supposed to be back at the park headquarters to start closing procedures 30 mins ago. *How was it already 5?* It felt like I’d stepped off the boardwalk only moments before. I started to backtrack. I planned to let an LE know about the lost kid, but first… I needed an excuse for being so late. *Was I helping a lost hiker find his way back to the trailhead? Did I have to clean up a bunch of trash on the boardwalk?* I was about to radio headquarters when I felt my boots slip out from under me and I tumbled down a small muddy hill, my body crashing through a dense thicket of palmetto bushes. Dazed, I struggled to my feet, wiping off as much dirt as I could. My green slacks and gray collared shirt had turned black from muck. My flat hat was crushed. My radio was cracked and unusable. And my cellphone was caked in mud. But as soon as I saw my surroundings, I forgot about everything else…

I was inside a campsite, almost an acre in size. The place was astonishing. It had an old canvas tent, pitched beneath a sprawling live oak, a fire pit, a small garden, a compost station, a dug-out latrine, even a plastic tarp for catching rainwater. A series of large ceramic jars stood by the rain catcher. They looked to be storing water. There was no one around. The tent was empty, but I could tell the site was still inhabited. Everything was well-maintained and the fire pit had some recently burned coals in its center. 

*Who could be living here*, I wondered. *Was it the boy I was chasing?* *Was he hiding in the bushes somewhere nearby, afraid of getting caught?* No. Whoever had been living at the site had been there for years. Perhaps even decades. The camp was surrounded by dense palmetto bushes and a makeshift wall of driftwood. It was so well camouflaged that I realized I had already walked past it before falling down the hill. 

“Hello?” I said, tentatively. There was no response. Cicadas droned from the nearby trees.

I was about to leave when something along the far edge of camp caught my attention. It appeared to be a crude statue carved out of an old tree trunk and decorated with various objects. As I approached, its details came into focus. The statue depicted a humanoid figure with an alligator’s head and a long, muscular tail, clearly meant to be the Swamp Rex. There were various objects around it. Some had been laid at the creature’s feet: a moldy tennis shoe, a broken compass, part of a child’s lunchbox. Others were draped over its body: a baseball cap, a canteen, a golden necklace bearing a cross. They were arrayed in a specific pattern, as if the statue was some kind of a shrine. I crept closer, almost mesmerized by the mysterious display. And that’s when I saw it… A bracelet, made of Lego blocks, hanging around the statue’s left wrist. My breath stopped. All noise faded. I reached out and grabbed the bracelet. The letters were faint, but still legible: 

**M o o k i e**. 

This was the very bracelet I’d given my older brother the day he disappeared. My skin felt prickly with fear and worry. I put the bracelet in my vest pocket, then turned around, looking in all directions: “Mark?”

There was no response. The campsite was perfectly still.

My eyes scanned the tent, the garden, the compost heap, the latrine, the-— A male FIGURE, hidden in shadow, standing at the edge of the woods. Motionless. I gasped. *How long had he been there?* It was too dark to make out the man’s features. *Could it  be…* 

“Mark?” Somehow, I already knew the answer. 

There was a loud hiss. Then, very slowly… the figure stepped into the light: a six foot tall man, mid-to-late 50s, with a muscular frame and scraggly grey hair. A hermit! His wiry body was covered in dirt, mud and bug bites. And he was completely naked. The hermit stared at me with bloodshot eyes, his expression unreadable. *Angry? Scared? Confused?* My stomach wrenched with fear. Every alarm bell in my brain was ringing simultaneously. 

“S-s-s-so-sorry-sorry,” I stammered, backing away with my hands up. “I didn’t mean to… I can leave…”

The hermit opened his cracked lips to reveal rotten, yellowed teeth. He hissed, producing a noise so low and resonant it sounded like a giant snake.

I jumped back, falling on my behind at the foot of the shrine. “No, please…”

But the hermit didn’t attack. Instead, he grabbed something from within the tent. Something BIG. It looked like a pile of clothes. When he brought it out I nearly screamed. It was a suit made of thick reptilian skin. The hermit had stitched together pieces of alligator hide to form a Swamp Rex costume. It had long sleeves that ended in clawed gloves, a hood made from a gator skull, webbed feet, even a tail. The monster suit was ugly as sin but also intricate, terrifying, mesmerizing… The hermit started to put it on. His movements were slow and deliberate, like this was all part of some sort of ritual.  

“What— what are you…?” I crawled backwards, keeping my eyes on him the whole time. My fingers brushed against a piece of driftwood: *A potential weapon?*

The hermit stepped forward, wearing his Swamp Rex suit. He looked like a mutant from the bowels of Hell. The man hissed again, his voice amplified by the gator skull. It was louder, more guttural. 

I grabbed hold of the driftwood piece and stood up. The branch was small, but solid, like a billy club. I raised it up defensively, and Mark’s bracelet fell from my vest pocket. 

The hermit stared at the bracelet and hissed again. He took a step back.  

Cautiously, I picked up the bracelet with my free hand and held it out so the hermit could see it more clearly. It hung loosely from my fingertips. “Where… where did you get this?” 

No response.

“Do you know Mark Brooks?” I asked, trying to sound a bit more confident. 

With his gloved hand, the hermit pointed to the ceramic jars standing beneath the rain catcher. The ones that held water.  

“I don’t understand. Can you-- can you speak?”

The hermit didn’t say anything. He walked over to the jars, his reptilian hands brushing across the top of each one, until… He tipped the last jar over. CRASH! A gallon of slimy liquid poured out, along with a pile of big white sticks… *No. Not sticks…*

BONES!

Inside the jar was a complete HUMAN SKELETON, its bones all mashed together. “Oh F-f-fuck,” I stammered. This was his answer. I was looking at Mark, spilled across the ground like some carnivore’s leftovers. “No. Nonononono.”

HISSSSSSSSSSS! The hermit raised his gloved hands. His eyes shined within the gator skull.  

My whole body shook. Sweat poured down my face. *This was it: The end. I had my answer, and I would pay the ultimate price for it. Until…*

I saw him: The boy who had run from the boardwalk so many hours ago… The one I’d been following. **It was Mark,** still eighteen years old and wearing the same faded jeans and long-sleeved shirt from the night he disappeared. He looked at me, then pointed at something lying against the tent: A SHOTGUN! 

I threw the driftwood at the hermit as hard as I could. Then sprinted for the tent. Five feet, three, two, one. I grabbed the weapon with shaky hands. There was just enough time to turn—

BANG!

Blood splattered my face. The blast threw the hermit backwards. His six-foot tall body fell to the ground with a thud. It all happened so fast, I didn’t even realize I’d pulled the trigger until afterwards. Smoke curled from the barrel of the shotgun. I let out a sharp cry that was half-cough, half-sob. 

The hermit lay motionless a few feet away. I pumped the shotgun a second time as I stepped towards him, finger still on the trigger. 

He never got up.  

Afterwards, I looked all over camp for my Mark’s ghost, calling out his name. But aside from that split-second moment before the attack, I never saw my brother again. To this day, I wonder if I ever saw him at all. Perhaps it was all nerves. Perhaps my brother was just a manifestation of the my intense fear upon meeting the real “Swamp Rex.” Looking back, I’m struck by how similar the hermit’s campsite was to the Swiss Family Robinson-style home Mark and I had imagined we’d live in when we were little. Aside from the obscene shrine and jars of course. 

The police cordoned off the entire site the next day. Aside from Mark, they found the remains of twelve other people, even wealthy land developer Jerry Flagler. News vans came from all over. Word of the Swamp Rex’s discovery spread internationally. Most importantly, our family finally had a proper burial for my brother that provided some much needed closure. My parents and I wept for weeks on end.

So far, the police have not been able to identify the hermit, even after analyzing dental records, completing a DNA profile and sending his picture to various news outlets. There have been numerous theories of course. Some said the hermit was Michael Jenkins, an escaped mental patient who vanished from a South Florida asylum 40 years ago, though the photos didn’t bear much resemblance. Others claimed various serial killers who had never been caught, like the Zodiac. Some even believed the hermit was planted by the Federal government to cover up the existence of the real creature. But no one came forward with any solid evidence. Nothing verifiable. The hermit has remained as mysterious as the swamp creature he had pretended to be for so many years.

I’ve since moved clear across the country. I currently reside in the vast metropolis of Los Angeles. I don’t go hiking anymore. I never go camping. I hardly ever even leave the house. But each night I dream… I dream that I’m still deep in that swamp, alone in my cold, reptilian skin. I am the hermit. And the thing that worries me the most… I enjoy it."

Although I love problem solving, I seem to be stuck on an issue.

Background:

I have a bachelor's in Mathematics from a very small university. I went to grad school for Applied math at a larger University but was not ever able to get an internship or any position what-so-ever with Mathematics. Furthermore, I wasn't able to get funding and ended up working construction. Later this led to many unfortunate events: eventually being homeless, not finishing my master's and ending up at my grandma's house. I did however, get a bit of good luck with getting a development position within the construction company that I had worked for. Developing an app, Rest api and database for them, albeit at less pay than what an internship would give me.

Current topic of discussion:

Now that the job market is terrible, I need a job. However, I find it hard to believe that I (a person with a year of job experience in programming) could get one. So, I'm looking into going back for a master's but this time in Computer Science or Data Science.

knh7ca,681,2020-12-30,"India isn't as bad as Reddit makes it out to be, stereotypes you know?",BelugaOneSturgeonII,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/knh7ca/india_isnt_as_bad_as_reddit_makes_it_out_to_be/,"First off, I'm Indian, and don't downvote this to oblivion just because this is something about India that isn't negative, I find that petty, thank you nice people.

I've seen a lot of hate about India on Reddit, too much, I've seen people say downright racist things like:

""Indians are absolutely gross, ew.""

""India is a shit landfill, case closed, that's all there is to it.

Etc.

And they get loads of upvotes and even fucking awards, so I'm like, ""How do people find this racist shit funny?"" so now I'll be explaining why India isn't all that bad and also debunk some stereotypes, strap up.

Stereotype #1: India is filled with slums like a landfill.

India isn't COMPLETELY filled with slums, cities like Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, and Kolkata, albeit having some slums, also have huge suburbs and high rise buildings to cope with the overpopulation, and planned cities that are still being built like Navi Mumbai and Noida are allowing slum-dwellers to move into houses and pay low rent, besides, try having your country being invaded by the Persians and colonized by the British.

Stereotype #2: Indians shit in the street.

There are already toilets in India, about 86% of Indians have toilet coverage, of course, that's good but also not good since it's not 100% like other countries such as the USA, Canada, or Switzerland, etc..., so India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi signed a 20 billion US dollar deal to build 111 million new toilets.

[World's biggest toilet building spree is starting in India.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-30/world-s-biggest-toilet-building-spree-is-a-windfall-in-india)

Besides, people go to the bathroom on the street in other countries too, some being: Benin, Togo, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Eritrea, Sudan, South Sudan, USA, and Chad.

Stereotype #3: Indians worship cows as gods and they're all vegan.

No, nope, don't think so, nada, nobody in India WORSHIPS cows as GODS, but more as just, a sacred animal, and besides in South Indian states, people are way more lenient and you can actually eat beef there, besides, there's a tribe in Ethiopia that REALLY worships cows, even sleep under them, and Norwegian mythology has some cow gods.

Stereotype #4: Indians rape women as part of their ""rape culture,"" and make kids marry young.

According to a report by UNICEF, Indian child marriages have halved over the past years, and hell no, you can't just rape a girl and get away with no suspicions or charges, in Lucknow, a guy was beaten to unconsciousness for having suspicions of raping a girl, he was then taken to the police all bloodied up, where THEY took him to the hospital, and then straight to the cellar, also, in Delhi, 4 men raped a younger intern girl so brutally, she died and sustained numerous other injuries, like being hit with a stick and having her organs be visible partially, they made a lot of pleas to the government with no avail, and the 4 men were hanged, (Yes India still uses hanging, but so does the USA and Saudi Arabia).

Now time to explain good sides of India.

\- India has a powerful army, and is a nuclear nation, with a nuclear triad (nuclear weapons able to be launched from submarines/ships, planes, and land vehicle artillery).

\- India pulled 271 million people out of poverty in 10 years, and 6 people are being pulled out of extreme poverty every minute in India.

\- India's population will stabilize and see some slight decreases around 2022.

\- India VERY recently legalized gay and lesbian marriage, and recognized transgender people, overruling a British colonial law illegalizing LGBTQ+, not because of overpopulation, but because of mass protesting and riots, which have now died down after the passing of the bill.

\-Finally, India is one of the few nations with a GDP of over a trillion US dollars.

Seriously, don't downvote this because this is something about India that's not bad, that's very petty.

Thank you for your priceless attention.

knico5,91,2020-12-30,Some advice for you,eitherorsayyes,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/knico5/some_advice_for_you/,"I have been recruiting for 5-6 years now. If you have interview questions, feel free to ask me and I’ll try to give you my take on it.

Here’s some items to think about:

1) Show up on time for a call, ready, and prepared.

You can do this by setting an alarm on your phone 5 minutes before a call, or however long it takes you to get to a quiet place (just practice the distance it’ll take and the steps you need to pair your headset). If someone is calling you at 2:00pm, be ready to pick up the phone. 

Say Hi! This is Name! 

Before all of this, write down on a cue card 5 things this company does:

1 - Make absolutely sure you know the site name and copy down their tag line. 

2 - Figure out their “product” so to speak. Why are they in business? Is it a service? Is it software? Hardware? What do they do - functionally.

3 - Figure out 1 news article about them, watch or read it, and summarize the “pain” point in your own words. It can be on their YouTube, own website articles, or other news articles. Find anything, even media if there’s nothing “news” worthy.

4 - Figure out where they are located. Why they are hiring at that location.

5 - Write down a simple summary of what 1 issue they have that you can solve.

2) Tell me about yourself in under 2 minutes. Don’t rant, ramble, be unclear. 

Think elevator speech. Think of your audience. Some thoughts on what to say... 

1 - I am currently at x-job, and at a high-level, I am doing 1-3 functions. I started this job looking to accomplish 1-3 goals. At this point in time, I have reflected on my development and growth and found that more opportunities lie external to the organization. I am looking to expand on my path by doing 4th-7th goals, and become next position.

2 - I graduated from x-school on x-month, and I had set my sights on x- role out of college. I was an intern at company/I started an organization which introduced me to real world experiences that I have been excited to expand on. While there is a gap between my graduation and today, I have been carefully looking for a company that will accelerate my growth to become x-position. 

3 - I was part of a restructuring because my industry took a dive/I was informed of a future layoff/I saw blood in the streets and saw the writings on the wall/My company laid off floors of personnel/I lost my job due to high-level decisions by management to reduce cash burn, and they had shrank headcount. I am excited to turn a new leaf over and start another job where I can deliver 1-3 impacts that I know is highly sought after in other flourishing industries such as x-industry that you are in.

These all start somewhere, don’t blame Covid per se, is honest, and shows your skills, desires, what you can put on the table, and takes 1-2 minutes to say. That’s an about you that you want to leave your recruiter knowing.

3) Why do you want to work for us?

This is tricky.

Best answer? Look up CEO LinkedIn profiles. They have something in common besides branding products or laurels. Look for the more honest ones and craft your answer like that.

1 - Company culture is important to me. The more I find out about your x-company, the more I find that it’s a fit that I love! I take pride in my work, whether it’s something small that no one asked me to do to something visible that everyone has eyes on. I want to make an impact! Because I value doing the best work of my life, it comes off easy and natural for me to meet goals and exceed them.

2 - The unique skill I posses is enlarging others, so I can deliver results by building instant rapport with diverse groups of people. I love  getting people excited about work through difficult and complex challenges. I want the opportunities to navigate experts to win and deliver financial and operational results.

These answers show the interviewer more about the big picture, but also leaves them with your last sentence to them. It’s that transition and feeling you get from talking to someone that you just met, and it’s the final impression you get to make. You don’t need to repeat anything you’ve said in your interview. It’s more about building a relationship with a potential stranger than anything.

Focus on: Why you validate that you are more than “okay” to work here. Divulge something you are motivated by, and what you see from your research and interview/s so far.

Simply: “I want to work here because I am looking for money” doesn’t cut it. I am good at sales and believe in the potential of your product to the x-location market I would be responsible for. I can speak the language the x-audience uses/tech/retail/etc. and I set clear goals to continuously improve everyday. I meet and exceed my quotas because I am a hunter, and I am looking for bigger fish to fry."
kniibu,12,2020-12-30,Lost longhorn in need of some advice,JayyyDaGreat,UTAustin,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/kniibu/lost_longhorn_in_need_of_some_advice/,"This will be kinda long so I understand if it gets ignored. I've debated reaching out on here for awhile but I don't see how it could be too harmful. Anyways I've been at UT for over 2 years and in that time I realized I no longer want to do pre pharmacy. It was something my parents forced me to pursue and they directly influenced my career path. I wouldn't say I felt incapable of the classes but the lack of motivation stemming from doing something I had no passion for took a toll on me mentally. Being bogged down by science classes and shit I didn't care about instead of studying what would make me happy has really sucked. I had to enter therapy, my GPA is awful and I've had to drop classes/withdraw from 2 semesters now. Covid and the online learning environment has been rough. I should be a junior knowing what the fuck is going on but I'm still classied as a sophomore trying to begin again. I felt pretty useless and suicidal because it seemed like I messed my life up. I know college isn't a race but it's discouraging realizing I won't graduate in 2022 like I'm ""supposed to"". My passion involves being around tech and computers, I don't know what specifically but in middle through high school I enjoyed the principles tech classes, animation, doing graphic design. I was in an engineering program as well but I wasn't too into it (or moreso Cockrell intimidated me) I've had several discussions with my advisors and I wish I took action sooner. If I could go back to 2018 and pick another major it would've been Computer Science or eventually AET. These are no longer options because of my GPA and I've passed the 4 semester restriction. Apparently the closest thing to computer science I can study here is computational biology and I've already aligned myself with that for the upcoming semester. My fear is not being prepared for the programming and coding jobs that people with a CS degree will have. How will I get a job, what's the route? I'm wondering if anyone here who's graduated with a comp biology degree has had success with software development jobs, etc and how they went about obtaining this. I don't know where to begin teaching myself or how I'd land an internship. I saw a similar post from someone on here with a similar situation and I'm asking what you would do if you were me. I missed the window to transfer to Texas State where getting into CS should be easier, I'm on the fence. I want to succeed here at UT. My parents aren't too helpful obviously and they don't help financially so Im working so much to pay rent at an overpriced west campus apartment instead of focusing on school but ironically I'm not learning what I want. I'm so sorry for this mess of a post, just hoping I can get some advice."
knioiz,4,2020-12-30,Pass/Fail,Patrickk2323,Concordia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Concordia/comments/knioiz/passfail/,"I’m in actuarial mathematics at Concordia and my lowest mark out of 4 classes is a C in cal 3 Math 264. If I pass/fail it I would have a gpa of 3.0 instead of 2.75. If I don’t then I stay with my 2.75. Both in my opinion aren’t very good and I have to definitely improve but is it even worth using the passing/failing option since were allowed up to 1 class. Only thing I’m afraid of is that for my program we have to find an internship on our own to gain experience on the field and I’m not in co-op. However, does passing/failing a course affect the company on making a decision between me and another student for example. Also, by using the option do the people interviewing you can see on your transcript that you have passed/failed a class. In your opinions what should I do, simply leave it at that or just pass the course and get the higher gpa of 3.0? Also this is my very first semester in university. I’m going into my second semester so I know that I have time to improve but I just wanted to know what would be best and how does it work exaclty this new option

knj30h,11,2020-12-30,PayPal Interview Process,blackunicorn2000,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/knj30h/paypal_interview_process/,"Hey everyone,

I applied for SWE intern at PayPal, and they reached out to me saying they want to interview me for the Data Quality/Data Analyst intern role. The first interview will be 30 min long, and It will be technical. I was wondering if anyone could let me know how the PayPal interview process is, and if you interviewed for this position, any tips/advice? How many interviews are there for PayPal? It went straight to the technical one so I am curious. If anyone could let me know, that would be great! Thanks in advance!"
knj31q,396,2020-12-30,Unpopular opinion: CTCI and all that prep actually makes you a better problem solver,Clark106,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/knj31q/unpopular_opinion_ctci_and_all_that_prep_actually/,"I definitely do not jump at the idea of prepping for technical interviews, but I think that learning the skill has taught me some useful lessons. I consider my self a relatively thoughtful coder/problem solver but I was getting pretty discouraged after spending almost an hour on LeetCode easy problems. After a lot of practice and reading CTCI I feel a lot more confident.

I think going through the process has taught me:

1. not to kid my self and start coding before I really understand the problem and my solution. Basically through a lot more whiteboarding style problem solving first
2. write nice pseudocode to plan out the coding process before coding
3. write very modular code

I caught myself doing these things, that I didn't always do before my interview prep when I was working on some problems for my winter internship. So that's my hot take. Does anyone else feel similarly?

Note: so far I haven't found the skill of talking/explaining my thoughts while coding to be super useful yet but who knows."

knjnj5,8,2020-12-31,Database structure (SQL) and DAO's - what's the go.,TheVoidHasHadEnough,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/knjnj5/database_structure_sql_and_daos_whats_the_go/,"I'm working on a platform designed by someone else which has an API that talks to a Postgres db. For simplicity's sake, let's say we are storing inventory items for a store.

In the current setup, there are a whole bunch of dao's and models in the code (.net based) and in the database, if you were writing an inventory item, the row contains a json field where the item particulars are written and a field to record under which data model this data conforms and another for version.

There are several things I don't like about this

- The code is full of abstractions and interfaces and is difficult to follow

- If another module/microservice needs to be created, all of this DAO code needs to be replicated. Obviously a complex task and easily spirals out of control 

- Other devs creating other services that write to the same db have to adhere strictly to the DAO rules in their code and it has to match the current version. 

- Someone not following the rules properly can insert malformed data into the database

The only advantage I can see of this method at all is that the database itself is more flexible to changes in the data model, like if we want to add or remove a recorded attribute of a product.

What makes more sense to me though is to have the database be strictly defined with specific fields, types, not nullable, cross referencing etc so that the database schema is the ONLY source of truth and it doesn't matter what anyone does in the code because the db will simply not accept malformed data. You can let your intern have a go at it all they want and they just won't be able to add bad data to it. You can do away with ALL the code overhead and just have a simple insert statement. More services can be added which use the same db without any extra technical debt.
But again, the flaw I see with this method is what do you do when you want to change the db? If you want to add a field, then fine and you can set that to some default on old records without it. If you want to remove a field, then you don't have a legacy record of that old data.

So I am quite clearly in favour of the latter implementation. Are there compelling reasons for/against each method and if I do use the latter, how are changes to the data model handeled under such implementations?"

knl4jw,3,2020-12-31,Want to change career path from Engineering to commercial airline pilot.,TinkerCube,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/knl4jw/want_to_change_career_path_from_engineering_to/,"I am a 21 y/o male in Canada, and I am half way through the engineering program. I have done 50% of my required courses, two internships, and I've already graduated with a unique 3-year Bachelor's degree. I've basically breezed through the engineering program so far, even having gotten the highest grade point average out of the entire department in my first year. On top of that, I have many engineering-related extra-curriculars and some of my previous projects have impressed my professors to the point that they say that I will ""do great things"". 

The problem is while I'm very technically inclined, I'm not sure if I actually WANT to be an engineer. I know it might sound stupid, because for many people, Engineering is probably somewhat of a dream job. High pay with lots of room for career advancement, and the ability to make an actual difference. But I realize now that when I signed up to do engineering, I was so obsessed with proving whether or not I was capable of completing this noctoriously difficult program rather than what I would actually enjoy doing with my life. 

So far I hated both of my internships (One in manufacturing and the other in design), and I wouldn't go back to either of them. I think I just despise the corporate office environment in general, constantly trying to get approval from incompetent management. More often than not engineering work is poorly defined, and it seems as though you often have to work on things that you do not fully understand or have real experience with. Sometimes there are roadblocks in projects that are impossible to pass and you have zero control over, and yet you are penalized for not resolving them. 

At my last internship I got mediocre reviews, even though I had done everything that was asked and the only reason I was't able to complete all of my projects was because of corporate BS. My scored ""excellently"" in my ability to quickly learn and to problem solve, but only moderately for things like communication and my ability to follow-through (the communications one is fair because I had take the lead on a few team meetings, and presenting to a lot of people is not my strong suit).

As a result of all of this, I have started exploring other career options, focusing on job interest rather than pay. I've come to realize that work takes up a lot of your life, so it's better to do something that you at least moderately enjoy. I've been thinking about getting out for at least a year now, but this is the first time that I'm actually serious about it. It's a tough decision because I'm now only 2.5 years away from graduating as an Engineer, but the fact that I already have a Bachelor's Degree makes it less bad. 

I have recently been looking into Aviation - someday I think I'd like to be a pilot for a commercial airline. I realize that this can be high-stress and odd hours, but those aren't deal-breakers for me personally given all of the pros. Not to mention the fact that the path to getting this job is very narrow. It seems like there are only two viable ways to obtain this position, and neither are very easy. Option 1 is that I spend tens of thousands of dollars at flight school, only to come out of it with no job prospects and a huge loan until I find a way to log my 1500 flight hours, which would probably take years to do at very little pay, if any. Option 2 is to join the Canadian Air Force and complete 10(?) years of service in transportation or something like that before becoming an airline pilot. 

The good thing is that I'm in a great financial situation: Because of my scholarships and work I have actually net about $10000 during school, which is better than most of my peers who are in debt. So if I need to take out a loan or whatever, it wouldn't be an issue (until I had to pay it back, that is). My bachelor's degree will also help me if I'm going to join the military, and also most commercial airlines require you to have one if you're going to become a pilot. 

To do either option, I would probably try to take a leave of absence from school rather than quit completely to make sure that this is actually what I want to do, and I'd hopefully (if possible) carry on with my program until the end of August, so that I'd be able to try out one more Engineering internship before making my decision. I'm just scared to take this leap, because engineering has been my goal for so long now, and I'm now going to completely derail that. 

Does anyone have any thoughts or advice that could help me?"

What should I do?,homeskilletsam,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/knml9z/im_a_new_grad_whos_been_at_a_company_for_about_5/,"Hi everyone. I've been struggling a lot lately with my job. I graduated with a CS degree this past May. I now work as a Full Stack Engineer. To be brief, I hate my job/the company I work for.

I've only been there for 5 months but within those 5 months, I have been on **4 different teams**. This isn't because my managers are unimpressed with my work or because I'm in a rotational program. All engineers in my department switch around very frequently. Because of this, I feel like I'm not learning anything and that I never know what I'm doing. I wanted my first-full time job to help to build me as an engineer but I can't do that when I'm consistently moving around and having to learn a new code base every month. Another big issue I have with this job is that we work in a paired programming environment. I'm somewhat of an introvert so having to make 8 hours' worth of small talk every single day is somewhat draining. I knew this going in but I didn't think it was going to be as big of a deal as it actually is now. Finally, I'm slowly realizing I don't like full-stack work as much as I thought I did. I've only done full-stack work once before getting this job and it was during a part-time internship. Working on it on a much larger scale is not like I thought it would be.

I didn't want my first full-time job to be like this. I've honestly wanted to quit every single day for the past month or two. So my big question is, what do I do? I'm scared that it will be hard to switch jobs with only 5 months of experience since typically you should stay at a company for a year before you switch jobs. Also, I've been glancing at jobs on LinkedIn/Indeed and I feel like most jobs I see are for at least SWE II or New Grad. I'm unsure if I even count as a new grad anymore since I've had some experience now. Does anyone know if I still qualify for new grad roles?

Any tips or thoughts on the matter are greatly appreciated, thanks\~

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr I graduated in May, I hate my job now but it's only been 5 months. Should I quit? If I do, am I still a new grad or what kind of roles should I apply for?

P.S. I work/live in the US if that in anyway changes your thoughts on the matter"

knqsic,433,2020-12-31,We are trapped in an underwater facility surrounded by the mist. Atlantis is real and it is not what you think it is.,ItsMeRoyale,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/knqsic/we_are_trapped_in_an_underwater_facility/,"We are currently trapped in a covert underwater facility, miles under sea level. Our location has been compromised by the mist.

Two of my coworkers have attempted to contact the rescue team as I type this transcript out, in the hope that people out there will see this.

You might be wondering how I walked into this dreadful situation. I was promoted as a field agent after attending an internship at a company called *CrypTech* *Corporations*. I was then assigned to an exploration group on my first project, code-named “Atlantis.” I was very skeptical at first but when they showed me the seismic data and the coordinates, my heart excitedly skipped a beat.

I was a fan of the outdoors and, when I realized that this would be my sole opportunity to uncover a location deemed as a myth within the walls of history, I decided to take the chance.

Following many hours of travel by boat, we arrived at the underwater station hidden skillfully under a mini-oil rig, to obtain our gear and then embarked on the way to the coordinates of Atlantis. My expedition group consisted of Tim and Drake, divers who passed the same programs I had gone through. At the launch site, once the briefing had finished, we prepared for descent while the command group attached a filament line to the submarine.

The tech sub was capable of withstanding very high pressure, courtesy of the privately funded institute. Within a few minutes, we had swiftly descended into the depths while I made sure that the attached tether held up. The strength of the sunbeams deteriorated as we descended further, but we knew that there would be just enough left to accurately view our surroundings.

I guided the sub towards the altitude coordinates, and before long, Atlantis emerged into view. I half-expected the city to be full of colors, with towering structures that depicted its lost inhabitants. Though, what sat in front of me resembled more of a shipwreck on a larger scale. Plantlife plagued every corner of the seafloor and barely visible, dilapidated buildings were scattered in a circular formation – surrounding a significantly-sized, fallen mortar head that sat upright in the sand, its mouth hanging open.

We all cheered and congratulated each other before Tim and Drake exited the sub with their special scuba gear. My suit’s pressure valve did not function properly for some reason and someone had to man the sub anyway, so I stayed behind to monitor communications and gather data with the built-in machinery.

Moments later, I saw Tim split up to examine some of the exterior buildings while Drake swam to the mouth of the statue. Both of them had cameras imprinted into their suits and their first-person perspectives appeared on my station panel. Minutes later, they both faded out of sight.

Tim’s voice then came over the comms.

*Delta 1 has arrived at the statue’s mouth, turning flashlight on. It seems to stretch back quite far. I’m heading in to examine, over.*

“Copy that, Delta 1.” I relayed the info to control and eyed the visuals. I witnessed Tim edging his way into the tunnel, the flashlight hovering over countless crevices as bubbles floated away with every breath release. So far, no sign of life.

“Delta 2, what about you?”

*I don’t see anything significant, Alpha sub. Most of the buildings here are completely barren or caved in. There are some markings on the walls, but they are indecipherable. I’ll check the other ones.*

“Roger that, Delta 2. Keep searching, you guys are doing well.”

Like Drake had reported, I saw the markings through his perspective, embedded into the wall of one of the structures. Although most of it was impossible to understand, the last part of the symbols depicted a human-like figure throwing a trident at numerous ovals. A plethora of carved squiggles emanated from the elongated objects and I pondered what they may have stood for.

As if to answer my thought, Tim’s muted voice came on the comms again.

*This is Delta 1, you need to see this, Alpha sub.*

I stared at Tim’s POV and my eyes went wide. Tim hovered still. Surrounding him on every side were glowing orbs, all protruding out of enormous fissures in a magnificent canyon landscape. They were lined in various, intricate formations, but they all lead up to the center of the long valley, towards a bright source of light in the distance that I could not perceive due to the camera’s murky quality.

“I’ve never seen anything like this in my life, Delta 1. I’m… speechless. We definitely have to show this to control, all these orbs…they remind me of—”

I stopped mid-sentence. The realization had hit me square in the face. These were not orbs, no, these were eggs. My mind flashed back to the markings Drake had momentarily shown me.

“Delta 1, you need to get out of there! Get back to the sub, now!”

*Roger, Alpha sub. What’s going on?*

“Those are eggs, Delta 1. They coincide with markings Delta 2 stumbled upon near the buildings. I’ll explain it in detail, but you need to return ASAP!”

I switched over to Drake’s comms.

“Delta 2. Evacuate the area! You may be in danger, over!”

Drake’s response was an ear-piercing clatter of static.

“Delta 2, this is Alpha sub. Please respond. Drake, can you hear me?”

I looked at his visual. I could tell he was moving but the screen was evolving into a distorted mess. I looked at his suit data, noticing a “critical damage” icon near the camera symbol.

“Drake, if you can hear me, please get back to the sub now!”

Just when I had finished with my late warning, Drake’s screen instantly went blank, all the functions of his suit flashing red accompanied by several beeps.

“Drake? Delta 2? Respond Delta 2!”

I was met with complete silence, save for the echo of the static.

“Delta 1, are you almost back? I’ve lost all contact with Delta 2.”

His worrying tone answered almost immediately. *Almost there, Alpha.*

My heart raced as I struggled to re-establish the connection with Drake. All my efforts were futile, so I quickly relayed the grave news back to the control group. They advised me to initiate the sub for resurfacing and to secure Tim on board. They seemed even more nervous.

I established the panel commands and surveyed the surroundings to see Tim swimming toward me yards away, a flurry of bubbles surging past him due to heavy inhalation.

“I have visual, Tim. Coming to you.”

I directed the sub forward, the contraption igniting to life, and steered it towards Tim. I was beginning to feel a small sense of relief the closer I approached him, knowing that he would at least be alright.

But Tim never reached the sub in time.

A sudden wave of dark mist struck into him from the side. Whatever was in it moved at a speed I could not comprehend, screeching violently in the process. The creature, which I could vaguely discern, appeared to be about six feet long and utilized the mist as its façade. Spiny, sharp legs slashed through the haze but quickly retracted into the fog before flickering away.

The tainted smog encompassed Tim for some brief seconds before it altered into an ominous shade of red. Once it dissipated fully, I saw his body floating lifelessly in its place, his mask filling up with a mixture of blood and water. His oxygen tube had been shattered open and a crater--the diameter of a log—rested on his chest, spilling all of his shredded innards out.

I dry heaved at the drifting carnage, a sight that I may never be able to cleanse from memory. In my panic, I managed to sputter a few words back to the control center. The line attached to the sub went rigid and hauled the machine to the surface. I stared forward in severe shock, not solely at Tim’s body, but at the armada of moving mist that began to grow behind him.

\-

We rushed back to the facility, oblivious of the fact that the creatures had followed us.

The mist has blocked all of the windows now and I cannot help but notice that the reinforced glass has started to crack. We had enough time to report to mission control and we are unsure how far the rescue team is from our location.

The lights have flickered on and off several times and the screeches from outside have gotten louder. Angrier. These creatures want in and they sound relentless.

I have uploaded this post to all of the online databases. The other workers have suggested operating one of the backup vessels to outrun the horde. That may be our only chance.

To whoever is reading this transcript, please do not search for Atlantis. It is most certainly not what you think it is. Because whatever is breeding down there is the true origin of that entire city’s demise.

* Why I want an MBA: My passion has always been public service through the lens of public policy. I'd like to do a dual degree for this (likely MPP/MBA or JD/MBA or an internationally focused MIA/MBA) as I would like some job security and mobility between the public and private sectors. Specifically, for post-MBA I'd like to get into consulting for public policy or strategy within the public/non-profit sectors. MBB would obviously be nice, but I'm not married to a brand. Getting a gig with Bridgespan or Dalberg would be great. This is currently my post-grad goal regardless of whether an MBA is right for me or not. Another career path that would be very fulfilling would be working for a Federal Agency in a policy analyzing or policy creating role. I had this goal coming out of UG, but struggled initially to find employment (an experience I never want to repeat) and I want to have some sort of degree/certification that helps me in pursuing my passion by providing the skillset/analytical aspects of an MBA, while also allowing me for some career flexibility.
   * NOTE: Job security and career flexibility are important for me.
* Why I want one now: TBH, I'm considering putting my nose down and grinding out another year or two in my current role. I do Operations/Tech Consulting for a Top 3 bank in the world in terms of AUM. The consulting that I do is specifically for Economic/Risk Analysis and would fall under the ""FinTech"" category. While this is lucrative and somewhat prestigious due to my employer's reputation in the industry as a leader, it is unfulfilling. I don't have the same ambition or energy that I did when I worked for the UN. I'm currently being recruited by a big four company for public sector tech consulting (software implementation, likely workday) in a similar role, which is unappealing to me because it is not policy/strategy focused consulting and more operational focused consulting. (Open to opinions on whether I should pursue this more fervently if you think it will help my apps)
* Target schools:
   * Reach: **Wharton**, CBS
   * Target: **Tuck**, Darden, Ross
   * Safety: McDonough
   * Note: All of these schools have integrated MBA/MPP or MBA/JD or MBA/MIA programs. Wharton and Tuck are through HKS (These two programs are my top 2 because of this), Darden is with Hopkins, CBS/SIPA, Ross and Ford, McDonough and the MSFS program.
   * For reference, MPP programs are not as competitive as MBAs. I wouldn't argue with anyone telling me that I'm not HSW material. That said, averages for accepted students into HKS is 80% test scores (a 321 GRE) so keep that in mind while evaluating me here. Additionally, I checked the class profiles, and even for HSW I wouldn't be a statistical anomaly, on the surface at least.

**Background**

* Work experience:
   * UN Diplomatic Intern 6 months (worked in UN Security Council, attended a lot of high-level classified briefings and negotiations)
   * UN Congressional Intern 11 months: worked part-time during the school year and full-time in the summers and breaks.
   * Internships in Finance 1 year: Started to branch out into private sector after Trump's election and subsequent cuts to entry-level Federal roles.

* Extra curriculars and other experience:
   * Volunteer 10 hours a week or so with a local Habitat for Humanity chapter. This has been going on about a year or so. I was nominated this year for Volunteer of the Year, let's hope I win! A Board Member will be authoring one of my LORs and speaking highly of my contributions here. I think this also pairs well with my UN/Congressional experience and the story of public sector/non-profit consulting. I run HH's digital marketing for the County, which is a pretty large budget ($120,000 annually) and am assisting them in migrating to an e-commerce platform, since they currently have no website for their restores.
* Undergrad school/major:
   * Top Public Ivy: UVA/UMich/UC Berkley double major in Economics and International Studies completed in four years.
   * 3.5 GPA
* Other education/coursework:
   * I have a SQL certificate I got on EdX from IBM
   * I am currently enrolled in the CAPM (Certified Associate in Project Management, precursor to PMP) class and anticipate getting my CAPM before I apply.
   * Will likely target other skill-based certifications
* Race/nationality:
   * White, USA
* Sex:
   * Male

**Stats**

* GMAT Score: I took the GRE
   * 326 -&gt; 165 V (95%), 161 Q (79%), 5.5 AWA (98%)
* Undergrad GPA:
   * 3.5

knt96h,1,2020-12-31,Engineering Internships and Research,Edlebo,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/knt96h/engineering_internships_and_research/,"Hi!
I’ve never posted on this sub before but I figured it was a good place to start. I hope you all are doing well and staying safe. 

I’m a mechanical engineering sophomore with a strong passion for aerospace and big machines/projects (simple pleasures). I figured I would start looking for internships and/or research over the summer, so I started looking around this week for opportunities. Being new to internships I had no idea (ignorant in hindsight) that most big companies post listings for student interns over the summer in August or September. It’s December and I just started - granted, there are some companies that have new and up-to-date listings for the summer, but I’m worried that I might have missed the boat and could be heading to a wasted summer. 

My questions are: Did I really miss the boat? Do I have a real shot at landing something (my qualifications are strong academics and leadership experience as well as experience in a few engineering club projects)? Should I be worrying about this now, or should this be a later problem? I plan on going right to grad school for Mech (5 year) so I’m not sure what’s best for my career and resume building. 

Thanks for reading this and for any help you might have.

After getting rejected from over a hundred companies, I almost gave up. Then, I landed a role at an a16z-backed startup.

The best part is when I first reached out, a recruiter rejected me stating that there weren't any open internship roles. That wasn't a reason to stop trying! I cold messaged the VP of sales, got him on the phone, and convinced him to create a role for me.

Here's how:

1. I spent 20 minutes of the time listening &amp; asking questions to understand his needs:- ""what are you quarterly goals?""- ""what challenges are you facing trying to hit those goals?"",- ""what's something that needs to get done that never does?""
2. After each reply, I dug into his answers to understand exactly what he meant and try to identify root causes of problems.
3. I spent the next 9 minutes sharing why I would be the right person to solve those problems.
4. I spent the last minute asking if we could set up more time (ideally you get the person to agree to another call and find time on their calendar while on the phone).
5. I emailed a follow up right after shared a few specific things I could do to solve his problems. (If you're curious, screenshot of the follow up here: [https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6740401576944394240/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6740401576944394240/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=calendar&amp;ust=1609873682873000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2FVF0ymLFNyZaf7NBe6e5C))

knwofo,5,2020-12-31,[Profile Review:] Undergraduate Acoustical Engineering Student,DecibelDog,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/knwofo/profile_review_undergraduate_acoustical/,"I am a undergraduate Acoustics student graduating in May 2021 looking to apply to the HBS 2+2 program and the MIT Sloan MBA early admission program. I will most likely end up working in the Boston Metro area after graduation, so I am only applying to MIT and Harvard as of now (unless any other schools in the area with early admission for current undergrads).

Just to eliminate any possible confusion, Acoustical Engineering refers to the field of noise/vibration control, consumer audio product design, auditorium design for acoustics, etc. (not recording/mixing musicians).

**MBA Info**

* **Why I want an MBA**: My undergraduate degree provided me with great knowledge of engineering and acoustics. As much as I know I will enjoy designing and developing acoustical products and spaces, I have found that the business-side of things interests me as much, if not, more. After interning at both an architectural acoustics consulting firm and a large consumer audio company (Bose), I have already come to appreciate how important business is in every aspect of engineering. I want an MBA in order to successfully lead groups developing acoustical technologies while profitably bringing these technologies to market. I know I will not enter in the job immediately taking on these roles, but it is my eventual goal. I have skills in leadership, I am often the leader of engineering group projects where we greatly succeed in the tasks given to us. Though certainty different from a project in the workplace, I want to develop these leadership skills into that of a successful manager. I have also been thinking about starting my own acoustical consulting/technology firm sometime after I've had experience in the field (10-20 years from now). An MBA would certainty help me if I pursue this.
* **Why I want one now**: I definitely want to get an MBA at some point in my life, and there's absolutely no rush to get one now. I am applying to these schools because they offer early admission and I am currently an undergrad student. In the (likely) chance that I am rejected from these, I will most probably apply to other traditional MBA programs after I've had a few years of work experience under my belt.
* **Target schools**: HBS (2+2), MIT Sloan (early admission)

**Background**

* **Work experience**:
   * Summer 2020 - Acoustical Engineering Intern at Bose Corporation (remote)
   * Summer 2019 - Architectural Acoustical Consulting Intern at the largest acoustical consulting firm in NYC. Would prefer not to give name out for privacy, but it's large for an acoustic consulting firm (50+ people, 3 locations).
   * Summer 2018 - Maintenance Management / Engineering intern at a local Municipal water and sewer company.
* **Extra curriculars and other experience**:
   * Volunteer - Music-based nonprofit HQ in Boston founded by Berklee Students. I hold acoustics workshops for middle/high schoolers talking about the science of acoustics and opportunities for careers.
   * President - Tau Beta Pi Engineering Honor Society CT Gamma Chapter (AY 2020-21)
   * Member - Acoustical Society of America, American Society of Mechanical Engineers
   * Undergraduate Engineering Teaching Assistant
* **Undergrad school/major:**
   * University of Hartford: Mechanical Engineering (concentration in Acoustics)
      * Relatively small school, but well-known for the acoustical engineering program.
* **Other education/coursework:**
   * I have been interested in programming since middle school. Recently, I have been working on my programming skills as a hobby with the goal of developing acoustical tools and software. I am proficient with MATLAB, Visual Basic for Applications/Excel Macros, and C++ and am currently learning Ruby and  JavaScript.
* **Race/nationality:** White American
* **Sex**: Male

**Stats**

* **GMAT Score (practice exam)**: 710 (47 Q, 41 V)
   * Not nearly as high as I want it to be. I've been doing practice exams and questions since the spring but have seriously ramped up my practicing since my classes ended a few weeks ago. I am planning on taking it for real in early spring (mid Feb), and hopefully can get my score up before then.
* **Undergrad GPA**: 4.00/4.00
   * As of F2020. Shouldn't change too much as a result of S2021 classes."

However, I already accepted an offer back in November, thinking that if I hadn't heard from company X by then, I wasn't going to hear back from them at all.

Thus, I have a dilemma. Obviously, I'm not going to reneg on the offer I've already accepted, but I'm considering performing the online coding assessments (and maybe the interview) for practice. Is this a good idea?

Moreover, is it possible for things like this to ""carry over"" to next summer? (i.e. asking my recruiter if I can interview next year for summer 2022 without going through the application process again)"

However, I'm really passionate about the computer graphics and game programming courses offered, and I was wondering if I have a chance. My second option is studio arts or film because I have a lot of experience and ECs in the field of animation and arts, and my grades better reflect that.

If anyone could help me with deciding between the two to see if I could even risk CS or not, that would be amazing!

Coursework: 8 APs over 4 years, 3 APs currently (Calc BC, Literature, Statistics), currently also taking PreAP Physics, Band, and Practicum in Animation, AP Scores all 4s and 5s

-Worked on Animation Film and programmed game to bring awareness to ocean pollution and how it affects wildlife (animation won regional award in UIL Animation 2019)
-VBS Committee Head at my church since Freshman Year
-Volunteered at multiple elementary school and YMCA festivals

I don't have many CS courses because they constantly clashed with my commitment to Band and I didn't want to quit something I worked years toward and our CS teacher ended up quitting halfway through the year so the kids who are in it right now are confused 

Essays: I feel like the Why Rice essays would be strongest with CS but I think I can do pretty ok with discussing any of the three majors and I feel I can do ok with the Diversity Essay

Schools: UT auto admit early decision, Applied to USC and Loyola Marymount

As of right now I recently started working as a Service Desk Analyst for a company with salary pay. I love it, from my entire journey in Information Technology I’m extremely proud of myself. In terms of education all I have is a Associates Degree in Computer Science with no certifications. The only experience I have related to I.T. are an IT related internship and temporary position, which lead me to building my homelab with my services running and helped understand networking concepts greatly (VLANS, Port-Forwarding, etc). Now in terms of pursing forward that is where I’m asking for guidance because as of right now college loans are kicking my ass and I’m focusing on paying them off. But I’m also thinking about putting school on hold and slowly obtaining certifications. At the top of my career I would like to see myself as a Network Engineer. But also with my Linux familiarity I wouldn’t mind diving into AWS since cloud technologies will become more popular as time moves forward. AWS Cloud Practitioner or a CCNA is something I was looking for as certifications if I put down getting a bachelors degree for now. If anyone can give me some advice I would be greatly appreciated! 

TLDR: Continue with school loans and get a bachelors degree
OR
Pay off community college school loans and acquire certifications moving forward. Eventually find a better paying job"
