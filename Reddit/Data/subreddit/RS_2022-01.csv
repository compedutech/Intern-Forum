Currently a senior at a semi-target school in Canada and expected to graduate in Spring 2022. Just finished a fall internship at a middle-market investment bank where I gained amazing deal experience. Unfortunately, I didn't receive a return offer, not sure why as I believe I performed very well, and got along well with the team. MD mentioned if there's anything in the future, he'll stay in touch which is a good thing I guess.

Other experience consists of a smaller boutique M&amp;A shop internship this past summer, and a no-name PE fund internship last year. My resume is pretty good IMO, and I've got good leadership experience since my first year at school.

My goal is to break into big 5 by the summer or fall of 2022 - even another boutique/middle-market shop will be fine. I know the lateral market is hot, but would these firms consider an upcoming new grad? If there are any tips on how I should approach recruitment for the next couple of months, that would be great. I plan on networking a lot in the new year, I'm just not sure how responsive individuals will be given the new year is busy, and just bankers, in general, being unresponsive at times.

Really need some advice as I'm very discouraged with nothing lined up for after graduation. Any thoughts are welcomed.

Thank you and happy new year!"

I graduated college with a computer science degree in 2018. My dad owns a business and I decided in college I didn’t want to peruse a career in CS but just go work for him. I neglected to peruse CS internships and jobs in college despite them being readily available (pretty much thrown in my face).

Now its 2022 and I realize this was a huge mistake. I want to get a job as a software developer but I have zero work experience. I applied to a huge amount of jobs and it’s not going well. I assume companies are doubtful of my effectiveness as programmer since I have no experience on my resume or a body of work to show. 

I’m looking for advice to jumpstart my CS career. Would going back to school for my masters be the next logical step? Or should I work on personal projects in my free time?"

I have been looking for a coding bootcamp to take for a month or so and I have spoken with some bootcamps like ""FullStack"" and ""General Assembly"", but I became really interested in Learn Academy when I read that they offer a one month internship for their students during the program. Since I am currently living in San Diego, I though it could be a good option and I was pretty excited until I began looking at reviews and more information regarding the program. I am having a hard time finding reviews online. They don't have much on Youtube, some reviews on CareerKarma, and I ended up finding 37 reviews on ""Course Report"" with a 4.5 avg. rating, but they only have one review for 2021 and one for 2020 and the rest are super old reviews from 2018. So if anyone knows anything about ""Learn Academy""and would be open to sharing their experience with me, I would love to hear it. Or if you have taken another great bootcamp that helped you to change career, I would be very interested in hearing about that. Thank you!"
rt8nol,67,2021-12-31,I just graduated with a CS degree - What can I do to make sure I can land a job?,DepressedGarbage1337,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rt8nol/i_just_graduated_with_a_cs_degree_what_can_i_do/,"So I’m a recent CS graduate and I’ve been feeling pretty lost recently - I can’t seem to land interviews no matter what. One thing I have to admit is that I don’t have many personal projects, just a few completed atm, some backend projects (Django, Express) and some React apps. But the reason I have so few is that I find it really hard to stick with a project and complete it, especially when there is no one to hold me accountable and set deadlines for me. Also I like making games and stuff which obviously doesn’t translate well into the job market. Another thing is that I never did any internships - Not that I didn’t try, but I just couldn’t get an offer no matter how hard I tried. So I guess I’m just lost and uncertain as to what I can do at this point to finally get my foot in the door…"

You have done brilliant this year while balancing your school work, internship apps, extracurriculars, and social lives. You guys are tireless grinders, and you should be proud of yourselves.

Before you head out to crush it again next year, please take a moment to step back and reflect on this year: your accomplishments, your failures, your best moments, all of it. Stop with the endless clout and TC chase, and for a moment be grateful for everything you have, and for everybody who makes your life that much brighter.

It's not been easy, but you've kept your head down, and pushed through. You've made it to the end of 2021 in brilliant form, despite how dark things looked at times.

So to all of you, I wish a happy new year, and send my best wishes. Let's send it to the moon in 2022, Kings/Queens!

I’d like to know:
- your current college year
- the team you worked on while at Microsoft
- past/upcoming internships

I had some CS experience from high school and my freshman year. I’m looking to focus on algorithmic economics and data engineering. I have a data engineering internship this summer(FBU). On the side I started Angela Yu’s web dev course and I’ve completed the HTML part. I signed up for the 100devs so that I have a ‘classroom feeling’. 
Is this okay or will I burn myself out? I feel like I’m taking on too much but at the same time I’m afraid I’m might need all these three. Plus I don’t know a lot of people looking into algorithmic economics. Is it a good option long term? My statistics isn’t as strong. I did S1 for A level math. 
Any advice will be really appreciated. General advice on how best to navigate these three. I am sure I can do it. I have the plans but it feels like I’m lacking something."

Will I be working on the weekend as well? Let me know please!"

So, I am the workers council at my 25 employees retail store (branch business).
I have noticed that this is not common in most countrys, so imagine it like a company intern union.
Basically I push for better work conditions and  monitor labor rights. 

I have achieved many things which improve the conditions for our staff.
For example: Overtime does not exist anymore, responsibilities imposed on employees without extra pay were removed, shift plans of parents are rearranged to fit school/kindergarden, vacation lock 
is no longer existent, new contracts are checked and modified, break time interruption is gone, calling employees in their off time is now forbidden and the list goes on. 

I have had regular conversations with the store manager and the area manager for a few weeks. 
The store manager cried a few times when we had discussions about said stuff, because she doesn't know how to run the store with all this limitations.
She's under a lot of pressure from company management. 
She also wants to quit now because of that and because she can do almost nothing without my permission.

The area manager warned me, that I put all of our jobs at risk, because our store makes mediocre sales and he said if I go on like this, they have to eventually close the store because it becomes unprofitable.
We have ~120 stores and our turnover slightly under average.
In my opinion, one of the main reasons is that we are chronically understaffed.
That gets worse because nobody wants to work overtime anymore.
It seems that the store only (barely) functions with people working overtime regularly.
I'm sure the company also worries that if I succeed, other stores would also set up a workers council and this would be fatal for them.
I stay in contact with other stores too, so thats absolutely possible. 

I am at a point where I ask myself if I am too radical maybe. I don't want to risk anybodys job. I do believe, that they would close a store which makes mediocre turnover and just causes trouble otherwise. 

I don't know how to act anymore.

I don't want to back off because of the threats, I know that it's definitely the right thing to push for better conditions and to insist on every single labor right. But on the other side, I don't want my colleagues to lose their jobs. They are moms, dads, older people who wouldn't find another job easily. 

I am stuck between my worries and my principles."

rtj4yl,0,2022-01-01,My boyfriend’s sister regrets getting us together and I screwed it up further by talking about anal. How do I fix this?,ModeAny2666,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/rtj4yl/my_boyfriends_sister_regrets_getting_us_together/,"TL;DR My brother’s sister has had consistent issues with our relationship, mostly due to my fault. I keep trying to do better but I keep fucking it up worse: most recently by talking about anal. Help me and my bleeding asshole repair her and I’s relationship. 

Hi Reddit, posting from mobile. I genuinely am at a loss of how to repair this situation. I don’t have close siblings so I don’t know the dynamics and everything I’ve done so far has seemingly made it worse. And of course, obviously a throw away.

To Preface: I have half-siblings, but it’s more of a “we know we exist” kind of relationship. So I was essentially raised as an only child by a single mom. My boyfriend and I have been together 9 months.

Exposition: I met Stacey in high school, we knew of each other and had mutual friends but weren’t close until after we graduated. I invited her into my friend group just after we graduated and she fit in fantastically. We ended up going to the same university as well. She and I went through phases of being incredibly close and having down periods of not talking much aside from occasional phone calls. 

I briefly met her brother, we’ll call him Ken, when I was 18. He was 24 at the time and working on his PhD and doing an internship out of state. We got along well, but as we were both in relationships: it didn’t go anywhere. However, Stacey and her dad would joke that because of our similar interests were meant to be together in the future, frequently. I always laughed it off and he did as well, but we continued to get along the few times we saw each other throughout the years.

This past year: Their mother passed away after a long battle with cancer. I had a long period of not being close with Stacey, and just prior to their mother’s passing I had made a resolution to be better and close the gap. This resulted in me being very involved with their family during these hard times. My last words with their mother was a promise to take care of the family and be there for them. 

I began talking a lot more with Ken during this time, supporting and comforting him through both the passing of his mother and the end of a 4 year relationship. He was away from his friend support system( he lives out of state, 12 hours away.) and I wanted to make sure he had someone outside of the situation, nearby, he could rely on. We got to know each other a lot more and found that we actually were incredibly compatible. We spent a month just friendly chatting before giving in a going on a date. Spoilers: went fantastic, we’ve been together for 9 months. The relationship is incredible and I’ve never been happier. We’re closing the gap this June! :)

However, not everything has gone so smoothly. I attempted to be as there for Stacey as I was for Ken, but I believe she found comfort and support in some of her closer friends she made in college. Everyone grieves differently and I was never hurt if my texts or invites were ignored or declined or her replies were short. We hadn’t been close in a while, and although she was initially incredibly receptive to us becoming closer again, I don’t blame her for not having the effort after her mother passing.

Before Ken and I went on our first date, he had informed Stacey that we had been flirting and that we were going on a date. She had told him she was completely fine with it and hoped we had fun. Later, she and I had a talk about it and it reaffirmed she was ok with it but warned me that I shouldn’t get attached because he eventually had to go back to his home out of state. This admittedly made me nervous what his intentions were, but I went along with it. A few weeks later, we all hung out together and it went fine… at first. She slowly became more reserved and withdrawn throughout the night. We tried to involve her, get her to come out of her shell more, I asked if she was ok or needed medicine and she said she was fine. 

The First Sign: Come to find out, she was not fine. She had called my best friend to rant about how terrible my behavior was, openly throwing myself at her brother, seeing me sexually flirt with him, and that no one cared how uncomfortable she was the whole night. I don’t want to discredit her feelings on the matter, she is entitled to them and her perspective. However, my recollection of the night was different. She also mentioned how I was annoying for inviting her to do things too much and she wanted me to back the fuck off and leave her alone and allow her to come to me.

Ken and I had a date that night, and I relayed to him the despairing news that his sister didn’t seem happy with the relationship. It looked like we needed to end it or at least take a break until we could have another conversation with his sister on her time. We were incredibly sad, but we decided to take a break and hope she came around. 

That immediately backfired. He had talked to her about it and they ended up fighting. Ugly things were said, such as “I just thought you were going to fuck her and be done with it.” But apparently it resolved well at the end of it, from his perspective.

The next day Stacey sent me a long text that she didn’t want for us to break up and to do that was not what she wanted. That it was unfair to put her in that position and that while I made her uncomfortable, she didn’t want to interrupt anyones happiness. She also voiced that she doesn’t communicate the same upset directed at me to her brother because she can only hold him so accountable because he is her brother. She said she wants to communicate, set boundaries, and wanted Ken and I to continue our relationship. I apologized profusely and immediately agreed. I was so hopeful for the future of all of our relationships.

Issues and My Failures to Reconcile: Every time I tried to have this talk about boundaries, the conversation was put off or I was dismissed that the boundaries were common sense and didn’t need to be talked about. I should just get it. However, she discussed boundaries she would like me to have with my boyfriend or my best friend, and told them she’d like to have that conversation with me. She also emphasized that she did not have to put in effort to mending the relationship between us because I was dating HER brother.

Over time, I backed off and tried to let her come to me (as she had told my best friend, but not me). Then she was upset I didn’t reach out enough or communicate. She eventually removed me off Snapchat because she wanted distance from me and my relationship with her brother, not wanting to see it. Yet apparently talks highly of our relationship to her brother and comments on his photos of us. She declared that she and I are no longer friends, and that I need to respect that relationship we have between us now. I’m occasionally invited over by my boyfriend when he’s in town and I feel so intensely uncomfortable I have to be convinced nearly every time. (His sister will tell him how much she wants me to be a part of the holidays, celebrations, and dinners but I have personally never heard any of this from her.) There have obviously been more highs and lows between Stacey and I over the course of this, but this is already fairly long. Slowly, I’ve stopped talking in our mutual groupchat, with friend group from beginning of post, for fear I’ll fuck something up again and further ruin this degrading relationship.

The Fuck Up: I take full responsibility for my mistake. I should have known better. When I do reply in our groupchat, I never mention Ken. I don’t talk about sex. And I try to stay out of the space as much as possible to make sure she can comfortably talk with our friends without feeling uncomfortable his brothers girlfriend is there. These weren’t discussed boundaries, these were ones I imposed on myself. It has been this way for the entire 9 months Ken and I have been dating.

But I was tired and slap happy on my break at work. Saw people talking in the groupchat and joined in to toss in a shocking one liner and dip. They were talking about how we were all various forms of sick or injured. Stacey hadn’t been active and I forgot myself for a moment: I joked that while my head cold was annoying, I was more concerned about an injury I got while having anal. It was in the groupchat for maybe a minute before I realized my mistake and deleted the message. But, by the glory of god, she had checked the groupchat and she had already seen it. She replied in the groupchat along the lines of “OP I can see this, are you kidding me? Take this somewhere else”

I apologized and took responsibility in reply to her and she simply replied “Lmao.” I was horribly embarrassed and feeling ashamed as it’s been a few months since she’s had an issue with me. So I left the groupchat. I hadn’t been very active anyway and I feel like I was now infringing on a space where she felt comfortable. Only moments later I got a text from my boyfriend with a screenshot of a text from his sister: “Your girlfriend just announced to the groupchat she’s bleeding from her ass because of anal.” Followed up by, “I’m extremely uncomfortable.”

Boyfriend not exactly happy with me because he’s been trying to bridge this gap. She’s not happy with me for obvious reasons. And I feel like the world’s biggest fuck up and I deserve the bleeding asshole. 

I know this might seem small and will pass with time, but I’m sick of sitting on my hands. I want to fix this so it’s not so uncomfortable or awkward for either of us.

Thank you if you made it this far. My significant other’s family is incredibly important to me and I desperately want to repair this relationship. But more than anything, I just want my friend back. Even if we’re back to just occasionally calling each other to update each other on everything for hours. How can I mend this most recent mistake? What would be the best plan of action for the future? What the fuck do I do?"

I’ve been here for 3 months and I haven’t had a good experience. Training was very informal which shocked me because of how large this company is. The office space is very nice but everyone in it is very closed off and they have these “poker faces”. I had a meet and greet with a colleague, we had a great conversation and then the next day i saw her she completely ignored me. 

Also I remember having a holiday lunch with my director and another colleague and I felt so uncomfortable because my director (Female) kept staring at me up and down. 

I would like to mention that my director has a very different style of teaching people and I respectfully asked if we could compromise. I am someone who is a visual learner rather than learning on my own with very little guidance (using a poorly made user guide). I’m also given BS tasks (the crumbs that they do not want to do) and I feel that I am not learning how the business uses data analytics for their business needs. Instead they have me working on creating gift designs for the holidays and fixing user guides. The next thing they want me to do is to learn a system so that I can hold training lessons. Oh and let me also mention that I have to send pointless daily updates to my director. Yet she still asks in person what I did. 

For these reasons I chose to start looking for a new opportunity, I feel that I am overqualified (I have a MS) and my experience here has not been great. I don’t have benefits at all because i am an intern and it’s not a permanent position which i am not okay with. 

So I ended up getting a job offer at another company. Higher pay, full benefits, it’s permanent and it’s within my career path (marketing analyst). However, I’m a little nervous because the company is smaller(which isn’t a bad thing) but it’s not really the industry I want to be in and I was looking at reviews to see what people say about the company and people had mixed things to say which put me a bit on edge. I just hope that I am making the right decision, regardless I know I’m not happy working where I’m at right now. I’m young and I need experience to climb up the ladder. 

Praying for the best! Please share your thoughts about this"

IDK if there are laws against this, but an intern is supposed to be there to learn from others with more experience, can't do that if you're the only one.

I messaged them saying that it wasn't a job, it was an unpaid internship and they weren't allowed to post on that Reddit sub.

---------------------------------------

Just as a quick warning to anyone in the tech field, there's a partial scam that has been going on.  Basically it's a programming bootcamp that is being advertised as a job, you are supposed to be trained, then you get the job and your pay goes back to them.

It's not that bootcamps are illegal, it's not a scam to front the learning and get paid later, it's that they advertise the process as a job.  They make the boot camp seem like it's training for the job (which it can be) but then you have to go get a job after you thought you already had a job."

My code school focused more on Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript. By the time the internship ended, I felt like I’d finally developed some proficiency in coding and was getting pretty decent at JavaScript (React/React Native) and Python (teaching myself on the side). 

After my internship, I got hired into my full time tech job as a technical support engineer. Now I’m an account manger in the support realm, but I miss working on technical problems and think that I want to pivot back in that direction. Long term, I’d really long to work in a front end capacity specializing in accessibility. 

My main question - how do I get started again after such a long break? I haven’t written a line of code in 2 years but I’m up to speed with industry trends. I know React is still hot, so I was thinking I’d try to focus on relearning JavaScript and maybe build a small app. Any input would be much appreciated!"

While Amazon is a big tech company, given their reputation and intern class size (10k vs 50), would it be worth reneging for? 

The interview process at Qualtrics was much better, and the people I spoke to were friendly and seemed to enjoy their work.

It took a lot of effort though. Including, but not limited to:
- pushing back on my college major and going into computer science because “they don’t make a lot of money” — this will be relevant years later
- being forced to go to community college and paying on my own so they could save money
- working 2 jobs throughout multiple periods of my life because I’ve dreamed of getting out since I was 15
- “disobeying” or being sneaky whenever they set boundaries that seem pointless to me, e.g. getting a waitress job that forced me to stay til 11pm-2am
- dealing with a lot of verbal abuse that eventually dwindled because I learned how to grey rock
- taking control of my mental health and paying out of pocket to see a psychiatrist to deal with my (once undiagnosed) ADHD and Bipolar 2
- taking a gap year to save up money for school and deal with my mental health that prevented me from completing my transfer apps
- getting belittled for that year because I’m “doing nothing with my life” even though I was working my waitress job weekends and a 9-5 job weekdays at 20
- doing school online pre-COVID so I can keep working the 9-5 and afford to pay it on my own
- overworking myself to the point of exhaustion just to maximize time away from the house
- saving enough to minimize my dependence on them so that all they paid for was my shelter
- giving emotional support and validating the issues my younger siblings faced because I knew my parents weren’t giving it to them
- having a serious convo with my parents about their how their behavior is detrimental to us, just for them to completely ignore what I said by the next day
- applying to jobs across the country like crazy just to get away, getting over 70+ rejection emails
- taking on 3 internships back-to-back, one of them leading to a six-figure full-time job that paid over $10k for relocation… what was that about CS not making money, mom?

I know this comes off as a flex but I’m still pretty damn proud of myself for overcoming all this and more."

1. What do I need to do in college to get a decent job after graduation? (internship/co-op, projects, etc.)
2. How necessary is networking in the CS field? I'm not the best at it.
3. I will most likely attend a fairly small liberal arts college in the US, and considering that it is fairly rural, how likely am I to land an internship and a job afterward?
4. I know that the CS market is extremely saturated these days, as a LAC graduate with just a bachelor's, will I be able to get a job in the US, and if so how will the income be?

First, a quick backstory: I have a bit of experience with programming, but I've never built anything other than websites for fun, despite wanting to do more. Lately in my internship I saw that people were still using paper to elect school principals, so I wanted to make an election program(not sure if this is translated correctly, not a native eng speaker) to help them and for me to learn something new.


So, I chose to use java(very popular in my region), H2 as an embedded database to store the votes (since it has to work offline) and some framework to make a gui(I didn't get to this part yet).


Would a core 2 duo with 2gb of ram be able to run this fine when it has a GUI and all? Since that's what schools have available

I am also a bit lost if I am using the correct tools for such a program?

Is there something I should be using that I'm not?

I also want to package and release this to both Windows and Linux in the future, but I'm not sure how I would go about it(perhaps I'm not searching the right keywords?). If anyone could reference any guides, I'd be thankful!

I'm trying to learn everything at the same time, so it is a bit overwhelming"

Both are in Seattle, would prefer an in-person summer where I can learn as much as possible and also meet other interns. Both are planning for in-person but might become virtual.

Since I don't know what team I'll be on for either company, I've been looking at overall culture/work environment and intern benefits. Seems like Amazon is more fast paced with more opportunities for learning (not sure how true this is?), but I'd enjoy my summer with Microsoft more, especially if it's in-person with their intern perks and corp housing.

Currently a sophomore, so I've been evaluating the two based on the internship experience over potential return offers. If I had to choose for full time, I'd prefer Microsoft based on their culture and WLB, but I'd also like to be in NYC. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

The program is a junior year program at Tohoku University, and the duration is April through August of 2023. That eliminates my summer opportunites for getting an internship that summer. The program covers classes that I need and has a required research lab embedded in it.

Also, I would try to get one this summer, but I have to take Calc 3 over break, and from my research that is a hard class, especially in condensed form.

However, I have declared my major as computer science, and if I'm investing so much of my time and money into college, comp sci is where it's at, and would be the best payoff, right?  

It's been fascinating to dive into programming for the first time in my life and challenging myself. However, I can't help but ignore this pull towards dietetics/nutrition. I am instantly intrigued by anything relating to it, such as a random description talking about a research project on exploring nutrition and the circadian rhythm. I could feel myself getting excited by the possibility of being a part of such a team. 

I don't know what to do. I don't want to be foolish and be in debt later on just for some 'passion'. Because at the end of the day, work is work, and it won't always be pretty. Money helps pay the bills and help you get a better quality of life. 

I just feel so guilty for throwing computer science away, but again I'm not sure if my heart is completely there... 

For reference, it's only been my first semester of college, and I've been doing a lot of reflecting. 

I'm going to take an intro into nutrition class on top of my computer sci classes to get a feel for things.

I did 3 years of SWE internships in college, one IT internship at local government, then the last 2 years as a SWE.

I’ve been fortunate enough to make it there within a rather short period of time. Feel free to ask me anything and I’ll try to answer.

\--

I shared my salary in the recent thread and got quite a few direct messages and responses, asking for advice or other insights. And instead of answering these questions multiple times in private, I figured it might be useful to do this in a separate thread instead.

A couple of caveats first: This is a throwaway account and I will obfuscate some details on my background because I want to keep some level of anonymity. I am fairly sure that some of my close colleagues can make the connection, but I’d rather not go much further. I am pretty sure you can work out which company I work for though.

Secondly, I think big tech companies are too often seen as a monolith. But they are not. There are obviously many similarities, but also many differences. Even more, there can be significant differences across teams and organisations within the companies as well. This all goes to say: **This is just one single path.** It is a path that is in many ways exceptional and I am not sure it would have worked in other places. That being said, I will try to distill learning and insights from it.

I won’t focus much on compensation here, you can find it in my history. Instead I’ll focus on progression and what I’ve learned along the way.

**Background**

I come from central Europe. I actually do not have a CS degree. I studied business in my undergrad at some no-name university. I had a minor in computer science though. I wanted to deepen my technical background and also study abroad. I was able to get into a reputable university in the US for a masters program in software engineering. This then allowed me to get an internship at a MANGA company. Originally I wasn’t planning to stay at that company full-time, and instead return to my home country afterwards. But I enjoyed my time there so much that I accepted the full-time offer in the end.

**First Two Years (L3 -&gt; L5)**

I first worked one year in the US full-time. I joined a backend (but not infrastructure) team as a full-stack engineer. I actually had a bit of a rocky start and got a basic rating in my ever first performance evaluation. I remember this troubling me. Part of it was a ramp-up. But it was also that on my project I focused more on building long-term features, neglecting some of the short-term benefits I could enable. My manager helped me balance this better and I had a good second half, resulting in a promotion to L4.

**Learning:** Balance short term value added with the longer term. This doesn’t mean you can’t build for the long-term, but don’t do it blindly.

I then moved to London and joined a new team. In the new team I was able to leverage a lot of my knowledge I’ve gained in the first year, but apply it closer to the product. We were on an early stage product and had a lot of greenfield code. I wrote probably the most code ever in the next year or two. We had a great team, with one very senior engineer (L7+) as a tech lead and I was able to learn a lot from them. I got a promotion to L5 after a year.

**Learning:** I learned to have an opinion during this time. A technical opinion, but also a product opinion. I think this mattered a lot. I would be able to be a counterpart to the tech lead, but also communicate with other stakeholders or even external partners.

**Senior Engineer (L5 -&gt; L6)**

I’ve been at the company now for 2 years. I think two things happened here: First, I started to build a reputation across the organisation (when I mean org, I mean engineering under our director, not the entire company). I didn’t do this intentionally, and more by being passionate about certain things. In particular I started to care a lot about code quality. I would go out and clean up legacy code left and right. These were partially side projects and would go much beyond the codebase of my immediate team. So I became known for being the person that improves our codebase. Secondly, the senior tech lead left the team. This left a clear gap within the team that I could naturally fill. I received the L6 promo after another year. This was honestly the most surprising promotion. I didn’t even know my manager put me up for it and I did not expect it at all.

**Learning:** Don’t be limited by what your immediate team is doing. If you see opportunities outside, see whether you can pursue them. This needs to be done right though. Be clear with your manager and team on how you prioritise and also make sure you don’t step on other people’s toes.

**Staff Engineer (L6 -&gt; L7)**

Now at the company for three years, on the same team for two. The next promotion would take 2.5 years.

For the first year it was really mostly me getting comfortable with being a staff engineer in the first place. I’d be a tech lead for my team. But I’d increasingly also get pulled into tech discussions that would affect the entire org. I noticed how my skip level manager (our director) would start seeking my opinion or ask me to look into certain things. My passion for cleaning up code became a larger program for the entire org to organise and encourage others to do the same. I also got increasingly involved in recruiting and performance evaluation for other engineers, including promotions.

**Learning:** As a staff engineer, you should stop optimising for your immediate team. You are much more responsible for multiple teams or even an entire org. Building culture, mentoring, growth plans for talent etc. became more relevant.

In the second year of being a L6, it also became clear that I am no longer really a member of a team. Formally I was, but the majority of my time would be spent on things that would go beyond it. I would often jump into things that were on fire and help stabilize them. I helped build a team from the start up (but within the same org) that focused a lot of reliability and scalability instead of concrete product features. My manager struggled quite a bit with the new situation of COVID and asked me to take over certain things usually managers do. This provided me with great insight into what is happening across the entire org and also gave me further exposure.

**Learning:** This is really the year I learned that a manager at that level is much more a peer than a manager. Sure, they technically do all the paperwork that people managers do, but in the end you are both responsible for the same thing: Team and org health. So you should collaborate together like peers.

When the third year started, I had concrete discussions with my manager how the promotion to L7 would look like. It felt like a challenging step, but within reach. I also at the time started a new project with a very ambitious but business critical goal for our product. This provided me with a lot of room to show that I could really tackle large problems and gave me a lot of exposure. I knew at the end of the half, that my manager would put me up for promotion, but I had no idea whether it would go through. My manager also was not sure, as I was the first promotion to that level they ever handled. In the end it was enough and I got promoted to L7 after 2.5 years at L6, 5.5 years at the company in total.

**Learning:** Be open to new challenges. This project was not directly in the domain I was familiar with, but provided me with excellent opportunities to both grow and showcase what I’ve already learned. But also understand how you are supposed to operate on such a project at that level. My time directly contributing code there is limited. I am much more helping other engineers make progress, aligning stakeholders and partner teams and building long term roadmaps.

\--

So, this is it. I tried to keep it as brief as possible while still providing an overview how progression can look like. There are many other things I could go into more detail:

* I am really active in recruiting. I do about 60 interviews a year. Mostly system design or behavioral. I also review packets before they go to the hiring committee.
* I had three interns over the years and I am active in internal mentorship programs. I really enjoy mentoring others.
* I am also involved in the release process for the main web server of the company. I find release engineering fascinating.
* I’ve dealt with imposter syndrome multiple times over my career, starting as an intern and I will expect to have to deal with it again. I got better at it, but I think it never really goes away.

So yeah, feel free to ask me anything. Or don’t. That’s also cool."

ruahdz,6,2022-01-02,Is a CS masters worth it for me?,Individual_Builder73,DevelEire,https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/ruahdz/is_a_cs_masters_worth_it_for_me/,"I’m a 3rd year CS student at Trinity, and my course has two options:

1. 4 year bachelors degree in CS
2. 5 year integrated masters degree in CS

You choose which option you would like to take at the end of 3rd year (which is coming up soon for me). There are a few differences in both options.

If you choose the 4 year bachelors degree, there is no internship and you do a final year project in 4th year, and presumably you can get a job after that. 

If you choose the 5 year integrated masters degree, you do one semester of normal modules and then for semester 2 you do an internship (which can extend past the end of term up until September of the next academic year if you wish) instead of a final year project. Then, you do a dissertation for your 5th year. When you graduate, you get both a bachelors degree and a masters degree separately.

I currently have an internship at Microsoft lined up, and I will probably end up working there after my studies. I am still thinking about which option would suit me. For me personally, I don’t want to go into research or a PhD or anything like that. I want to work in the industry and hopefully eventually move to the US. I was wondering what you guys think? I am leaning towards not doing a masters if I get a return offer from my internship, but I have to choose which option I take before that can happen so I’m unsure. Do you think a masters is worth it for someone like me, or should I skip on it and either not do it later on at all, or do it at some other college later on? How much would it affect my career?"

I will describe my story and how I perceived the way into getting to work in the IT sector, as well as the computer science topic.*

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 19 years old software developer (official, still a trainee) in Germany. Since I was 14 years old, I am engaged in web development. It is my biggest hobby and in the meantime it has become my profession.

I did my two school internships out of interest in the field of software development. During these internships, my supervisors praised me and told me that with my knowledge and great interest in software development, I should pursue a degree in this field.

In Germany, roughly speaking, you need the highest of three school-leaving exams to be able to study something at a university. When I had to make the decision to go to the upper school to get the highest exam, I decided against it. From my grades, I could have easily done it. But I had massive problems with the school system and wanted to get out of it. I wanted to do something practical and not have to learn theoretical things for the next decade.

So I left school with a very good second level exam and looked around for an apprenticeship.

And this is where the whole problem starts. Many companies want the highest school-leaving exam for a normal job apprenticeship. I was lucky and was taken on by a good company near me.

On the one hand, it's really stupid that the highest exam is so often required everywhere. But on the other hand, it's sadly understandable, because the level of education in our country has dropped drastically due to an outdated system and a lack of teachers.

Many parents, for example, assume by default that their child will graduate with the highest exam, since the lower ones are already considered almost worthless by society. Students who have difficulties with the school system are not respected. It is almost like a competition.

But let's talk about studying computer science. In English, it is correctly called ""computer science"". In our language, it is typically just called ""studying IT"". This difference usually leads to the conclusion that people who have a CS degree are better programmers than those who have learned it as an IT job.

A quote which has remained in my head until today comes from our vocational school teacher:

&gt;*""If you want to do programming, don't study IT""*

And that is the point. That's why it's called ""computer science"" in English.

**Do you really need to know complicated math, algorithms and binary trees to build a nice website?**

Of course, it could help to understand the things behind. But in my eyes, it is definitely not necessary to build a cool app and be a great software engineer.

That's why I think it's not a necessarily good idea to study computer science if you want to be a good developer. If you are interested in the technology behind computers and software and want to work in a more scientific field later on, then studying CS makes sense.

Actually, a lot of cs students I've talked to know a lot of theory, but they can't develop real software. But we, the ""causal"" programmers, are often **being discriminated by those people**, and they think they are a lot better than us.

For this very reason, we have many people in our vocational school who have dropped out of their university because it was too much for them and they would rather do a software development job. I have friends that doesn't have a Degree, and they're super intelligent and I truly love working together with them!

Also, for companies, your actual work experience and how good you are in practice counts much more than any degree.

So, I personally chose not to study CS and would make that decision again if I had to. For me, software development means living out my creativity and putting my ideas into practice.

Of course, apprenticeships also have disadvantages and problems that I have experienced myself. But that's another topic...

**My top advice for everyone here is: Teach yourself what you are interested in and do exactly that! Make your own projects, live out your creativity and show what you can!**

&amp;#x200B;

*What I have reported here is based on my experience. It can be different in other countries, and each person also makes individual experiences. But I hope to have given a thought-stimulating impulse and am pleased about everyone who has read up to here.*

&amp;#x200B;

All the love and good luck

She left for a better job.,Kosta7785,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rui9gz/company_refuses_to_give_a_decent_raise_and/,"This happened to my partner in 2020-2021. She got a job as a financial analyst at a well regarded startup. At the time, she struggled with negotiating salary and so took a relatively low salary for her field. Once she started, as a financial analyst, she could see not only the pay rates of the position but also the budget that had been allocated for her position. She came on for $60k a year and they had allocated between $85-95k for the position. She realized it was her fault for not asking for more plus she was less experienced having only been graduated a year ago with 2 years experience (she worked as an intern while still in school). 

After working there a year and a half they were discussing raises. She asked for a substantial raise to $80k, still less than the lower end of their original budget. She was flatly refused. When she said that the standard pay for that position was higher and that they had just hired a new, more junior analyst for higher than that, she was berated, told that her performance was lacking (she had only had positive performance reviews up to that point), and told that using confidential salary data to negotiate was a firing offense. She was pretty upset about the whole thing. 

Later she posted her resume to LinkedIn and started getting head hunted. Within a few months she was offered an analyst position at a company in the same industry for $110k. So she put in her notice. Her bosses came back asking what it would take to keep her and offered her $95k to stay (which was what they were paying the new, junior analyst) but she refused. Now she’s happy although the new job is a bit more intense and requires more hours. Her old company is desperately trying to fill her role for anywhere close to what they could have been paying her. 

Moral of the story: don’t screw a financial analyst out of pay."

Junior investment bankers across the board highlighted overwhelming workloads [(some publicly)](https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rim9z3X.NpYk/v0?fbclid=IwAR0ODL_MKntKLsziT2uEzhkC0pW6GuIUG_C-0PPz3pnA7iIqTPaMn0l8fnE), and many transitioned to working from home to the office.

On the recruiting front, firms grew their 2022 summer intern classes and we saw record lateral mobility between companies as they looked to plug holes in their junior ranks – both from summer interns who switched companies for full-time employment, as well as for those already employed full-time who wanted to make a move. In addition, junior investment bankers and management consultants received raises to their base compensation, and bonuses are expected to bring total compensation to levels not seen [since the financial crisis](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/16/wall-street-is-set-for-biggest-bonuses-since-great-recession-report.html).

The 2021 recruiting cycle was marked by a significant increase in networking and interview discussions related to the intersection between social impact and finance, driven both by [student interest](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/13/business/dealbook/business-schools-esg.html) and professionals focused on the topic after Engine No. 1’s [high-profile victory over Exxon](https://www.wsj.com/articles/activist-wins-exxon-board-seats-after-questioning-oil-giants-climate-strategy-11622050087) and [similar](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/28/business/third-point-shell-breakup.html) [challenges](https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2020/08/05/evergy-elliott-avoids-sale-new-strategic-plan.html) led to [record flows into ESG funds](https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-climate-2021-11638372735).

It's UCLA, UCSD, Cal, Columbia, Harvard, Stanford, and Duke. I thought when I was developing it that it would just be better to apply to schools I'd *really* want to go to, rather than settling for since I could always go to community college. (Cali resident who would love to take advantage of free schooling). I think I have some more money saved up for a couple more applications, so if you could help me find some safeties and targets, I would greatly appreciate hearing from you all.

**Tl;dr: what are my chances at Columbia, and are there any safeties/targets I should apply to?**

**Demographics:** Upper-middle-class Filipino-American male

From the Valley (Los Angeles)

School of 3,800 students; pretty competitive, although we haven't sent any students to Ivies in a couple of years? A couple of students from last year got into Stanford.

**Intended Major**: Political science

**SAT:** 1470, 730rw, 740m

**GPA/Rank:**

3.91uw, 4.18w, 37 out of 961 (top 4%); had a rocky sophomore year but overall it went up (couple Bs here and there but otherwise, straight As).

**Coursework:**

10 APs (5 on CSA, 4s on Bio and CSP, 3s on WH, Lang) All honors classes if not AP

**Awards:**

1. Designer of the Year for a national journalism organization
2. Overall yearbook excellence award for separate journalism organization (ironically... it's the Columbia Scholastic Press Association)
3. Photography portfolio award, regional, won twice
4. International writing award for yearbook
5. I'm kind of stupid and put AP Scholar with Distinction on there (can't hurt I guess?)

**Extracurriculars:**

1. Editor of yearbook staff, receives national recognition
2. Paid internship at art museum
3. Editor of newspaper staff, also nr
4. News Editor and over 100 volunteer hours for Key Club
5. Photography Club pres.
6. Student Council branch club... idk how to describe it, it's like students who aren't in the class but still help with activities, was the secretary
7. Social Media Directory of Club that promotes anti-racist curriculum
8. Mentor of freshmen in academic program
9. Petition committee for LGBTQ+  club
10. Student representative for school board codivision

**Essays/LORs/Other:**

Common App is about a summer internship at a popular museum in LA, researching racial exclusion in art. Pretty strong, IMO? I think it's creative and it's expanding on one of the activities higher up in my extracurriculars.

Columbia Supplement: pretty lengthy list of books and poetry, went more creative with the content I engage with; First prompt about diverse, collaborative communities is really strong, about a mentorship program for freshmen. Second prompt, ""Why Us,"" is probably the strongest essay I've written outside. of the UC ones. Refers to the publications at the school. Third prompt about why I chose polisci is fine, kinda personal so I won't go into crazy detail.

Letter of rec for my yearbook adviser of three years (Stanford grad) and my AP bio teacher. First is probably v solid, we were really close and the second would be good it's just been a while since I had her and bio doesn't exactly align with my major.

rulvgk,1,2022-01-02,College Junior - Would Love Advice,[deleted],csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/rulvgk/college_junior_would_love_advice/,"Hello! I'm a college junior who, due to many extenuating circumstances, has only declared their CS major this year. 

As I've fulfilled many math/GE requirements, I'm still set to graduate in the Spring of 2023. However, I'm worried about what the job-hunt will look like upon graduation, as I'll only be finished with my school's intro sequence at the end of this year. 

I'm greatly interested in machine learning, so I'm trying to work as a research assistant with a professor at my institution who specializes in this area this coming Summer. 

What scares me the most is that I'll be doing this instead of an internship (which, given my coursework, I don't think I'd be technically prepared for). 

Does anyone have any advice as to what I should do in the remainder of the year/my time at college? If it helps, this is only my first year at the university I attend, as I am a transfer student."

**Letters of Recommendation**

(Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)

If I were to rate these, that would be obvious bias. Instead, just gonna describe how well I knew them. 

1. My Counselor - We had talked a few times. But nothing substantial to our relationship. 
2. My English Teacher - I met this guy in tutoring freshman year. We knew each other, but just barely. Had him a teacher for sophomore and junior year. We’ve had deep convos, he’s put with my antics, and now he’s my advisor for my Independent Study. He’s like the cool old uncle. 
3. My APUSH Teacher - I met this guy in freshman year and he hated me. I had went to him for tutoring for AP World and he called me out. He remembered that when I entered his class junior year for APUSH. But our relationship grew and now we respect each other. I grew to love history even more under him. He asked to write my LOR. 

**Interviews**

Just one, with the one Ivy League I applied to. I enjoyed it. We talked about our love for Marvel, our desire to have philosophical conversations at 3:00 am, and Turkey (the country, not the food). One question he asked me was “If you were a Marvel character, who would you be?”. I said Iron Man - because I’m self obsessed and have a desire to protect the people I love. Honestly, I was just happy someone heard that. 

Essays

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

Spent, in total, like six hours on my PS (editing included). Went through two drafts. The main gist was on my addiction to social media, and how I was the fakest person I knew. But eventually, I learned how to be real. And I’m still learning. 

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

Princeton REA - Will commit, just waiting for financial aid :)

Rutgers (School of Pharmacy, School of Engineering, SAS)

I applied to Columbia and NYU yesterday. The only reason I would go there is if Columbia gave me A LOT more money. NYU was my dream school until I learned about financial aid, so it really is just for me. 

*Waitlists:*

None :) 

*Rejections:*

None :)

**Additional Information:**

In the additional info section, I wrote that I couldn’t really do in school clubs until junior year because I couldn’t stay after school (had to come directly home to take care of my siblings). 

I don’t know why I got in. Freshman year, I got a C one marking period in Honors Bio. I ended with a B-. I got three more Bs pre-senior year. I now have a C+ in AP Chem, and a B in Calc and Independent Study. I wasn’t involved in school clubs. I did basketball freshman year, but that was it - I was the water girl because I could barely attend and cause I sucked. When some of my classmates found out, they were like “You? But how?”. Bruh, I don’t know either.

I CAN tell you what I tried to do with my application. I was honest with my application. My entire life I had tried to fit in by pretending to be things that I wasn’t. With my application, I wanted to be honest. For myself. I weaved this message of honesty and vulnerability throughout my application. I talked about my worries and fears in my supplements, but also the cheesy things I wanted to do. I really tried to let them know who I was - especially with those supplements. 

I really loved Rutgers. I was happy going there. I applied to Princeton because I wanted to go there - but I knew I wasn’t going to get in. My school is pretty competitive, we had about 35ish students apply to Princeton REA (50 apply total). Usually, we send one kid to Princeton every year. 

Can’t believe that kid is me.

rumff7,19,2022-01-02,"I was an exploited worker, and I didn't even realize it",foreveraclown,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rumff7/i_was_an_exploited_worker_and_i_didnt_even/,"I'm not sure if anyone is going to be interested in reading this long rant, but I felt like writing something just to show that even in countries like Sweden, which has comparatively strong labour laws and unions, you can still be exploited if you don't know your worth and stand up for yourself. Never lean back and think that your current rights are ""enough""; there are always cold hearted capitalists out there who can't wait to exploit desperate people and roll back every right you have, step by step, just so they can make a bigger profit.

I graduated high school in 2009, when the financial crisis was in full swing. In my province, unemployment among people aged 18-25 rocketed up to way over 50%. Because of this, pretty much everyone in my class decided to go either directly into university, or to take a chance and move to a bigger city where there were more opportunities for work.

I tried going to university but quickly found out that I was not ready for that, nor for moving to another city (there are many reasons for this and I won't go into it here), so I was in a really bad spot as my boomer mum would never allow me to just sit at home or take some time off. My mum is the protestant work ethic made flesh, and started to charge me rent as soon as I graduated. I needed some way to make money.

I uploaded my meagre CV to various places, and one day a man called me and offered me a customer support position at a local IT business. I was shocked to say the least. I said I was interested and showed up to the interview, which went something like this:

**Them**: ""You will work full time as a support technician, where you will receive calls from customers and help them with our products and billing questions. You will be an unpaid intern for six months, and then you will be employed and will receive $11 per hour.""

**Me**: ""I'm not sure I can work for free...""

**Them**: ""Well, we'll see what we can do.""

A while later I heard back from them, and (hold on to your butts) their new deal was $3 per hour during the ""internship"" period, which, if you didn't notice, was not an internship at all but straight up full time work (which would have been illegal if they hadn't paid me). However, they knew exactly what they were doing, targeting inexperienced high school graduates with poor support from home, who were desperate to make some money during a financial crisis. They struck gold going for me; I had no way to say no to this, and I was so inexperienced that I didn't know what else to do or demand.

Fast forward about two months, and I'm working my $3 per hour job. A bunch of other guys in the same life situation as me join as well. Suddenly I'm called into my boss' office and he tells me that he will increase my pay to $7, *retroactively*.

Now, I was never told what had happened, but I'm 99.9% sure that the parents of one of the guys who joined after me heard about this ""unpaid internship"" that the company had offered me and my new colleagues, and got the union involved (I don't think all of them had done the ""bold move"" that I did and requested some form of compensation for full time work). The company then panicked and decided to hike up the wages to this still unacceptably low figure to avoid having anyone else report any other issues to the union.

And here is the point I want to make with this story:

Your rights are never ""enough"". Even in Sweden, which is so often held up as a model country when it comes to workers' rights, there was nothing more to be done by the union to help me. In fact, my boss didn't even need to give me that raise at all, and I got those $7 per hour from the kindness of his cold, dead, heart.

The reason for this is that there is no minimum wage in Sweden - the effective minimum wage is what is agreed upon in collective bargaining agreements between unions and employers, *but it is not mandatory for an employer to have a collective bargaining agreement in place*. Therefore shitstains who prey on desperate people like me and my then colleagues are legally free to offer whatever pay above $0 that they please; the only thing they need to care about is finding the right people to prey upon. The only power the unions have when there is no collective bargaining agreement is to make sure that labour laws are followed. A minimum wage, or any other form of compensation for one's work, is not in those laws.

Don't stop fighting just because you get a raise, or even if you are able to unionise. Every country needs solid laws that prevent these exploitative practises from being a thing. Nothing but actual, nation wide, laws can protect the working class. Solutions like here in Sweden, where a good solution like collective bargaining is put in place, still becomes a completely flaccid aid for someone in the position I was in when companies are allowed to freely bypass the solution.

Could I have done things differently? Yes, of course; now, more than a decade later, I would have told them to give me a liveable wage or to shove their shady contract up their ass; but that's not how you handle these situations when you are a blue-eyed high school graduate in a desperate situation. Those are the people that really need solid workers' rights, and to create laws that make protecting these people an optional thing takes away a massive part of why these laws even need to exist in the first place. I'm very worried for the future as the power of unions has been diminishing for decades, and the number of workplaces without collective agreements is constantly increasing, especially in IT."

runr8o,3,2022-01-02,Teaching and PUA Assistance,InterrogatorMordrot,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/runr8o/teaching_and_pua_assistance/,"I graduated with my masters from a 5 year program I'm May of 2020. My last year included an unpaid internship but I was able to get some substitute work in depending on if my cooperating teacher was out and in another case where I covered a long term medical situation for two months. When the Pandemic hit and the school finished online only, there were no more sub jobs. I was also being considered for a full time position for next year as a matter of course due to the successful internship. 

All that fell apart when the pandemic hit. My summer opportunities for working with the summer school kids and tutoring also went out the window. The PUA was a lifeline. I was able to remain housed and not on the street as well as afford food and repair my car so I could get a job. 

My state now wants me to payback all assistance I received. Nearly 10k dollars which includes penalties. As best as I can tell they are saying I was never actually eligible to receive assistance because substitute teachers are not valid recipients. 

That was a while ago and now I have a full time teaching position but as you all know, this would devastate me financially to have to pay this back.

Did anyone else have a similar issue? Did you draw PUA? Is your state telling you to pay it all back? I'm trying to better understand my situation and how to navigate it."

It's just so demotivating, and sometimes I wonder if its even worth pursuing a degree at all in order to make the career switch I want to make.

I want to do research in some area and I am confused between AI, robotics and ML. Can anyone help me out with this? I want to know what the daily lives and work involved looks like and most importantly I wish to work with something I can use to create tech innovations or products that I can sell. Any advice is appreciated."

Due to rises in covid cases, our schedule got changed and I suddenly now have 3-4 day weekends. 

Due to how busy and stressful my days usually are, I find myself struggling to figure out how to spend my free time. I make all these plans during the week, thinking to myself ""Oh! I'll be able to play X video game! Or I can catch up on reading that one book. I could work on my cross stitch project, that'd be relaxing."" And I get excited.. 

But once the weekend comes, after I finish my house chores, I find myself just sitting on the couch scrolling through reddit or Etsy,  mindlessly watching youtube, or taking naps. When I think about all the things I was excited to do over the week, I just end up feeling indifferent to them. Which makes me kinda sad, cause I WANT to be excited to play video games and read books like I used to years ago before I started the process of getting my doctorate. 

Idk if it's because my brain is constantly running on all cylinders from years of intense schooling and now intense work or if it's something else, but I feel like I just waste my off days and start the work week feeling unfuffilled. There's a constant war between wanting/needing to do something and not being able to gather the energy to actually do those things.

Anyone else have any experience in this? Thanks in advance for any tips!"

rusndg,1,2022-01-02,I am feeling lost and intimidated,ParadoxDivinity,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/rusndg/i_am_feeling_lost_and_intimidated/," I  am about to graduate with my associates degree in cyber security. I  thought that it would be enough to secure me a job and I could get  higher education once I get a job, whether it is finishing a 4 year  degree or whatever certifications a company could want.

But  that is the thing, I am learning the hard way that... it seems like I  just wasted 2 years of my life and attention on a degree that is  meaningless when I could have just gotten the certifications. And that  even if I did get a 4 year degree, what good would it do me without the  certifications? I am feeling mislead and confused. And certifications  are thousands of dollars that I do not have, as well.

I  am in the middle of a 3 month unpaid internship at a cybersecurity  consultation company because that was a requirement for my graduation,  getting an internship, but it is an educational internship and I am not  gaining any job experience at this internship, it is a classroom  environment more than anything. I accepted it because it was quite  literally the only internship I could find in my area that even  responded to me. And all that said, if feel like I am learning more  relevant information here than in some of my other classes combined...

I  really am just feeling so defeated and down about this, to the point  that I have been considering a different career, but then I would  literally throw it all away. Is there anything my degree could be used  for to get a start, anywhere? Do companies hire people with no certs but  a degree?

Why even have a degree available if it won't get me a job.....

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you"

Many are mostly memeing it as ""prestige"" but some are idolizing it and actively chasing it. I went to one of HYPSM and got a software engineer job at one of the ""prestigious hedge fund/trading firm"" right after college. After this I realized what a mistake it was and now work at a FAANG/MANGA.

This job literally consumed my entire life. No one left at 5 pm. You leave at 7-8 pm on good days. If you leave at 5/6 pm, people literally shout at you and you're viewed as a some degenerate taking who's taking a ""half day"". The work I did was dull and most of the time I had to work with legacy code. I had to listen to traders bitch about something that didn't work, and because of this job I almost lost my relationship of 2 years since I couldn't spend anytime with my partner. I started feeling burnt out and this really affected my mental health badly. I started shouting at my colleagues and developed anger issues. Guess what? No one gives a fuck about your mental health at these hedge funds!

I started leetcoding again and soon found a job at FAANG. Now I make about less now but now I'm working on products that I like and have a nice tech stack. I leave work at 5pm and spend my time with my partner and my dog. When you join these hedge funds, you average 80-85 hours per week so your hourly rate is same as FAANG/MANGA employee. These HFTs that say ""we value work life balance"", yeah shut up. That's still around 70 hours. This industry is fucked by ex-Investment Bankers from Goldman Sachs who bring in their toxic work culture. These companies ""groom"" you with posh housing and trips through through their internship program, they overwork you when you join full-time. There's not much you can do with an extra 100k/200k when you don't have a life outside work. From being a full-timer at both FAANG/HFTs, I truly believe the tech industry provides the best compensation, career growth, and actually values work-life balance.

If you have an offer from a top tech company and a trading firm, and you value your life outside work even a little bit, do yourself a favour and join the tech company.

He’s the alpha type (reminds me of a character from wolf of Wall Street idk haven't even seen it). Basically he likes poking fun at  his employees; for example, he once made fun of an older employee for losing his hair.

When I first  started here, some of his jokes were funny but it quickly became old.  Anyway we just had a New Year’s Eve party right before work ended  yesterday afternoon. I brought my brother to the party because I had to  pick him up from karate right before it started.

My  brother is on the bigger side but it’s fine because he’s still growing  and I expect him to get a little taller at some point. Also, he’s sweet  to others. Anyway thinking that since it was New Year’s Eve, my brother  thought he would indulge and have a donut that was provided at the  party.

He already had and finished two powdered donuts, but he went back to he grab another donut to bring to our mom, who’s been under the  weather. My boss saw this and said, “you can only take one home.” My  brother was visibly confused because he only took one.

My  boss approached him and got uncomfortably close, then said, “I mean this extra one, chunk,” and wiped some powder off the corner of my  brother’s mouth with his handkerchief.

My  brother pretended not to be hurt but not only was he violated, but he  was also the target of a fat joke, being called chunk. He left quickly  and went to the bathroom for 20 minutes.

I tried to confront my boss, but he said that he was trying to motivate my brother on his weight loss journey, whatever that means. I know my boss was a little tipsy but what the fuck? I don't think any amount of alcohol would make a normal person behave like this. I guess this is what they mean when they say it takes a special kind of person to be in charge..."

With that being said, I also haven't been able to spend too much time on things like networking, grinding excel, financial models, etc. or things that would propel me into a reputed SWE role like grinding Leetcodes, mental math etc. Ideally, I want something in the finance world where I can also use some coding here and there, but I am not sure such a role exists. Ofc when people think of finance and CS they think of fintech, but I'm also not sure what exactly fintech companies entail and what roles they recruit for especially internships wise. I'm currently searching for more finance based internships and haven't found anything yet, and am feeling like I am falling super far behind on my career development, so any advice is appreciated!

ruvb2t,1,2022-01-03,What should I do next? Need advice on how to proceed in undergrad,mangodeobi,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ruvb2t/what_should_i_do_next_need_advice_on_how_to/,"Hello! I have a relatively important educational/(life?) decision that I need to make within the next month or so. But, I'm a very indecisive person by nature and just want to hear some outside opinions that'll (hopefully) bring me some clarity :). To boil it down: I need to decide whether I want to study abroad for a year or if I want to graduate early from undergrad.

I (18F) am currently a sophomore in college but have junior standing. So, including the upcoming Spring '22 semester, there are only 3 more semesters worth of credits that I need before I complete my degree. Due to my AP credits, I am able to spend a full year abroad and still graduate on time (in Spring '24)! This has always been my goal and there's one exchange program in particular that I have been dreaming about since freshman year of HS!

But, partly because of the \~global situation\~ this past fall has been my first REAL experience at my home uni. So, I haven't been able to join any clubs or do any internships (things have been shut down at my school, only slowly re-opening and then being shut down again recently). So, I'm fearful that I'll go abroad and goof off for a year (the program doesn't offer courses that will be relevant to my major, so I'd only be gaining elective creds) and not gain any real experience for when I graduate.

Also, my home uni is not cheap and even though my exchange uni is far cheaper, (we're talking \~70k vs \~10k) I'd be paying my home uni's tuition even while abroad. So financially, it makes more sense to graduate early, save that money, and then consider possibilities of post-grad traveling or maybe attending graduate school in that country. (I'm very fortunate that my parents don't *mind* paying for the extra year, but it makes me feel bad to think about it even if they say it's alright--especially if making this decision seems like it'll prohibit me from having time to gain experience to get a good job after graduating and be unable to pay them back later on). My roommate keeps telling me not to worry and that for our major having experience abroad will be equally as valuable as an internship/ extracurriculars, but I don't know that I can believe that.

So, the alternative is to graduate early, in Spring '23. But, it seems like a waste to go to my uni (known for their study abroad programs) and not study away. And, while people around me have always talked about graduating early as something impressive--I just feel TERRIFIED. I'm already young for my grade level and if I were to graduate in Spring '23, I would be graduating at 20 y/o. That idea honestly horrifies me. I barely even feel like a real college student, let alone someone ready for the workforce! While I'd have some time to work on getting internships and joining more extracurriculars, I feel like no one would want to hire anyone that young regardless.

Furthermore, I'm scared of the social repercussions of graduating early. I already have a hard time making friends, and the \~global situation\~ has further hindered that. It's kind of embarrassing to say that I've barely made any friends in college. But, for the ones that I *do* have, I feel like being a student was a leading factor in how we bonded. So graduating early and having no classes to meet people in sounds like a very lonely future for me :(.

Furthermore, there's a bit of peer pressure from one of my roommates (who I've known since high school) who I've always talked to about having this perfect plan to study abroad in nearby locations at the same time. It's making me feel bad for ""flaking"" on these plans we've had since HS and adding an emotional complexity to making this decision. I fear she'll kind of leave me behind if we are no longer on the same pace school-wise. Currently, we are in the same major, in 50%+ of the same classes, share most of the same friend circle, etc. and I feel like if we no longer have those things we'll drift apart. It also seems scary in general to be the only one of my friends (from HS or college) who will no longer be in school. Will it be hard for me to maintain these friendships if they're still in undergrad while I'm not? Or is that just an immature way of thinking in general?

Sorry for the wall of text wall, but I really will appreciate any insight people have to offer! I realize that I'm still young and naive, so this probably isn't as big of a deal as I'm making it out to be and it'll turn out fine either way. But, right now it's causing me a lot of anxiety, and I just want to be confident in whatever decision I make. Thanks for reading :)

TL;DR: What should I do: study abroad or graduate early? Thoughts on graduating young (20 y/o) -- will it be hard to get a job or to have a healthy social life? Versus thoughts on going abroad like I've always wanted -- but it seems financially selfish and I'd possibly be underqualified when I graduate? Is it a waste to go to a university known for its study-away programs and not take advantage of it? Is studying abroad seen as a valuable experience to future employers or not? Will it be difficult for me socially to graduate before all of my peers?"

Idk what should i do after graduate because my major is my mother choice even for what kind of work is all my mother who decide it, i have anxiety and depression (but i think it's getting better? Idk) i never go to psychology or anything because my parents is somewhat never understand and don't want to understand about mental problems, what they thinking is just you just sensitive,emotional,etc, so i always hide it but i usually use  painkiller to make me calm when i got bad anxiety. I really don't know what will happen in my life, i always trying to work harder but i always felt not enough, i always scared to share or open up because I'm scared to ruin everyone expectation and what they're thinking about me, so i always keep it myself. We're not a rich family not poor either we live comfortably with everything we had but since pandemic everything is hard but we still survive, i live in different city  with my sister in a small apartment and my parent's live in my hometown, my sister working too with a average income, we're not really like each other (she hates me and she always said i'm his punching bag since child), she will hit me, pull my hair and drag me everywhere,everything bad happen is my fault, and my parents will always take his side because she  is a golden child, it's make me learn to always quite whatever happen never speak up, just accept it and move on. We never talk to each other in this apartment i usually just playing in my room quietly, i felt like in prison and i felt like i can't be free. That's why i want to work oversea where i can live alone, it's my dream for  years, since high school i already made plans for myself when I'm graduate I'm gonna gtfo from this country and  start a new life, i just want to be free and living my live fully. in my opinion if i can work oversea i can help our economy problems and i wouldn't be a burden to them anymore. But today when i talk with my mom on phone about after graduates she want me to comeback to our hometown to continue his business, my mother have laundry store? and restaurant she want me to continue his laundry store, she told me to skip my graduation and just back to hometown so i can continue his work, i never did 17 birthday party or any celebration, so i really want my graduation being a special day but after hear what my mom said, my heart drop to the floor, i just can't thinking and i just fall silent i don't want to comeback to my hometown i have so many bad memories there where i got sexual harassment, bullying and everything else i don't want to remember, but i can't reject it because i have little sister who gonna graduate highschool too, my mother told me to take her place so she can take cares of my sister college etc. It make me think did i really don't have my freedom till i die?? Did i have to work under my mother forever, can't i be free? I'm scared and can't thinking straight i felt like my future ruined, what i always dream off, what i wish i can do, everything felt like just fly away from my future, i really want to be free and just stay away from my family, i don't want to cut our connection because i still love my family and  i understand what they want for me but i just want to be free from them, i just want to make my own decision and just being a person, for 17 years of my life i felt like i never choose and i never can do what i love, because i always do what they want, idk what should i do or say, the only thing i say in my mind only ""why can't i be free? "".

He's in First Year Computer Science engineering from a tier 2 college in Mumbai ( college has just begun, been 2 weeks only )
What are some projects/languages/internships he can try for and how to go about the same?


I'm an engineer by profession but I never really did any valuable ( engineering related ) internships. I don't want him to repeat the same. I want him to have a strong profile and not do marketing or content writing internships but something that will eventually help him get a good role in a product based company.

He holds interest in crypto, finance, blockchain and web development. 

He knows basic C++  and HTML ( had it in class 12 curriculum )

Can someone share a few resources or roadmaps on how to go about the same?"

ruwfwv,0,2022-01-03,Software engineering or RPA?,needhep_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ruwfwv/software_engineering_or_rpa/,"I am a business student with a second major in computer science graduating in 6 months. I have gotten an internship conversion offer to work as a RPA developer. The location is good, pay is rather decent (slightly above median for local computer science students). They expect me to inform them of the conversion in a week.

However, RPA doesnt exactly excite me and seems to be a job that just locks in my pay, ease the burden of finding a new job and I expect to hop to another job (software engineering or programming related) in the near future (1 year after onboarding).

Another alternative would be to reject the offer and find a software engineering job in my last semester. I have no experience in SWE except for the modules I have taken in university and do not know whether it will excite me or not. The pay would be around 1000 less since I am not a pure computer science student. However, at least I am trying something I am interested in and feel that I can switch to RPA if needed.

Would it be better to lock in my pay and switch from RPA to SWE later (since it may give me experience in working in a programming related environment), or just bite the bullet and try my best to apply for SWE now to get the relevant experience?  Because many mentioned that it is hard to switch from RPA to SWE.

Thanks!"

ruxkwa,22,2022-01-03,"Interned at a company, signed full time, but the job is quite different now. How should I renege?",throwaway4csadvice,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ruxkwa/interned_at_a_company_signed_full_time_but_the/,"I interned at a startup in 2021 and really enjoyed the experience. The team I work for is capable and the work I did was interesting. Importantly, I had an okay work-life balance.

However, after signing full time, things quickly changed. My boss's boss (the CEO) became my boss and immediately gave me what I think amounts to a second role. During my internship I was just doing software development, but now I'm also supposed to debug any production errors in our backend code. Matter of fact, I'm the only person in an American time zone with this role, so it's a job with a lot of pressure.

Additionally, he told me that I have to start joining meetings every night from Mon-Fri at 8pm. These meetings are often only 30 mins but can last up to an hour or two. Obviously, this would cripple my personal/social life.

These things were all communicated to me after I already verbally agreed to join as a fulltime.

Ultimately, it feels like the culture changed. The boss I had during my internship cared about me as a person whereas my new boss is trying to get the most productivity out of me for the lowest price. (The CEO lowballed me on the salary -- my salary is around 30% less than my friends who are entry level software engineers. I only signed because I was offered a large amount of options but I realize now that options can't be relied on as compensation -- especially for a private company that is less than 4 years old.)

I decided that I have no choice but to renege on the offer, but how should I do it? My CEO is well connected and I'm afraid that reneging will hurt my reputation and thus my ability to get a new job. Should I tell him I'm reneging asap and be honest about why I'm reneging or should I get a new job and then tell him that I'm taking the new offer?"
ruxnhl,4,2022-01-03,CS student introvert turned antsy extrovert in need of career advice,Cynical_Muffin,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ruxnhl/cs_student_introvert_turned_antsy_extrovert_in/,"Here’s my background:
I’m a third year computer science student. I began college as a quiet introvert who loved working alone, I had very bad social anxiety and depression, made no friends my first two years. Discovered computer science during that time and gained some confidence and purpose in life. I then had a summer internship in CS, hated it and performed poorly, unproductive, and was generally a waste of space.

I became very lost again, depressed, and intensely lonely and fearful that I would be alone after graduation, hating my social anxiety, and regretting the college years I wasted being isolated from everyone. I meditated and reflected intensely for a long time after the internship and started having panic attacks daily which would only be settled when I acknowledged how much I missed my friends and social life and remembering how social I was as a kid and how much I loved people and how terrible isolation has been for me.

I have lost nearly all interest in CS. I began partying. I go to the gym often, party every weekend, talk to people all the time, I’ve made a lot of friends because I am so grateful for their presence and I am desperate to show them genuine appreciation and they love me for it and I love them back. The social anxiety has almost all gone away, I got a job working in retail and love helping customers and I am mostly satisfied with it for now. I haven’t felt this good in a long time.

I can no longer sit still at a computer and must be around people and being intimate with people and helping people at work to be happy. Though I am too far into my CS degree to change my major to something more social, and I have already changed it enough times, so I am committed to finishing it.

What jobs can I still get with a computer science degree that are more extroverted? The ones that come to mind are software sales, software training, and teaching math or computer science in school, there is also project management which is what my dad does but I assume that’s not a job a recent undergraduate can easily get.

40 to 55k a year as a salary would support my life-style and current goals. 
Any thoughts are appreciated!"
ruy41e,41,2022-01-03,[UNI] My experience as a second-year Accountancy undergraduate at SUSS (Singapore University of Social Sciences) University,Doinkmeisters,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ruy41e/uni_my_experience_as_a_secondyear_accountancy/,"Hi everyone! I will be starting my last semester for my second year of university and I have decided to create another post just to update on my previous experience as a first-year university student. Please see my previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/njzzyz/uni_my_experience_as_a_firstyear_accountancy/) for my first year recount. 

Again, I also would like to put a disclaimer that I am NOT a dean's lister and my experience may be different from other students. But, I hope that my experience and tips can help someone who might encounter similar situations as I do.

*Background*  
My route: ITE Higher Nitec in Accountancy (2 years) &gt; SP Banking and Finance(3 years) &gt; SUSS Accountancy (4 years Full-Time)

*Experience* 

Context: I took 7 modules last semester which is a mixture of accountancy, economics and social(?) modules. I also had 6 online exams. 

TMA/GBA (assignments): As a whole, my experiences with TMA and GBA was similar to my previous year. I did a word dump document for every TMA/GBA whenever necessary and proceeded to add and refine my assignments. Tools such as MyBib and the school's online library were useful for citation and gaining FREE access to 95% of the articles I needed to quote in my assignments respectively. Also, rubrics/marking schemes were given for my assignments and to be honest, I found it a bit hard trying to figure out whether the information/answer would satisfy the rubrics. As for my groups, they were alright and everyone did their work. However, as a self-reflection, I wish I would've started on my parts much earlier so that I could help out those who needed it at the last minute. So far, I have not had to create any PPT/Google Slides so I can't comment on that. 

Class Participation: In terms of participation, it remained roughly the same or slightly better than my previous year. I am glad that my professors for that semester were open to any questions and were very nice about it which made me more comfortable. They were open to emails and in-class questions. 

Online/In-class lessons: In terms of online classes, Zoom university has been the method of teaching. So the usual login to your Zoom &gt; class starts &gt; final questions &gt; class ends. Maybe it's me, but I've grown to appreciate HBL slightly better than in my first-year. In terms of physical classes, it was a bit sian to travel for school but it was nice to be able to see my classmates and put a name to their faces. 

Regarding the number of lessons, it is still 6 lessons so I still think it's quite a rush and I found it hard to digest all the content. I know that as students, we are recommended to do our own self-study for the rest of the week, however, 3-4 modules in one term can be quite heavy on 1 brain. I ended up having to study harder in the weeks leading up to my exams because I had to scour whatever resources to fill up all the learning gaps. 

TOA Preparation: The school does provide past year papers but do not publish the whole answer. BUT, your professors may go through exam papers, question by question during your tutorials. So, try to come to class or get your answers from a few people as much as possible. Then, compare their answers to see which ones have the least mistakes to filter out the actual correct answer. Lastly, ask your professor if the answer is correct. THIS would be your final correct answer for an exam question. 

Please also download revision slides and attend revision briefings. I personally did not listen to the recordings attached to the revision slides because all of them were just repeating slides. However, I would take note of how they would like you to ANSWER the paper. Chegg and Studocu are still my life-saviours for anything so if you can, gain access to them. 

TOA (online exams): In terms of online exam, they were proctored this year as compared to last year. Proctored exams means you need your computer + your handphone on a stand that faces directly at your computer screen and your upper half of your body. It is done using Zoom's Focus mode where you can't chat with or see anyone except your proctors. I would say that unproctored exams are a tiny bit better because you don't feel so pressured with someone looking at you. However, proctored exams offers you better access to help. PLEASE KEEP A LOOK OUT FOR **TOA TECHNICAL SUPPORT CONTACT NUMBER. IT WILL BE EMAILED.** Additionally, try to attend the TOA briefing that is also sent to your email in order to get your set up enquiries answered. 

Paper-wise, I felt that only 2-3/6 papers were manageable. Otherwise, it was just a whole cluster-bark of questions within a 3 hour time span. I also pre-typed formats/answers wherever possible and had my notes opened to quickly CTRL+F them quickly. 

Student-life: None. But, I did join the IG associated to my degree and it was nice that I could ask some questions there. I did maintain relationships with some accountancy students and we shared our resources as much as possible which was helpful during exam periods. Lastly, I am currently on a part-time internship at a MNC so I can gain some extra bucks and beef up my resume. 

*Overall thoughts and personal feelings*

My experience during my second year has been nothing but the same tbh. Online university has its pros and cons. I personally felt that ever since school had to be done online which is in 2020, my brain just didn't function as good as I thought it would. Procrastination was really a killer for me and the number of modules really wrecked my whole brain. I completely burnt out by my last paper. Taking 6 EXAMS IS JUST WAY TOO MUCH FOR ONE SEMESTER and the urge to drop out of university has been so intense. 

My academic life right now is just pretty bad, grades-wise and experience-wise. I'm just trying to survive this degree to be honest. Not gonna lie, having done two years of degree, I remember nothing but I have learnt 1 thing: I don't think I am cut out for Big 4 or Accountancy. But, knowing that made me take up a part-time internship that is not accountancy-related and so far, I like it. For my next semester, I will only be taking 5 exams so I hope that it would ease my academic torture and my mental health can recover slightly. 

*Final note*

This post came out more negative than I thought but to be honest, I want it to be as truthful as possible about the realities of being an SUSS student. So far, it has been okay enough as a public university for me and I am thankful to have been accepted into this course. But, I also know that sometimes you have to go through a hard time to decide whether something is for you or not. 

Also, I feel like a lot of study TikToks and youtube videos of Singaporean universities doesn't capture much of the negative sides. They commonly show Logitech keyboards, iPad Pros, coffee, totebags, colour-coordinated notes, and an existent social life. But as someone who doesn't fit those things, I am a burnt out student who hasn't turned off my laptop in weeks, my notes are a bit messy and incomplete, I am running on 4 hours of sleep because of revision, I only have university acquaintances, crying at least 2 times a week, and I am losing my hope to stay in school. But, I'm trying my best. So, to any SUSS students who haven't been feeling the best about the ""Singapore University of Self Study"" or any other university students who are in the same situation, I hope that you know you are NOT alone. 

If you have any questions or thoughts, you can comment or PM me and I'll try my best to answer you :)"

I really want to transfer and I would greatly appreciate some advice.

I have a 4.0 GPA currently but my school doesn’t have a big reputation . My SAT scores weren’t good so I’m going to apply without it. In highschool I had *great* extracurriculars but my college doesnt offer much extracurriculars so instead I’ve done 2 internships in the past year. I haven’t asked yet but the professors I’ve had in my major have all said they would love to write recommendations for me in the future. 

I want to apply to Columbia and UCLA. Do I have a shot? And any recommendations for the application? 

(For context I want to transfer as a Econ major and Polisci minor)."
rv4jfs,14,2022-01-03,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (1/3/2022),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/rv4jfs/weekly_job_qa_thread_132022/,"Hi all,

Here is the 105th installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

\--Nick

rv5fiy,6,2022-01-03,Chance an international for T20s!,cg50calculator,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/rv5fiy/chance_an_international_for_t20s/,"(I’m going to be a bit vague just so no one recognises me on here— but if you know who I am, no you don’t. I already posted about private chancing once, but I thought I’d give it a go in public, too!)

I’m looking primarily at Stanford (dream school), Brown, Cornell, Duke, Dartmouth and Princeton. I have a few safeties in mind too, but I don’t really want to be chanced for those.

Demographics: Female, Indian (international student), private competitive school, LGBT (if that counts), no financial aid needed, third-gen

Hooks: None that I know of lmao (have a neurological condition but I don’t think that really counts, and the LGBT thing again)

Intended major: cognitive science

Applying for the incoming batch of 2023

IGCSE (9-10th grade): 6A\*s and 3As

ACT: 35

SAT: N/A

GPA/Rank: (My school doesn't give this and I'm a junior, so not really sure. Last checked, my GPA was 3.75 (based on my IGCSE results), but I'm a bit iffy about this because my school didn't do the conversion). No class rank either, and I honestly don't really know where I stand so I can't make an educated guess).

Coursework:

APs:

1. AP Human Geography 
2. AP Computer Science 
3. AP Psychology 

(School doesn't offer AP classes, but I wanted to try for the AP Scholar anyway so I'm self-studying.)

IBDP subjects (have no idea how much I should expect):

1. Chem SL
2. Spanish SL
3. Business Management SL
4. Economics HL
5. English Literature HL
6. Math AI HL

Awards: (nothing too significant, just a few school awards for my performance in my IGCSE exams). I'm also applying for the Pramerica Spirit of Community, Ashoka Fellowship, and Diana awards, and I expect to get at least one of these.

Extracurriculars:

1. Founded a social initiative aiming to equalize the state of education in India. Has over 200 member schools with about 8000 beneficiaries so far; I expect this number to double at least by the time I apply. For more context, we work with schools with more privileged high school students and help them create a change in their vicinity among lower-income students (India has a very segregated education system). Tied up with an NGO with Special Consultative Status with the UN ECOSOC for this as well; they help with the administration of the project (due to the large scale of it) as well as finding schools. My project also has partnerships with a government agency and a Fortune 500 company, which we got through the NGO.
2. Worked with and tutored 50+ students from one school in my home city, was featured in a few national newspapers for this (The New Indian Express, India Times, and Scoop Whoop) and on the IBO's Asia Pacific Linkedin Page. I also provided 20 kids with connected devices during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (since they couldn't afford the shift to online education) post a fundraiser which raised a decent amount of money.
3. Showcasing my work next year at the UN HQ in New York as a part of a leadership program (that I was given a full scholarship to) if the pandemic permits it.
4. Young Member at the New York Academy of Sciences (as a part of their 1000 Girls, 1000 Futures program)
5. Founded an initiative distributing sustainable everyday items (i.e. water bottles/sanitary pads/toothbrushes/etc) to underprivileged people (this is just taking off, but I expect to have at least 150 beneficiaries out of it?). Also connected with a popular start-up for this.
6. Founded an initiative aiming to help mentally diverse people gain access to employment as a part of a competition with hundreds of schools participating in the first round. Won the competition in a final round with 13 schools participating. My partner and I were also featured in Economic Times (another Indian newspaper) for this, along with Outlook Magazine and Business Standard.
7. Intern at a Fortune 500 company, related to cognitive science (this is ongoing, but it's for 3 months or more)
8. Intern at an NGO working in the sphere of my educational initiatives (points 1 and 2)
9. Leadership position at my school as an editor for three years, senior editor in the twelfth grade.
10. Learned music for 8+ years, the equivalent of a Bachelor of Arts in Hindustani vocals, with Distinction (will be giving the exam in May 2022, but positive I’ll pass)
11. Diploma in western contemporary vocals from Rock School after learning for 5+ years, with Merit (again, exam in May 2022)
12. Research paper published on [arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/), under the guidance of a professor at a top Indian research institute (IISc).
13. Was selected and attended the Harvard Youth Lead the Change conference, which, according to the mentors, had an acceptance rate of 0.4% (reeeeally iffy about this statistic though, lmao).
14. Chief Editor at a chapter of Girl Up.

Essays/LORs: haven't reached that stage yet, but I'm fairly close with most of my teachers, so 8-10 on LORS, and I enjoy writing a lot, so same ranking (or more) for my essays.

Also, I’m still in my junior year, so I’d appreciate any suggestions for what I could do to improve my application! When people private chanced me, something I heard was that I should consider delving deeper into cognitive science. Point 7 already deals with it, but I’m also thinking of doing a research paper on cognitive science relating to the user interface of my social initiative (point 1). I also plan on attending a competitive summer program or doing research with another faculty member at a good institute (if things go well lmao) in the realm of cognitive science, so I'm hoping this increases my chances as well."

1. What interview format are they doing this year? 2 rounds (each 2x45 min) or 1 round (2x45 min) or 1 round (4x45 min)?
2. I know LPs take up most of the time, but for the ""technical"" element, do Amazon typically ask Product Design type questions? (or are metrics, ops, strategy, etc. all fair game?)
3. For those that interviewed for PMT roles, did you have a bar raiser interview? How was that like?
4. How can one best bring in relevant tech experience from extra-curriculars/hobbies? I don't have much technical experience in my previous job, but have done multiple coding projects/apps outside work.

Thank you in advance!"

I'm really passionate about cybersecurity and compete in a national competition because of our performance each member of our team was offered an internship for college but I really want to be able to get a summer internship of some kind. I'm itching to get some real world experience. 

I wanna get my pentest, ccna, and oscp this year but I recently quit the fast food job I held since 14 so I could focus on school.

My company has a fair number of users in AD who do not have e-mail addresses.  These would be interns, students, whathaveyou.  For whatever reasons, the organization did not want to supply these users with O365 accounts, but that's fine.  We are rolling out Duo for a few applications, so when users try to log in with their AD credentials, they will instead be prompted to self-enroll.  No big deal... except that some applications do NOT have a Duo prompt (Citrix Netscaler) and just auto-DuoPush to your phone when you log in.  So, if one of these users try to log in, they will simply be met with a Timeout and not be able to log in.    


How would you solve the problem of getting these users enrolled?  Stand up a public facing website that you protect with Duo and put it behind ADFS (ADFS is protected)?  Basically I want to put a *very simple* link on the Netscaler login page that a user can click and it will ask them to enroll in our Duo instance.  I'm not a web dev, but I'm sure I could cobble together some kind of thing for the users to get redirected to ADFS and then spit them back out at a ""Congratulations, now close this tab and try logging in again with Duo"" page.

After finishing my final college applications yesterday, I've been able to reflect on where I am right now and how far I have come.

Demographically, I wasn't given the perfect hand, but it is one that I am thankful for nevertheless. I'm an unhooked, unconnected, middle-class Asian male living in a relatively normal school district. I come from a lineage of uneducated farmers, with nearly all of my extended family (cousins, uncles, aunts), with the exception of my parents and a single cousin, never passing the Asian equivalent of community college. My family is the only part of my extended family living in America, and I am the oldest child in my family. 

Growing up, I was not naturally prodigious nor insanely talented at anything. Maybe math came somewhat more intuitively, but I was nevertheless in the ""middle of the pack"" in terms of my peers and on the ""lower-end"" in the Asian subcommunity I was raised around (Bsian gang :D). I was just a typical recreational-sports-playing, video-game-loving, orchestra-participating, unexceptional kid. My parents didn't expect me to go to a top school, nor did they push me to be ungodly good at a particular thing. I was just ""normal"".

But it was around 8th grade when I really started applying myself, partially due to puberty and the pressure to ""conform"" to the high-performing, high-achieving peers I was around and partially due to my younger sister, who was always much more studious and academically gifted. My B's became A's, I started practicing more in what I do, and casual hobbies turned into dedicated passions. Yet it became obvious that the playing field was not fair. A lot of these ""high-achieving"" people were being linked to programs and professors due to sibling and parental connections, and a lot of them delved into competitions and activities that I had not even heard of. 

And it was admittedly frustrating. I didn't have an older sibling to look up to, nor could my parents give me much guidance themselves. I was my own guinea pig, wading blindly into the unknown without any sort of direction or goal. I could not rely on the ""natural"" academic talent a lot of my classmates had (I could never maintain all-As in school without copious amounts of studying and crying :')), nor was I ""prepared"" to excel, whether that be artistically or athletically. Yet I tried. I tried very very hard. 

And 4 years of this vex-fueled effort later, looking back, I'm beginning to realize how far I've come. I've gone from being an all-B student to one of the top in my class. I'd consider myself decently talented in my beloved instrument and I'm a leader for several clubs that I enjoy. And beyond that, my mindless wading had landed me into amazing internships and mentorships, selective academic and summer programs, and certificates and awards that I never thought would be possible for someone like myself--all while having to spend 15-20 hours a week taking care of the house, from cooking to cleaning to laundry to shopping because of my parents' working hours.

And that's not to say that I was perfect. I fucked up. A lot. I completely broke down emotionally for several auditions, barring me from things I really wished I could've partaken in. There were clubs I loved that I didn't dedicate enough time to, which ultimately costed me. I am a notorious choker in my sport, preventing me from being very impactful for my school's varsity team.

But even with these fuck ups, I don't really know how much better I could've done. 

Maybe if I practiced another few hundred hours for my instrument, I could've made All-Nationals. Maybe if I studied more for competition math, I could've qualified for USAMO. Maybe if I knew about things like USABO and ISEF, I could've actually delved into research rather than the hundred rejection emails from professors. But could I guarantee this? Could I guarantee I would've done all of these things?

Even outside of purely academics and activities, I have a huge friend group and social support circle. I hung out and played video games with people that I cared about, and I can't even remember all the 2am discord conversations and weekend bubble tea trips I've had. I've never been involved in a lot of social drama, and I'm dating one of the smartest people I know :). The sheer number of people who reached out to me asking if I was ok and consoling me after I was deferred from my early school (T5, so no surprise really) was so heartwarming and it made me incredibly happy even with the disappointment of not securing my dream school.

And even through all the crying and self-doubt, my RD essays were some of the best pieces of writing I've ever made in my life. I loved how human and genuine they all were as if I was speaking directly to the reader in my own distinctive way. I loved how they all came together to create this super full picture of myself, and I felt proud after submitting each application. I love how humanizing and authentic my loci is for my deferred early school, and I made it in a way that screamed ""me"". Maybe the institution will give me a second chance!

And who knows? In 3-4 months, maybe I'll be going to my state flagship, or maybe I'll be going to Harvard. Either way, I'm proud of myself for what I've done over the years and I wouldn't have wanted it any other way :D."

I found the test incredibly nerve-wracking and like many others thought I had failed so if you are in that position just take a deep breath and try to calm down. 

I had been studying for about an hour a day since late November. For context, I am a first-year computer engineering student. However, I had no IT experience and very limited knowledge of IT concepts going into this certification. The resources I used, ranked from most to least helpful in my opinion were the following:

1. Professor Messer's videos. They're amazing and go through all of the objectives. They were my primary source to learn the material.
2. Professor Messer's practice exams. I found that his exams were the most useful to identify any areas I needed to review as well as allow me to get used to very wordy questions.
3. Jason Dion's practice exams. These exams were good but I sometimes felt like they were not as aligned with the exam objectives as Professor Messer's practice exams. However, I appreciated the Udemy testing format. Make sure to pick them up on sale!
4. Ian Neil's CompTIA Security+: SY0-601 Certification Guide. I read through this textbook after going through Professor Messer's videos. There's definitely useful information in there but I did not rely on it as much. I also liked the two practice exams that were included in the textbook.

Additionally, I used ExamCompass and the CertMaster app (free version) to quickly quiz myself. I also watched all of Professor Messer's study groups and did his Take Tens.

I'm not sure about the next certification I will be pursuing. I will be looking for internships this summer and seeing where that takes me. Good luck to everyone studying and I hope my post helped you."

Apologies for being all over the place and any grammatical errors in advance

This past month has made me age 5 years. It started with the death of my cousin, someone who I looked at as an older brother. His loss came as a complete shock to me and the rest of my family, its been little over a month and I still haven't gone a day without thinking about him and the memories we could've continued to have together. Grieving the loss of my cousin has been bad enough but now my dad is having a manic episode rubbing salt on the wound. Hes either talking non stop about spirituality, a trip he plans on taking at the end of the month or other ideas or he's irritated and gets triggered at the slightest things no matter what.

As of writing this my cousin called my dad to check up on him and my dad wanted to her to sing a certain song because she is a good singer. After singing it my dad was insistent that she keeps singing that song until he says its enough. My cousin sang 2 more times but it was clear that she cannot sustain that type of singing for a long time and now he is irritated. I tried to calm him down but I guess my dumbass didn't help cuz he just got more triggered and he's probably going to drink and smoke more.

couple all this with the fact I am stuck at home because school is online temporarily due to the omicron so I have no way of escaping this and I have to walk on eggshells. I feel bad that I even wrote this last sentence because I don't want to leave my mom and my sister here by themselves dealing with my dad at his current state. It feels like there's a thousand worries in my head already with school and an internship I have to find to complete my degree on top of dealing with my dad and grieving for my brother figure.  

I have never felt more mentally lost and drained in my life. It takes me hours to sleep these days, my mind is flooded with all the problems mentioned in this sub or something else. Im so envious of all the people that have a normal family dynamic because I will give anything to have that right now. I miss my cousin and I miss the way my dad usually is which is a kind and caring father. Im 21 and I've never been more scared and unsure for my future and my mental health. It feels like this hell will never end for me"

How do I navigate this situation, need help..?",NoMoreFailing,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/rvmzqp/turning_29_soon_completed_2_stem_degrees_and_i/,"**Background:**

Graduated in chemical engineering in 2017 with 16 months of Oil and Gas (O&amp;G) experience. Failed to land an FT job due to oil prices crashing and was unemployed for around 1.5 years. Decided to pursue a degree in Computer Science (CS) in the summer of 2018. However, I had no real interest in CS at that time and basically used my student status to get an internship at another O&amp;G company in order to leverage my chemical engineering degree and obtain FT employment and drop my degree in CS. The internship position was in the Automation team (infrastructure and networking) for 1 year. I was miserable in that job with a maniac manager who hated my guts, I managed to move teams during my internship in the same company, but Covid hit and oil prices plunged worldwide to -$40/barrel and that was that. I returned to school and wanted to focus on completing my CS degree and start a career there. I struggled with mental clarity to get started for self-learning programming, would have severe motivation problems and honestly, I got through school by solely relying on a friend who helped me out a lot for CS (with projects, assignments and even told me the things to study for the exams which I just rote learned). Basically, my gamble to go all in for an O&amp;G job backfired as my basics for CS and programming were terrible. Also, I learned that I may have a learning disability in ADHD which contributed to my lack of persistence in completing schoolwork and finding the motivation in applying for jobs in general. I managed to land an internship in the government while completing my final year in school as a Java developer intern. Many of my friends got FT offers to work for Tech in the government which propelled me to apply and I decided this might be a ticket for me to finally gain FT employment. I was doing full-time courses in my final year as well and working this internship job full-time. I failed miserably as a programmer as I didn’t know anything and basically had my peers help me out in every user story I was assigned in the 8-months I was there. Having ADHD and taking on such a heavy course load with FT internship work was indeed stupid and I set myself up for failure. Come May 2021, I graduated from CS and during the last week of my internship, I asked my supervisor if there is any FT opportunities and she obviously just made excuses and told me she’ll keep in touch (she never did and ghosted me after my internship ended..). After graduating, I tried focusing on my ADHD mental disability but I still haven’t got any appointments due to covid and wait times. I strongly believe I don’t have a job due to ADHD. I have this fear of not being good enough to get an FT job. I don’t even apply to some jobs because I know I am not good enough. 

**Applied to Masters**

In September out of desperation, I applied for a Masters in CS very last minute for a January start date and got accepted (extreme luck played into this!). I was sick of being unemployed for the last 8 months, so I thought I would become a student once again and apply to internships (the only thing I know how to do apparently) starting this January and gain more tech experience while also applying for FT jobs. I got 2 internship offers from a Big 4 firm in Tax/Tech and a medium (well-known) tech company. I chose the tech company (Automation developer role)  as I would be exposed to more tech and it would be nice to have this company on my resume. I am hoping to impress them and work myself to the brink just so I can have a chance at gaining FT employment with them in the future. I do feel disgusted as I am pretty much just cheap labour to these companies doing internships with literally two STEM degrees and 3 years of the relevant internship experience. I know someone with half a brain would leverage my skill set and degrees and land a $100K job easy but I'm just mentally inept...  

**Current Strategy:**

 I have a contract till May 2022 for my current internship at the tech company. I will apply for meaningful tech internships for May 2022 onwards as a safety net if I don’t get extended for this internship or get any FT offer. I will be applying to FT jobs in tech consulting, DevOps, or developer (automation or software). At some point during the internship, I will let my manager know that I am interested in joining as an FT employee and will be very willing to drop my Masters's degree and join them. If I get an offer for FT from another company during my internship, I will let my manager know and ask to match (if I prefer the current company over the fantasy company that gave me FT offer lol) or just take the offer and quit my internship and Masters and rejoice in finally having an FT job. I severely lack confidence in coding so I am planning on applying to a bunch of big 4 tech consulting to get my foot in the door. 

My current skill set is weak in tech. I have experience with only Java and that’s the only language I’m comfortable programming. Planning on taking courses in front-end development, python Docker, Kubernetes, and automation development for my current internship. Also plan on learning Data Structures and Algos and start learning how to solve leet code for interviews. My biggest fear is technical interviews which make me not apply at all (I’m such an idiot). 

It just really saddens me to see these 22/23 years olds getting employment with ease while I am approaching my 30s and still haven’t even had a company acknowledge me. No contributions to retirement, just nothing. I feel so worthless and a colossal failure as a man. My whole life is in shambles due to my inability to land FT employment. No woman wants an unemployed dude with no career progress heading into his 30’s, my dad looks at me in disgust and I cry myself to sleep sometimes when I think about my life and the choices I made. My friends are all seniors/leaders and I’m still just a stupid grown-ass man doing an internship. It's embarrassing applying to these jobs when I look so old and sharing work with this 20 something-year-olds. 

I will try to remain positive as I am starting my new role tomorrow (or today, should really sleep now..) and I could use some career guidance on how to make the most of this opportunity. Is there anything I can do differently? is my strategy any good? how do I overcome the mental block that I have for FT jobs and their technical interviews? I’m sorry I have ranted long enough here, just really want to change things around and get this FT monkey off my back."

rvom6i,80,2022-01-04,Helpful question to an interviewer,Sentinel-MG,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rvom6i/helpful_question_to_an_interviewer/,"I wanted to offer this little bit of advice which was taught to me while I was a graduate student, and I've found it very helpful for forcing out a potentially critical red flag toward the end of an interview. One of the reasons I took some of the advice I was taught was because the professor who did so was a psychologist, not a business person. They were very quick to teach us a great many ""tricks"" to gain some authority in a situation where you're usually made to feel subjected to it, and has definitely helped me by demonstrating that a lot of these ""better interview"" books are complete shit. They're often written by people in business to help mold you into telling interviewers exactly what they want to hear while subjecting yourself to conformity.

Admittedly, this may only work with prospects that require things like resumes, CV's, or more detailed applications than what an average retail job might expect. Still, I have found it very, very helpful.

Toward the end of an interview, most interviewers will (or should) ask you if you have any questions for them. They are expecting you to either say no or ask about further clarification regarding the employment process. What they are not expecting is to have the interview turned around on them for a brief moment, which will in turn make them slightly more vulnerable as the role is reversed. You can do this with one simple question:

""What is it about my resume/application/CV and/or skill set/background that motivated you to contact me to join the team?""

The wording is very important here. ""Motivated"" is a strong term often used in the business environment to denote positivity and encouragement. Motivation can also be used critically, such as ""you lack the motivation to do X or Y"". The word triggers something as it's usually used by managers, and they are typically not ready to address it when it is directed toward them. Also, to join \*the\* team as opposed to \*your\* team signals two things: your intention to maintain a sense of agency once you become employed, and firm acknowledgement that a team does not belong to one individual. Hence, you wish to join and only acknowledge \*the\* team as opposed to their team.

An interviewer or group of interviewers should be familiar with your resume, and they should have a firm grasp on your qualifications for the work. Moreover, they should know exactly why they chose yours over someone else's, and they should be able to answer this question with little difficulty. I'll give you an example of two very real answers I've had to this question when I posed it to interviewers, though there might be some mild paraphrasing. I do, however, remember exactly what my responses were because I practiced them.  

&amp;#x200B;

1.)Interviewer: ""You met the requirements for the job. I don't know what you want me to say to this. We're looking for people who can go above and beyond the minimum requirements that the institution demands, and can demonstrate the proper initiative to serve the needs of this department without being prompted to do so.""

Me: ""I can see you were not prepared for this question. This is unfortunate, as I arrived prepared for this interview. My time and investment in my future are personal to me and my family, and while I appreciate your time I can see that this is not professionally reciprocated. I remember the way I came in, and will see myself out. Thank you.""

2.)Interviewer: ""Your internship and the additional coursework you took in the sub-field immediately stood out to us. We've been hoping for someone to join the department who has this extra training, as it opens up more possibilities and avenues to explore with respect to your skill set. We're looking for individuals who have the greatest potential to move up, and do so knowing they have our support.""

Me: ""I genuinely appreciate the thoughtfulness of your response. I look forward to joining the team.""  

&amp;#x200B;

It's probably very clear which one is the better of the two examples, and which one was successful. The first one demonstrates a typical ""manager"" while the second exemplifies a ""leader"". Managers do not care about you, your work prior to arriving for that interview, nor anything beyond data and figures. They are the armchair generals. You are a cog and a pawn. You serve a purpose until you don't, after which you will be discarded. Leaders clearly lead from the front, and are prepared to address the strengths of those around them as integral to improving the whole. They address you as a person. To them, your weaknesses are unrealized strengths, and they will uplift you to help you find that. Leaders understand that an interview actually goes both ways.

Everywhere from corporations to academia suffer from a lack of leaders, but they are out there. Don't suffer yourself to settle or sacrifice your humanity for some manager that doesn't give a ripe shit about you. Jobs will come and go, opportunities will ebb and flow, but your life is only one to live. If this, in any way, helped you find an extra way to determine if you're going to end up somewhere that will destroy you, then my purpose of writing it is realized. Go in ready to take charge, fight the fights you can, and demonstrate that you are actually in control. The right people will actually see that as the initiative and motivation they were looking for. Don't ever settle for less than you're worth."

SO much about the U.S. education system is fake and unequal to the max, to put it lightly (the SAT is FAKE for starters). Do not take college admissions to heart! Do not let this reflect your self worth or put bounds on what you think you can do to make the world a better place!

Really cannot remember, but I know I won two competitions associated with Columbia and those were #1 and #2 (both not super prestigious). A minor state-wide debate award was probably #3, national merit semifinalist was #4, and AP Scholar was #5.

**Letters of Recommendation**

AP Econ teacher, 8/10 - We were really close, I took her class and TA'd for her senior year. I got to read it and it was very sweet and positive, but not necessarily ""she is the smartest most genius person ever"" material.

AP Calc AB teacher, 7/10 - He gets a looootttt of rec requests because he's so popular. I struggled hard in that class and was trying to present a growth narrative, but I don't know how that worked out for me.

Counselor, 6/10 - She's a public school counselor, what can I say, but we were comparatively close and I made an effort to visit her and give her holiday presents over the years. (She also watched me get bodychecked by my terrible ex-boyfriend in the hallway walking to her office, so that brought us closer together!)

Supplemental, school district chief, 8/10 - Worked under him my junior -&gt; senior summer and he loved me, told me that I was outstanding among the students he had worked with (and then told me that I would have a great future standing up to the damn liberals, but hey that's neither here nor there)

Supplemental, high-level politician for my state, 7/10? - She was affiliated with my policy/government related extracurricular and I worked closely with her staff who wrote the letter and then she signed off on it (which I've found is a pretty common practice for letters of rec, at my job now working with high schoolers we have a template - albeit glowing). Columbia alum.

**Interviews**

Oh god. I think I'm generally a pretty good public speaker especially when you put the STEM folks on the bell curve (uhhh, debate team captain, hello).

When they went well they went really well - e.g. Bowdoin interviewer compared me to Christiane Amanpour in a follow-up email, I would also put Harvard in this category.

Some of them just went OK - e.g. Barnard, Georgetown, Pomona.

Annnnd some of them were not good - e.g. in the year of the Yale kiss story, my Stanford interview story was like the third or fourth most upvoted terrible interview story in A2C (yeah it was THAT BAD). I cried in the parking lot and ate three donuts after my Columbia interview because he said he ""wouldn't waste money on my major."" Yale was also in this category.

**Essays**

This is hard to summarize -

Common app essay, 9/10 - An edgy take on Asian-American cultural differences and my interest in social justice. I talked about a really taboo topic (think drugs, sex, rock n roll, but no illegal activity!!!) I worked so so hard on it. Yes, writing about being Asian-American in the ""they said my lunch stinks"" way is cliche, but it was definitely not that I think.

Supplements were all over the place, because I applied to SO MANY SCHOOLS (mostly out of fear of having to go to gasp, a state school - but state schools are incredible options and I realize I was being so stupid in retrospect, mostly because I just hated my hometown, so very Lady Bird of me).

But ANYWAYS, a lot of the school specific ones were quite average because I wrote them in the days leading up to the deadline. With a re-read I actually really like them and feel like they represent me, but I thought they really only hit one thematic note which was my interest in social justice (that could be a good thing because it developed a spike, or a bad thing because I came off as less of a real person to admissions officers). Being driven by social justice is definitely a big part of me, but I wish I had time to refine and really tease out different aspects of myself.

**Additional Information:**

Waitlist things!!!

Quarantined at home, I went HARD for the three waitlists I was on. AdmissionsMom's post (as well as every post she makes) was immensely helpful here, but here is a take-with-a-grain-of-salt summary of some things I did:

* Genuinely, there was an uptick of impressiveness in my extracurriculars from Covid times on. I got involved in some very notable national political work in March 2020, and received accolades that really weren't on my original application - think New York Times level stuff. (Of course, I only had those opportunities because I was passionate about what I did in high school so continued to do it, even when apps were submitted!)
* I also was involved in a spot of \~ controversy \~ with speaking out against some of the schools' policies that I was in the review/WL process for. I interacted with admissions offices, thankfully only in a positive capacity, relating to this.
* For each of the schools I was WL'd at, I contacted a current student (like a tour guide, leader for one of the competitions I had been involved in) and spoke to them about their experience at the school. Then, I talked about this experience in my LOCI.
* For schools that didn't accept a LOCI, I used an email finding browser extension to search for my regional admissions officer's email and then POLITELY emailed them ONCE with a quick update about my new extracurriculars. (I don't feel bad for this at all, because private school counselors have a rolodex of these emails and are in the ears of these regional admissions officers for their students, so advocate for yourself!)"

Hey guys. I'm a student who tried getting into business, but I realized that I just don't have the social skills necessary to thrive in that kind of area; I flubbed a lot of my internship interviews because I didn't learn it and frankly didn't care to learn what I was working about because it seemed like just an easy pass to money.

I recently internally transferred schools, so I'm in my uni's business school now, and I took a Python class and an MIS class and I really enjoyed the Python class (the MIS class not so much but that was because it was extremely obvious what I was being taught), and was considering a career in CS (thinking software development or management specifically, but I'm not beholden to anything at this point) because my Python class was far from my first time coding. Additionally, I'm extremely good at math, good with syntax and learning languages, and also learn languages extremely quickly (so I did get a hang of Python quite quickly as well), so I figured that my skills best lend themselves to a field in computer science. There are also some reservations I have on career culture and the way I like to work that best lend themselves to compsci, but I'm not gonna get into those.

I'm likely going to finish college with a BS in business administration, concentration Management Information Systems, which is the most pertinent degree to CS I could probably finish out with without delaying my graduation (unless business analytics is more pertinent?). My only fear though is that it's too late for me to learn CS; I was considering getting a master's in computer science to bolster my chances and trying for that, but I'm completely blind to how all of this works. I'm not sure as to the recruiting timeline, or if there even is one, so I believe that it is definitely too late to try for any kind of CS internship (because I'd need a portfolio and to learn the language).

What do you guys think? I'm completely blind here, and I'm reading the FAQ and some recent posts, but there's not a lot of pertinent info to my situation there because:

- I don't really have all the time in the world to learn the ins and outs of CS and SD since I'm nearing the end of college. If I had the gift of foresight, I'd be better but I'm not.

- I'm in in high school nor am I a postgrad working a job that I **need**!!!! to get out of

- I'd like to get started as quickly as possible on something tangible so that I can at least know if I should apply for jobs in senior year or grad school; I've already accepted an internship in something relevant in junior year is a foregone conclusion.

 I have a good GPA (3.77), so I could be competitive for some good programs and whatnot, but I'm not really sure how to tackle getting my foot in the door. I'm a quick learner so I am ready to get some books and start things, but I'm really overwhelmed due to so many options and feeling like I have little time. Help me out here?

EDIT: I'm taking a course similar to my Python one next semester. I'm thinking of asking my professor if there's any research opportunities that I could perhaps get in on, I'm not sure how to approach that though."

Feel free to give your input on this. Thank you. I've been struggling the past 2 yrs with finding a job. I'm almost 27 now, living at home, barely have anything for myself really. Then an internship opportunity came in aboit last week, a paid one at that. I'm yet to start on it as it resumes in Feb. Where i'm from, i'd really want to do it in the city, not just because it's a bigger sphere, also just to be my own. As sad as that sounds, i could really use a break from people around me here, try to be independent as a person, have independent thoughts. My mom though doesn't want me to go to the city, she claims it's expensive, once i'm taxed and all that, i won't have much left to sustain me (this is true. It's an expensive life there). Thing is, our relationship is..rough, even with my dad. They're controlling af, even when it comes down to things like how i should do my hair, what medicine i need to take, &amp; i'm tired of it all. If i stay back for this job, i just might go nuts haha. Worse, i know i won't grow. At all. I'm fkn almost 27 yrs old, and i can barely go the doctor's on my own. I know it's going to be rough, esp getting something to add onto the internship money to sustain me (again, it's tough in my country to even secure one thing); but i try to write stuff--doesn't pay much, and it's almost like betting, therefore not really stable as i'd wish. But i want to be in the city, literally be thrown among the wolves analogy. I feel, i know i need to grow, idk how, maybe as an individual person, as a citizen e.t.c., but i just need to. I love my parents with all my being, but this is about me now i feel like, &amp; i know they won't take it well as usual. What do you guys think? Thank you."

On the other hand, I wanted to take our getting back together step by step and not be all over each other and love each other with same intensity. Truth is I messed up, I was terribly tired after exams, I wasn't sleeping well and I wanted to rest but Being with her I felt more frustrated and everything sapped my energy, I couldn't keep up with the constant complain about how life is boring, how she is not traveling, how she is going through a rough phase ( which for me wasn't the case since she just found a job and she is getting paid well and her parents pay her rent, which is an amazing thing at 24 years old, and she is rich). While I'm in my last year and my parents won't finance my life no more, I didn't find an internship yet but still I see life through the glass that half full and it is amazing. 
The point is I could be there for her, I couldn't care for her as I used to be, I was above all more annoyed more bothered since we hang out for 4 days and she got a list of things that bothered her about me like not saying thank you and nit refusing lasagna that she wanted to save for tomorrow which I had no clue about it. And I'm tired if validating her emotions and giving her all my attention and being attentive to everything, I just wanted to be me and please myself for once. 
I admit I did hurt her, I messed up but I choose my peace of mind since I can't take of 2 people but only me since It is rough for me financially and the anxiety and stress are taking a toll all over me and I became a complainer as well, hating on people and then loving them the next day, I just got to become super toxic by gaslighting and not caring about nothing other than me. 
I just wish I will have the courage to forgive myself and move on with my life, please myself and achieve the things I want to do in life.

Dear \_\_\_

I am writing to apply for the role of an art sales assistant at (gallery). What attracts me to this role is the level of quality that is expected with relevant experience, knowledge and skills that I have developed in my professional and academic background. I would like to take this opportunity to elaborate on this to demonstrate what makes me an appropriate candidate for this position.

In my professional experience, I am currently working as an events representative for (Artists association). The purpose of my role is to attend events, such as art fairs and open studios events, to promote (the association) to artists looking to build their careers and enlist them as a member, their chief measure of sales. I have refined my networking skills and contributed to a high standard of client relations with the artists I have registered. This is particularly relevant for this role with regard to supporting the Client Director in maintaining and growing client relationships. Additionally, preparing information for art fairs and exhibitions is a directly transferable skill for this role.

In connection to the tasks involving updating mailing lists, customer folders and online systems, there are two notable examples that highlight my ability in this area. As an intern at --- (a London tech start-up), I was responsible for creating e-newsletters which made me familiar with Mailchimp. I am very efficient with organising digital storage and creating a usable framework that can be easily maintained. My work with --- (a commercial property firm), demonstrates this. I was given the task of creating a digital archive for their collection of nearly 500 artworks to be accessed by their cultural development team. Regarding the interpersonal skills required for this role, my work in the hospitality sector has taught me that communicating in a polite and confident way is always important. I worked at a (restaurant 1) and more recently at a (restaurant 2) I have also worked in a sales environment as a receptionist at  (car dealer) I greeted customers, handled phone calls and helped with the general upkeep of their showrooms. All of these roles gave me experience in conducting myself professionally.

My strong interest in art is evident from my degree choice of history of art as an undergraduate at the University of --- , where I graduated with a 2:1. My module choices in museology and curatorship, as well as art law, encouraged me to pursue further studies in the practical side of the arts industry. I studied Arts Management, Policy and Practice as a masters degree at the University of ---, and graduated with a Merit. I learnt about the cultural sector and creative industries from a business management perspective in a very in-depth way. Having degrees in both history of art and arts management makes me able to appreciate creative expression and make pragmatic considerations about art with equal ease.

My focused yet flexible attitude towards working enables me to combine the strongest aspects of my personality and skills. I am able to work confidently on my own and in a team. I am very well suited to work in the arts industry in a role that has a strong focus on organisation and communication skills. I would be honoured to be involved with the opportunities offered by working as an art sales assistant at (gallery).

When it comes down to picking the college I will be attending soon for EE, I figured I'd ask how actual engineers view them and the job opportunities from them post college. 

Wentworth Institute of Technology (lower ranked school, 2 semester co-op program) 

Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (higher ranked, larger school, ties with Boeing, NASA, SpaceX)

Both schools are at no cost thanks to scholarships so that is not a consideration. ERAU seems to have a larger name recognition throughout the country, which may lead to easier time with internships and hiring.

I intend to apply for PhD programs next year in computer vision or machine learning, and I am worried about how competitive I will be applying straight out of undergrad. My dream would be to attend Berkeley, Stanford, MIT, CMU. 

GPA: 4.00/4.00 (but I still have two more quarters)

GRE: I still need to take GRE, but there is a huge trend of making them optional. Is it worth devoting time to studying for and taking it?

Research experience: Since freshman year, I have been conducting research in a lab that focuses on computer vision, signal processing, and machine learning. It is led by a successful electrical engineering professor (h-index 80+). In sophomore year, I was accepted into and participated in a Google research mentorship program. I have not had much luck in receiving research internships, but fingers crossed for this summer! Freshman year, I applied for and received a competitive research grant at my school. 

Publications (chronological): 

1) Senior year of high school, my single-authored paper was accepted into a low-tier microscopy journal. 

2) Freshman year of college, I was involved in a large group project, resulting in a workshop paper at MICCAI (A level conference). I was sixth author. 

3) Freshman-Sophomore year, 5th author on a landmark paper in a top tier journal (Radiology). 

4) Sophomore year, 5th author on a paper in a relatively respected microscopy journal (Microscopy and Microanalysis). This paper was based on a collaboration not within my main lab. 

From sophomore year to current, I became more involved in leading my own projects. 

5) First author paper (just me and my advisor) in AAAI-22 student abstract program. 

6) Based on reviews before the rebuttal phase, I am fairly optimistic that my first-author paper can be accepted into ICASSP 2022. 

I am worried because I don't have any publications in NeurIPS, CVPR, ICLR, etc. I am working on an interesting project right now and will try my best to shoot for ECCV or NeurIPS, but that is definitely a lofty goal. 

Other info: Goldwater scholar as a sophomore. My main advisor and I have a very nice dynamic. We meet every week and he treats me like a grad student. So I feel like his recommendation letter would be very strong. Another professor I work with let me read his letter, and he compares me to his PhD students. 

I am really grateful for all the opportunities I have been granted. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!"

So this post is to ask for some advice and get some general opinions on possible career paths I guess (Not sure if this falls under repetitive, hope not), this might be a bit long, I apologize beforehand.

&amp;nbsp;

To give some background, I am a 26-year-old Android Developer, I work in Spain, but I'm asking here since it seems like a general doubt rather than a regional/continental one? And there are more opinions here.

I've been working as an Android Developer since 2017, I started with a sort of Bootcamp (something similar), had my internship, stayed there for a year and have switched like 3 times since then.

After finishing my Bootcamp and working for a year I decided that I ""should"" go back and get an official bachelor's degree in computer science since it seemed important somehow? And I thought if I ever wanted to go and work for a MANGA company they might filter candidates by degrees and I wouldn't stand a chance from the get-go. 

&amp;nbsp;

Since then, I started a long-distance degree, but since is not full time I can only pick so many classes depending on how much free time I have. If my math doesn't fail me, I'm still 3/4 years away from graduation assuming I don't fail any class.

Also since then, I have started thinking about whether I want to continue and whether I ""should"". Most of the classes I take aren't that interesting to me nor useful for my job. And they don't come ""naturally"" to me, so I have to put in a lot of effort that I don't always have. After working for 9 hours I don't always feel like studying.

Going back to my possible MANGA aspirations, it seems to me that having a degree is not a requirement per se? I might be wrong, I applied to Amazon and although I didn't get an offer it didn't seem to me that it was because of my lack of a degree, if anything it feels like I should do more leetcode (sounds like circlejerk, I'm sorry).

So I keep going back to ""should I continue this? what's the point?"" or if should focus on studying other stuff, or getting certifications? study specific courses? study something I enjoy as a hobby? (I do think I should study more math since I struggle with advanced calculus...), I'm mostly full of doubts.

&amp;nbsp;

I hope this doesn't come across as rambling nonsense, and thanks for any insight anyone can give!"

There is this guy though that nitpicks everything I do and if I make some mistakes immidiately sends comments like „did you even read it“ looks like total dogshit, etc. with the review.
He is definitely someone who is doing good work and moved up fast though.

Again everybody else is happy and thanked me for my good work.

One time I prepared something for him exactly like it was done a couple months ago even though there were imo some mistakes but decided not changing it due to fear of him attacking me again, in the morning I woke up to a bunch of messages like what the hell am I doing, Etc. I knew it would result in this so I prepared a mail as a response that wasn‘t like I normally do as in answering sorry/will fix/..

It was honestly a bit passive agressive, reasoning why I did it that way + send him the work from couple months ago that it was same and the mistakes he picked out were mistakes from the last one that wasnt done by me…

Afterwards it was like a 180, he didnt respond but no more bad comments, always very nice, went to lunch a couple times and is extremely supportive.

What the hell? I dont understand the sudden change, was it just because I called him out/defended myself in a strong tone?
What goes on in ones mind to be a bully for months and talking back once he suddenly becomes a „good guy“."

rw98wp,2,2022-01-04,Struggling to find a remote job as a system administrator EMEA,Bommbassice,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rw98wp/struggling_to_find_a_remote_job_as_a_system/,"Hello guys,

Although there are plenty of similar threads, my problem in finding a remote job in IT is a little bit different, because I already have such a job.

I work as ICT administrator II for two years now, we can work remotely as much as we want, but there are two problems:

1st- my salary is too low - just slightly above 800 euros netto. ( it is above average in my country tho )

2nd- in a current team, with my work responsibilities, it is really hard to grow career experience. - basically, my job is very repetitive and sometimes it does not involve IT work, but process-like things ( creating changes, communicating what and how to do, what is the best solution to do something ).

&amp;#x200B;

Even though there are many repetitive responsibilities in my position, there are few that are above my level of responsibilities - reverse engineering, assisting 3rd level support etc.

I have applied for over 100 positions and I had like 10 interviews - none of them successful. 

As I got desperate to find a better job, I started to study remotely on university, during full time job ( the open university ). Yet, it is not helping.

I am pretty confident with my level of Windows administration, but yet I struggle to find a job. How did you guys start your IT career ?  What is your advice to boost my career? 

What thing that I could use your opinion -  

IT certifications... but which ones?

Internships? Are there remote internships that I could attend even tho I have a full-time job?

Daily CV applications? Is it worth it?

What is the average salary in EMEA for this particular position? Should I be trying to find half time job in a foreign country and expect the same salary? Or should I be at least trying this to get work experience?"
rw99nv,48,2022-01-04,Two for One [First Responder Cycle Story],alexdelacluj,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/rw99nv/two_for_one_first_responder_cycle_story/,"No matter the Alternative, a bar was still a bar, busy or empty or bustling or filled to the brim with easily forgettable, and that made it the perfect place for someone like Chim.

She wasn't someone one could ignore easily. The Elf was tall, with long hair split in halfs right in the middle - one side was blonde, the other one completely dark. But the split didn't stop there. Unlike other people, she was somewhat uncanny, perfectly symmetrical, the two halves having different colors. The right half was pale, almost ghostly, the other one darker. People always compared it to chocolate, but the better comparison would've been to ebony, the dark hardwood found in many places around the world.

Chim sat down at the bar and felt plenty of gazes thrown in her direction. She stopped paying mind to them a long while ago.

The bartender came up and asked what she wanted. The Elf asked for a beer and a bowl of peanuts.

""We don't serve those here. Too many people are allergic. Class Three allergen law and all!"" he explained. Chim nodded, faking understanding and then sipped from her beer. If people here didn't have peanuts she'd have one less pleasant thing to look forward too.

""Thank you. Just so you don't worry, bring me another beer when I finish this one."" Chim said and the bartender smiled, moving away to serve another customer.

The door opened and another person entered, a human. Chim didn't even need to turn to know it was a human. They had a certain step - their massive weight making all floors squeak in ways that alerted Chim's sensitive ears. Judging from the step itself, it was a male.

So before he even pulled the chair to sit next to Chim, she said.

""Sorry, that seat is taken. Waiting for someone.""

""You're waiting for me."" The human said and took the seat. Chim looked at him. He was forgettable. ""Chim, I presume?""

The Elf's ears twitched. *Why do these people always pronounce my name wrong?*

""It's pronounced Kim, like in Kimberly."" She said, giving him a name he could easily pronounce.

The human shrugged. ""I'm sorry. Does it stand for Kimberly?""

""No, it stands for Chimera.""

The human laughed and ordered a beer as well. He then passed something to Chim. ""This is for you. Orville wants it done by tomorrow.""

""So soon? Did he mention anything about my reward?""

The human shrugged again, his shoulders slumped as he looked down at his bottle.

""No idea. I'm not privy to Command directives. Your reputation precedes you, though. I know what you do, I just couldn't ever put a face on your renown.""

It was Chim's turn to shrug. ""Compliments will only get you far enough. I stick out like a sore thumb and the moment you saw me you knew who I was. This thing Orville wants requires subtlety.""

""Then go complain to him. You know where to find him."" The human said, paid for his beer and left the bar without a goodbye. Chim finished her drink, checked her phone. It was seven in the evening. There was still time to find Orville in his office. If not, she'd just drive to his home. He was used to her peculiarities already.

Sighing, Chim paid for her drinks and left, taking the metro to the Command Office of Lunden. The trip was uninteresting, save for three teens that were especially loud in the car. One of them kept checking out Chim's bi-colored skin, but stopped once the elf winked at her. Typical.

The Office was still bustling. Command worked around the clock because humans could be up at all times and being awake at all times meant they could cause trouble no matter the hour.

Like usual, she went through the contractor's entrance and a guard asked her politely to put her weapons away.

""I don't have any. Feel free to check me up."" He did and found none. Chim just scowled and he shrugged. ""Is Orville around?""

""Yeah, should be slumped over his desk, surrounded by paperwork.""

Chim had been in dozens of Command buildings across several Alternatives and they were all labyrinthine. What helped is that they were usually made in the same layout, so once you figured out where things were supposed to be, you were set for life. She took the elevator to the agent offices and was welcome to an open-floor area with several desks.

Clicks of typewriters reached her keen ears. Humans loved their papers - even if they were the inventors of the computers, some of them powerful enough to command machines capable of reaching the moon.

""Orville!"" she called out, noticing the man at his desk and approaching him. Several others looked at her as she strode to the desk. A poor intern dropped a mug of coffee. She didn't stop to help her clean the mess.

""Chim. You are... here."" He sounded surprised.

Chim pressed her hands onto the desk and looked at the human from above a stack of papers. ""You're asking me the impossible.""

""Why, I thought a tracker of your reputation would find this task easy."" He sounded condescending briefly, but then he sighed and leaned back in his chair, studying the elf. ""I need you to do it. Once you do, you will get your reward.""

""No! I track people, I don't barge into their house to steal--""

""Not here!""

Orville's eyes darkened and he got up, picking his coat from the backrest of the chair. ""Come.""

Chim followed Orville to the balcony of the open space. Several agents were on break, smoking cigarettes and chatting. Chim noticed all of them heading inside, some snuffing their smokes mid-way. Orville took out a pack and lit one, offering Chim too. Shaking her head, she tapped her foot.

""Well?""

""Chim, this is a job for me, not for Command.""

The words were spoken calmly, as Orville was looking down River Thames and into the distance, beyond the skyline of Lunden.

""My alternates are being murdered. Command will barely allow me to investigate and I'm stuck doing paperwork with no field agents under my command.""

Chim suddenly realized that Orville was bothered by this in a way she could never understand.

""Do all people with alternates feel compelled to protect the others?""

Orville shrugged. ""No idea. The Psychology Department is still trying to find that out. Alternates are not that different. They gravitate towards the same kind of jobs, they're always the same age, have the same parents. You know all that...""

""I do. I wonder what it's like.""

Chim asked for a cigarette this time. The revelation of Orville's real problem was interesting, to put it mildly. It was a rare occasion to see a human distressed.

""How many of you were killed?""

""Seventeen. The last one was found in an Alternative without humans. He was dragged there - as a warning for that Alternative's Orville.""

""Who is not a human.""

He nodded. ""Precisely. I have no idea who he is. A friend of mine went there a few days ago and found her alternate, recruiting her and her boyfriend. But that's all she can do.""

""That still doesn't explain why you want me to travel all the way up to the 1st and bring your first alternate's father all the way back here. By tomorrow.""

""I can't tell you everything, because the walls have eyes and ears. But my first alternate's father is still alive, unlike my other alternates'. I need to have a chat with him. He can help me with something.""

Chim sighed. ""I don't like this.""

""Neither do I."" Orville replied. ""Trust me, I wish I could tell you more, but I don't want to drag you down with me if I fail."" He paused to drag from his cigarette and then threw the butt off the balcony with a dismissive gesture. ""Command is aware of other people like you, Chim. People with no alternates. I've seen the readings of the new Alternative. There's a high chance you'll encounter people like you there.""

He looked right into her eyes and offered the most disarming smile Chim had ever seen. Puppy eyes and all.

""Bring my dad from the 1st and I'll make sure you can slip in that Alternative unnoticed."""

I am a junior in EE graduating in June 2023. I have experience in PCB design, C/C++, java, python, Verilog, electrical testing. I am looking to pick an internship that can lead me to a full-time job that fulfills several things for me (High pay, Good Work/Life Balance, Building skills easily transferable to other roles).

The roles I got an offer for are:

Caterpillar(EE intern): schematic/PCB design, EMC and sensor testing, coding in c or python(he left it up to me to do what I want) in Illinois pay: 26 hr.

AMD(Microprocessor VLSI design intern) [https://jobs.amd.com/job/Ft-Collins-Summer-2022-Co-Op-Intern-113982-Colo/787899800/](https://jobs.amd.com/job/Ft-Collins-Summer-2022-Co-Op-Intern-113982-Colo/787899800/).

Intel (Electrical EMC Engineering Intern): Testing shielding integrity, circuit/cable interface isolation, and using the models to mitigate and control. Survey production and lab areas and develop contour maps of magnetic and electric fields and assembly and production areas for ESD phenomena and propose mitigation as needed. (Oregon).

I am honestly leaning towards AMD because of the type of work and potential for opportunities after graduation. Would love to hear advice from everyone.

Thank you."

  This is my first interview for such position and I have little ideas about what I should prepare for the 2nd interview. Do you guys have any insights on this? I tried Blind and Glassdoor but all the reviews are for SWE rather than DevOps.

It's for an SWE role which is an umbrella for more specific roles in ML, Front-end, Back-end etc.

However, in the mail, I've been told that my interview will be on Back-end related questions. While confirming the interview date, I wrote an entire paragraph talking about how I have work-ex in ML &amp; AI and would love to be considered for those roles, which I thought would be gently communicating my interest. The response was a thanks for letting me know. Later on, I again checked what technologies should I expect at the interview, so I can prepare better, I have been told Back-end again! 

I want to let them know that I have 0 experience in back-end and that I want to interview for ML, but I am afraid I'll lose the only chance that I have gotten this far. 

Back in my country, if the recruiter asks you to bend, people crawl. But I understand that the recruiters are open to communication in the US.

rwckxt,1,2022-01-04,Should an EE major interested in aerospace get a CS minor?,kale_lol,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/rwckxt/should_an_ee_major_interested_in_aerospace_get_a/,"I'm an Electrical Engineering major, and I am considering adding a Computer Science minor. I am more into the aerospace field and am hoping to go into that field (whether for companies or the gov) post-graduation. In addition to my EE coursework and labs, I also really enjoy programming, so I am trying to determine if I should add a CS minor. The CS minor would be 20 credit hours, 4 of which I have already completed, and 10 of the remaining 16 could count as my technical electives. I currently do not have room in my schedule for the remaining 6 credit hours, but I could take some math courses through a community college over the summer and transfer them in to make room for a CS minor. (I am also trying to figure out how this would work with pursuing internships. I hope to intern 3-4 times throughout my undergrad degree.) Overall, if I do indeed pursue a CS minor, I will probably have 18 (+?) credit hours for all of my remaining semesters. 

Basically, I am wondering if getting a CS minor is really worth it considering my goals. Does anyone have any thoughts?

(Also, I am currently in my uni's honors program, but I am willing to withdraw from it as necessary. At this point, I am really only in it for scheduling preference.)"

Third year university CS major here.
This is the time where applying for internships is critical. I’ve applied to a total of 31 so far which is a lot lower than you should apply to. This may sound like an excuse but I have not been in the best mental place last semester, which decreased my motivation to do schoolwork and apply for internships all together.
I recently found out that I got rejected from Amazon, and got rejected from capital one a couple months ago. Those where the only two places that asked me to do a coding assessment/interview. A few others rejected me, and I haven’t heard back from anywhere else.
My mom found out about my Amazon rejection, got upset and talked some sense into me. Now I’m worried that I’m not going to get an internship this summer. Planning on applying to maybe about 20 more this week. Any advice is very much appreciated.

Edit: a friend told me that by February it will be much harder to find an interview. I’m not sure if this means I lost my chances completely and will never be getting an internship, because I hope that is not the case."

One thing I did want to ask was I also have a bunch of personal projects I have worked on, is that something I should include in the resume? I didn't include it because it would take up more than a single page. Would you recommend I make an online portfolio for them and link it in the resume?

I was a direct admit to ENGRUD but was placed into ECE (I know it can be used, etc etc but I'm far more passionate about the content covered in CmpE). 

I know people work SUPER hard and get rejected so I am sure it is pretty hopeless but thought I might ask for a second opinion if I choose to reapply:

* GPA: My gpa was tanked with covid and especially PHYS 12X and family situations - it was absolutely brutal. My GPA is a 3.1 at the moment. &gt;\_&lt;
* CS Courses: 
   * I have taken CSE 142, 143 (while the grades aren't super high, they are higher than all my other grades by far except VLPA, DIV, W)
   * CSE 190: Lab that went with CSE 142 and helped with fundamentals
   * CSE 390H: I was one of 18 students to take an honors CS course with Professor Reges where he talked about how CS people approach problems, common issues, etc.
   * CSE 331: I was lucky and secured a spot today in this course (I really wanted it and worked super hard to get into it with my petition, emails, etc)
   * CSE 373: Also taking this course this quarter with Kevin Lin - so far, I really enjoy the content.
* Research
   * I am currently a member in a research lab of 100+ people and have quickly became a high ranking technical writer with grant proposals being funded for the lab.
   * I am also the finalist in two competitions for a project I'm working on (I am working with 1 other but I am definitely pulling my own weight for the competitions). It is quick possible this project is becoming a startup within the next month, in which case I will be a startup leader? That's wild.
* Extracurriculars
   * I am currently the director of a Hackathon that is later this year and leading committees, securing sponsors, obtained MLH status, etc. I have spearheaded this.
   * I am an ECE TA where I work with assignments, exams, course materials, etc.
   * I have continuously worked since sophomore year in high school and have worked at a grocery store since the start of covid for 20hrs a week
* Internship
   * I am desperately trying to get one and just got the book Cracking the Coding Interview to assist with interviews
* Family
   * I have a disabled sibling that I also help my family care for 3 days a week. :)
* High School stuff
   * FBLA President and 4 statewide awards and national finalist
   * ASB Treasurer, Link Crew, NHS, Tri-M Honor Society
   * 3.7 GPA and then 4.42 GPA Weighted
   * 12 AP courses with scholarship with distinction twice, even during covid senior year
   * Orchestra
   * a KILLER personal statement

I have very strong writing skills so I am sure my personal statement would be as good as possible - but I do not feel my application is enough (will it ever be?) I only discovered my passion for CS when I got to UW and I am so annoyed - I feel I was a stronger applicant back before covid, when I applied to UW (but regrets dont help) 

If there is no chance for UW CS or CmpE, I am strongly considering switching to UWB CSSE which has coursework that aligns with things I very much would enjoy ...

rwgz6e,0,2022-01-05,How do I turn down a subsequent internship offer after I have accepted a full time offer at an organization?,upaupmaupa,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/rwgz6e/how_do_i_turn_down_a_subsequent_internship_offer/,"I have been offered a full time role that I have accepted. Soon after that I was offered an internship at the same organization for the next 6 months, before I start working full time. I am a final year UG student. The organization a tech based company with around 1500 employees.

I would like to decline the internship for two reasons-

1. I want to look for more opportunities while I'm still a student
2. I have a startup that I've been working on for a while and that's my priority at the moment

Doing this will definitely become more difficult if I accept the internship right now. So, I want to write an email to turn down their internship offer. However, I also want to hold on to my full time offer at this company because I have been offered great pay. (I've been working on automating my business, so that'll be my side hustle while I'm working this job until it starts making me more money than this job.)

When I tried talking to the HR  about a week ago, she told me that I'm not required to do the internship prior to the job. However, she strongly suggested I do it anyways because it would be a ""good learning experience"".

As you probably understand, my circumstances (those two reasons) aren't something I can explicitly talk to her about (they're obviously red flags from an employer's POV).

How should I tackle this situation?"

Currently I am working at a job where I was hired as a software dev, but I’ve been largely roped into conducting basically all IT for the business by my boss.

Well, about a year ago, we started having to implement NIST compliant cyber security for some stuff that we handle, and I got stuck with doing basically every aspect of this.

Over the last year I’ve gotten a lot done in terms of the paperwork and implementing systems, but the IT side of things has never been my strong suit, and now I feel incredibly stuck.

I don’t know almost anything about what solutions in the real world are best for monitoring for CUI transmission, or how to implement MFA on Windows Server, or even really how to work with the server at large.

Now I just feel exhausted and defeated, even after a week off for the holidays(though I did spend more than half of it sick and in bed.) I don’t know what to do anymore as I spend almost all day at work browsing the internet trying to learn about this stuff, but the progress is almost non-existent. My boss also absolutely refuses to contract any kind of external help, despite that I’ve explained things, and I’m probably burning enough hours that a consultant would be cheaper.

I’m honestly terrified every morning of going to work, because of the anxiety I feel about this. I can barely sleep, making my performance even worse, and contributing to a recent tardiness.

I feel like I’m at the end of my rope. I really need help from someone who knows what they’re doing."

Then after graduating, I did a 9 months internship with a management consulting company and I really loved the environment there as well as working within a team. I really felt like I’m learning a lot and growing pretty fast. 

Sadly, after the 9 months of internship and due to financial collapse of my country (Lebanon), the company didn’t hire me (in fact, they didn’t even invite me to an interview even tho my work was really good with them and they were always satisfied and I literally gave it all I had cause I just wanted to get a job and settle). I didn’t really talk to the HR much after My internship came to an end. I guess I should’ve followed up with them more on that matter but back then my mental health was shit, I was really anxious that the country was falling apart and there’s no way for me to make a living other than to actually get that job. 

Anyways, after leaving the management consulting company, I decided to start working on a Dropshipping store which will allow me to get income from abroad. I spent around 7 months taking courses in 2021 and learning all different things an online store requires. Then after came the practice. Sadly, until now, I have made no sales and my investors are running short on money so I really need to find a job now and start investing in my website more and more. 

I also found a passion last year for coding so I learned HTML and CSS and they helped me with the coding my website (I added those skills to my resumé). And I also really got into blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. I got the hang of the fundamentals and even started working as freelance researcher about different projects and their uses. 

Currently, I’m really lost, I’m taking the Mckinsey Forward Program which is supposed to introduce me to the business world but I’m not really sure where I want to go next. 

I definitely don’t want a work in a laboratory as I’ve had a few internships there and didn’t find myself working in a lab for the rest of my life. What would you suggest that I do from here? Can I possibly pursue a career in blockchain that doesn’t require prior learning? Maybe a research analyst in blockchain or for cryptocurrencies?  

I am also applying to many positions on linkedin but my profile is definitely not optimal (recently I took Microsoft Word, ppt and excel quizes for the badges). 

Thank you for your time!"

For the first 2 months, there was a full time training ( and hands-on assessments ) on full stack java development. My background ( internships and personal projects ) is also in full stack development, and I enjoy working on it. 

The problem is that after the training, I got allocated to a project in the manufacturing domain which involves working with Simulation tools and data integration, and some programming in the tool specific programming language. Basically, so far I have only been assigned work related to understanding the industry and some more training related to the tools. 

I am frustrated for not having any actual work to do, no value creation , so I started applying for other companies and always struggle to answer what I have been working on so far in interviews. I am also scared about the fact that the ""work"" on the current project is not really core software development. 

I'm actively looking for the job switch, but as it can take some time and I am scared if I stay any longer in this organization , I will become irrelevant in the software dev industry.

Can you please provide any advice on what should I do in this situation? Will having some more personal full stack development projects help recover the time I have lost?"

My boss is very hands off so I ask a lot of questions, but sometimes it feels like they expect me to come up solutions really quick. I just want to do a good job and show that I am tryouts by my best, how do you guys deal with fitting in and battling imposter syndrome?

I also want to work here after I graduate, how and when do I bring up the conversation for a full time role? Or do I wait for them to come to me? Do you guys think that decision is also weighed on how I’m learning/ my commitment in this role?

Every species on the council was fascinated by our technological evolution, and how it defied the norms of the galaxy. 

You see, Other species have never really thought about standardized parts or connections. much of their shipbuilding capacity is run by what I can only describe as guilds. Each ship was a masterwork, only able to be repaired, refitted or upgraded by the specific ""guild"" workshops. 

We made a mess of that. 

Our ships couldnt compete on a 1-1 footing. Not at first, especially with the laws restricting what tech we could have access to so that we could ""make our own path"" and other such nonsense.

However, our ships were comparatively cheaper, much easier to repair, refit and retrofit. For example, an Akerri craft outmatches us in speed and agility, but it is expensive to maintain as you must have an Akerri Guildsman to look over the craft, and fix it, which often mean cracking and replacing the polymer shell of the craft.

Human ships had only 55% of the speed, but for the same price as a repair on an Akerri craft you could get four new ships made of common, resilient alloys like steel and tungsten with simple ceramic heat sinks, all of which could be repaired within a week due to the fact that every ship was made so that entire sections were detachable, and replaced with a functioning section. 

and the part that got the guilds fuming? All of this could be done, not by master shipbuilders or guildsmen, but by ordinary tradesmen of any race, with access to relatively simple tools.

While yes, those tradesmen still needed SOME training, it wasnt a lifetime of schooling under masters just to become the equivalent of interns for most of a decade. 

You didnt need to be an engineer to fix or modify human ships. You just needed on average a 2-4 year course in a vocational school, much of which was spent familiarizing the students with the tools, safety regulations, and how to troubleshoot  and figure out what an issue was and how to get to it, and usually, the engineers that had designed the human ship had already thought of how to get a full sized human there, let alone the number of smaller species hanging about the galaxy. 

With this, also came ease of customization. With guild ships, you had to hope you could afford a newer one when yours became obsolete. With human ships? You could replace the reactor and engines with a number of different models. You could enlarge, elongate, or configure the ships how you needed, upgrade individual sections with newer tech, and if the connections had changed since you bought it? Well, a number of companies sold adapters. To this day, there are gen 1 terracorps ships in service. Something that on earth would be a museum piece, the equivalent of a trireme among steamboats, and you wouldnt even notice under all the new tech thats been crammed into it. 

The guilds still exist, almost 200 years on, but they've been forced to change. It's slow going, with a lot of the heads of the guilds still disdaining human designs for their ""inferiority""...but most of their members have grown up surrounded by our ideas. A recent poll found that a large number had even said their first personal craft was human. hell, even the new supercarrier from the Golsar Shipbuilder's guild recently had an internal scandal when it was dicovered that a number of their designers were incorporating terracorps  circuits and Samsung holodevices into the damned thing.

What I want you to understand is this: ""A jack of all trades, and master of none, is still better than a master of one.""

We may never master the speed of the akerri, The strength and armor of the Golsar, or even the detection capacity of the Sirrin...but we dont have to. We just have to be ""good enough"" at everything they arent

Purely for money. I am tech savvy, but that was the extent of it, and thought I would just figure it out along the way. I absolutely despised every second of it, and my mental health hit rock bottom. So I took a gap year, collected myself, and prioritised my mental health over everything and chose to do a 180 to pursue History and Politics at a different russell group university. And it worked! Kinda… 
I graduated in 2020, and have been unable to find a job that in any shape or form utilises my degree. I know I dont set the bar for applications high, because I’ve even been rejected for internships. I work a dead end warehouse job to earn a living, but I cannot get my foot in the door with anything related to what I studied. 
So often I think I should have suffered through the Comp Science degree, and landed a job thats pushing £40k straight out of uni like my friends. Only thing that honestly makes the regret go away is knowing that I probably would off myself if I had stayed.

 I’ve been looking for a job for months since October. Previously up until October I was working as a paid intern at a public relations company working social media and media production. 

The week they were supposed to tell me if they were extending my contract or not. They told me two days before my contract ended. 

I have two Bachelor Degrees.  One in communication studies and one in journalism with an emphasis in PR. 
 
I’ve been looking for a job and was told about being an educational assistant at this point I had already applied to 20* jobs and hadn’t heard from all except two rejection letters. So I said F- it and applied. Initially I had already missed the deadline but they needed more applicants so they made an exception for me. During the interview I told them my only concern is working with students that lower functioning since I have no experience or educational background. They said it wasn’t an issue and they had several positions open. 

It also took HR over a month to finalize my paperwork(maybe that should have been the red flag?)


.Yesterday was my first day, I gross assignment and will not have any students till next week( students are till on break)
I was given my classroom assignment  and officially told the position I will be taking on which is just a filler post I took since the student hasn’t come back to school but they don’t want to loose the funding. Thank 
I got briefed by the other EA’s about the students we have in the class a lot of them have behavioral issues, it’s a “low incident” class and the main teacher cannot share a lot of details with me about the students and I’m going to need to learn how to  change pull ups.

I am freaking tf out. I wasn’t given too many details on the position when I initially interviews I still don’t even know how much they are going to pay me. I have some experience with people who have special needs. I have a cousin who is high functioning who lives in California and I haven’t seen in years and I used to help my mom when I was younger she used to massage. But other then that I don’t regularly have any interaction with a person of special needs. 

I don’t know what to do and I’m freaking out. I would love a job where I could use my degrees but it just hasn’t happened for me. This was the only job that has responded and I’m tired of being out of a job and leaving my partner to support me. I have no clue what I’ve gotten myself into.
I keep telling myself they wouldn’t have hired me if they didn’t see something in me but maybe their just desperate? If anyone has any advice I’m all ears."

I am 40 years old and currently I work in Law Enforcement. I am a fairly high ranking officer and I make 100k a year. I worked my butt off to get to where I am, but the last couple of years I haven’t been happy with my line of work and I am considering a career change. I would like to explore my options in other fields, preferably some type of IT job.

I am not naïve enough to think that I can go from being a cop to working in some high payed IT position (although that would be nice), but I also don’t want to start out working in a low level, low paying help desk position. I wouldn’t be walking into IT unprepared, although I have no formal IT experience, I have plenty of hands on experience with both hardware and software.

Some background on me; for the past 18 years or so I have been a cop by day and a computer geek by night (or vice versa, depending on the shift I was working). I have spent over 20 years, off and on, coding in several languages as a hobby, I have created software which I have sold, websites and even a semi-successful mobile app. Additionally, I have built all of my computers by hand, setup networks for family and friends and I have a “home-lab” that I built for pen testing, playing with different Linux distros and general shenanigans.

In 2 years I am eligible to retire, although if I leave at only 20 years, I will not make much from my retirement; but I am willing to risk my retirement in order to work in an industry I am more passionate about. Typically, a person would have to work in this profession for at least 30 years to receive really nice retirement benefits. **I am looking to make a change in 5 years**, but I still don’t know what specific job I should be shooting for. I am interested in cyber security, but am unsure about which type of job I should be targeting based on my formal experience as a cop, manager and free-lance geek. I am not willing to take a job that pays less than 80k a year, but I am willing to intern to get formal experience for the next couple of years.

TL;DR: I’m a 40 year old cop looking for a career change into IT, preferably cyber security. I lack formal work experience, but have decades of informal experiences. I’m asking for guidance on what my path should be based on my years of working in law enforcement and my IT hobbies."

Sorry for another post about degrees and whatnot, this is mostly to ask for some advice and get some general opinions on possible career paths I guess, this might be a bit long and I apologize (again) beforehand.

&amp;nbsp; 

To give some background, I am a 26-year-old Android Developer, I work in Spain and I've been working since 2016. I started with a 2-year sort of a degree (I'm not sure of the equivalency outside of here), had my internship, stayed there for a year and have switched like 3 times since then. Here in Spain, I haven't had many problems finding a job or increasing my salary despite having no degree.

But after working for a year I decided that I ""should"" go back and get an official bachelor's degree in computer science since it seemed important somehow? I wasn't sure (and still aren't) about how other countries in Europe feel about no degrees, and also I thought if I ever wanted to go and work for a FAANG (MANGA?) company they might filter candidates by degrees and I wouldn't stand a chance from the get-go.

Since then, I started a long-distance degree, but since is not full time I can only pick so many classes depending on how much free time I have. If my math doesn't fail me, I'm still 3/4 years away from graduation assuming I don't fail any class.

And now I find myself here, thinking about whether I want to continue and whether I ""should"". Most of the classes I take aren't that interesting to me nor useful for my job. And they don't come ""naturally"" to me, so I have to put in a lot of effort that I don't always have. After working for 9 hours I don't always feel like studying.

Going back to my possible FAANG aspirations, it seems to me that having a degree is not a requirement per se as I thought? I might be wrong, but I applied to Amazon and although I didn't get an offer it didn't seem to me that it was because of my lack of a degree, if anything it feels like I should do more Leetcode (sounds like circlejerk, I'm sorry).

So I keep going back to ""should I continue this? what's the point? should focus on studying other stuff? or getting certifications? study specific courses? study something I enjoy as a hobby?"" (I do think I should study more math since I struggle with advanced calculus...), I'm mostly full of doubts.

 &amp;nbsp;

I hope this doesn't come across as rambling nonsense, and thanks for any insight anyone can give!"

I am a bachelor undergraduate, this in Computer Science. So I am mostly looking at big tech and innovative companies. I know Silicon Valley is the place to be for this. Does anyone recommend any companies in those areas? I do have some ideas myself, one of them is Tesla. 

Anyone have had experience at Tesla yet? I most certainly think it will be hard to get hired. Still I got nothing to loose, I can only gain the biggest opportunity in life. 

What time are US internships for spring   mostly getting posted? I know for summer internships this is mostly in the month of September. 

Any general recommendations from students who went abroad for their internship? Europeans who went to the US. Any advice is welcome!"
rwudlt,9,2022-01-05,My Anti-work Story: from Rule-follower to Bullshit Job,askurm,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rwudlt/my_antiwork_story_from_rulefollower_to_bullshit/,"Hey folks, just wanted to share my own story of arriving at an anti-work mentality. I certainly don’t have it all figured out, but taking it day by day here. I just let myself go with the writing, so sure, it’s long.

**TL;DR: Recovering workaholic/perfectionist thought playing by the rules would lead to success. Nope. Now working towards anti-work mentality at a bullshit job.**

A little bit about me currently: \~30 years old, white gay guy from middle/upper-middle class background in the USA. Parents have degrees, grew up in a wealthier suburb of a big city, attended well-funded public schools, etc. Now live and work in a more expensive city.

Anyway, growing up and even today I’m mostly a rule-following type. Following rules is easy for me, comfortable, and it was easy enough through school to be a generally well-behaved kid so as to be mostly ignored or praised. I wasn’t so great socially, so throwing myself into school work, extracurriculars, and a part-time job was comforting, and an easy excuse or way to spend time when there weren't many friends calling me up, especially as a semi-awkward, closeted kid. My parents are averagely successful professionals with degrees, but they were born in the 50s to more traditional families, so that was a part of my upbringing even though I was born in the 90s (and had friends who were being raised by parents born in the maybe more lax 70s). Definitely come from a rule-following family too, and through them and the community felt that college was my only option, that good grades lead to success, and that following rules would too, etc.

I guess I got a little taste of something anti-work adjacent while in high school. I spent one year as an exchange student. Without knowing the language I was sent alone to live with a host family in a lesser frequented corner of the world. It was like a Des Moines, Iowa. A small city, sure, but surrounded for hours by cattle country. I didn’t speak the language or really understand the culture, so succeeding at school and following cultural rules was impossible. After a few months I took a few weeks to just “give up” and try again after I was ready. Consider this analogous to walking off the job. I would sleep through the whole school day, and for about two months I was just a terrible exchange student. But after that period of rest I was able to jump back into things, make some local friends, get the language to conversational fluency, and now look back fondly. I returned to finish high school and after spending a year abroad like that, so many things that were important to me before were no longer. I slashed my amount of extracurriculars and tried to focus on more social things, but still struggled with being a perfectionist and workaholic.

College was much the same. I had a partial scholarship that required a certain GPA, which meant I passed on social activities more often than I should have to study and do projects. Even though there was some wiggle room with the GPA, I aimed for all As. I had some internships, studied abroad again, had good grades, and thought it would be easy to get a job with those stats. No, not really. I had studied something akin to global diplomacy and wanted to get some sort of job in that area. They don’t want an actual degree in that. Turns out they prefer econ degrees or STEM fields to do more technical work.

Eventually 2 years after graduating I hadn’t yet had a full time job and was temping in my current city, dipping into savings from a graduation gift from my grandma, which was supposed to go to student loans, not helping me survive month to month. So much for working hard and following the rules, right?

Eventually a temp job led to something permanent. Even though **I had applied to 50+ other jobs, hardly any got back to me**, and I only received an offer from the temp job. It was at least marginally related to one of my interests. I was supporting policy work at a well known think tank, mostly doing administrative grunt work. I was making $39K full-time in one of the US’s more expensive cities. I was lucky that I found super cheap rent. Anyway, I figured if I work hard I could move up from an assistant role to something that paid more, maybe in research or comms. **I was working with project officers making 3 times as much as me because they had advanced degrees, even though they could never get projects done on time or on budget** (but of course blamed the assistants, right? As if we’re responsible for these major policy documents). Of course, even though they relied heavily on assistants for organizing multi-day meetings, catering, hotels, etc. all over the country, we’re still making literally 33% of the officers’ and directors’ salaries.

I tried multiple times to advocate for myself or apply internally for positions. I interviewed occasionally but never got one. HR was a pain in the ass and would actively try to stop me from communicating with internal position managers because “all communication should go through HR” despite that I personally knew some of the managers and didn’t trust HR to advocate for me (they weren’t). My worst experience of this was having two internal interviews for a position with another team at a higher salary. One day I randomly got a form email from HR that the position was “cancelled” with no explanation. I get that sometimes funding disappears and the positions too, but the people that interviewed me didn’t even reach out to explain. A few weeks later **they reposted the same position at a lower title and salary** and didn’t even offer for me to apply. Not that I would have wanted it at that point

I spent about four years at that think tank getting average salary increases and very small, unofficial “promotions.” I had made a slight name for myself doing some interesting work with virtual events (this was before the pandemic) but nothing that paid off for my pockets. I had steadily been applying to jobs throughout the final two years but still wasn’t getting bites. Again, I was a hard worker, trying to follow the rules, but I was basically broke after expenses and it took months to save up just to make a big purchase or take vacation beyond the city.

But eventually I did get a bite for a coordinator role at a diplomacy org that offered a 20% raise. I accepted the officer and I was thrilled! **It wasn’t quite a “dream job” but it was close, and I thought it would be a good foot in the door. Nope!** I was hired in early 2020, just before the pandemic. This type of work relies on a lot of international travel. That was of course grounded, as were many of my job responsibilities. The whole program I worked on was thrown upside down. And that wasn’t the worst of it. It was also immediately evident to me that the HQ team was highly dysfunctional. The project director was oblivious and the rest of the HQ staff basically hated her. That made it hard for me as a newcomer to really get a sense of things, especially while dealing with the early pandemic. Just awful team culture, plus almost daily 8:30am meetings that might go for hours since we work with offices in Africa where that was the only time that overlapped. After a few months I looked around and thought maybe I could transfer to another team. But then I realized I didn’t like what those teams did either…negotiating contacts for office space in Burkina Faso? No thanks! **I thought I was gonna get to help people in this job, but it was just more office grunt work, only international.**

About 6 months in I knew I needed to start applying to jobs again. It was bad enough that I considered quitting without a follow-up plan. I had enough savings by then, but figured I would try a little longer. Around that time one of my team members left. Three months later as I’m in a final interview for another job, I get an email saying that my direct supervisor has resigned. Three weeks later I have a new offer and put in my 2 weeks. Project director is shocked. I totally let it all out to the HR person in my exit interview how it wasn’t the right team, not good leadership, not a good team environment etc. She was sympathetic, at least.

So early 2021 I start my second job of the pandemic. I’m at a much larger consulting firm and have gotten another 20% salary bump. I’m working in an area I have no experience in, but they don’t need topic area expertise, just someone who can do administrative work. Fine. I’m just trying to get out my dumpster fire of a last job, and **being “passionate” about a job is no longer important to me**. I work 100% of my time with one specific office in the US federal government, and here is where my anti-work mentality starts to grow and flourish. **It takes the federal government almost 2 months to process my background check and get me my working supplies.** It takes them even longer to get my government ID card, which is needed to get into certain digital systems. **They pay me the whole time.** They’re my only client. Even if they’re not really giving me stuff to do–which they aren’t–I’m contracted to work for them and they’re contracted to pay me. After about 2 months I can finally start doing stuff, and it’s super simple. These were tasks I was doing previously for basically half the salary. Gotta love consulting firms and the federal government, right?

Anyway, **I basically have a bullshit job now**. I charge 40 hours to the government per week but am maybe working 3-4 hours a day on average. Even with just that, the federal government team I support loves my work and thinks I’m a super valuable employee even after less than a year. What does this say about the other 12 federal employees on my team who have been doing their jobs for 5, 10 or in some cases 20+ years? Truly the government is full of bullshit workers. There have even been two people on my team who have departed over the last few months. It was so easy to distribute their work among the rest of the team. I mean, it was hardly a blink when they left. If it’s that easy to take on the responsibilities of TWO workers, what were they even doing in the first place? I guess they mastered anti-work before me, and they even get federal government benefits!

As I start this new year, I’m working further on encompassing an anti-work mentality. I already tell my supervisors no, or counter them when they ask for more work. They often ask for new documents or tools when the information already exists in other systems or documents, so I try to question them: Who is really asking for this? If I make this tool will people use it? Will they know where to find it? Who will update it and when? Usually they realize it’s actually unnecessary.

I still struggle with some perfectionism and workaholism. But this year I am working on focusing more on my personal interests, relationships, and ascribing less value to my job.

Anyway, I just wanted to get this out and share in case anyone relates. Thanks all for being such a great sounding board."

rwwcf1,1,2022-01-05,DE vs DE-BI,rudboi12,dataengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/rwwcf1/de_vs_debi/,"I’m currently doing a masters in DS in europe and working as a DE intern at a mid-size tech company (300ish employees) and I’m considering a move to a better brand tech company as a DE-BI —-top startup with around 3k employees. Salary and perks are basically identical.

Only diference is the DE role. While both are in Data Management team, the one I’m at is way more technical than the DE-BI role. I’ve heard that some FANG have this kind of DE-BI role where you are basically a BI-Engineer since you work daily with dashboards and BI tools. In my current role we don’t do any BI, just pure DE with scala. 

My goal eventually is to become a MLE after some years of DE experience. Another thing to consider is that my company DS team is nothing compared to the startup i could join. The most we do is few recommenders and search optimization. The startup have an inhouse research team building crazy stuff with chatbots and RL, and other SOTA applications. 

Which one should I choose? I’m leaning towards the startup but don’t know if I’ll get enough technical experience to be able to transition to MLE in the same company."

rwym17,9,2022-01-05,Very scared of applying to jobs.,Maximum_Extension,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rwym17/very_scared_of_applying_to_jobs/,"Well, the title says it all. I lost my job last semester since I graduated from university and it was a work-study job. I graduated with a stem degree with a decent gpa. I was a god damn good student (that says a lot because I usually don’t have good things to say about myself). 

 In the summer I took a vacation for the first time since starting university with my family. In the fall I joined a certification program and learned some stuff, unsure what I was going to do with my degree. I didn’t look for a job right after I graduated because I had to take care of my siblings who were at the time remotely learning. I got a biology degree. Well, before any of you say anything and start blaming me for getting a “useless” degree please don’t say that to me. I love studying my degree and I loved all my classes, I never had anyone in my family go to college and much less advise me. I basically just stumbled on my degree after two years of taking hard science classes. 

Well, before judging I want everyone to understand how people with degrees like me, end up homeless and with no prospects. It’s because of people like me, who was I to think I had a chance? Well, my family is very poor and my parents had told me that I wasn’t going to college, so I worked my ass off to get into college for free. I did it, but I still had to work my part times and stuff until my mother got sick in the middle of university and died suddenly. I was starting the semester and didn’t want to end up like my mom. So I kept attending amidst abuse and a lot of stuff going on at home. I worked crappy part times as well (I.e cleaning houses and McDonald’s) until I got a good job at school with work study starting my third year. I was so grateful. 

It was a job not related to my major at all, so I don’t have much of an experience working in labs and doing research. I did try to get involved and work with a lab at school but it was not paid and I could not quit my job to do this for free. My siblings needed help so I had to keep working. I would have accepted research even if they paid me very little because it’s not like my work study paid me that much to begin with. 

I just wanted to set this straight because I see this line of thinking a lot in forums about jobs. people like me getting shamed because we either 1.) didn’t get a useful degree and 2.) didn’t get internships. But it seems for the most part the privileged suburban kids giving advice to poor people. 

That’s not to say that the classes I took didn’t teach me anything, they did a lot. The problem is that employers want experience as undergrads in research. I understand, but if I never get a chance how will I get myself out of this hole? Because no one wants to hire me from lack of experience, I have succumbed to working crappy part times like I used to. It’s just a vicious cycle. I feel like I was betrayed by society. It sucks. 

To be fair I haven’t applied to any jobs relating to my degree because of the qualifications listed. That’s why I say this, I can’t even apply. It’s sad. I don’t want to work anywhere else, I’m already Poor. Might as well be poor with something I like. 
 
Now, I’m not trying to give up, but I am scared to apply due to my little experience. I found some listings for research at a big facility in my state, but I am just so scared to click the apply buttons for all my applications. This job isn’t anything too fancy, but I’m sure it’ll help give me some direction. How do I get over my fear?"

These past few weeks I've been doing nothing but applying to entry level positions and practicing leetcode for interviews, but nothing has come out of it besides a handful of rejection letters, complete ghosting's, a couple failed OA's, and my rapidly declining self esteem and overall mental health.

---

Trying to remain optimistic, but am getting super stressed since I was under the impression that this degree was one of the better ones in this day and age as far as job outlook goes. I'm starting to feel like maybe I'm just not smart enough for this field, and that I made a mistake with this degree. I'm really just looking for any practical experience so I can build on my resume and start to pay off my student loans, I'm not trying to get into any fancy companies right away. At this point I am also considering starting to apply for jobs in other fields so I can start making income again, but that will most definitely cut into my studying and prep for these tech interviews and applications, so I'm not sure what to do.

---


When I started college I was a Bio major, and switched into Comp Sci without having any prior knowledge of programming. Because of this, I have much less practical experience with Comp Sci resources, internships, or projects than my peers, and really am only truly comfortable with Java. My resume has gotten many complements, but unfortunately does not speak much for a Computer Science background, which is what employers are looking for. I'm also getting really overwhelmed with these so called ""entry"" level jobs, which usually demand a couple years prior professional coding experience and/or a handful of other languages under your belt to qualify. I was not expecting a job to land in my lap immediately after graduation, but I was hoping that the expectations for a new grad would be much more realistic than what I have been seeing. Is there a place for someone like me who hasn't been programming since they were in utero? 

---


So here I am sitting with my degree in a major that was quite challenging to transfer from as a Bio major with no prior experience with programming, and people keep telling me that I should be proud of the accomplishments and whatever, but I'm feeling that both my degree and myself are pretty useless and out of place here honestly. I thought that excelling in my classes and pushing myself to graduate would pay off in the end, but now I am hundred times more stressed as I feel all my hard work did not pay off and am now in a sort of ""out of the fryer and into the flame"" situation since I'm out of school and jobless and starting over at zero seemingly.

---


I usually lurk on this sub, but today I decided to make an account and post this question to get some advice, as I am truly feeling lost here and am in need of some proper guidance. I should note that I am also quite overwhelmed in what exactly I want to specialize in this field, as there just seems to be so many options. For now I've just been applying to entry level Java SWE jobs as I desire simply *any* experience, but I thought it would be interesting to work in the healthcare field at some point, although everything I see for that requires a different type of degree it seems. Are there any types of jobs I can apply for that aren't as demanding as SWE, but will still count as productive tech experience while I try to keep building my skillset? What else can I be doing to help improve my chances of securing any entry level position in this field, and is there anything I *shouldn't* be doing that could possibly be wasting my time?"

I’m in need of serious help, I know I should seek professional help but I just want to hear what other students think.

I’m miserable and depressed, I used to be a straight A student but I’ve lost interest in what I’m doing. I do nothing productive anymore, I’m always on my phone. Sometimes I stay in bed nearly the whole day. My sleep schedule is messed up even when I literally have nothing to do. I’m always anxious now whenever I think of school work and projects. I’ve lost motivation to just even do the basic things in life.

I’m thinking of seeking professional help soon and I’m thinking of taking a break. The thing is, I’m also a coop student (and well, we know their requirements). 

I’m currently in a big dilemma. I do not know whether I should stop everything and work on my mental health (in that case, drop coop as well). Or just stay full time and in coop because I’m just hearing positive things about coop. What sucks is, once you drop out from coop, you cannot reapply anymore. I haven’t started my first work term yet but I do already have 4 months of internship experience. I’m scared that I’m going to fully regret dropping coop in the future.

I’m not really worried about not registering for classes since I can always take them anytime. It’s just dropping coop and not being able to reapply anymore.

I’ve also got other personal issues that I’m not comfortable sharing and need to work on. There were many moments where I just freeze and think about ending it all but I just don’t have the guts to do it.

I’m seen as that “intelligent student with a bright future” by my friends and family. And I can’t keep lying to them and to myself that I’m still that type of student. I love my family and I really don’t want to disappoint them.

I don’t know if it’s just me being a pu$$y and that this is what real life is, or do I really need to just stop everything and work on myself.

I know and will speak to a professional soon, I just wanted to hear from you guys, thank you."

My current CGPA is 3.25 which I can only blame myself under-performing because of the pandemic. 

I have been grinding Leetcode for the past few weeks and I feel like I'm not doing enough. A lot of my friends are excellent programmers that have graduated, and they all do very well for themselves. Even those who admit that they probably aren't as good as coding as me got better internship positions than I did because (I think) my lack of technical skills. Which, speaking of, when I was interviewing for my internship, my interviewer questioned if I even knew python because I didn't put much projects on my github at the time, I did got the position in the end but that was a horrifying experience...

The problem is I think all I know is how to code, but I just spend all my time code-golfing or doing challenges, and I don't really have any personal projects under my belt, like 95% of my github is just:  

\-Games I made as my hobby (Which is useless because I don't really plan to get into gamedev as a job)

\-My solutions to Leetcode questions, or other online programming challenges like Advent of Code  

All my other projects, I feel like they are way too short to justify me just making a repo for like 1 or 2 scripts, and a bunch of abandoned, unfinished stuffs that I don't think will look good either

I don't know many frameworks at all, especially web frameworks which I only have surface level knowledge, as I said I live in a developing country, and I've looked at the dev job postings, almost all of them are webdev and requires like 15 web frameworks. Even stuffs that I've learned like SQL, I have no idea how to actually apply it to a backend... I've tried learning them on my own but each time I just get overwhelmed by the complexities and give up

The best I can say is I have like one or two local competitive programming trophies under me, but nothing else.

Currently confused about what I should do or what I should learn next, please advise."

(Manager cusses me out),OneTinker,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rx8dg2/the_worst_internship_experience_ever_manager/,"This happened to me back in the summer of 2019 and I have definitely moved on; however, I would like to know what I should do if I happen to encounter this situation again (hopefully not). 

During the summer of 2019, I finished my first year at uni and I had an internship as a Software Engineer Intern at a Fortune 500 company. The company was located in San Jose and generally had a very kind and meaningful atmosphere. The company hosted almost 40 events for the interns during the 12-week period. Those events consisted of various trips around SF/Bay Area, talks from prolific people, etc. They also had recently furnished the interiors and they looked very startup-like. I was paid $33/hr + $6k sign-on bonus for the 12-week long internship, which wasn't bad at all. 

The company housed various projects that were very much like a startup. Each project has its own startup name, culture, and floor in the building. I was assigned to one of the internal startups and I was placed to be in the infrastructure team. I was told that the infrastructure team was the heart of the entire startup and we would essentially provide support to the other teams. If one of the other team's applications isn't working, they would run to us for help. 

I thought that was really cool to be a part of a team with great importance. My team consisted of a manager, three extremely talented principal-level software engineers, and a few senior engineers. I meet the manager and initially thought he was a really cool guy. He tried really hard to crack jokes and be funny. The onboarding into the team and the project were horrible. I was given a zip file filled with ten folders consisting of PowerPoints with very technical and vague system designs. I was still setting up my environment, GitLab, software, etc. In the first week, they assigned me to fix a memory leak bug in one of their API Gateways with a senior engineer. I was told that they were using OSS ZUUL and I started conducting research to resolve this bug. So for the next few days, I was googling specific keywords to help solve the issue. I found a few sources and I linked them to the senior engineer. The senior engineer still couldn't find out where the memory leak was happening. A week and a half go by and my manager wanted me to build his ""brainchild"": a log aggregator that parses logs from hundreds of microservices and maps them into a visualizer. The premise of the project wasn't bad and I had to build it from scratch. I love the challenge so I accepted it. I had to context switch from what I doing earlier to this while I was still getting used to the workplace environment. 

I was handed a small python script that one of the engineers worked on before and it was super inefficient. To upload 3GB of data to InfluxDB it took almost an hour. The manager wasn't happy with the current algorithm and asked me to make it better. I went ahead and did some research to optimize the bottlenecks. I batched the data to upload 50k data points per request. That brought the time from 50 minutes to 8-12 minutes. My manager told me to make it more efficient. I was a little stumped mainly due to a couple of reasons: 

1. I wasn't given a server to continuously deploy to test the script. I wasn't given just one file, I was given hundreds of JSON files sized over 50GB. If I ran the script, it would take almost 5 hours to finish. I had oftentimes had to restart due to one of the files incorrectly parsing due to corruption at the source. I also had InfluxDB and Grafana running locally and had other apps on my MacBook Pro open. The computer would run hot and I wouldn't be able to do anything else but run the script and look at the output for any suspicious formatting errors. 

2. I spent literal WEEKS worth of time testing and debugging because they didn't give a dedicated server to run these tests concurrently as I work on my computer. 

3. I wasn't given much logical help from my team members, which sucked because I was really looking to learn from their experience. The most I got was an emotional outburst for my ""lack of engineering"" skills. I wasn't given a direction, I was told to keep googling and find a solution. 

4. The script I was given was written in python2 and I updated it to python3 and made significant changes. For example, the zipped folders I was given had deeply nested folders with hundreds of logs from several microservices. I spent a good week going through every type of file and many files of the same type to see log lines that were anomalies but contained crucial information. I wanted to be smart about it so I designed a whole system where the script took a config file containing regex patterns for each of these log files. I made the code a lot more cleaner. 

5. I had to manually download the files and uncompress them to run the script initially. I decided that it would be smarter to automate it. The compression was easy, but downloading the files was not. I was given IPs to the servers so I could download the compressed log dump. Since there were hundreds of IPs or clusters that I had to do this for, I had no other option but to use SCP commands for file transfer. That's when I ran into the horrible permissions issues and everyone was anal about it. I get it, security matters but I literally got 0 guidance or advice on a better implementation. I wasn't even allowed to use other tools but the ones given to me. Quite literally the entire file downloading process consisted of a separate script that's basically a cron job to download the files from the clusters through SSH and SCP. At this point, I still was not given an IP to concurrently test and develop. 

It wasn't until half of my internship I was given my dedicated cluster where I ran the script in one, DB in another, and the visualizer in the other. The setting up was a pain in the ass and the only engineer that helped me out also had many issues doing it too. I finally set it all up and everything worked just fine until the servers went down due to a power outage. Fuck. Do you know what the worst part is? The cluster got deleted. So all my work/configs/setup/data just went right out of the window. I had to do the whole setup process again. I had to do everything manually because none of the engineers helped me with their CI/CD system. 

Finally, one of the principal engineers gave me the smallest advice. He just drew a little diagram and we talked about how to make the script more efficient. I got excited because I felt I was finally being taught something. I went to my computer and immediately built it. Shit, it brought the time to parse went down to 2-3 minutes. This was great and a bit of a small victory. I celebrated it with him, which was the nicest moment I had throughout the entire internship. 

Some log files were still corrupted and there is no way for me to know that a file has been corrupted unless if I attempt to parse a 3-10GB file into memory. With file streaming, I would be able to upload 80% but then the script would crash and move on to the next file. That 20% of data is extremely important so I dug around and alerted the principal engineer to look into the log dump script that each of the services had. Turns out, the script was asynchronously dumping JSON data into the same file with no mutex locks. The file corruption happened because a small chunk of the previous logs and the current logs were being written at the same time, offsetting some of the JSON syntaxes, causing parsing issues. Apparently, this issue has been with the company for months and no one cared to figure it out.  

At this point, everything was going alright, the file uploading process was very slow and the server I was given was apparently one of the smaller sizes, so I ran into memory/CPU issues constantly. Sometimes the server shut down and I would have to manually run the script, database, and grafana. I made a script to automate it, so it's whatever. A lot of engineers from the other teams came up to me asking for help with the logs in their server. I spent a good amount of time helping them around. I enjoyed it because it made me feel like I was a part of the team. 

The good feeling only lasted a minute because we had a sprint meeting and my manager questioned my work ethic. I was really confused because I was on my feet the entire time. He said that I should have gotten more work done than I accomplished. What? I'm an intern and I did not receive a lot of guidance so I was left to learn to swim or drown. I would explain myself and he insulted me because I had an ""attitude""? I'm super respectful and I don't question others in a professional environment. I accepted the bullshit of an L and moved on. This man came at me and I was sportive about his criticism. I told him, ""I will try to push myself to accomplish more"", and he dead ass said, ""See I don't understand this attitude that you have"". I was choked up and I couldn't even look at my team members in the face. It was fucking embarrassing. He asked me to demo everything that I have done the next day. I thought I could redeem myself so I spent the night before grinding away. I tested the whole program if it worked, and it worked. I slept that night and I woke up. I reached the office and logged into my server to prepare for the demo. It all fucking crashed. All three of my servers won't even connect or boot up. I was so confused. I had 10 minutes until the demo and it still wouldn't bootup. I walked into the glass-walled meeting room and sat down and kept attempting to fix it. He walked in and closed the door and asked me why my computer isn't connected to the large screen for the demo. I told him that my server won't boot up and it kept failing. He was livid. 

""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING, WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?!?!!? WE NEED TO HAVE A TALK ABOUT LIFE AND YOUR ENGINEERING SKILLS""

I responded with ""I know how this looks, but I promise you that I've worked on it and I don't know why this is happening.""

and he walked out. Later I found out that he spoke to all of the engineers about how he made the mistake of picking me to be his intern. He told them that I have an attitude problem and I lacked engineering skills. He later gave a ""life talk"" telling me that maybe it's too early for me to have an internship the next time and that I would work on building engineering skills. He also told me to fix my attitude. 

Oh, by the way, the reason why the server didn't boot up is that the programs I ran on those servers had a special folder tucked away in their elaborate file system that is meant for large-data applications. There was no way of me figuring that out and it wasn't until one of the senior engineers tried to help me out and spent a solid hour figuring it out. All the other directories had a limit of how much data can be stored and if it hit its limit, the server wouldn't boot up.

After that ""simple"" fix, everything worked as intended. I later displayed the whole thing to the manager and he used it to conduct a debugging session with the team. He didn't apologize or say anything to me. 

During the last week of my internship, I had a demo coming up where all the interns in the startup demo their work. I went first and I explained what I built, but my manager wasn't satisfied with my ""pitch"", so he interrupted me while I was giving the demo and kept pitching for me. It's whatever. The other intern didn't have any skills and he deadass did manual data entry, so he showed his PowerPoint presentation to everyone. I got a letter from the director of engineering complimenting my work. I shook my manager's hand and walked out of my building. 

During all of this shit, I was going through a lot with my family and I was emotionally manipulated by this chick lol. I was living with my relatives in Cali and apparently, they're friends with one of the senior engineers. My uncle would hear all the negative shit about me from them and then bash me for being ""all talk and no walk"". I would hear that I'm ""overconfident"" and get bashed for everything I do or say during the time I lived with them. My family back home would be getting into a fight with me because I wanted to take a gap year during my sophomore year of university (I just finished my freshmen year). I pretty much cried every day after work and before sleep. Sometimes my Aunt and Uncle would hear me cry and then tell my parents and it was a huge mess. 

Not to mention at work, I didn't spend time building new friendships with other interns. I had to work. I brought my lunch to my desk and I work while I ate. All those events the company hosted? I missed out on every one of them. While I living at my relative's house, I couldn't do anything fun without them bashing me for not working harder. I worked a solid 10 hours a day. The intern in the team across from me was from a top CS school but he barely had the skillsets to do any of the work his manager assigned him. He ended up doing manual data entry. We got paid the same, but different experiences. He was allowed to work from home whenever he wanted, but I couldn't.

The summer of 2019 was miserable. However, those experiences in the past made me a stronger person. I learned that what I went through was a toxic work culture with an extremely toxic manager. I wasn't pushed intellectually as much I was pushed emotionally. 

I wanted to hear what y'all thought of my experience. Did y'all experience anything worse? Was I really at fault?"

There's not a lot I can do about that now, I just don't have time to work on side projects as often anymore, and if I did, I would be delaying graduation for another semester. While I put out a bunch (at least 40 per week) of applications every month (anything literally titled ""Software Developer Intern"" or something like it, even if it's totally unrelated like it is all of the time), I haven't gotten *anything* back, so this clearly means my projects, GitHub profile, and GPA are not sufficient to demonstrate I can write code to hiring managers, and I'm nearly out of time to do anything about that.

I've had my resume reviewed several times by several people, and it should look good, just that finding a place to apply to that I fit most or all of the job requirements, is actually hiring juniors or interns, and does not require me to move far (I'd like to stay somewhere in the Pacific Northwest, especially Idaho, so not California or Texas or New York or something) is essentially impossible, no matter how often I check places like Indeed or SimplyHired or Monster.

I'd love to work on something like QNX, ESXi, Hubris, Fushsia, VxWorks, INTEGRITY, any of the unikernel frameworks, etc. Where can I find listings for internships, or given that I'm close to graduating, full time positions for these sorts of jobs, instead of staring at ""No results found"" like Indeed always has?

Problem is, for most projects, they actually get to keep the rights to your work (meaning the are going to use it for profit) and students will receive 0 compensation.

I'm furious, and I'm morally opposed to doing free labor, especially for scummy corporations that I'm supposed to be proud to say I did work for.

rxkmnm,2,2022-01-06,Career change - bachelor's?,Jordarix,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/rxkmnm/career_change_bachelors/,"Hi all. Finding myself at a crossroads, could use some career advice.

Background: I'm an EU resident, late 30's. Bit late for a career change, but I'm ready to risk it. My formal education is civil engineering (though I'm working in a different field now), but my passion has always been coding, so I've finally decided to pursue a career in the field. Been preparing on my own for a while, now it's time to decide on the next steps.

My first instinct was 'bootcamp', since I already know the basics (did a couple java projects, including a fairly complex game), but from reading and talking to friends, I get the feeling this route is much less common in the EU than the US, as it's so much easier to get a formal education. I could also continue to study by myself and start applying right away, but as a self-taught on my late 30's, I feel that would put me at a big disadvantage.

So, the current plan is getting a bachelor's. This would help fill gaps in my foundations, but also give me access to networking and hopefully an internship, which would be helpful in getting a foot in the door. Disadvantage would be of course having to wait longer before getting a first job. OTOH, this would also give me time to build a portfolio and deepen my knowledge, which could open more doors.

Is this a reasonable approach? I'd have to relocate anyway, so I'd like to make the most of it, by getting into a bachelor's with a good reputation and/or good connections to the industry - but the classes would need to be in english (though ideally not in the UK, because post-brexit fees), and no longer than 3 years. What kind of bachelor degrees should I be looking at? Also, a good urban environment would be important too, as I'd be living there with my partner for a while."

I'm having a hard time deciding if I should stick with my current job as a operation manager or take the opportunity to start a new career and become a data analyst....

I'm currently in my early 30's and  make 75k at my current job with a guaranteed 7% increase annually.  I do not have a college degree as I have dropped out during my 2nd year due to financial conflict and decided that it was best to start working instead.

Recently, I have been introduced to someone that was looking to hire a data analyst. Luckily, they are willing to hire someone even without a data analyst background. I will basically be an intern for 3 months and get paid close to a minimum wage. After 3 months, I will be getting paid close to 50k.

I believe that this is a great opportunity for me especially for someone who does not have a college degree and since it is a growing field (from what I have read). But these are the things that has me worried: taking a significant pay cut; might not really like being a data analyst; scared that I won't be good at it.

Is this career change worth the pay cut + risk in the long run?

I'm really interesting in Cybersecurity. It's because I truly love this field that I've been learning for the past 8 months with a really strict work ethic. I've learned from TryHackMe and various others sources about Networking and Hacking and am about to start HackTheBox CTFs. I've done my fair share of CTFs on picoCTF, I'm learning scripting languages (Python, Bash, Powershell), know backend languages like MySQL and PHP and I have no intention of stopping. I started out in general with programming (C/C++/JavaScript) but stopped doing that once I started to get more into Networking.

When I started out I had the intention of learning for about a year or so and then applying for internships / part-time jobs to help with my college expenses. After these 8 months and with enough confidence that I'm good enough at least for a beginner, I started to look around for jobs/internships. But what I found out truly surprised me.

Nearly all the jobs require 2+ years of experience along with at least one Industry recognized Certification ( I know Certifications are important but right now they're a bit too expensive for me to take since they cost a lot when converted to my country's currency ).  I looked around a bit in the hope of finding remote internships with lesser demands/beginner inclined but those which did have, had really unprofessional and sketchy Job descriptions. I have no idea what to do now.

I started out this so that down the road I can earn money part-time to ease pressure on my home but now this seems to  impossible. At this rate I can only start earning if I spend the rest of my college (2.5 years remaining) learning and then when I get a job. This won't work out for me. I'm sure that with my work ethic, If I switch back to programming/developing within 6 months or so, I can start earning. But I don't want to. I really want to go stay in this field since I love it here but I also need money. Can someone here help me out with this ? Is there any particular job or Internship that I can take which will help me in earning while also helping me to learn more ? Or is there anything in particular that I should learn that will help me with this ?  And by earning I don't need thousands of dollars per month. A few hundred will do.

rxoeiz,156,2022-01-06,"25 yo, how do I get out of the poverty cycle",eeveetale,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/rxoeiz/25_yo_how_do_i_get_out_of_the_poverty_cycle/,"I was born into a family with two older brothers, and our whole family are not really close. My father was the sole breadwinner and a compulsive gambler, while my mum is not able to work as she is physically inept. Both are not well-educated, and to this day, do not have any savings for retirement. I'm currently a uni student and is awaiting for my internship to start.  


Since young, I was quite aware of my family's financial situation and I recalled not purchasing drinks or simply purchasing rice with steamed egg for lunch as a primary school kid. I used to receive bursary money for primary school studies, but they have gone to my parents for expenditures that I'm not aware of. As I got older around secondary school, I started to work part-time to earn some extra income. I've also acquired the skills of walking home (even now) to save money on transport fees or cab fees if I ever went out past midnight. I felt like at that stage in life, I was not able to pursue any form of hobbies (e.g., extra classes, equipment) as they would just incur more costs. That made me feel like I was unable to improve myself in character or skills, and that it potentially rendered my character to be duller as a person. Next was tertiary education and I would still try my best to save money while socialising. It felt hard to balance and juggle between saving money and socialising. There were times that I rejected hanging out just to save money. Yet, there were still a couple of friends that I hang out with as I didn't want to be a wet blanket, and hence I would spend a little more than usual. This also came with the rationale of ""I have saved a lot in the past, so it might not hurt to spend a little more."" My mindset also kept changing back and forth between ""it's okay to spend a little more on expensive, healthy food for better health in the future"" and ""eating cheap food is akin to purchasing cheap fuel to keep me alive; cheap is good enough"". Even at this age, I do recall my dad asking me for money (which yes, is the same money that he gave me as allowance) to gamble, which I would furiously refuse and that would lead to squabbles.  


It was time to serve the army and I was at the lowest of my life. TLDR would be that I wasn't mentally coping well with the administrative workload due to politics. In addition, I wasn't socially doing great in life. I started to rely on binging upon expensive food and drinks to cope. That went on and became a habit in my Uni life as well and thus cost quite a dent in my savings. I started to pay for my own phone bills, transportation, purchased my own laptop for school. I occasionally hang out with friends or on my own (to binge eat and drink) to pass time or relax to feel better than staying at home cause I do not have my own personal space to have inner peace or to study.  


Despite my family's financial situation, I was not able to obtain a bursary for my University as I lived with my older brothers who has started to work. We weren't close either and they were starting to have their own life. They would not offer to cover my University cost which is understandable. I have applied for bank loans, but it just feels like a stupid situation where I could have actually obtained a bursary to lighten the financial load on my own. My brother used to give a portion of their savings to both of my parents. However, in an attempt to stop my father's gambling habit, they struck a deal to pay and clear the house loans for my father to start saving up. Yet, my father still continues to gamble as he needs money for retirement for both him and my mother.  


Originally I wanted to not go to University and start working straight to earn money, but my mum suspected it, felt bad and kept persuading me to head for it. I went for it in the end, since the degree would help in earning more in the long run. I did not do part-time during the course of my University as I try my best to obtain a good score by putting in more time during the weekends, in hope that I would be able to get a better paying job in the future. I've tried putting money in Robo-advisor (most of my savings), but I've ended up withdrawing it due to a lack of savings that have depleted over the years. I've also tried day-trading, but my uninformed choices do not do very well either.

Recently my mum has been borrowing more than a thousand dollars from me over three months. They are still not coping well and sometimes she skips her meal just to save costs. I do not have insurance (per my knowledge) and it feels very off-putting that I'm not able to afford a basic need and that I can't simply explain to every insurance agent/friend that I'm not able to just buy any insurance package easily. I can't help but feel constant envy of friends who are able to simply pursue hobbies that they are interested in, purchase games that they wish to play, able to cab when and wherever they want. Friends that spoke of travel or obtain a driving license.  


I've tried to mine crypto with my damaged laptop and realised that I do not have enough GPU (only 2GB) to mine. I felt annoyed that I need more money (which I do not have) to earn additional money to climb out of the poverty cycle (which led me to write this post). I don't know if my feelings or rant is justifiable with how I did squander my money from binging or spending a little more just to improve my quality of life. It just feels tiring that when I start working, the money that I've earned, would be used differently from everyone else as everyone starts off from a different starting point, with some further in this ""life race"" and that I'm way back with liabilities to consider. I'm honestly not hoping to purchase a car or to live in some big house in this life of mine. I just want to live a little, fund my hobbies, feel financially secure and be able to cope if anything were to befall myself or my parents.  


TLDR: A university student with parents that do not have savings and just want to break out of the poverty cycle."

Built my first one at a young age, learned networking basics before high school, was an intern for my school's sysadmins for the last 2 years of HS. Went to college for networking, learned Cisco stuff, some server building. Tried to join the saturated market in the 2010s, but no luck till 6 years after college. Eventually landed a help desk job in government IT, pretty breezy with my hobbyist level of retained knowledge. Did it for 5 years, end-users drove me crazy, decided it was time to move up. Landed a job as a SysAdmin in a small shop with less than 300 employees. 

Now I feel like everything I have ever known is useless. It's been 4 months and I still come in every day just trying to figure out what I am supposed to be doing. My lead has 20 years on me, my co has 15 on me. They just work work work, while I am here asking reddit what the hell is going on. There hasn't been any real training, it's just been kinda let him loose until he asks a question, but I am so unfamiliar with what I am doing I don't even know what questions to ask. The CIO drops in regularly and drops 10 new things to pay attention to... I'm overwhelmed and have tried to talk about this matter with my lead, CIO, or co-worker but the talks never seem helpful. Just a 'yea, you'll get there' kinda response... I tend to think about what they were even looking for when they hired me. Someone who wont just get some experience and book it? A complete blank slate that they expect to be clueless for a year or 2??

Idk, I am ranting now. But my question to reddit: is there anyone out there who's been in a similar situation? From help desk to sysadmin, having to just figure it out as you go? Constant training videos, youtube, and reading and it still doesn't feel like it's enough... for 4 months as a new SysAdmin, does this sound about right?"
rxpue2,4,2022-01-06,Amazon SDE Intern vs JP Morgan Data Science + AI Intern,RevolutionaryFerret9,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/rxpue2/amazon_sde_intern_vs_jp_morgan_data_science_ai/,"Hi! I'm currently a junior in college and I'm trying to decide between two internship offers for summer 2022. I have an offer from Amazon for a Software Development Engineer internship and an offer from JP Morgan for a Data Science/AI internship. I ultimately want to become a data scientist so I'm leaning towards JP Morgan, but I have some concerns and I would appreciate some advice.

1. I already accepted Amazon's offer back in September. I applied to both Amazon and JP Morgan in August, didn't hear back from JP Morgan so I accepted Amazon. Then, I got an interview with JP Morgan in October and I got the offer in December. So if I take JP Morgan, I would have to renege on Amazon.

2. Amazon has a better location and higher salary. Those aren't a huge concern for the internship but the location would be a plus if I get a full time offer there. However, I've heard bad things about Amazon's culture so I think it would be better to work at JP Morgan full time.

3. For JP Morgan, I can choose between two teams: HR data and analytics solutions. For Amazon, I don't know anything about my specific team yet but I know that the office I got assigned to has teams that work with devices and ground stations. Both of these sound more interesting to me than the JP Morgan teams, but I would be doing software engineering work instead of data science so there's a tradeoff. I'm also worried that a software engineering internship would make it harder to get a full time job as a data scientist.

Another small thing is that Amazon’s internship is 12 weeks and JP Morgan’s is 10 weeks. Amazon is also paying for housing and relocation. 

Overall, I'm just confused about which would be the better option and it would be super helpful to get any advice from people in the industry. Thank you!"

Basically I'm wondering if it's possible to go to graduate school for a MS in Computer Science with a BA in Liberal Arts.

**Background**

I'm an avid computer programmer; know Go, C, and Python; love Linux; have a decent-ish Github profile with several personal projects; and contribute semi-regularly to a couple open-source projects. I know that I want to go into Computer Science.

**Right Now**

I'm a freshman in a small college (top 50 for liberal arts) studying liberal arts.

I have looked at a couple local graduate schools of Computer Science / Engineering for reference (e.g. UMass Amherst, UConn, MIT) and they obviously list some admissions requirements, which generally boiled down to

1. Calculus I / Differential Calculus (4 credits)
2. Calculus II / Integral Calculus (4 credits)
3. Calculus II / Multivariate Calculus (4 credits)

I am planning to take those math courses online at UC San Diego, in between my regular semesters.

I'll be finishing with:

* BA in Liberal Arts
* 12 Credits of Calculus I, II, III
* Various software-engineering summer internships + a decent GitHub profile

Is that a feasible plan for admission to a graduate program in Computer Science? Or should I transfer into an actual Computer Science undergraduate program?

I'd really appreciate any first or second hand experience, advice, or tips on how to make it work. Thank you!"
rxq9kn,0,2022-01-06,May have screwed my future up - Can use any advice,ThrowawayCS1448,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rxq9kn/may_have_screwed_my_future_up_can_use_any_advice/,"Hi all,

I'm currently a senior CS student at a no-name state school, anticipating graduation in May.. I've come to a point where I realize I've messed up big time and I don't know what to do. For a couple of years, for some reason, I didn't think I wanted to work in software. However, my last year of school *really* changed that idea, as I've grown to love software.

As of \~3 weeks ago, I've been firing out job applications for graduation like no other. Unfortunately, I have zero software-internship experience, and I absolutely suck at LeetCode. I've only been able to solve maybe a dozen easies without looking at solutions. Naturally, I am doing *horrible* on the OAs companies send me. For the few that I have passed, I've yet to get a call back... 

On the plus side, outside of a lack of software internships, I know my resume is pretty great. I have two smaller (yet interesting) and two mid sized projects listed. I have my current work experience, which is leading an IT department at a pharmaceutical company for 1.5 years (started as an intern), and I have 4 years of networking/security education from vocational school prior to college. Additionally, my GPA is 3.5 so not terrible.

For the last week, I've had a tremendous amount of stress over this feeling of inevitable failure. I feel like I'm running out of time and I need to send out hundreds of applications and somehow start to master LeetCode. I've purchased a Data Structures/Algorithms course on Udemy and I've purchased Cracking the Coding Interview/Algorithm Design Manual. I've started to go through these, but I can't help but feel overwhelmed, and like I'll never make this progress in time. I haven't been able to sleep and my mind is racing beyond belief, it might honestly be a week-long crisis or panic attack, if those exist.

Note: As I stated it *has* only been 3 or so weeks. In terms of next steps, the ones I've had so far are: An offer for M&amp;T Bank's Technology Development Program (soft, I have the HR interview coming up), and completed rounds 1&amp;2 of Goldman Sachs Full Time Analyst position, although I feel that I didn't do too hot on their Hirevue (behavioral pre-recorded interview). All I want is a position with a respectable company that'll allow me to learn and grow in the industry.

I'm considering a couple options - 

1. Gamble at what I'm currently doing and hope that I can secure a position in time. 
2. Additionally send applications for a Summer '22 internship with a separate resume saying I'm graduating in the Fall. (straight up lying)
3. ""Delaying"" my graduation by a semester (literally just graduating a semester later) and applying to internships for the upcoming Summer/Fall.
4. Enrolling in a Master's program (my school has a path focused on Algorithms), and using that extra time to secure an internship or two and have more time to study my resources.

Any advice at all to help me calm down will help. Thank you so much in advance."

3. Big Data Analytics
4. Cryptography and Network Security
5. Capstone Project

rxxrhb,32,2022-01-06,Do you really need a CS degree?,EngineeredPapaya,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rxxrhb/do_you_really_need_a_cs_degree/,"No.

But a degree really helps. Like a lot.



You can look up all the success stories for [self-taught developers](https://old.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/search?q=self+taught&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all).

But there is a good bit of survivorship bias there.

According to StackOverflow’s Developer Survey 2021, some [80% of professional developers have some form of higher education](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#education-ed-level-prof), with a Bachelor’s degree being the most common. So if you want the most straightforward way to pursue a career in Software Engineering, you should probably start by going for a Bachelor’s in Computer Science degree.

A lot of people might say you can learn everything online, for free or very cheap. And this is true. Most of what you will learn during your time as a student, you can find resources for online and self-learn those topics.

A lot of people will also say you won’t learn anything practical by pursuing a BS in CS. And this is also true. This is a science degree, and you will learn the science of computing. It's not an apprenticeship and the goal of this degree is not to make you job-ready, but to expose you to the math and theory of computing and introduce you to basic programming and software engineering principles.  There are however, some practical electives you can take which teach you industry skills.

But just remember a degree is not just about education. When you are paying for a BS in CS degree, you are paying for access to a lot of things that self-taught developers don’t have access to. As a student at a university, you can participate in the following:

* **Research Assistantships**: At most schools, if you get to know your professors well, you can get yourself research assistant positions at their lab and work for them. It's usually available to undergraduates and often a paid position. It's a great opportunity to learn a lot and a great experience to put down on your resume.

* **Lab Volunteering**: Most CS labs need student volunteers to do various technical things. This is similar to research assistant positions, but unpaid. Once you get to know your professors, you can ask to volunteer at their lab if you are interested in their research. You can usually turn this into a paid research assistant position very easily as long as the professor has the budget for it.


* **Teaching Assistant/Tutoring:** It's usually available to MS students, but some universities allow undergraduates to be TAs as well. You can also get a job as a tutor for specific classes, so look into that for your university. Being a TA or tutor for your beginner CS course from freshman year is a great experience to put down on your resume.

* **Co-Ops**: Most universities should have some Co-Op program for engineering students. They are usually overseen by a professor and you can ask them to join their co-op program. Your academic advisor should also be able to help you with information on how to get accepted to the Co-Op programs. Definitely do it if offered by your university.

* **Internships**: The majority of internships are available to degree-seeking students exclusively. I don't really need to explain how important internships are. Your university might have a program to match you to internships or might have career fairs where tech companies come in and directly recruit students into internships. This is the most real life work experience you can get as a student.

* **Hackathons/Programming Competitions**: Most universities' engineering departments or various CS focused clubs (IEEE-CS, ACM, MSDN, etc.) will host a few of these every other semester or so. There usually also are large local competitions with multiple universities participating, depending on your area. You can grab some of your friends and participate in them. Getting top 3 at a hackathon or competition is more impressive on a resume than making the Dean's List.

* **Networking**: This one isn't as corporate as it sounds. Just be friendly with all your classmates and you'll naturally become friends. Make connections with your co-assistants, your professors, and advisors too. You're going to make some of your best friends in college, and they will go on to work at great companies too. I can basically skip to the phone interview at any of the companies my friends work at through a referral. I can reach out to my old professors and get referral letters very easily if I decide to pursue a MS or PhD. You're going to have a hard time finding so many talented people to befriend in one place outside of university.

* **Clubs/Orgs**: As mentioned above, most universities will have a chapter of a CS organization such as IEEE-CS, ACM, or other local CS organizations. Volunteering at them can be a great experience, and they often have engineers from various tech firms within their network come in and give talks, and it also serves as an opportunity to network with these companies and get your resume directly passed to their recruiters.



So basically, if all you are planning to do during your BS in CS degree is go to class, study, and take exams: it's not worth it. When you are paying for a degree, you are paying for access to all these things which can make sure that when you graduate, you have a lot of collective experience and are a much more desirable candidate than those with just a few personal projects on their resume. Most of your internships will also turn into a full-time offer if you perform well, so you can have guaranteed employment upon graduation.

Of course, getting a CS degree is an expensive endeavor and not everyone can afford one. But if you can afford it, you should definitely go for it instead of a bootcamp or some certificate. In most cases, getting a loan for a BS in CS is usually worth it because of all the aforementioned opportunities you get access to, and you will be able to pay down your loans very aggressively because Software Engineer jobs just pay well.

You might also be thinking all the above opportunities are only available at the best schools like MIT, UC Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon, or similar. But I went to a public state school which isn’t even in the US Top 100 universities list, and I even had access to all of the above opportunities.

So should you get a CS degree? If you can, yes!

If you can’t? There’s enough self-taught success stories to indicate you can rest assured that you can make it without a degree too. It just might take a bit more elbow grease, and isn’t as much of a straight shot."
rxzk9d,1,2022-01-07,Been a while.,ComradePark,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/rxzk9d/been_a_while/,"Been a while since I wrote here.

Got into college (and studying a topic I like: psychology, which is kind of ironic), got new friends, got a gf, got a job. Life's still shit.

That made me realize, the things around me aren't the problem. Life isn't that shitty. People treat me well. They treat me fairly. I have a paid internship, receiving twice the salary of most of my friends. I work with benefits since I'm in the same office as my mother. My transportation fees are paid for, as well as my lunch. The company takes care of my taxes, since I hold the position of assistant accountant. I don't have to worry about not being able to afford insulin, or my meds. I don't have to worry about getting evicted, or not having a roof over my head. I don't have to worry about starving, or not having enough food. I have ample entertainment available to me.

It's me. I'm shit. One thing I've been consistently hearing from people around me is that I don't try at all.

I do. I try as hard as I can. I try to get out of bed. I try to take a shower and not smell like shit. I try to be friendly to people, make sure to greet everyone. I try to communicate properly, although it's hard for me to trust people and open up about myself (even if they are trivial things, like sharing my birthday). I try to sleep, although it gives me nightmares, almost every day. Even if I have to wake up soaked in sweat and my body aching.

It's just not enough. It never has been. It never will.

I'll probably finish my employment contract (ending next month) and die before next college term starts.

I'm just sorry to everyone around me that it took so long to realize this. I could have ended this so long ago. I could have saved my parents literal tens (if not hundreds) of thousands of dollars in medical bills and tuition fees. I could have saved them time. I could have saved my friends' time. They could have spent the time they've invested in me in meeting a better person. A better friend. I wish I was smarter. That way, I would have realized this long ago.

I hope they never find my body. I don't want a funeral. that's just more money wasted on me.

For anyone else struggling out there, I hope you make it. I was too weak. Too much of a coward. Too worthless."

I manage to get interviews due to resume, but always fuck them up due to my debilitating anxiety - like I honestly find it difficult to answer questions the way I want to.

I've been thinking about applying for a Master's, but I have zero motivation to even begin applications at this point.

I hope 2022 has been going well so far with you!

So, good news as a self-taught dev, I finally got my first interview as a Junior Front End Developer. I only applied to 2 positions so far on LinkedIn, so I haven't done much yet with the job search. I guess, at least I can rest a little bit relieved that my resume and portfolio are kinda working. Bad news is the company really seems kinda off.

They look like it's a startup, which was an upside for me. I wanted to start somewhere that's still starting off. I could only find their Facebook page and official website along with their LinkedIn profile. First off, the Facebook page has only job postings and angry reacts on everything.

I ignored it, and went on to the official website. I thought I could take a look on the job postings there, and everything is labeled under ""internship"". Literally every vacancy is an internship. Business Analyst, Front End (The one I'm interviewing for), Back End (C# and PHP), Digital Marketing Specialist. Everything is an internship. Not just this, but also there's some kind of a weird rule which literally says, ""***Interns are required to bring their own laptop.*****""** I don't know if that's common, but it just feels off.

Also, there were no questions when they called me. He just asked me if Friday was okay with me, then called me again after 15 minutes to postpone it to Sunday. Didn't ask anything about my resume, my experience, nothing. So, I don't know whether I should really bother with the interview or not."

ry909t,27,2022-01-07,Advice for how to hire DE intern,stackedhats,dataengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/ry909t/advice_for_how_to_hire_de_intern/,"I'm a fairly new DE (1 YOE), and received permission to bring on an intern this summer.

The main goal would be getting me experience teaching and managing people and hopefully to find someone that we could hire full time next year.

I'm the only person in the firm wearing the DE/SWE hat right now.

I have some idea of what traits I would want in a hire, namely curious, enjoys programming and understanding how things work under the hood.

I do not expect an intern to know jack shit, and will probably just ask candidates to do fizzbuzz and talk about projects they've done in the interview.

&amp;#x200B;

While I'm hardly a seasoned veteran, I've been growing into the role quite well, have a working data warehouse with solid logging and exception handling that hasn't broken after 2 months of daily pipeline runs, and expect further growth in the 5 months between now and when the intern would start.

I'm thinking I'll probably spin up a cloned warehouse environment with the PII stripped out (this is an investment firm so replacing client names with a list of baby names or just numbers won't affect data quality in a meaningful way), give them a copy of DDIA to read over the summer and have them work through some of the problems I've worked to solve. That would give them real experience and provide a way to familiarize them with the stack and databases.

Basically, I'm going to treat this as a learning experience for them rather than try to shove grunt work or busywork at them and feel good about myself.

&amp;#x200B;

So with that in mind, and the fact that ideally we could recruit some talent into the firm afterwards, what do you think I should be looking for/ asking for in the posting and interview process?

I also HATE the way most technical roles are hired currently and will fucking die on this hill if I have to in order to make it better.

&amp;#x200B;

My basic requirements are:

&amp;#x200B;

* Cs or Cs adjacent degree, quantitative degree
* Experience with ANY OOP language (the foundation of learning your first language is what matters, not intimate knowledge of the idiosyncrasies of python)
* Ability to pass fizzbuzz (with numbers other than 3 and 5)
* It would be nice if they knew SQL, but let's be honest... it's not that hard to learn and the only way to actually get good at it is to use it
* Rising Senior
* Smart person who gets things done

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah... that's pretty much it, we're a finance firm with low data maturity and a lot of room to grow, we aren't using the shiniest new tools, but data people here have a lot of upside and value to deliver as a result.

Any advice on how to find and evaluate candidates for a DE internship at a small finance company?

What would you require from candidates? What traits would you select for?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:

While I'm not looking to teach someone to code from scratch, seeing the response here and being a physics major (with CS minor) I'll widen things to include quantitative degrees.

Yes fizzbuzz is stupid, but so is asking someone to invert a binary tree.

I am the only person in so called ""IT department"" and I report to Operation Manager that has a very small knowledge of IT. I am finishing my bachelors degree in cybersecurity, and want to get some exposure to system administration. The job description for this position did not state any essential duties and responsibilities nor any goals that they want me to achieve during my time with them. 

At my meeting with executives, I was told that I am free to do whatever I want and work on any projects that I think can help the company. I spent my first week observing their work and trying to note any ideas and suggestions on what can be improved from IT standpoint. Few of the initial ideas that I noted:

1. Transition to M365 - they currently work with Google Workspace, paying separately for Office tools, Slack, and Zoom. 
2. Designing and implementing backup solution - they currently have no backups at all and keep all their data in G-Drive.
3. Creating documentation - they have none.

The problem that I encountered when I shared my thoughts with executives and supervisor is that they were not interested in anything that I mentioned nor they expressed any desire to spend any money on IT needs... 

I am here for a little advice... Is there anyone who has experience working with companies like mine? What projects can I actually work on to make this internship worth it, both for me and the company? Any other advice would be much appreciated as well. Sorry for any typos and grammar errors."

So after finishing my bachelor's thesis in 2020 I was lucky enough to get a job as an engineer in the offshore industry. My dream come true field of work especially since the pandemic was more of a job killer than a source of opportunity even in offshore engineering. So mandatory working from home kicked in and I was never really given much instructions of my work and frankly may have been too hesitant to ask for help. The day I was ready to face management and talk about my issues was the day they let me go. The firing was semi legal and management never really explained it to me, but I guess I was too expensive, not experienced enough, yet they had offered me a contract without a probation period. After just 8 months with the company I was not going to take it to court.
Luckily found work in the public sector as a tmporary worker. I liked this type of work. Didn't pay too good but working with people was quite fulfilling. However contracts where renewed on a month to month base and quite arbitrary. I knew this position wouldn't last so I was looking for work in naval architecture since I had a degree in it. Again I was lucky found work at a big shipyard. Also a dream come true. 
Unfortunately I am sort of an employee for lease at a shipyard that currently has to cut a lot of workers. While the engineering department is still hiring temp workers. The mood at the company is not great since people are let go. But temp workers are still hired. Also pay is way less then other engineers in the field get. Since I just moved and have to pay rent in two apartments and also had to buy a car im financially not too good at the moment (might be a little bit of a luxury problem). 
On top I see the same problems as with my first job. This time I am at the office however there's not really anyone willing to give me work instructions and training. At the same time there's no work for me to do. I ve aked my boss straight up and all he had was some basic intern assignments (updating the year in a spreadsheet) for the whole week.
Since I have to work a full 40 hours I have to sit in the office for 8 hours a day. It sucks having to sit here in an empty office with nothing to do. 
When I leave early I might loose the job. When I look at my accounts I get anxious since I sometimes dont know how to pay bills. I can't put money down for the future or emergencies and all emergency funds are drained right now.

This whole thing feels more and more like a rat race. I dont see me ever seeing able to buy property like my parents or be somewhat financially independent in retirement. 
I dont really know how to escape and its just not the lifestyle I want to have for the next 40 years. Some things need to change."

Between a rock and a hard place. Whatever metaphor you choose for saying I have no idea what to do. I'd give my undying love to anyone who reads all this and can help with some coherent input.

About me: I know this is long but it's necessary to understand where my conundrum comes from. I'm a third year mechanical/aero engineer on a fairly flexible integrated master's course - can switcheroo a bit. So for all intents and purposes I'll say I'm minoring in information engineering (control, transforms (Fourier/DFT etc), inference, linalg, stochastic methods and stats) and hence have the opportunity to major in ML next year for my master's. After 2 years I'm a little turned off from engineering as I find it a bit boring and I prefer working with abstract systems rather than concrete stuff (I started off uni as a scientist! I did mixed materials, chemistry and physics for a year. Was planning on doing physics as specialisation). My plan is to do a PhD in ML applied to maybe fluid mech or aero engineering design and then switch to doing trading/quant research. Or work in ML applied to big data for grid levelling stuff (I'm interested in sustainability). Backup is to do R&amp;D in tech consulting. Because of my changing ideas, I think that doing a year in industry will be useful to give me time to work on my own projects out of work (ML especially is a very 'find some time and sit by yourself and do some Kaggle' job).

Okay now to situation.

I accepted in email writing an offer from Airbus for a year in industry already (it was an exploding offer :/). It starts July 2022. Salary not that high, but enough to live off of.

Got an email with an offer from ESA for a ML-based summer project today. It's unpaid and remote. However it's ML applied to engineering design - exactly what I want my PhD/masters project to be on. So now I have a few options, each with their own benefits and drawbacks. I also have a few general questions.

General questions:

\-How does blacklisting work? I feel very bad possibly needing to reject Airbus, and they might blacklist me if they think I've rejected them to go elsewhere after confirming in an email. I haven't signed a contract yet.

\-How flexible do companies tend to be about start dates if they've listed a specific month on the advert?

\-Can I nitpick the contract to find a legal point I disagree with and use that to reject Airbus blacklist-free? I may not even have to search very hard; I have genuine concerns about military aircraft etc. - I don't want to be forced to work on them.

Options:

1. Ask Airbus to start in late September. If they say yes, then I can do the ESA internship and then do the Airbus one.

Drawbacks:

\-If they say no, then I'm screwed - if I reject Airbus they will definitely blacklist. Also, they are likely to say no.

\-Means I won't get to apply to other companies that I could get better internships with next summer - ML internships are a dime a dozen, and all useful for my PhD application. In ML I might get a paid one, one that's more interesting, etc.

Neutrals/benefits:

\-I might not be that upset about being blacklisted. As I've said, I'm sure that I'm not 100% set on working in engineering specifically.

\-Same benefits as either Airbus or ESA alone (below)

2. Reject Airbus, do ESA.

Benefits: useful for my future PhD applications. Is ML-based.

Drawbacks:

\-No extra summer I can use to apply to internships I got rejected from this year (Rolls Royce especially, as well as trading companies - though many of these do PhD internships, so not a last call or anything).

3. Reject ESA, do Airbus

Benefits:

\-All those that come with doing a year out (extra summer, time to work on projects and revise ahead, looks great on CV).

\-I won't have to worry about upsetting Airbus as I've technically already accepted.

Drawbacks:-Airbus placement less likely to be directly applicable to my future path perhaps. Undecided.

I've forgotten if I've missed anything so please give some initial thoughts and I'll update as need be."
rye76f,22,2022-01-07,Do I know too little for 12 months into my first job (6 months intern + 6 months FTE)?,aqeo,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/rye76f/do_i_know_too_little_for_12_months_into_my_first/,"Read another thread here about what people knew when they got their first job and I am a little freaked out, as I feel I know so little even after a year.

So when I joined as an intern, I knew:Python, Django, a bit of CSS, and some SQL and Java. The first two, at an intermediate level.

Now almost 12 months later, I know:

Node, TS, \[decent ish, not great\], React, Redux \[A bit more than elementry\], some AWS, making CLIs, GitHub Actions/Workflows, some Terraform and Docker, writing better tests.

I'm not very good at either of those. Like just enough to get by. If I wanted to build something of decent complexity, using a combination of these now, I'd have to google a lot but I think I'd be able to piece it together.

I've also been on a niche project for more than a quarter. So that learning will be almost useless for my future. I'm being paid between 14-20 LPA \[don't want to be too specific\], which I think is a decent amount, so I didn't mind it a lot previously, but I'm starting to worry a little about the future now.

So from this,

1. Is this too less for my level?
2. Will spending any more time on the niche project harm my future? I feel like a generalist now and maybe not a great one. I'm wondering if the first few years shape your future as an SWE and if it's a bad idea to keep working on something niche for this long."

I am a recent college grad, and I have a bachelor's in Computer Information Systems with a minor in Data Science, and I have no idea how to get started in the IT field. I have an internship under my belt as a data analyst intern, but I am unsure what to look into. I am interested in taking the CompTIA exam but cannot for financial reasons. Any tips and tricks into getting into IT. TYVM!!!"
ryfnhi,6,2022-01-07,Choosing between internship offers - please help!,Alternative_Range111,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/ryfnhi/choosing_between_internship_offers_please_help/," In a bit of a pickle. Between a rock and a hard place. Whatever metaphor you choose for saying I have no idea what to do. I'd give my undying love to anyone who reads all this and can help with some coherent input.

About me: I know this is long but it's necessary to understand where my conundrum comes from. I'm a third year mechanical/aero engineer on a fairly flexible integrated master's course - can switcheroo a bit. So for all intents and purposes I'll say I'm minoring in information engineering (control, transforms (Fourier/DFT etc), inference, linalg, stochastic methods and stats) and hence have the opportunity to major in ML next year for my master's. After 2 years I'm a little turned off from engineering as I find it a bit boring and I prefer working with abstract systems rather than concrete stuff (I started off uni as a scientist! I did mixed materials, chemistry and physics for a year. Was planning on doing physics as specialisation). My plan is to do a PhD in ML applied to maybe fluid mech or aero engineering design and then switch to doing trading/quant research. Or work in ML applied to big data for grid levelling stuff (I'm interested in sustainability). Backup is to do R&amp;D in tech consulting. Because of my changing ideas, I think that doing a year in industry will be useful to give me time to work on my own projects out of work (ML especially is a very 'find some time and sit by yourself and do some Kaggle' job).

Okay now to situation.

I accepted in email writing an offer from Airbus for a year in industry already (it was an exploding offer :/). It starts July 2022. Salary not that high, but enough to live off of.

Got an email with an offer from ESA for a ML-based summer project today. It's unpaid and remote. However it's ML applied to engineering design - exactly what I want my PhD/masters project to be on. So now I have a few options, each with their own benefits and drawbacks. I also have a few general questions.

General questions:

\-How does blacklisting work? I feel very bad possibly needing to reject Airbus, and they might blacklist me if they think I've rejected them to go elsewhere after confirming in an email. I haven't signed a contract yet.

\-How flexible do companies tend to be about start dates if they've listed a specific month on the advert?

\-Can I nitpick the contract to find a legal point I disagree with and use that to reject Airbus blacklist-free? I may not even have to search very hard; I have genuine concerns about military aircraft etc. - I don't want to be forced to work on them.

Options:

1. Ask Airbus to start in late September. If they say yes, then I can do the ESA internship and then do the Airbus one.

Drawbacks:

\-If they say no, then I'm screwed - if I reject Airbus they will definitely blacklist. Also, they are likely to say no.

\-Means I won't get to apply to other companies that I could get better internships with next summer - ML internships are a dime a dozen, and all useful for my PhD application. In ML I might get a paid one, one that's more interesting, etc.

Neutrals/benefits:

\-I might not be that upset about being blacklisted. As I've said, I'm sure that I'm not 100% set on working in engineering specifically.

\-Same benefits as either Airbus or ESA alone (below)

2. Reject Airbus, do ESA.

Benefits: useful for my future PhD applications. Is ML-based.

Drawbacks:

\-No extra summer I can use to apply to internships I got rejected from this year (Rolls Royce especially, as well as trading companies - though many of these do PhD internships, so not a last call or anything).

3. Reject ESA, do Airbus

Benefits:

\-All those that come with doing a year out (extra summer, time to work on projects and revise ahead, looks great on CV).

\-I won't have to worry about upsetting Airbus as I've technically already accepted.

Drawbacks:-Airbus placement less likely to be directly applicable to my future path perhaps. Undecided.

I've forgotten if I've missed anything so please give some initial thoughts and I'll update as need be"

Specifically for the development side (Backend, frontend, SWE, etc..). I would love to hear about others experience as I am planning to apply to IBM. Is it common that they send a full time offer after graduation or does that depend on how well you do during the internship? 
I dont really have any specific questions related to a position but I would love to hear from people about their general experience 😊."
rygskq,2,2022-01-07,Have any Canadians interned in the US during COVID-19? What was the process for moving there?,BubbleTeaEnthusiast8,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/rygskq/have_any_canadians_interned_in_the_us_during/,"I'm a Canadian citizen and I'm currently a CS major at a university in Ontario. I just received an offer in the US for an in-person summer SWE internship, but my career office said there may be complications due to the pandemic and going abroad. I'm having a difficult time finding exact answers for this because our province's restrictions keep changing lol.

Has any Canadian interned in the US during the pandemic? If so, what process did you go through? I heard people get a J-1 Visa and get sponsorship from their employer but I'm wondering if there are additional measures during covid.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

I'm a second year engineering student with no past tech internships, and my goal is to get one for this summer. I only decided to pursue software very recently. So far I have:

* Taken two first-year programming and data structures/algo courses
* Can solve most Leetcode easy and some Leetcode medium
* Have some frontend experience (built a portfolio website recently)
* Built some projects for my school courses, nothing too fancy
* About to learn databases and some AI this semester

I just want a tech internship, and it doesn't really matter what - frontend, backend, DevOps, testing. I really don't think I know enough in any, or have the luxury, to choose.


What should I prioritize my time doing? I have plans on learning backend (Flask maybe), doing more projects to improve my resume, and learning some Shell Scripting perhaps. How do you all think I should allocate my time to maximize my chances of getting a job?

Thanks in advance for any advice!"

I just heard back from Microsoft on Jan 4th for my first-round interview. From scrolling through different posts on the internship this seems extremely irregular. Has anyone heard of anyone interviewing and getting an offer in January? Also, I'm just a freshman with no CS experience and I've only taken an Intro to CS course last semester. I'm seeing that there can be some data structures questions (Hash Tables, Binary Trees, etc.), or are those questions only asked if they see that you've taken Data Structures? What does the first round interview generally look like?"

Hello! I am currently a recent graduate from Mechatronics engineering and haven't been able to land a good job in this field. My greatest interest are controls engineering with heavy PLC programming (Both Siemens and Allen Bradley), Problem is, other than what I saw in my bachelors, I do not have any professional experience. Internships in this field where not available or hard to land during university.

I am trying to find a good certificate to up my chances of getting hired. Do you guys know any good course certificates that can help me get some valuable knowledge that can up my odds of getting a job in this field?

Thank you all!!!"
ryi8xg,1,2022-01-07,How do I seek more career Satisfaction?,MaybeBaby0708,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ryi8xg/how_do_i_seek_more_career_satisfaction/,"Hi everyone. Thank you to those who take the time to read this and respond in advance. A little background on myself. I am a recent college graduate who graduated in May of 2021 with my BS in Marketing. I have been working in various marketing jobs since January of 2021 and have experienced a lot of disappointment thus far.

To start, back in college, specifically in March of 2020, I applied for an internship at a company I was really excited about, after a few interviews and weeks of waiting I was accepted. I was thrilled for only a short amount of time because about 2 weeks after I had accepted the internship they called and canceled the whole program due to COVID-19. While I appreciate the caution and understand where they are coming from, I was still disappointed as I felt this being my first career success, was also my first failure, so it was off to a bad start.

Fast forward to December of 2020. I have now acquired a different internship and completed that, no matter how awful an experience it was, and was now looking for a full-time job. I reach out to some LinkedIn connections and low and behold one of them says I would be a great fit. I apply and was given an offer, and tho the job was not great, I figure the opportunity is better than nothing to get some experience. Once I start, I am immediately disappointed with the tedious very easy almost patronizing level of work, the compensation, and the overall culture, and the product that is being delivered to clients. I am again very unhappy with this role but wishing not to be labeled a job hopper, I keep the job for 6 months before a recruiter reaches out to me.

The recruiter who reached out to me is representing a very well-known large and respected company and I think, ""okay this is my shot, I am still early in my career and I can learn a ton here that will set me up for success in the future"". The job is a marketing analytics job where the recruiter says I will be learning, SQL, Tableau, SAS, Power BI, and tons of other tools I love and try to learn in my free time, so learning them in the workplace and applying my skills here will be great! Yet, when i start this role, I do not use any of this. Instead, I am taught a marketing automation tool that not many companies use or care about. Again I am disappointed. But, I stick with it, get good at my job, earn the respect of my team, other teams, managers, and start feeling good about the shitty situation I am in, despite the lies. However, I am still disappointed because 

A) this is a contract position

B) this compensation is the exact same as my last job even though I have more experience

c) I have tons of downtime and am not given an opportunity to expand my knowledge of other areas I was promised I would learn

But again, I stick with it, mainly because I am given the guarantee that if I prove myself then I will be brought on full time with a pay raise, promotion, pto, benefits etc. Then 3 months ago, I am given the news: talks are being had about bringing me on full time with at long last more than the paycheck to paycheck income I have been living with. I am so excited, my first promotion ever, my first raise ever, and an opportunity for growth. 3 weeks ago they tell me that January 7th of 2022 (Today) would be my first day as a full time employee with a raise and promotion, they have me start looking at 401k matching benefits, insurance benefits, we discuss salary etc. Then today gets here. And ya know what happens. My boss schedules an out of the blue 15 minute call and I know in my gut already, that my string of disappointment is not about to be broken. I get in the call, and he says ""we are sorry but we are retracting the offer, not because of anything you did, we are keeping you on as a contract worker, but because our budget has been cut due to upper management.""

Guys, I dont know what to do anymore. Everything in my career has been disappointing. I have been making less than 45k ever since i started my career and no matter how much I go above and beyond my and my bosses expectations, I am met with disappointment. Im not sure if there is something I am doing wrong or something I need to be doing different, I just constantly see everyone I went to college with and even HS with getting promotions, raises, moving states for careers, and I feel like I am going now where. I left my original major in college that I had a passion for to pursue marketing because I could have a career in it, and I just feel like im constantly fucked. I dont know what advice I am looking for but anything is apprecaited. Thanks in advance."

ryl8k3,3,2022-01-07,Work at a tech-based summer camp or spend the summer working on personal projects?,sydthecoderkid,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ryl8k3/work_at_a_techbased_summer_camp_or_spend_the/,"Hi! So I've just finished out my first semester as a freshman and am starting to think about what I want to do over the summer. Right now I'm debating between two things- One, being a summer camp counselor at a camp called iD Tech, or spending the summer continuing to work my on-campus job from home and keeping up with side projects.

I'm torn for a few reasons. The reason I 'd like to do iD Tech is because I was a camper there, and I had the time of my life. I can honestly say that camp is the reason I decided to pursue Computer Science. But if I decide to do iD Tech I'll probably working long hours and won't have a lot of time to work on any personal projects over the summer. If I had to guess the hours would probably be 8-5, maybe longer, and I know how exhausting working with kids all day is. I'd also probably need to stay on the campus I'm a counselor at(or endure like a 2 hour commute with heavy traffic) But I really enjoy working with kids, the pay is pretty good, and it would look solid on a resume.

My other option is to spend the summer working on personal projects, setting up a portfolio website, and still working my on campus job(it can be done remotely which is nice). I also want to get certified in a few different areas to improve my resume. This is definitely the less labor intensive option.

My question is wondering which of these two options would set me up best for Sophomore year in terms of finding internships? Money isn't really a factor for me, as I am working two jobs on campus in the fall and have a lot saved, so I'm really focused on what's going to be best to set up me up in the fall. I also am sure that I'd be able to work on projects if I did choose to be a counselor, but definitely not at the level I would have if I spent the summer focusing on them. Any and all advice is welcome!"

rypc1f,3,2022-01-07,Internship advice,ShitPostingDepresso,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/rypc1f/internship_advice/,"Hi everyone, I'm Europe based student who is choosing my first internship (second last one). Got offers from FB and upper-mid tier prop shops (think about IMC/DRW/Jump etc), and I'm not quite sure what to choose. Planning to apply for grad school in the US so I'd appreciate it if anyone familiar with US grad schools / European prop shops can give me some insights on what to choose.

Here's a bit about my background and career (goals?):This is gonna be very vague, it's very ez to dos otherwise.

Uni: CS at Top Tier European Uni (think about Oxbridge, Imperial, ETH, Munich, Warsaw, etc)

Did a non-trivial amount of competitive programming, IOI medal, good rank in regional ICPC (but not good enough for world finals), top percent on Codeforces, and a decent rank in Round 3 of Hackercup and Code Jam. I haven't quite been actively practicing it since Uni but it definitely helped with my interviews.

My interest is quite broad, but it's mainly automated reasoning, and machine learning (Geometric DL and RL are on my radar recently). I have several projects on them (basically individual research) and reproduced results from quite a lot of papers in recent ML conferences. Interested in doing research, but unlike the US colleges, mine doesn't let undergraduates join (got fucked for cold-emailing).

My family isn't quite well off, so if I'm not getting a full scholarship, I won't do grad school and I'd like to have a high-paying job (obvious but yeah I need the money).

Personally, I feel like prop shop is the more sensible choice, they r paying me a lot more (2x Facebook), and it's likely to be the same for full-time (FB doesn't pay the crazy RSU here). The work there looks a lot more interesting, and I feel like I can learn more. But on the other hand, I'm guessing if I get matched with a ML team in FB, it might be better for my grad school app since I don't have any real research experience."

I can program with in Java and C#  but I am not confident enough that I think I am hirable for a programmer role, I have limited networking skills and web dev skills. To be honest I think I would prefer an analyst role or some less technical but businesses are not hiring analyst with no experience. 

Ultimately what I am asking is what skills can I learn online for free that would be a plus on my resume. I want to get my self in the field so that I  can get the opportunity to learn on the job and gain experience. For example active directory knowledge, Microsoft SQL  and I don't know what I can learn to improve my chance of a analyst job.

Also I am not sure of the different career paths I can take with my degree some insights on that would be helpful too. Thank you."

My big problem (and why I accepted an internship) is I can't stay focused for more than 4 hours a day. Just found out that it's likely latent adhd. It presents itself differently in women and I've always been top of my class, so I didn't realize how many symptoms I have. A lot of productivity tricks don't work for me as my mind will literally just daydream instead of focus. I wasn't confident I could handle a real dev job, and this internship pays pretty well at least.

I've got 6 months left of this internship so I'd feel dumb quitting with that little time left. My next step is junior dev at this company, which feels underwhelming at 3 years out of school. The money is good, but not all that necessary. I'm also really not learning that much. I have a 1 on 1 with my boss soon and I'm not sure what to say."

I am writing this to provide insights to curious folks about how the process works and advice for success.

**TLDR:** Student at M7 and got multiple offers from MBB (US offices, not NY/SF)

**Pre-Matriculation**

* By all means, apply for the MBB pre-MBA summer programs. You will get on their radars sooner. This will help with getting interview offers during the recruiting phase.
* These programs are not very selective. The McKinsey Squad program is selective though. If you are invited to McKinsey Squad, it likely means you will get a first-round interview.
* There is nothing else to be done before matriculation. There is no need to start case prep or even fit prep at this point.

**Fall Semester**

* There is again nothing you need to do during the early part of the fall. You should focus on classes and socializing.
* Things really start to pick up in a big way some time in October when firms start organizing info sessions and more intimate events.
* Not everyone gets invited to closed list events. Being invited is almost always a sign that yes, you will be invited to interview. However, not being invited to these events is not a sign that you won't be interviewed. Plenty of people who didn't get invited to closed list events still got invited to interview.
* My advice during the networking phase is to just be presentable and well-spoken. As long as you come across as a normal and mostly polished person, you will be fine.
* My observation was that the median number of interview invitations was 2. About 40% of applicants received all 3 MBB interviews. I don't personally know anyone who applied to all 3 and got no interviews. 

**Interview Prep**

* Mid-late October is the perfect time to get started on case prep and also to think about stories to present during the PEI and behavioral interviews.
* Start with one mock case interview every few days. Ramp up the frequency during the 3-4 weeks before the interview.
* Most people I know did between 25 and 40 mock case interviews. There may be a ""*Don't do too many mocks. You will quickly hit diminishing returns.*"" vibe on campus. **Don't fall into this trap.** Especially if you're MBB or bust. Casing is a brain muscle and the more you flex it, the better.
* For mock interviews, do not rely solely on other first years aiming for consulting. You need to eventually start doing mocks with 2nd years who went through the process or actual/former consultants.
* For the PEI &amp; behavioral interviews, you can practice on your own. You don't exactly have to practice in front of other people. As long as the story makes sense to you and you can answer follow-up questions, it should be good.

**Actual Interviews**

* If you have done enough (&gt;30) high-quality medium-hard mock interviews, the actual interviews will go mostly smoothly. You may stumble here and there but overall, you will be consistent. You won't make any rookie errors.
* McKinsey's case interviews are different from BCG and Bain interviews. They are interviewer-led and will feel more like a verbal exam. McKinsey case interviews are also shorter.
* McKinsey puts a huge emphasis on the PEI component of the interview. Your stories are expected to be much more detailed. The interviewer will ask many many follow-up questions and will interrupt frequently. Your stories have to be water-tight.
* All of your MBB interviews will happen within a compressed 3-4 day timeline. You will have multiple interviews with multiple firms on the same day. You need to have built stamina through mock interviews by this point.

**Office Choice**

* Not all offices are equally hard to break into. SF is on average the hardest one. Followed by NYC. NYC's difficulty can actually create weird outcomes. A lot of people apply to the NJ office, thinking NYC is hard. That in turn ends up making the NJ offices almost as competitive as NYC. 
* It's true that you risk being snuffed out if you randomly put a less popular office as your top choice if you have zero connection to it. But if you do happen to have some connection to a less popular office (*eg. went to undergrad there, lived there at some point, have family there etc.*) and want to go the MBB or bust route then by all means put that office as your top choice.

**EDIT**

As pointed out in one of the comments, don't just practice live cases. Also do a lot of drills (framework, math, charts, brainstorming) from sites such as RocketBlocks. Another way to practice is to find YouTube videos of mock cases and pretend as if you were doing the case live. Pause after every question. Say what you would've said in a real interview. Play the video and compare your answer to the video."

Due to my grade not being that good, iirc a 6.5/10, i couldn't sit in campus interviews.

However, I wasn't low on savings and i could comfortably survive on freelancing while searching for something more stable.

First job i gave an interview for was an extremely new company (20 days old) 

And thus, my horror show began that would last for 5 months.

not only the pay was shit, they didn't even give me any equipment (a laptop and a phone is standard here), so not only i had to bring my own, I wouldn't even be able to get reimbursed for it.

I worked Saturday's and Sundays without overtime pay, i was technically an employee but they never got it in writing. They only got me in writing as a paid intern (first red flag, verbally they told me I'd be a full time employee).

So, i was slaving myself away for 11 hours a day without overtime pay and no guarantee of payment, (sometimes the paycheck were delayed by weeks because our clients delayed the payments because we were understaffed and couldn't meet our own delivery requirements)

This continues for 4 months, sons of bitches knew I would quit sometime soon.

So they increased my ""salary"" every month by 10%, saying I'd get the paperwork for being full time next month(at the end of every months ""review"").

Finally had the balls and just quit, gave up two weeks of pay. Just refused to show up, sent an email as a resignation later and just left.

One month later, got a job in the proper company. With paid leaves and sick leaves, salary credit every 15 days without issue, proper seniors to support me, proper HR and ONLY 8 hours workdays.

I would never ever join a startup again. Shit is outright abusive.

While I am very lucky now to have a lot of good and wonderful friends who deeply care about me, I have no family because my parents abandoned me when I was a baby because I wasn't good enough for them, so I grew up in five foster homes and two group homes. When I was in middle school, I decided that I wanted to go to law school because I strongly feel that no person should ever have to go through what I went through in life and everyone should be loved and cared for regardless whether they have Autism or are different in any other way.

Growing up, I had no toys or games. I spent all my free time in the library reading every book I could grab my hands on. But other than my library card, I had nothing except for three outfits, one pair of socks and a pair of $10 shoes with a black garbage bag to put my things in. I oftentimes when to bed hungry at night and I literally walked everywhere unless I was able to get a ride as I had no car and there was no public transportation where I lived at the time. 

So when I told my teachers in middle school and later on high school that I wanted to go to law school, many of my teachers literally laughed at me. I was told by my school guidance counselor that people like me don't get to become lawyers, and that my future is in retail or fast food. But I didn't listen to them. Maybe I was a little crazy for not listening to them, but I knew deep down in my heart that I only have this one life to live, and I might as well try to live the life that I felt like I needed to live instead of failing by default by giving up completely on my hopes and dreams.

So I went into community college and I graduated two and a half years later. And then I went into a four year school. Being at my university was one of the scariest yet greatest times in my life. It was the family that I never had and the home that I never had. Many of my best friends were made at that school. But it was hard too. I didn't find out until after I graduated when I was told that there was a lot of pushback in the administration for me to even be there before I was admitted as a student. It wasn't even the fact that I had autism, but it was more that I didn't have a family or a home. The administrators who were against me attending basically argued that this was a university and not a orphanage. They were fearful of someone like me there. They didn't know me and they never met me so it wasn't personal of course. But they were afraid that if I caused trouble or was the type of student who snuck beer in my door or broke other rules that they couldn't just suspend me or expel me. I had no parents for them to call if I got in trouble. I had no other family. And I had no home. So I lived on campus 365 days of the year. I was completely alone for Christmas and Thanksgiving and Easter. And I spent much of those breaks walking aimlessly what felt like a ghost town crying because I felt so alone. But somehow I made it. I graduated again. Somehow got accepted to and went to law school twice where I earned both my JD and LLM. 

Even though I have Autism, I am really intelligent according to my friends and I was always good at school. I received high honors in middle and high school. I had a assessment test while I was in the 7th grade and even then my reading ability was equivalent to a sophomore in college and my writing ability was equivalent to a junior in high school. In law school even through I didn't study much if at all (I'm not proud of this fact) I received the CALI award for receiving the highest grade in one of my classes, and I ended up with good grades in nearly all of my classes.

I was very lucky to have got my dream job right away at CT Legal Rights Project (CLRP). And I was there for over two years. I first started out as a unpaid intern. Then, working with the state Dept of Aging and Disability Services vocational services office I was able to get money under the social security ticket to work program and the working interview program so that I could work there while getting paid. I really loved working there. I don't care about money and I don't want to work for a big city law firm only helping out wealthy people. I would hate that. I want to help out people like me, particularly persons with disabilities and children growing up in the foster care system. And I don't want enough money. I just need enough to pay rent on my small studio apartment and a little extra for food and the occasional video game and that's it. There are no six figure salaries or anything fancy in my future. I am happy living a basic life while helping other people like me who need help. So that job was perfect for me. I felt that I had finally made it in life. I was no longer depressed or anxious or scared. I felt like all of the struggles that I went through in my life and all of the dark depressive times that I had to endure would be over. I felt for the first time hopeful. But then in a instant it was all taken by me.

In addition to having Autism, I also have a rather large cyst inside my brain that grew as large as a golf ball and nearly killed me. At that time I already had two very intensive brain surgeries. I had to be in the hospital for weeks and I had to relearn how to walk and eat and do basic tasks. I got the worst news in my life one day. The shunt that they placed inside my brain suddenly stopped working and there was a blockage inside my brain and so I needed a third brain surgery. I couldn't work for a while. So I was in the hospital and at home recovering for two months. But I hated every moment of my recovery. I really wanted to go back to work ASAP and after about two months I was able to go back. But that's when my life as I knew it ended along with all of my hopes and dreams. 

My supervisor at that time was giving me a really hard time. She complained about me to everyone and to me how it was my fault that she had to take on my clients. She screamed at me for using the word ""a few"" instead of the word ""several"" in a draft letter. She yelled at me that I was ""too polite and nice"" to the hospital caseworker. I felt as if she was literally out to get me and to make me suffer over the most trivial stuff. I honestly don't know what I did wrong but I felt really bad. I didn't want to have brain surgery. It was the hardest experience in my life because I was very close to death and I literally spent two days before the brain surgery drafting up my will and saying good bye to people I cared deeply for as I didn't know if I would ever wake up again. But my supervisor was verbally abusive to me and telling the executive director and legal director outright lies about me claiming basically that I wasn't doing my job right all because she felt like I chose to have brain surgery to make her life harder or something like that. But they didn't do anything and she got so angry at me that one day and she outright refused to even speak to me. She sent me a mean email saying she wasn't going to talk to me ever and then I asked for her to call me and she refused. I couldn't do my job at that point. 

I didn't know what to do at first. I was scared. I tried calling up my vocational counselor and my caseworker and neither of them answered my phone. So I looked at the employer handbook. The employer handbook stated, ""It is CLRP's policy to promote the resolution of disagreements or conflicts among staff directly between the people involved whenever possible...If you are unable to resolve conflicts or violations with your supervisor/manager/s, a regular/non-probationary employee may file a written grievance."" The employee handbook also stated, ""CLRP will not fire or otherwise penalize any employee for making a grievance regarding harassment, discrimination, or other violations of CLRP's equal employment opportunity policies under these policies..."". 

As someone with Autism, I need structure and certainly in order to function. I need rules to be successful. At every job and at every school I had ever attended I read the employee/student handbooks cover to cover. That's why I ended up being so good at law school and why I am perfect for this profession. 

The employee handbook clearly stated that since I couldn't resolve the conflict that my supervisor had with me, that I may file a written grievance and it didn't provide me with any other options. And to be clear, when I wrote the grievance I made it clear that I didn't want my supervisor to be penalized or punished. I just want to be able to do my job. I really want all my co workers to like me. I really want my supervisor to like me. But unfortunately, what I found out in life is a lot of people will never like me because of the fact that I am different. That makes me very sad and I don't know how to fix me.

So I filed the written grievance as instructed to by the rules and 34 minutes later I got a call from the executive director telling me that I was fired. It was the worst phone call in my life. I was very sad. I asked her over and over what did I do wrong and she wouldn't even tell me. 

I went to my best friend and cried in his arms for several hours. Neither of us knew what I did wrong. I felt like a horrible person. I felt broken. I felt like my life was over. 

My best friend texted the executive director the next day or a few days later to beg her to reconsider. She flat out refused to even talk to him. 

After a few weeks I filed a case with the Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities and the EEOC. I literally got fired for following the rules. I literally got fired because of the fact that I have Autism and that I needed to have brain surgery. And I literally got fired from the CT Legal Rights Project, the one law firm that was supposed to be preventing discrimination instead of engaging in discrimination. 

When I filed my complaint, all I wanted at the time was a apology and a pledge by them that they would never discriminate against anyone else ever again. That is it. I may be the first person with autism to live at undergrad or to attend law school or to work at the state capitol when I took my gap year from college but I don't want to be the last. I want everyone to have equal rights and opportunities.

To give you all a sense of what I have to deal with, in my state, it is legal for a employer to pay persons with disabilities less than the minimum wage. I had a job once where I was paid $1.50 a hour working at a store. That was a whole $7 less than the minimum wage. When I was 8 years old, the state wanted to sterilize me against my will so I wouldn't be able to have children. Lucky for me, I had advocates in my corner who fought that, and the state stopped forced sterilization of disabled persons about 12 years ago. But as it stands today, I do not have the right to get married and I do not have the right to have children of my own. If I get married, I lose my health insurance and my benefits from the Social Security administration including vocational services. While people who get social security retirement benefits can marry without losing their benefits, disabled people can not. In Connecticut, the Dept of Children and Families have a practice of taking children away from parents under the doctrine of ""predictive neglect"" which almost exclusively targets parents with mental health issues and persons with disabilities. There are cases where DCF literally will come into the hospital delivery room and take 3 day old babies because of the belief that persons with disabilities are too stupid to have their own children. There is no representation for persons with Autism in the legal profession or in elected office and I want to change that, not just for myself but the 5.3 million Americans like me. It is clear that the government wants to limit the number of disabled people marrying and having children because the government wants to limit the costs of providing services for people who have disabilities. If I was born a few years earlier, I would have been put in a asylum and just forgotten about even through I can take care of myself, live independently, and only need a few supports. The state of CT only provides enough funding to literally take care of a grant total of 17 people with Autism who need extensive supports from DDS so it's not like the government really cares to do much anyways. But the government is clearing taking measures to limit the births of disabled people, which I may add is in direct violation of the United Nations Commission on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide (Article 2(d), 1948).

All I want is equal rights and equal opportunities for myself and others. So I felt like if CLRP got away with what they did to me, then others would inevitably be hurt as well. And I just couldn't live with that. So I brought a legal case against them. But not only did they not apologize or make the promise that they will never engage in discrimination, they filed a fraudulent form with the Dept of Labor cutting off my unemployment benefits in retaliation for the CHRO complaint that I filed. I was in total panic. I found myself with no money. I couldn't afford food or rent or gas or anything. So I hired two lawyers. At first they were very skeptical. They didn't believe my story. They assumed I did something wrong. But after looking at hundreds of pages of emails and texts and other documents they saw that I was telling the truth. 

The case went into private mediation and my lawyers hired a retired judge to mediate the case. CLRP didn't offer a reason for why they fired me until the day of the mediation, and it was such a bs excuse that the judge scolded them. I never once got in trouble there. I had no verbal or written warnings, and on every single employee evaluation I received a perfect score. I got along with everyone and all my clients loved me. So they weren't able to offer any legal reason for why they fired me. So I ended up with a rather large settlement of nearly 2 years worth of wages (which sounds like a lot but after my attorneys fees and taxes and what not I barely got 50% of that award) but in exchange I had to sign a NDA. But I refused to sign the NDA until I made them promise that they would not speak ill about me to my future employers and they would submit positive letters of recommendations. They agreed to that in writing. And while I had some money at that time, that was a year and a half ago and now I am left with nothing and I still don't have a job. But to be clear, I didn't want the money. I just wanted them to apologize and to assure me that they wouldn't discriminate against anyone else ever again. But for some reason, it was easier for them to pay all that money then apologize. I don't get it.

But unfortunately even through they also promised to provide future potential employers with positive reviews, they had not kept their end of the bargain. In the past year in a half I applied to hundreds of jobs. But I had only one job interview because CLRP refuses to say good things about me or recommend me to potential employers as they promised. Instead, they either had flat out ignored phone calls and emails from potential employers or in the case of one employer told them not to hire me because I sued them or something along those lines. And to be clear, I am not prohibited by the NDA to say anything, except to say if I do say anything, they reserve the right to sue me for $2,000. And after all I've been through in the past year and a half, I don't care anymore. Let them sue me for $2,000. I literally have $4 to my name right now so I literally don't have anything left to lose. 

The last few months have been especially hard on me. I've lost hope. I'm depressed. I can't sleep. I can't eat. I even tried to kill myself last month. My best friend tried to abandoned me three times in the past two months because he can't take the fact that I'm no longer happy or joyful or hopeful like I used to be and he literally told me that I just don't feel like he likes me anymore. 

On top of that, I'm going to be evicted on Tuesday if I don't pay the rent by the 10th of the month. And I can't afford my car tax. And I'm going to have my cell phone turned off on Tuesday and my internet turned off on Friday because I have no money for Verizon or Comcast. I'm going to be homeless by the end of the month and most likely dead in a few months. My doctors are worried that I might have brain cancer, and I literally spent the whole afternoon on Thursday undergoing lots of tests and they had to inject me with stuff through my skull so I can continue to wake up and function. So if freezing to death on a sidewalk doesn't kill me my brain will kill me instead. I have no family to turn to. There's no hope left. I feel like I'm on a crashing plane right now. All I can think about is how stupid and naive I was to think I could be successful like everyone else. The teachers who laughed at me was right. The guidance counselor who told me that my hopes and dreams were stupid was right. 

There are many people who think that because I have Autism that there is something wrong with me. There is nothing wrong with me. To put it in it's most simplest form, a key difference between people with Autism and neurotypcial's is how the brain is structured. In my brain and in the brains of those with Autism, neurotransmitters are really good at communicating within regions of the brain and not across regions but in neurotypcial's brains, neurotransmitters are really good are communicating across different regions of their brains but not within the same regions. That doesn't make me worse off or better off. That makes me different. Albert Einstein, Bill Gates, Charles Darwin, Emily Dickinson, Michelango, Thomas Jefferson, and Jerry Seinfeld are just some of the people who have or are likely to had Autism. We are taking about some of the best artists, poets, scientists, business persons, Presidents, and comedians who have ever existed. 

But unfortunately people with disabilities face stigmas and barriers to success. Over 90% of people with Autism have no job. Over 90% of persons with disabilities live in poverty. And while my friends tell me over and over again that I am a good person and I am intelligent, kind, caring, compassionate, and resilient in a effort to build up my self confidence; I look at the state statues and federal regulations and I am reminded that in the United States and in Connecticut, I do not have equal rights under the law as others do, and that I am a second class citizen that is afforded fewer opportunities to succeed and fewer rights because I was not born the right way. The Constitution and Bill of Rights applies to everyone but me. So naturally I see that and I feel sad, rejected, and full of despair. 

All I want for myself and others like me is to be treated equally and fairly under the law. But instead I ended up being discriminated against an employer who is literally supposed to be fighting discrimination, and nobody wants to hire me even through the government is willing to potentially pay any employer that does want to hire me 130% of my salary for the first three months and possibly up to six months. But even with those incentives plus the possibility to qualify for $4,800 in additional tax breaks, no law firm wants to hire me so far because I have autism. They view me as a risk and they don't like me because I am different. Law firms would rather hire wealthy privileged people with well connected families than someone like me who is different, who has no family, who grew up in poverty, and isn't like the others. While one law firm did tell me they do want to hire me, they won't even return my phone calls and I've been waiting two months for them to follow through, so I assume they too don't want me. Now, because I am not good enough, I face homelessness and hunger and despair all because I got fired for quite literally following the rules and because as someone with Autism, I am not sophisticated enough to understand which rules to follow and which rules not to follow. I feel very sad and hopeless and I just can't take it anymore."

I’m not overly concerned with high compensation or working for the biggest names, I just want some experience that will make me a stronger applicant for new grad roles later on.

I’m a second year university student studying Computer Science. I’ve been applying to internships, getting interviews for software developer roles but I have been getting rejected constantly.

I have two months of experience working as a marketing intern at a tech start up and I’ve just found another internship that’s going to last 3 months doing the same role at another tech start up. How helpful do we think this really is when applying to software engineering roles?

Furthermore, if I can’t actually get an internship/job as a software engineer somewhere does this really impact my future ability to be a software engineer?

All I have is my personal website and university work to show my skill set and my website isn’t even the best to be honest.

Is it just a case of trying to develop a portfolio to showcase my skills and keep applying for jobs/internships?

Hopefully this makes sense, and thank you to whoever reads this!"

I have been looking for a programmer job.

I applied for a position at a relatively small company roughly 3 months ago. This was the first position I've applied for since it suited me the best out of all of which I've seen so far. It was even somewhat related to work I've done in my master thesis. To make it clear, the position required at least 3 years of experience so I sent an open request stating I liked the position. The interviews didn't go great and I honestly didn't expect to get an offer. And I still didn't get it, but HR called and informed me they would want to see me in their team. They also said they would call me in 2 weeks to arrange that final meeting where they would offer me a position. I have been waiting for 16 days now. To make things better, this isn't the only time they ""put me on hold"". I had been also waiting for the technical interview for a month. Reasons for such a long hiring process were the illness of the guy who was supposed to interview me and restructuring the hiring department. Also, my friend told me that the fact I sent an open request may also be the reason for the stall as they might have been creating a specific position for me or stuff like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I applied for a position at a big company 25 days ago and they've already offered me an internship job. The whole hiring process went great. I am happy with how the interviews went and pleased with a quick offer. The position, as in the work I would do in the company, isn't as tempting as the one from the smaller company, but it is still close to my interests. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I accept (via email) the big company's offer and if I like the upcoming offer better, I would need to decline the accepted offer to work with the smaller company. This would be a big moral dilemma for me. But at the same time, I don't want to let go of an offer before hearing the other company as well. Also, what can I expect from a company that has been stalling me for 3 months? Would it be a good idea to contact the smaller company to ""hurry"" them so I could potentially have 2 open offers at the same time to avoid any unethical decisions?"

I was an intern at this firm. Which the office culture was fun, there were parties A LOT (about once or twice a week) and if we didn't party for that week CEO would just call us in her room and we'd just drink and chat there. 

About the CEO, she was late 30s tall and beautiful woman which i really liked and admired a lot. She was the silent but deadly type.

So in one of these afterwork gatherings in her room me, her and 2 of our coworkers were just drinking and having fun. We were really late and had work the other day so drunk CEO just hugged and ""kissed"" (just  cheek touching other persons cheek which is really common in my country if you are friends) everyone goodnight and we all went home except me which my 21 y.o. self taught its a good idea to go to a bar and drink more even though i had to work next day.

Comes the next day, hungover and still drunk me just said good morning to everyone and got myself a cup of coffee and sat on my spot. CEO came to seat and asked me for something, i got up and she leaned forward to my face to make sure i really understood what she asked me for and some strange urge rose up inside me. It was assuring me that, this move is the appropriate one to greet her as well. The urge was to kiss her like she did last night. I swear it seemed like the MOST REASONABLE act at the time. And i just kissed her on one cheek first and on the other cheek just afterwards.

Everyone was dead-silent. Then one co-worker laughed his ass off until tears came out of his eyes, then everyone else. Yet she didn't seem like she was impressed by the events.

She didn't invite me to any of the gatherings afterwards and i quit about 2 weeks after that kiss.

TL;DR : I kissed the CEO of my company which she was not amused by my kiss."

It's getting incredibly competitive for the higher paying more exciting jobs. My advice:

Take your classes seriously and really focus on your fundamentals. (especially DS&amp;A)

Academic coursework are always behind on what industry is using in terms of tech /best practices. You need to always be learning and keeping up.

Don't focus too much on any particular programming language. They are tools. Good engineers can pick the right tool for the right job.

Practice. Practice. Practice. Start leetcode early. Find people to code with and learn from. Focus on side projects and build your github. 

Make sure you get internships every summer. They are extremely important and a great way to network.

Balance out research experience vs core engineering experience if you want to go to grand school or industry. 

Lastly, know your market value. levels.fyi is super useful for big tech. For example a fresh college grad with solid internships can very easily land $250k/year TC at FAANG."

* minimum wage $15/hr

I was offered an internship for 8 months working at my university as a IT technician. But the problem is that it's $15/hr, that's lower than my part time job I quit recently. 
I also worked as a part time IT technician for more money than that, so I have some experience.
However this is the only offer I got for this semester.
I'm not even sure if I want to go into IT or software development either so I feel like working for this low wage might be a waste of time since it's 8 months. They also might just get me to do grunt work.
Should I reject this offer and try to get something else in the summer/fall?

I graduated in Spring 2020 with a Communications bachelors. I graduated just this last December (after Fall 2021) with an associates in software development from my local community college. My associates is a two year degree in programming, all practical skills with zero computer science theory. During my bachelors, I did take my school's intro to CS course, got an A. 

Professionally, I held a couple student dev positions during undergrad/my associates, and I got a SWE internship in June, and I'm working at the same company full time now. I hope to stay here for several years as the company and tasks are great. 

I have a few reasons for considering going back to school (again) for CS: 

* I regret not doing a CS bachelors but it was not right for me at the time
* I feel like I'm missing that level of deeper understanding CS curriculum gives
* I'm worried about being competitive when it comes time for me to look for my other job
* Honestly, it seems like having a bachelors curriculum in your brain helps a lot with the interview process

My bachelors is from a very good school but unfortunately they don't admit second bachelors students into the CS program. I also specifically want an online program if at all possible because I hate in-person learning and don't want to stop working full time. 

I also haven't taken a math class since high school, so I feel like I'd have to take so many math/etc pre-reqs to qualify for most masters programs that it seems like a bachelors is the easier route... maybe. 

How should I weigh OSU vs some sort of online masters? (I don't love the OMSCS program in concept, and kind of want to find one a bit more robust)

next week I'll have my final interview at Amazon for an SDE internship. The interview has 2 parts, HR interview and a white-boarding coding test. It will be online.

I honestly thought I wasn't prepared enough, somehow I got through the other 2 prior interviews. Now, I am just practicing leetcode and will go over the leadership principles and try to prepare some sample answers.

 I don't think I'll be able to do well with a person watching, there are too many practice questions and concepts to become comfortable with by the interview. especially when the text editor they provide will not allow me to run the code (as far as I understand). 

Can you guys give any other tips if you have interviews at Amazon or similar interview? Is it possible if I don't do well on the coding interview is there any chance I can make up for it with the HR interview? So far I'm giving 90% of my time to the coding test and 10% to HR preparation.

If anyone has any life advice or advice on how to get into programming given my situation, it would be greatly appreciated! 

I'm three semesters away from graduating w/ a health science BS from a good university. With my HS degree, I had intended to be either pre-med or pre-NP. My problem is I have begun to doubt my  aptitude for health care. 

\[background\] Although I enjoy my classes and have been successful academically, I've realized that I am different from my peers who are also pursuing a career in health care. I am ""reserved."" I have a flat affect and I have a difficult time getting to know people / breaking the ice. I've been like this my whole life, experienced immense frustration with this part of my personality, but have now accepted it as who I am. I still maintain meaningful relationships with people but it just comes very slowly with new people. I'm leaving out a few details, but I think I would burn out of health care. And of course, there is also the years of additional schooling / tuition that I would have to complete/pay in order to get to where I think I wanted to be. I might be in a sunken ship. 

So programming?

I have never taken any formal programming classes. I barely know anything about programming except that I'm enjoying intro to JavaScript on khan academy. (8+ years old, bb lets go!) Most of my friends (who are ahead of me bc I took a gap year) are now getting cool programming related job offers / internships. Some of these friends made a pivot from math/economics majors into SWE with just a few CS classes on their transcript. My friends tell me its never too late to get into programming so here I am. 

Right now, I am planning to take time off from school to learn programming. I'm pretty sure I would benefit from a bootcamp the most during this time off. While I am exploring my own interest in programming, I am also now feeling overwhelmed by making decisions that a) help me learn the most about programming and b) are also going to set me up to have a successful career. So here are my questions:

1. Is completing/continuing a degree in Health Science relevant to my chances of getting a programming related job offer? I've heard 20% of google employees don't have a degree lol. 
2. Does it make sense to try and get a programming-related internship while being a health science major, stating that I am a **computer science minor (but a fake one bc when I apply for internships I'd likely only have completed a few CS classes)** and hope I get a return job offer so I don't have to complete my education? (the latter is similar to my friend's path who landed a very swag SWE job, although he decided to finish his last semester bc he goes to a really good school).
3. How important are bootcamps' brand/name/certification to employers?

After writing this, I can see I might be getting ahead of myself thinking about jobs and what not because what ultimately matters is whether I actually enjoy programming. Still, I feel like if I am going to work really hard to learn programming, I might as well make smart decisions so that I end up in a better position financially, and have the most career options/opportunities. 

well this was a lot and could have been more concise, but I appreciate anyone who read this far, any input would be greatly appreciated!!"

This was a great experience with a competitive application process, and they offered me a spot this summer if I get back to them by Jan 16. At the same time, there's a host of other opportunities that are in areas that potentially appeal to me more that I was thinking of applying to/have applied to, but none of these are guaranteed, so if I forgo the original opportunity, I would be taking the risk of ending up without anything. 

Another factor is that my mom works for company I interned with last summer, and though she had no influence whatsoever in my hiring process (the process was blind), a concern is that college admissions officers may give less value to that internship if they cross reference my mom's employment information. Is this something they might do? 

In the context of college admissions, do you think it is wiser to have a repeat internship at the same company (could show dedication), or to have internships at two different companies (diversity of experiences/more stuff)? Either way I would likely be able to obtain a good reference/reccomendation from the company I interned with last summer. I'm tempted to reject the offer  from that contractor because I'm sort of undecided about life and want to get a feel for work in more fields than just STEM before college, but at the same time, I'm worried this might be an unnecessary risk. If you could give me your input on this decision, that would be amazing!!"

It is relatively frequent until the last bit. 

Like everyone else asking a variation of this question I am a 25 year old software engineer who lives with his parents. I make the figures from other posts from other people working remotely for companies in the USA and live in Edmonton, so houses are currently very cheap, at least for me. I went to U of A and had lucrative internships during that and then got a job with a company here and then remote in Canada and then remote to the USA so I have also saved a bunch of money over time there too. Current affordability isn't an issue. 

Here are my concerns:

1. Software engineering may be a bubble. I may not earn as much as I do forever. I could pay off the house in 3 years if I redirected all the money currently saved/invested and still qualify at these prices. 

2. House prices are taking off like a rocket in the rest of Canada. Edmonton may be next. 

3. I'm single income and pretty much guaranteed to be for life. Most discourse here says that homes are really only affordable for dual income people. Pretty sure I won't be. 

4. All the unknowns. I like my life free of unknowns and uncertainty. As you can probably tell I am a nervous person. Maybe my parents hate me and don't let me inherit the house or they give it to my sister or something. Idk. Bad things happen. I don't want them to ever happen to me. 

A house a few blocks down is for sale. I was thinking of buying it and just holding it as an insurance policy in case something bad happens. Check in on it every month or so, set up some cameras and sensors, get insurance, etc. Get an annual inspection. It would not be abandoned. 

How wacky of an idea is this?"

rzjhkj,1,2022-01-08,Pseudo-ex Issues,SkyExciting1321,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/rzjhkj/pseudoex_issues/,"This is a long story. So I’ll try to be brief (though a podcast host I wrote into once said I had the longest parenthetical he’d ever seen. So…we’ll see how that goes. But there’s a TLDR at the end). 

Four years ago I fell in love at first sight with a wonderfully nerdy cute dorky boy. I was 23, he was 25. We worked together and became really close friends over the next year. He knew everything about me and I felt like I knew a lot about him too. He helped me deal with family stuff, we hung out, and texted almost constantly. 

The fall that I was 24 we had a lot of weird situations. He had a girlfriend but it was a weird situation. He would complain about her, tell me that he didn’t see it going anywhere, sort of flirt with me, but then send me snapchats of them together. I was convinced he was just a good friend (I mean I knew I liked him but I was convinced he walked on water and would never cross lines). We had a lot of cute friendship moments, went to the movies a lot (including a super awkward night with his girlfriend too), got each other cute Christmas presents, etc. and he continued to open up to me about his life and his goals and his issues with his girlfriend (and hindsight comes in here) and she sounded like she was crazy. (Aka he made her sound like she was crazy. But I was young and bought it.) 

They broke up, the next night he came to a Super Bowl party my roommate and I threw. We hung out in my room, he helped me with my resume for internship applications I was working on in grad school, and he was being really sweet. He later asked if I wanted to have a “lonely hearts club” dinner on Valentine’s Day. I clearly did, but knew he just broke up with his gf of a year and a half so I legit thought it was just as friends. We underestimate the crowd of Cheesecake Factory on Valentines night and end up bailing for Qdoba and Brooklyn Nine-Nine. And Qdoba had a BOGO special if you kissed the person you were with. So awkward blushing me kissed him on the cheek. But again, I didn’t think he was interested, I thought it was just about the food. That night some slight flirting occurs, he has his arm behind me on the couch but not around me so I wrote it off and some other awkward moments but nothing noteworthy. The next night he was being flirty but also a little skittish and I was like “hey sorry if I was misreading things, I thought you were flirting.” “I was flirting…” Blah blah blah kiss kiss kiss. 

He didn’t want to “date” since he just got out of a relationship. And I thought I was being super mature by not running the other way (especially since he made the first move). So we “hang out” for a few weeks. Multiple dates, cute moments, fun texting and “texting”, and light physical stuff but I had a boundary where I didn’t want to have sex if we weren’t “dating.” 

One night we have a really fun date and make plans to see each other the next night after work. The next day I get home and I text asking if he’s ready to hang out. He says he’s not feeling up to it, I ask if things are okay and he says not really. And proceeds to tell me out of nowhere that things are moving too fast and he needs a break since he just got out of a relationship. (Hindsight: I let him set the pace the entire time) And he said all of this over text. And of course he wants to stay friends and I want to stay friends because he was my person before all of this started. 

Three weeks later we’re backsliding and flirting and he mentions that the issue wasn’t just that it was too soon after his breakup but that we worked together. (Even though we worked together when he made the first move…) 

A few weeks after that we’re still flirting and hanging out and we make a joke marriage pact for when we’re 40 and he quips “or just call me after you graduate” (implication: when we’re not working together anymore). 

Insert a year and a half of messiness. I dated people, he dated people. Less blatant flirting but still some at times (when we weren’t coupled up) Periods of time where he would drop off the face of the planet even just as a friend and imply that I was imagining it. And my feelings for him ebbed back and forth, especially in the periods where I was single. During this time he often made comments when we’d talk about relationships and dating apps etc.  “I wouldn’t want to date someone younger than me again.” “Im more interested in women a few years older than me.” (I’m younger by two years) and “I would never want to date someone in our field” (clearly I’m in this field too). And each time it was a twist of the knife. 

Pandemic hits, I graduate and find another job. I want to clarify I didn’t leave that job because of him, there were dozens of reasons. I’m gone for about a month and then I decide to lay it out there that I’m still interested in something. I tell him I like him, I think we’d be a good fit, we worked well in the past but the external circumstances didn’t work, and that I think we have a window. 

Literal crickets. He didn’t acknowledge it one way or the other. I didn’t get a rejection text, I got ignored. And the conversation wound up moving somewhere else a few days later. The next weekend he sent me a message referencing his “fuck buddy.” That was about the last straw for me in terms of being interested. But then we enter the six months of me progressively getting angrier and angrier (and bitchier). (And I now see why the “crazy” ex-girlfriend was likely driven a good distance of the way to the brink by him)

I’m not proud of this progression, though I do want to point out that I was slightly led on with talk of future possibilities, crushed with talk about “I wouldn’t date younger women” and gaslit both on the dating and the friendship realms for years. We had two big conversations during that six months. No apologies were made for anything that he ever did and it was almost laid out that the issue was me attaching vs. him being avoidant and manipulative. During the first one  he even admitted that some of the times he would disappear friend wise for weeks were bc he didn’t know what to say to me, but even after this conversation when I asked him about stuff he would say he’s just busy and of course it’s nothing more than that. The second one came after we were both equally dumb and engaged in flirting and sexting one night. 

After the second conversation he completely disappeared. We didn’t talk for almost two months, and then it was because something work related came up. And during all of that time with no contact I was actually doing great. But then he was in our discord server and treating me differently for teasing him the same way others were teasing him, and later making comments about dating and flirting (which I did give bitchy snarky responses to) and I was always just so angry anytime I saw anything from him, because of how much I’d been hurt by him over the years and how little recognition he had for that hurt, even on the friend level. Because at this point I was way past pining for him, but I missed the friend I’d had for almost four years. Another friend suggested I make a clean break and I realized they were right. So I deleted all group chats and phone numbers, unfollowed, threw out photos and letters I’d written him but never sent, the movie ticket stubs I had from our flirting/“dating” period, etc. And things got so much better for me. 

I’ve been really happy and chill for a few months now. And I hoped that he would work on his shit and grow because I tried to take a trauma-informed approach to how his behaviors came out etc.

I recently found out that he has a new girlfriend. I didn’t know anything about her but I was genuinely able to say I hoped the best for them. Then I realized she works where I used to work (he’s since left too but there was some overlap so, coworker). And clearly since she’s a coworker she’s in the same field as us, something he was adamant he didn’t want in a partner. And she’s even younger than I am about 5 years younger than him (and I was too young for him at 2 years younger). 

I’m not mad in a jealous way because I clearly see all of the red flags now that I’m out of the toxicity and that I’m older too. But it’s just mindblowing to see someone repeat the same patterns and not do the work to heal themselves first (and maybe he has. But our last issue was only 6 months ago…) So for this girls sake, I hope he’s a healthier dude than he was for me. Because she’s the same age I was when our shit went down, and when I was 24 I was naive and in love and missed all the signs and wound up in a three year spiral of shit with someone I didn’t even technically date. 

But yeah. 


TLDR: Pseudo-ex caused me lots of emotional damage for years, said he wouldn’t date people with X, Y, and Z characteristics (all of which I have) and is now dating a girl with XYZ characteristics."

I honestly just don’t like my current uni and I’ve been online most of my time here which really affected my mental health. I don’t feel like I’m getting a « college experience » at all, and I regret not applying to US universities when I was in high school. I want to transfer so bad, but I need financial aid (i have an almost full scholarship at my current university), and I’ve heard that it’s basically impossible because I’m not a US citizen. The maximum I can afford is 15k/ year :/

Stats/ ecs:

- 1520 SAT score (800 maths, took it during senior year of high school)
- cumulative GPA: 3.91/4.0 (4.0/4.0 fall2021) (also, don’t know if it counts but some of my courses were taught by top25 professors from the main  campus since we were online)
- 3x dean’s list
- my high school grades were good 
- Currently plan to major in applied maths but I’m considering switching to econ or finance

Main ECs: 

- I’ve been working 3 part time jobs at the same time since July (over 25hours/week, all education related, including a TA job at my university)
- I’m a research assistant (humanities-at my uni, also paid, did not include it in the 3 jobs I mentioned because I just started)
- volunteering ( one CS related)
- I’m publishing 2 short stories 
- editor at one of my uni’s magazines
- not an EC but I speak 4 languages fluently + intermediate level in another

+ some ECs during high school (including an internship during senior year and a summer program abroad at a top25 university)

other than that, I was not very involved because of the online situation

I think I can get pretty strong rec letters

Hi! I'm currently a student at a HYPSM+, graduating with a BS in Mathematics and MS in Computer Science in 2024. I have a strong academic background, having a 4.0 and having taken courses in Stochastic Processes/Modeling, Algorithmic Trading, Inference, Linear Regression, various topic-specific Deep Learning courses, Reinforcement Learning, Econometrics, and Game Theory. Every year, I see a few people from my school make QR at firms like Citadel - these people are usually olympiad/RSI people. I went to an underfunded, low income high school so I don't have any high school accolades and might lack some of the quick-thinking skills needed on the job/interview. I'm also still trying to figure things out, but I definitely want to try quant research. Since I haven't settled down on one particular thing I want to do, my resume is pretty varied - I have a lot of ML research experience (looking to draft my first paper this year), a FAANG SWE role, a smart contract engineer contract position (do firms even like crypto?), a fundamental/market research role @ a hedge fund (think something like BlackRock, Bridgewater, AQR), and interning as a quantitative researcher at a less-prestigious firm this summer (think something like Cubist, Virtu, Squarepoint). I'll use this internship to figure out if I want to do quant research, but would like to prepare nonetheless. The interview for my summer role was just a few brainteasers, data analysis, and statistics questions, so pretty similar to what I've been doing. I've heard that the higher tier firms have much harder questions, however. 

For next summer, I'm aiming for a QR internship at a top prop shop (want something like Jump, Radix, Five Rings, Jane Street). I have the ""Heard on the Street"" book but people have said that one is too easy for top firms. What are some additional resources I could use to prepare for these, and is there anything I should do this year to maximize my chances of passing the resume screen? (I've heard that for some of these places, it's pretty hard to get considered without having a connection already, and this field is pretty difficult to navigate as a student from a low-income background.) After graduation, if I don't get any looks from top firms, should I look to earn an MFE? (I think a Ph.D is out of the picture because I can't devote 4+ more years of my life to school - need a source of income.) One of my friends says to keep an eye out for headhunters - how do I get headhunter looks? Any advice helps, thanks!"

rzmrhr,36,2022-01-09,Shopify VS Amazon,hitkets,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/rzmrhr/shopify_vs_amazon/,"I'm in my last semester at uWaterloo and am lucky enough to have offers from both Shopify as a production engineer and AWS as an SDE but am not sure what to pick.

I prioritize culture, pay, growth and what will look better on my resume.

**Culture,** I knoww Shopify is the way to go (even though not the biggest fan of WFH).

**Pay**, currently I'll be getting paid slightly more at Shopify cause I'll be hired as an L5 instead of entry level, but in the long term (2-3 years) I think Amazon would pay me more (your girls trying to retire by 32 lol).

**Growth**, I wanna be a senior in the next 2-3 years. Since I'm getting hired at Shopify as an L5 the next step is SeNiOr so that SEEMS doable?? How long is the average for someone at AWS to get from entry level to senior, I have no clue?? Please keep in mind I am **not** very smart, just know how to talk to people and get what I want.

**Make my resume pretty**, I did an internship at both places and when I went to AWS **alot** more people reached out to, congratulating me. I know its cause its ✨ FANG ✨but will **BIG** companies really favour me more in a few years is I worked at AWS instead of Shopify. I know it comes down to SkIlLs but like I have none sooo purely looking at my resume and no interviews what would look better?? (I feel like is AWS but wanna confirm).

My gut rn is saying Shopify cause I loved my team there, but my gut seems to change its mind every 5 mins. I've BEEEN debating b/w the two and have no clue what to do. So I'm asking you please pick for me, I HATE making decisions for myself and would rather let a bunch of strangers on the internet do it for me."

I would really like to do this abroad, but I don't know how common this is in other countries and thus I have some questions. I'd really appreciate if you can specify the country you're from when answering this question. If it is relevant, my field is in biogeochemistr/microbial ecology/soil science.

1. Is it possible for international students, or students from other schools, to join a research lab for a few months under supervision of a professor.
2. Could such research internship be continued over summer break?
3. Are internship positions advertised or is it better to contact interesting labs and inquire about possibilities over email?

I'm already talking to professors at my current university about this to see whether colleagues in their network are looking for interns.

rzn4u0,2,2022-01-09,Need Internship Advice,machj_,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/rzn4u0/need_internship_advice/,"I am currently interning at a company where I love the work I am doing. It is full-stack web development. However, I am stuck on a decision on whether I want to ask for an extension or go with a coop program that I was accepted into. This coop program is where they pair students with two paid 6 months internships, but students have no control over where they're placed. Companies select their interns in a pool like a draft system. I graduate next Spring of 2023, and the two internships are this upcoming Spring and Summer and the Summer and Fall after I graduate. 

My question is is it worth pursuing the coop program, or should I ask to extend and hopefully get hired full-time at my current internship? The coop program gives me a chance to experience different company cultures and work on different projects. I am also very interested in cloud technologies and security, and there are a few companies in the program that offer them. However, it would sort of delay my search for full-time roles after graduation. I could end up at a company I don't like, or the worse case is that my coop internship could be canceled due to the pandemic and I'm left with no internship for the upcoming Summer. 

What are your thoughts and advice? I am all ears. Thank you!

It's very well written, just hasn't made many initial sales and he's feeling a bit down about it. He has the book set up on Amazon and Goodreads, and he already has a personal website (Wix).

I'm at an entry stage of my developer career: currently have an unpaid internship working with Angular and I know my way around React and backend with JS and Python. I know databases well enough to put something together, and a smidgeon of data analytics, pandas/numpy/Selenium if that factors in.

Ideas I've considered:
- some sort of scraping service that could pull up google search results based on his book title and spit out a summary of places for him to look up, identify places where the book is being discussed and try to push sales there?
- reddit bot of some kind to identify mentions of the book title?
- set up some kind of book discussion website (separate from his personal website) that would allow for comments/discussion centered around the book content itself?

If anyone has ever worked with Authors before that might be able to provide some additional ideas that I could pursue, I'd be grateful! Mainly just want to help out a friend and do a project in the process.

rzneu7,1,2022-01-09,Parents getting divorced again; No place to go; What to do?,No-Shoulder3346,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/rzneu7/parents_getting_divorced_again_no_place_to_go/,"edit: cross posted to r / personal finance first. sorry if it's so finance based. please feel free to share your thoughts on anything. i'm happy to respond to any one.

So I'm 21. I live in Phoenix, Arizona, USA. Back when I was a kid (circa 2007), my parents got divorced. Needless to say, that had a huge impact on me. They later got remarried, circa 2014. Problems have risen in recent weeks and in the past hour, from my bedroom, I've heard them discuss how they're going to go about getting divorced again. Mother mentioned that she doesn't want to pay the house anymore. So then I'll more than likely be heading my own way moving forward. Fck. I'll save the emotional turmoil perhaps for another subreddit, but I guess I've got to grow the fuck up in the next 1-3 months. Let's focus on me now:

Future prospects: I'm currently in school for engineering, B.S in Mechanical Engineering. I've gone the community college route for the first two years (2020-2022) and so I shouldn't have any expenses for that remainder unless its books, dropped courses, summer courses, etc. I will be going into my junior year starting 2023, so that's where the debt will start. I plan on going to Arizona State University as its the closest university to me (30 minutes away from current home). Given 2021-22 yearly student costs, I could expect to graduate with $35,000 in debt. Not too shabby, actually -- but it could be higher or lower depending on financial aid, I'm not too familiar with how those numbers are calculated.

According to CreditKarma, my credit is usually at 765. It's probably a bit inflated, but I've been blessed to get to that point with disciplined credit card management. I do own my car (2016 Buick Verano, a little on the small side for living inside of) and insurance is like $300 (usually just send a lump sum to my parents on what I owe per month) because it was a salvage title. It's ridiculous IMO but it's better than no car or having a car payment I suppose, so I'll live with it. Definitely going to need a timing belt change in the coming year though.

With regard to income, after taxes, I'm currently making $27,000/yr. Kinda shit, to be honest. I work at an Aerospace and Defense microelectronics company as an assembler. I'm pretty much only there to get some experience in the industry, meet and connect with engineers -- call it an intro to internships of sorts. I have learned quite a bit though and the things I do there are essentially akin to engineering technicians or engineering interns. Making fixtures, I know CAD software, can follow routers, some experience working on industrial 3d printers and other PCB manufacturing equipment. There is solace that I'll at least have the associate's by the end of the year, so more earning power there potentially (?)

Savings, Investments, Assets: I currently have $13k in stocks. $3800 in Roth (sad I know lol, definitely should be higher). $2000 in savings. NO debts as it stands. I put a lot into stocks because my expenses haven't been very high historically (relative to someone who lives on their own, of course) but also I wanted to have a better APY than a standard Marcus high-yield savings. But also as a younger person, I'm just more willing to take those risks. On a similar note, I do have quite a few expensive things around the house too that I can try to liquidate as needed that could yield a couple hundred dollars each. Examples of this are my ultrawide monitor, 3d printer, guns, compound bow, mountain bike, piano, old Xbox One that I no longer play, etc. At this point, it's all about survival.

Running out of things to mention. I will say that over the course of the past hour that I've been writing this, I feel a bit more at ease as I see my financial situation isn't all that bad. It's really just the emotional side of it all that sucks the hardest. I guess my questions moving forward would be:

Is there anything that I'm overlooking in terms of renting an apartment or home ownership for that matter?

Is it possible to transfer my family's mortgage to my own name? I wonder if I could refinance the home for a longer term and maintain it as best as I can.

What documents should I start prepping for 'adulthood'?

Should I start liquidating those 'assets' (guns, monitor, printer, etc) asap as a form of safety net?

Is it realistic to somehow grind through both some kind of home payment and student loans at my current income level?

What resources can you suggest to me to navigate this? (whether you think of the financial, education, emotional, etc. aspects)

And any other general advice you've got lying around from your years of wisdom on this earth.

Thank you all"

I had some internships where I was sitting alone in an office for 8 hours every day without any distractions having to write the same unit tests or integration tests and I despised it. I am just not passionate whatsoever about making software, but I love theoretical CS. I am planning to do a PhD, because I don't want to leave university so soon. I am also heavily considering becoming a professor, as I have been a tutor for a couple courses at my uni and I have enjoyed that work. Going into the direction of theoretical CS instead of practical SE does hurt my job options quite a bit, I presume. So what are my alternatives to staying at uni?

Hi everyone!

I am graduating in the coming May (Econs &amp; Data Analytics double major from top university) and I am currently torn in between my choices and I would really appreciate any advice from any professionals.

Long story short, I grew up in Singapore so I would really love to work there but due to my nationality being Korean, I am having difficulty getting a job there. I currently have 2 offers:

1. F&amp;B company based in Singapore, they are offering me a ""financial planning and reporting"" position. I do not know what is the pay is like but I'm guessing around $4K/month. I liked my internship there and the culture is good. The company has revenue of $500M, looking to IPO in 3 years and has a small team so I'm guessing I have lots of room to grow.
2. Major Brokerage firm in Korea, they are giving me rotational programme but I interned in ""equity derivative"" department so I'm guessing I'll get a sales role there in the end. I heard from my senior his starting pay was $60\~70K/annum with $20K incentive on a good year. The culture there is quite old and very hierarchical so I don't really like the culture there. In terms of promotion, they have fixed a promotion timeline so not much career acceleration there.

Of course, I will be applying for other positions in the meantime but these are the choices I have. I am confident with my CV I probably can get into most finance positions in Korea (anything except for very prestigious ones like IB) but would love to work in Singapore if I have the choice.

So after the long exposition, my question is: Would option 1 be a good choice relative to option 2 in terms of how career progression? I am not sure how far I can get in corporate finance without any accounting background and the salary growth is a concern as well.

I would really appreciate any form of advice!

Thank you all and wish you a great week"

rzscbj,3,2022-01-09,coinbase vs teradata internship,LingLingAndy,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/rzscbj/coinbase_vs_teradata_internship/,"so this is actually a really easy decision for me (and i’m guessing for a lot of u too), and i would pick coinbase because they deal with a super interesting problem space that’ll probably open some doors for me in the future that many other companies couldn’t. it’s just a really cool experience and i’d like to both work there and have it under my belt for the future. however the only issue is i’m looking to fill my gap quarter in the spring with an internship that’s remote that i can do back in the city where i go to school. coinbase being a remote first company makes it sound almost like the PERFECT fit except their spring spots are full and they’re super strict about not moving my offer to the spring. why would this alone make me want to consider teradata? because i’ve already accepted an internship at another company that i’m super excited to work in person at the bay during the summer for. they’re also flexible and if i want to do coinbase i’d just move them to the spring, but that means i miss out on going to the bay and experiencing working at a company in person, which is really important to me because i’ve never been to the bay before and i hated my remote internships last year. i also don’t want to go up during the spring because i already have a place here near my university so i’d be paying for that (don’t wanna sublease because i’d have to move out and i’m planning on living here for a bit) and i don’t want to leave since all of my friends who will be here for school. so basically, i miss out on an in person internship by taking coinbase and as a result i’m kind of considering teradata only for that reason. right now i’m leaning towards coinbase and i can’t imagine rejecting their offer but the pros of choosing teradata is holding me back.

anyway sorry for the long post i might have rambled a bit but i’d love your opinion if you’ve read it through! appreciate your time, thanks!"

I've always lived day by day not wanting to be an adult, that was my greatest fear to grow up, never had a dream, never saw myself after my 17th birthday so I never tried. I fell in love with a wonderful girl, she was perfect, gorgeous, and smart she helped me a lot I learned to eat and stopped hurting myself, but I still wanted to die, I still couldn't see myself at my 20s. I told myself that I would end it all until I'm 21, I just needed 1 achievement that I could feel proud.

My last year of school first semester out of 2 I was giving my all to get better grades, to get into a good university I wanted to try to be happy by her side, it was the first time I thought about the only dream I really wanted to archive, a family. At the end of the semester my estranged father died, my best friend of 7 years told me he was tired of me always being depressed the day I told him I wanted to improve and be a better friend and the last straw was my breakup. Failed my suicide attempt, was kicked out of school, was internalized into the best psych clinic for a month, a lot of pills and couldn't leave my room for the rest of the year, when I got the courage to go outside with someone I was sexually assaulted. The only hope I had was the promise with myself but still didn't want to live, stopped eating and started to hurt myself again. for years I was just moving forward waiting for my 21st birthday, dated a lot of people, long and short relationships but never felt love again for anyone, didn't had friends and never thought I could archive my dream. My life was miserable I just wanted to destroy myself, sold my body to anyone who wanted to have it, home was a horrible place to be, went to dangerous areas at night alone, etc.

21st birthday, I pondered about my death, the time was over, but I told myself just 1 semester I can still do something that I can feel proud about. I met him, he was an angel when I saw him I knew it was love at first sight, it was mutual, he graved my hand and showed me that life can be colorful, 21 years on this earth and never felt anything like it, At his side I felt at home, I wanted to be better I wanted to heal I wanted to archived my dream of having a family, for 3 years I did my best even when I felt depressed he was there, he didn't need to say anything just knowing he was there, in this world, was enough. The best 3 years of my life until this semester, one of the worst times of my life, home life got even worst, had lots of troubles at university and lost half my monthly salary, I felt lonely but I tried my best every day, graduation was less than a year away, In less than a year I could start my family with him, less than a year I could move out I just needed to hang in there just a little more. I was so focused on doing everything right that ended up neglected him, he felt it was worse than it was but I could never talk my side our friends agreed with me that he should at least listen on what I had to say but he just broke up with me the last week of university before my internship, the last day I had to give my all and tomorrow I could give him all my attention. He blocked me, he told me to rot and never contact him again. The only person I've ever loved this much told me to rot the day after telling me he still loved me I felt like I was the worst all my efforts were in vain my life crumbled in front of me, Took pills, cuts but that day I just had that word in mind rot and tried to jumped in front of a train, at the last second a security guard graved me and pulled me into his chest, that day I died. 

This was less than a month ago, I've having nightmares every day that he is next to me telling me everything is alright but he is not there, I can't have a family now, the work I got its great but its useless to me all I ever wanted in this life was to be by his side and now that I'm alone again I know that I'm alone in this world, I'll never met someone like him an angel the only one I've ever love, the only one that made me felt like every day had a meaning, he's gone and I don't have hope left.

Talking about it makes me feel less anxious even though it makes me cry a lot. This post it's just part of my last resources. Thanks for your time."

I go to a mid tier college with honestly what I would call a subpar CS program. I feel that I have not really gotten the greatest education, that I'm not learning the things I should be. Despite this, I somehow managed to land an internship this summer with Amazon.

I was honestly surprised to be offered the position. I did not do so great on the initial coding assessment that Amazon gave, but they still moved me forward in the interview process. When I had my final interview, it was with one Amazon SDE who asked me a few easy behavioral questions and then gave me one algorithm problem to solve in real time. The interviewer said they could give hints for the problem, which I did end up needing one or two, but I was able to get the algorithm working to max efficiency, which is what they were looking for. So I ended up getting a call back offering me the position. 

I feel that my skills are not where they should be. I feel that my college has let me down, and honestly I just really haven't had enough motivation to do a lot of individual projects on my own, so my experience is practically nonexistent. I think I just got lucky to have an easy interviewer, but I worry that I will really fall behind when I am thrown into the internship program this summer.

So I am asking for advice from any former interns, especially those who worked for Amazon. What would you suggest I try to focus on to become prepared? Do you think I will get eaten alive by Amazon, I have heard many horror stories about working there, like that they are extremely demanding. Will there be lots of opportunities to learn in the internship, or will they expect a certain level of knowledge already coming into it? I just worry I will get there and be asked to do things that I have no idea how to do, and fall behind the other interns. Thank you for anything you may have to share regarding working at Amazon."

The single interview I attended went perfectly. I checked all the qualifications. I had a background in science (Bachelors), I did relatable research to the posting, and I was even towards the end of my first semester for a Masters in Data Science, and one of the qualifications **on their website** that would put me ahead of other applicants was 'experience in Statistical Analysis.'

I never stopped smiling during that interview. They asked me tons of questions on my interests and how that would apply to the company; how my qualifications in SAS and analytics would enhance my undergraduate background as a potential R&amp;D technician. I had the most eager grin on my face, I knew I had this job before I even walked in the facility, and in the middle of the company tour, the HR manager even cocked her eyebrow and said, ""I don't know if anyone has ever told you, but you're an extremely positive person."" This sealed the deal for me. I was ready to get to work.

A week later, I got a phonecall back. The person who arranged the interview told me, ""The HR manager wanted to say that you seemed overqualified for the position and that you'd be best suited for a career in Data Science.""

Luckily this was a phonecall, because my facial expression was appalled. The entire time I was ready to reply, ""I understand you weren't there for the interview, but I'm focusing on my BS with my *single* semester in a Masters program complimenting my growing skills. I'm not seeing how this is an overqualification.""

I didn't. I wasn't interested in starting drama. So, I just thanked her for my time and hung up the phone. There's no pretty bowtie to wrap this post up, so I'll just wait for some responses."

rzxs8b,17,2022-01-09,Dropping out of my PhD and would like to find a job this summer. Advice needed.,Ming725,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rzxs8b/dropping_out_of_my_phd_and_would_like_to_find_a/,"I am currently a CS PhD student in my second year and I'm planning on mastering out and finding a job. If possible I want to find a full-time job starting this summer. I also have a CS master's and an undergrad degree in the US.

I studied CS theory (complexity, then cryptography), which means I haven't had any real programming projects for like 4 years. My research won't be interesting to SWE people. However I do have a good grasp of the fundamentals so algorithm interviews shouldn't be too hard for me. I also TA-ed a lot, and some of them involved giving out lectures on data structure/algorithms. Besides these, I only have small course projects, no internships. I am worried that I got no edge over an undergrad, and I'm likely a weaker candidate due to a lack of coding experience.

My school(s) have good CS programs, many undergrads are able to land great SWE jobs.

My current plan is to apply to (general? full-stack?) SWE jobs, but I'm not entirely sure yet. I'm learning web dev and plan to finish some web projects to fill my resume. At the same time I'm doing leetcode problems to build up my coding muscles.

I have the following questions:

1. Are there career paths/positions where I can frame my master/phd dropout experience into valuable qualifications? I'm under the impression that my past 4 years (2 master, 2 PhD years) are probably worth nothing. Is there a way to make them worth *something?*
2. What do you think would help me the most in my job search? Is a web project going to be helpful?
3. If I manage to convince my advisor to let me stay for another semester, is getting an internship this summer a better plan?

Thank you guys in advance and I appreciate any feedback!"

a.) When comparing ITS, Accounting, and Finance, what is the ranking from best to worst in terms of doability, job prospects, salary, difficulty, resources, internships?

b.) What are some of the entry level jobs for all 3 majors and what is the scope for growing in all the fields?

rzzt7z,8,2022-01-09,"For all you interns, use your University!",ShinigamiLeaf,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rzzt7z/for_all_you_interns_use_your_university/,"This is partially in response to a post from yesterday about unfair internship practices. I work at one of the top ten largest Universities in America in the career services department. My job there is to manage internship requests and make sure that the companies our students are interning with are legit. So here's some tips I have for all of the interns here:

1. Make sure that career services knows about your internship. Last semester about 12% of internships at my institute weren't registered with our career services. I know at least three went completely sideways because we got three phone calls about internships we didn't know about. At least at my University, registering your internship means that the company needs to sign paperwork that lays out some specific protections for you the intern that my state does not offer. Ex. Most places in my state could fire you for being trans, including internships. After they sign our registration paperwork my school WILL sue if they try that. 

2. Make sure you're getting the proper number of hours. At my uni it's 45 hours = 1 credit. So if you work 10 hours a week over a 14 weel semester you should get 3 credits. Make sure you are earning the credits you're supposed to be for the work you're doing. Any hour you are on your site is a learning hour, and if your supervisor says otherwise, contact you career services and your faculty of record for your internship.

3. Learn red flags. Here's a couple I see pretty frequently off the top of my head:

. Your job description is basically what I'd expect an actual worker to do

. You are being asked to build a website with no one supervising you

. Your internship is out of someone's house. Not even a garage connected to someone's house, just straight up a house that someone lives in.

. There is no actual business front or documents for the business you're interning for.

. The business has no website, uses Gmail, and their only online presence is a Facebook that hasn't been updated since 2019

. Your company works in 'web 3.0 NFT generation software and Metaverse applications' 

. Your internship has offered you course credit without checking with anyone in your department that your internship fits your degree enough to qualify for course credit.

These are all laughable, and all situations that have come across my desk in the last two months. If your internship hits any of these look VERY CLOSELY into the company who wants you to intern

4. Get your internship paid if at all possible. For some reason therapy, healthcare, and education internships usually have a state stipulation that you can't be paid for them. Me and probably every other person with my position thinks that's bullshit. Some schools may have a fund that can give you a stipend for taking these internships. Talk to your faculty, your career services, and your financial aid. Too many studies have shown that only rich white men benefit from unpaid internships, when they're often not the people getting them.

5. Save all important documents, and translate them into English if necessary. We require students registering their internships to have a job offer and job description. WAAAAY too often are we told 'it was a verbal offer'. A verbal offer doesn't mean anything to me except that your supervisor is probably going to be a pain. Request written documents and give them to your internship faculty or career services. This has saved multiple students' asses before when their boss starts trying to make them do tasks far outside the internship scope.

6. Use us as the bad guys. If your site supervisor is being an ass, lie. Say you need to check with your faculty because this sounds like something they warned you about. BCC someone at the uni you trust into an email chain. 40% of my job is dealing with employers who often don't understand what an internship is supposed to be; the catharsis of getting to lose it at a particularly bad employer is immeasurable. Use me as the bad guy, you'll probably make my week


So yeah, most people at your school's career services probably hate your supervisor and internship process about as much as you do. Get paid internships if at all possible, and please make fuss about unpaid internships."
s012z5,1,2022-01-09,Advice - Recent job and getting crushed by responsibilities/tasks I'm not qualified for,ThroAway219402938,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/s012z5/advice_recent_job_and_getting_crushed_by/,"Hello all,

I recently started in a new position mid-October. I didn't have the full formal education, as I got a job as an intern in college that transformed into a full-time gig. After that, I moved to this new full-time position. It was definitely a step-up in pay, but also responsibilities. One of the key ""gaps"" in my knowledge is technical - I work in IT, and one of my responsibilities is around configuration/compliance of systems. This is a huge dataset that I don't have much experience analyzing at scale... either using python or database queries. The expectation from my boss is that now that I've set up the tools to gather this information, I should have the pieces of the puzzle to ""figure it out"". This is also a highly visible project that will be given visibility into the C-Suite... and I'm just stuck. This is also a time-critical need, so I don't have the luxury of self-learning on the go. 

I've worked with this boss before at a previous organization, and I was completely transparent with my skillset in the interview/resume. He is probably the reason why I'm there - he was a mentor at my previous position. Between those two facts, I assumed that he would have a good grasp on what my current capabilities are. This is just one instance of being ""talked up"" to myself and others when I don't have that experience, and I've had to correct those assumptions many times. 

Because of my role being more senior, I think that I may have ""bit off more than I can chew"". I've been able to deliver two major projects thus far, but this one I think is where the ""rubber will meet the road"". The organization doesn't really tolerate people who do not know what they are doing, and I think this project is what will end me. 

I've let him know of the difficulties that I am having, as well as giving him regular status updates on the actions I've taken to progress. However, he is very results oriented and just wants it ""done"". There are also many other ""Priority 0"" tasks that have been loaded onto me, and I'm just feeling crushed. 

Should I try to grunt through it, knowing that I'll be setting myself (and him) up for failure? Or should I have an open conversation with him about my capabilities, at the risk of being fired?

As far as savings go, I have enough to last for 6-9 months depending on how far I need to cut back, and I assume I can get another temporary job pretty quickly... what I would like to do is finish my formal education (another 2-3 semesters of work) to plug in the gaps.

What would you all do in this situation?"

I accepted a FT offer in a back office position at a BB and am only now finding out about the stigma and lack of challenging work that comes with it.

It is now January and my start date is in a few months. I am considering applying to other roles, although I am worried that it might be too late to renege on the initial offer. I’m torn between applying for other roles now and potentially reneging the acceptance if I get a better offer, or toughing the job out for a year before looking for other opportunities.

I'm a 2021 graduate in CS interested in pursuing an MBS in the Applied Computing concentration at Rutgers Camden (previous internship experience as a research-focussed software engineer at Airbus, data analytics and deep learning teaching assistant at the National University of Singapore and currently a Site Reliability Engineering C++ Developer at Amadeus, working towards a research paper in bioinformatics under some professors from King Saud University).

However, I have a low undergrad GPA due to mental health issues that were undiagnosed at the time and being more focused on trying to getting an internship or a job to support my family when we were going through a rough time financially.

I'm now financially capable of pursuing my masters but am worried about the GPA requirements. Is there anything I can do to increase my chances or is just not possible?

s0ejj5,2,2022-01-10,Feel Like There's Nothing More To Live For,somethrowawayy12,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/s0ejj5/feel_like_theres_nothing_more_to_live_for/,"Hi to anyone reading this. Just as a warning, this does mention abuse and bullying.

I've had depression since I was 7 years old and it never really went away. I've been bullied for as long as I can remember and it generally ended at the end of high school. Since I was 7, I've been physically and emotionally bullied by peers and my own ""friends"" from people attempting to blackmail me to people starting false sex scandals about me from when I was 8 (yes, sex scandals at 8. My school was not great).  I've also been abused by a teacher (who everyone loved) from 11 to 13, which caused me to almost end it all but thankfully I was able to transfer schools.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried going to therapists and psychologists when I was 16 but my situation at home (closeted queer person) with my ultra religious, homophobic family who believed mental health was caused by the devil and not ""praying enough"", made life difficult. I tried everything to get help and even told my family that I was suicidal and needed to medication. After saying that, my parents cried while my sibling just said, ""you're too much of a coward to do it anyways"". And that fucked me up for a while. Life just got more and more bleak and eventually I started planning on how I would commit suicide but my psychologist discovered that through a session and tried helping me by getting me hospitalized. Nothing really came out of that experience, except for feeling how guilty I felt making my mom come out of work early for this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since high school, I've lost all my ""friends"" (they were toxic but the only people i really had to socialize with) and only really have my dog. It's been 5 years since high school and I've done nothing but change majors in my college 3 times and have 1 tech internship where I was harassed for my gender. Every time I feel like life gets better, it goes back 3 steps. Seriously, I've even tried to put myself out there and attend a ""fun"" group tech competition in a different city, which ended in them outcasting me and me getting into car accident when I was coming back from the competition (bad luck, I know). I've come to a point where I just enjoy being happy because I know it never lasts and I'm just going to go back to this dark place I've always been in because that's what always happens.

&amp;#x200B;

Especially with this pandemic, I've had to move back with my parents (been 2 years now) and haven't physically left the house (need a car to get outside) for a WHILE except on grocery runs. I'm too financially strained and frankly, not emotionally/mentally well to go back there on my own. The only really good thing going right now for me is that I get to take care of our family dog (who my parents are just too busy to take care of sadly), which also influences me to not leave this house despite how much my parents and I don't get along. Because of all this, I guess my residual depression and unresolved trauma, and feeling emotionally/physically stuck in my life, it has worsened my depression and led to serious nights where I would almost attempt to not be here, which then led to me crying about being too much of a coward and feeling pathetic for even thinking about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I have nothing going on for me now, socially and financially. Just feel too broken to make big leaps anymore in my life and like I should just not be here. I'm not strong enough for this world and feel so pathetic for that. I don't know why I've had to experience the things I did (though of course, I know I am lucky in many ways) but I just feel like bad things keep following me anywhere I go, especially when I put in the effort to do better. My psychologist promised that life would get better. I can't say it's gotten significantly worse but it's not marginally that better. I really wish I could believe and hope that it would get really better. But that hope, the only thing really keeping me going, is dying and I don't know what to do anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

If you got here, thanks for reading. Really do appreciate it."

I wanted to ask everyone what possible I could pursue because I'm having a bit of a crisis where I can't decide which career path I want to follow. Any advice would be appreciated.

About me: I'm a 25 M and I have a bachelor's and master's of science in computer science along with a certification from the UX/UI design program. 

I've been job searching as a UX/product designer for the past 6 months but have faced nothing but rejection due to lack of experience (people want exp but aren't willing to give exp). I've applied for several internships for a design role but the hiring for that position was paused or I didn't qualify as I was not in school anymore. I'm looking to branch out more into different roles along with applying for designer roles, but having trouble with which role to pursue. I do have experience with coding but I prefer not to do any coding roles due to some personal experiences, I'd rather not put myself through coding again. 

I am also considering switching fields to higher ed (college environment) as I do have couple years of experience with event planning. 

I'm struggling with making a decision about what to do or which role to pursue. Any help will be appreciated."

I’m just looking for general advice as an aspiring computer science major. I’m currently a senior in high school, and I’ll be a freshman in college this fall.

A bit about me: I think I have good fundamentals as I’ve been programming for the last 4 years, mostly for robotics, a bit for a research project, and some independent learning. I was lucky enough to get a SWE internship last summer. I’m not sure if I want to go into industry or research, so I’ll probably use the next 4 years to figure that out.

What are some things you wish you knew as a freshman? Can be related to internship, education, life, whatever, I just want to hear about your experiences."

This is my story, my struggle. What has shaped me to who I am and the struggles I face. I need to talk but have no one in my life for that role. I've tried to organize this as a comprehensive timeline but my mental state is not well. Sorry this is long as this could be the only time I record my life story. 

I'm a 33 year old gay male. As long as I remember, I have had intrusive thoughts about ending my life. I struggled until high school with my sexuality until high school and began to finally accept myself. I ended up sleeping with my best friend(he initiated after we had a few drinks) it destroyed our friendship and he moved away. He would pop back in my life randomly afterwards and then disappear. This really messed with me as I cared deeply for him. 

Throughout high, I worked and lived at a horse rescue as a ranch hand. There I developed a severe drinking problem. Daily, I was drunk and passed out every night. Many times I work up places I had no idea how I got there. After graduation in 2007, I continued to suffer from depression. 

My sister was diagnosed with terminal cancer. I had a hard time coming to terms with this. Me and her were best friends. Did everything together from going to theme parks to having out listening to music. My drinking increased even more and I decided I was to take my own life. I go in my car and planned to drive it down the long road into the trees at the end. During this attempt, I lost control of the car and went through a concrete wall fence. Almost into a family's pool. Lucky that I didn't have greater injuries besides bruising and almost torn achilles tendons. I was placed in the hospital under the Baker Act for a week. 

I decided to stop drinking completely at that time since I had gone though withdrawal while in the hospital. After being out for a while, I was reintroduced to a guy I had casually dated in high school. We hit it off and I left the ranch house and got an apartment together. At this time, my sister's cancer treatments failed and she refused any further treatment.

Her state rapidly stated to decline. I wasn't there during the treatment as I was in this ""blooming"" relationship. It hit me that she was not going to make it and my bf and I moved in to my parents to help. Hospice was called in but the pain was too much for her. She would scream in pain, we would give her morphine and she would pass out, just to have it repeat when it wore off. After several days, I convinced her to go to in house hospice to get an IV for pain. She was reluctant until I offered to stay there with her. She didn't want to die somewhere they wasn't home if she was alone. 

She was there two weeks and deteriorating every day. The first week she was conscious and I was able to speed some quality time her final days. Towards the end of the first week, she needed a catheter and they gave her morphine to make her sleep while they did it. Her breathing determinated with gurgling by that point and she panicked when coming out. At that point, hospice keep her asleep. I continued to stay by her side untile the very last minute. She started what they called the death rattle and we new time was near. My family came up and we were there as she took her final breath. 

After my sister's death, I decided to clean myself up more and go back to school. I went to the local technical school for electronics, even went to Nationals competition. I struggled with depression during these  years. I continued in my relationship that I didn't realize at the time was abusive. Looking back, he was very controlling and I had no friends. Even the national trip I was guilty about. 

Following the technical schooling, I stared community college and then university. All the time trying to better myself. My partner at the time did not like his as started trying to belittle me any chance he got. I found out several time he cheated on me, this led me straight back into deep depression. One night we had drinks for a friends birthday, I don't remember what happened exactly but he had upset me and I stated walking home. 

These intrusive thoughts became bad and I decided I was going to kill myself when I got home at my parents house. I want to my room and pulled out my .22 revolver. As I was loading it, my boyfriend had rushed into the room. He beat me pretty bad fighting to get the gun. I ended with two black eyes and a busted lip. The police were called and I was baker acted again. After several days in the hospital, they ask if I'm up for a few visitors. My boyfriend comes in and then he brings one of the guys he cheated on me with. 

I should have seen the red flags then. After coming home, my parents let me know that the house was being foreclosed on as they never recovered from the economic downturn. I had to find a place to go and I decided to buy the house I have now. Keeping this from my bf until I placed an offer. I closed in 2013 and I moved in with my boyfriend. 

As I was nearing graduating with my BA in Anthropology, I started challenging my relationship. The education and new environment helped shape me to a better person and gave me confidence in myself for the first time. I stared making friends and his control stated to skip. The desire to make gay friends led me to grinder and one of my best friends.

I continued to press for my own voice and freedom. The verbal abuse increased. One of the last nights of out relationship, he had this part he threw when his aunt was down. I'm still very much an introvert and bothered by crowded. He refused to move his car and threaten that I couldn't leave. After many times asking, I started walking down the road and called my best friend for help.  My boyfriend became physical with me, trying to keep me from leaving. Grabbing my arms and pushing me. My friend showed up and I was rescued. My boyfriend threatening us the whole time. 

I come home the next day to my car, all my cloths, and we much as you could carry gone. Several weeks the breakup took several weeks. I was threatened for my life, stalked, and lost over 25 pounds from the ordeal. He was finally gone and I could start healing. 

Over the next year or so, I stated dating casually. Started to find myself. I started an intern at our local government and eventually received a full time job. During this time, the best friend I mentioned, stated becoming close. January 2016, we made it official. 

He is the complete opposite of my part relationship. He is smart, there for me, my equal, and by best friend. Our relationship continued to grow over the next free years and we became engaged. Meanwhile, I was promoted several times at work. I stated a tech group that had over 50 members and even collaborated a reginal conference. My life completely changed and the first time I've been truly happy in my life.

Fast forward a couple years and here comes COVID. The isolation truly has not been good for my mental health. Work stated us working from home early 2020 through June. The isolation took it's toll but we were all hopefully it would be gone by 2021. 

End of April 2021, by brother catches COVID as he's waiting for his age groups to have vaccines released. His wife and two kinds also get it. His condition continues to get worse and they place him on a ventilator. For over a month it's ups and downs. His kidneys are failing then they are back. He has several strokes.They start to reduce if ventilator and attempt to wake him. He somewhat responds to should and the next day his body has enough. His lungs collapse and he passes on May 13. Proceed by my uncle the week before from kidney failure. We have back to back funerals.

My fiance had gone to the club the weekend after my brother's funeral. I had a breakdown when he did even when I expressed fear of him going. I had eminence feat and anxiety. He stayed at his mom's that night while I cleared my head. This we traumatic and slipped me deep into depression on top of dealing with my brothers funera.

I return to work after a week off. Covid spreads though the building and several coworkers catch it and pass. 
My mental state begins to spiral at this point. A project manager I worked with for over a year on a construction project dies from a work accident, he was only a few years older then me. I start to develop the most extreme anxiety and depression I've had. I fear leaving the house l, going to the store, and being around people

As 2021 moves on, my dad's health begins to have more issues. He's now on oxygen, has several calcified heart valves, and kidney issues. His time is limited now but trying to make the best. 

My mom's relatively good health until recently. They spotted something in her pancreas that the wanted to scope. Turned out it was just scar tissue. But the procedure caused a tear that was missed. Weeks go by as they keep sending her home. Then she has labored breathing and we find out she had fluid around her lungs. She's hospitalized for two weeks, 4 days in the ICU. They are hopful the surgery corrected everything. I'm hopeful it she has been severely weekend. 

By this point it's now end of December. My days have become this vicious repeating cycle. It takes all my energy to wake up every morning and go to work. The job I loved and inspired those around me has turned into something that I dread. Ever day brings a new struggle.

The stress the last couple years has been detrimental to my relationship. I was so cought up in the depressing, srees from Dr appomt to the the next. From funeral to funeral. I neglected to realize the negative impact it's having on those around me. 

This last week it hit me. Four coworkers in my immediate office are out sick as they were just having fly symptoms. Two test positive and we didn't know the others by this Friday. I'm told I need to quarantine. I text my fiance about what was going on. I'm met with a reply about I need to get tested before going home. I try to explain i was maybe exposed and not showing symptoms, that s test won't show anything at this point. I reached out because I was terrified and needed support. Not what I received

I get home and he has me put on a mask and I do as he asks. He's then says he's going to treat me the same way I did when he went to the club, the one he went to after my brothers funeral. This out me right into flashbacks, depression, shock. This traumatic time was right back. We had worked though this i thought. I completely shut down and lay paralyzed in bed. 

That night comes around and my depression is severe. My finance had left to go to a friend's house to get away. I text him my feelings and why I was upset and just get a response wish we could do that in person and not text. I let him know I need him and he says we will talk in the morning. I cried myself to sleep and he came home around 3. This is not anything hes done before. 

Today, we talk. He tells me that he's unsure about being in a relationship. We have grown apart but he still loves me. That we can try to fix stuff but will always be friends at least. This hit me like a train. I was not expecting this and was blinded by everything happening. 

I feel that there is nothing for me. I struggle to get up and go to work. I'm surrounded by loss of family and my last few remaining relatives have severe health issues. My relationship has eroded to the point of failure. My intrusive thoughts are back as strong as they have been in the past and I don't know if I have the energy anymore to keep fighting them. 

Tldr: I've struggled for years with depression and intrusive thoughts. My teenage years had my sister dying of cancer. My first long term relationship was abusive they really messed me up. Recently, my brother passed from covid and my depression returned multiple times over. My parents have developed severe medical conditions that require my constant help. With all this going on, COVID continues to provide me with crippling anxiety. This has all compiled to my relationship with my fiance unsure if the relationship can continue.

I have no am or ask from this. Just an ear and someone to hear my story."
s0gbts,0,2022-01-10,How should I proceed with my internship,HatAncient1742,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/s0gbts/how_should_i_proceed_with_my_internship/,"First of all, I fucked up.

&amp;#x200B;

The story starts in 3A, where I landed a coop in Huawei. Silly me thought that was a good enough offer and went off with it. I decided to continue to work at Huawei for 3B.

&amp;#x200B;

With my mark and experience, I could land internship miles better than Huawei. As I mentioned, I fucked up, didn't do enough research, and didn't know better. Thankfully, my friends in the same program were extraordinarily kind and helpful. They shared coop resources and knowledge, and some of them even referred me to companies they worked for or currently at. I am incredibly grateful that they did it, and I just want to thank you again if any of them ever read this part.

&amp;#x200B;

It was too late when I noticed how dumb I was. Around the beginning of October, I was informed that every one of my friends got jobs either in Cali or big names or pre-IPO companies. As you may guess, I had the biggest anxiety ever in my life. Most ""good"" jobs have finished recruiting in August / September. I began to throw hundreds of applications to all ideal tech firms I could find and hope to land a job. (I will spare the painful details)

&amp;#x200B;

As expected, no one would like to take me in for winter 2022 so I continue with Huawei, but fortunately, Amazon decided to give me an offer for summer 2022 in Canada. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the catch, I don't know if Amazon is good enough because literary everyone I know landed a job that is better than Amazon. I don't know if I am too greedy or not, but I think I should try on waterloo works again for Cali jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the problem: after Amazon will be my last coop, I no longer have the opportunity to use waterloo works for coop search anymore if I decide to go down the Amazon path. There is no more fun and joy and Cali, and the only thing I can try is maybe getting a new grad job in Cali, but I believe that would be not easy. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other option is to opt-out from Amazon and tries waterlooworks again for a shot at the Cali jobs. This path doesn't look good either, since I first gave up Amazon, which is pretty good on your resume, and I have to risk almost everything for it. But this might be my final shot at the US and my chance to go big. Also, because waterloo works are probably underwhelming in the spring term, I might have to consider applying right now or during fall. I talked to my advisor, and it seems like they are not willing to switch my study/work term around to let me in Waterlooworks. I am still actively talking to them about what I can do to access waterlooworks. (please enlighten me if you have any knowledge in this area)

This is a call for help. I am an intern at a big regional manufacturing company. My company wants to do data analysis on one of the plants. The plant has 44 parameter they are monitoring minute by minute using a software called historian. There 6 grades of products, 2 excellent, 2 good and 2 bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have cleaned and sorted the data according to parameter and grade. Took the mean and standard deviation of each parameter and sorted it by grade, all of this using excel. And indeed, it looks like the excellent grades have higher mean and lower standard deviation for most parameters. How do i proceed from here. I have no clue. I am just a college student and i have no experience with these stuff.

I am considering saying no to the project,honey_mist_auburn,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/s0k7vq/advice_needed_i_am_assigned_a_new_project_at_work/,"I am assigned a new project at work. I am considering saying no to the project.

Background: I have joined this company a year ago. And was immediately assigned a project. I come from experience as opposed to many of my colleagues there who were hired as interns and have 1 to 2 years experience at most. So I was able to catch up quickly with little to no help. My work is dependent on the product our company sells and honestly it's t he e interns/fresher employees that have more knowledge on the product. 

I was added late to my first project and there was someone already working on it. Let's call him X. Now the project required insane amounts of hours to put in. 12 to 14 hours a day as the timelines were very aggressive.Thats whole another story about my workplace. 

Now X starts treating me like his assistant from day 1, would threaten to influence my reports, honestly I did not know if I was working under him or with him but he handled the project like his own. Everything should go by him. Blah blah. And the project manager(PM)  was little to no help. As they both started working in the project way earlier than I did, they had an understanding and the PM completely trusted X. And X is a hardworker on his own. 

There were many situations were he would send me out on wild goose chases to gather information in a company where I was new to. He threatend to influence my report once. Was very bossy. Made me do intern work. This bothered me but I thought somebody had to do it and honestly I can learn the ropes by working end to end.I did not take any action untill this happened: my shift was supposed to end at 9:30 pm, I was working till 12 am and I get a message from him at 12 am asking me to raise a bug with our team. A bug that he has encountered on our project. I was tired and told will be doing it tomorrow. I usually login before office hours he knows it. He presses me to raise and I say something back. Honestly it's been a while and I don't remember what I said. Next day I get a message from the PM reprimanding me for not listening to X. 

I loose my shit then and there, ask him if it is expected of me to do anything that X says anytime he asks me to do it. He does not reply and I am upset by what had happened because I do not like people thinking I do not work hard or that I do not complete my tasks. But I have my limits. I immediately take a sick leave that day. 

I realise I need to get back to work the next day eventually. So i write a mail to my director explaining what had happened and attaching screenshots of our convos. My director immediately calls me calms me down and asks me to adjust for a few months as we are in resource crunch and that X will be reprimanded. 

I do not know what happened after that. It was a little better with occasional brush offs and we successfully concluded the project. This was six months ago and  moved on to others and I couldn't be happier in terms of my team. 

Now I get a mail saying there is a phase 2 of the same  project and that I should help some teams implement phase 2 whole working on my current engagement. The project is still X's . I do not know how much interaction we are going to have as part of it. I am considering saying no to working on X's project. Even if they assure me that there won't be any interaction between us. Because in a way I will be helping X. Only two people know the project. X and I so if I refuse i think it would fall in to him to work. 

I do not know if I can say that I do not won't to work on the project. I do not know how my directors would react. I have never been in this kind of situation. Need your advice. 

Sorry about the long post. Belive me i held back quite a bit. Can ask any questions for more info."

Anyway, im here to ask for advice about this job/internship i had for a month in a news website.

Im 6 months into my journalism course in university(sorry if im saying this wrong, english is not my first tongue) so i went job hunting in my field last month so i can accumulate some experience from the beginning and, for my surprise, i got a ""internship"" in a news website.

The owners were cool people who, from the beginning, explained they didnt have a lot of money to spend since they had just started this project, so they offered a internship with no pay, just some money for transportation.

I accepted it, since it would not only provide me experience, but also contacts, which is one of the most important things a journalist can have specially when just starting.

He said that i would be doing the job this girl was doing for a long time, which was writing their interviews down and then making an article about them, so later it would be posted with the interview video embeded. I also took photos during the interviews for the post headline. 

He said that this first month would be like this but later maybe i could earn a minimum wage working there, if i did a good job (which he said i did all the time during that month).

Anyway, yesterday we completed 1 month since i started so i contacted him about my actual employement and his reaction was really weird.

He acted like he didnt know what i was talking about and then proceeded to tell me this was the end of our ""collaboration"" and that i should now focus on my studies so that maybe in the future we could do something like this again. He also said he found this other person for that job.

This got me thinking, did he just use me for the month between firing the girl end hiring this other guy?

I think its important to note that i told him money is short and i had to stop my studies now at the end of 2021 since i couldnt pay for it, so this was my hope to get things going next year.

Anyway, i think maybe experience and contacts might be more important then being payed right now, so i was thinking if maybe i should contact him about me working for free for now, this way i can keep writing professionally, create a good portifolio of articles, accumulate contacts and maybe be hired when he does have money.

I also should say he was a cool with everything during my experience there, even tho the end of the experience was kind of weird.

What should i do? Let it go or work for free while i dont find something else? I think the majority of people are going to tell me letting go is the way, but try to consider what this experience might give me in the future, when being emplyed elsewhere."

s0l6mj,126,2022-01-10,Forcing kids to do unpaid internships is fucked up,anotherweirdhuman,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/s0l6mj/forcing_kids_to_do_unpaid_internships_is_fucked_up/,"Disclaimer: I know that the majority of people in this sub are from the states, so idk if this issue applies to the USA as well; tho I thought you guys might enjoy my toughts regardless. Also, sorry in advance for any spelling mistakes; english isn't my first language.

.

In the country where I live, it is standard for kids to do at least 1 or 2 week internship during their school time, normally when they are between 14 and 16 years old, and, as far as I know, this is even part of the curriculum (at least it was in my school and I haven't heard from a single person that wasn't forced to do that). Basically, stundets have to find an internship on their own, to the whole application process and later them as well as their employer have to write a report about the students ""work"", what will be graded. There wasn't even a real option to op-out, as if you weren't able to find something/refused to, either the school administration will ""find"" you something or you had to do the internship at the school (aka help the janitor). This sounds bad enough, but the real bummer is that the school didn't even allowed us to be paid; we and our employer literally got a paper, that we had to sign, stating as such. Tho tbf this was my experience at my school, maybe there are schools out there, allowing kids to be paid for their work; tho I haven't heard of one as all my friends who went to different schools had to sign simulair papers. And let's be honest, try to find a company that is willing to pay 15y old for their 2 weeks of work, when they can get away with playing them nothing. Regardless, no one (and especially children) should be forced to work, but I digress.
The common response to complaints like this is generally something along the lines of ""oh, but they can test out the field they're interested in"" (if they were so interested in doing it, you wouldn't need to force them to do that, wouldn't you?), ""they can't get paid, their employer is already 'paying for their training'"" (what kind of training?  In 90% of cases kids just run around the office, handing out coffee(okay, habe not that exactly but they rarely get any sort of training)) or, as in some cases kids are forced to do their internship in a 'social field', ""they will learn to value the social aspects of our society"" (yeah, by forcing them to do unpaid labour, that employers often exploit). Also, when I bring up that they are essentielly unpaid labour, the response is often something along the lines of 'bUt KiDs In AfRiCa ArE aLsO fOrCeD tO wOrK, bUt CaN't Go To ScHoOl', yeah cuz the worse suffering of some kids justifies having other kids suffer too, just less.

.

Anyway, as you can might think already; I have a couple of stories regarding the unpaid internships. While the only internship I was forced to do was rather boring, as I was just sitting around (and having panic attacks), I still got comparatifly lucky.

.

Starting with a good primary school friend of mine, he always wanted to go into film making, thus when we had to find internships for two weeks, he asked the local filmmaking studio and managed to get one for one weeks (this one was rather uneventfull, he basically had to carry stuff around for a week, but he said he still enjoyed it), but as he wasn't able to find something for the second week, the school administration 'suggested' that he asks the drug store near the school, and (due to a lack of option) he agreed. Well, he was basically treated as a replaceable work slave there. Not only was he not paid for basically stocking the shelves for 8h/one week straight, but was also denied breaks (illegal as fuck) and regularry yelled at by managment. He almost cried when he later told me about the week.

.

Another friend of my mine always wanted to do something with medicine (she's even studying it rn), so she did her internship at a kids dental office. Everything was going fine, but one day the anesthesiologist assistent wasn't there, so she has to help. Long story short, the anesthesia of a little girl had major complications, and she nearly died then and there. The anesthesiologist then send my friend to ""get the main doctor, but remember to smile, don't cry and say everything is under controll when you see the parents of the girl (they didn't knew that anything has happend yet)"". 
I know that this isn't the worst story, but it still messed her up for a few days, especially cuz no one offered her any help as 'this stuff just happens'. Pretty fucked up, considering she was only 15; and trained and paid adults in the medical field can have problems processing such stories. 

.

Last but not least, the story of my best friend. At her school, she not only had to do an internship for a few weeks, but for half a year (3 weeks internship, 3 weeks school etc. and they had to change internships after half a year). This means a) she was capable in the field as she not only had more time to gain experience, but also had the relevant subjects in school ('health science', idk the correct english term) but b) still wasn't paid. 
Anyway, her first job was in an eldery care facility (chronically understaffed here, so they were happy for some free labour), and as my post is already long, imma just quickly list the fucked up shit that happend there. 1) forced her to perform tasks she knew how to do, but wasn't legally allowed to, when it came to patient care (either because she was too young or alone and/or the task was only allowed to be performed with at least to people) 2) forced her to stay longer 3) they had a covid outbreak, and not only did an underaged girl had to deal with all the people dying before her eyes, but she also caught Covid herself (this was before vaccines where widely available, but luckily her symptomes where really mild).

Her second job was at a pharmacy, and, as you can imagine, got pretty abused and yelled at by managment and customers, written up for using her phone to perform a task her boss told her to do (she took a picture of a list, instead of caring all the paper around) and bad grades by the pharmacy, what made her final grade drop significantly, because she ""can do better"". Do I have to remind you that she was underage and unpaid? It's fucked up.

.


I personally think that the idea for forcing kids to do unpaid internships (aka giving away their labour for free) is absolutely fucked up and should stop. Not only do companies profit of the free labour, but kids are also taught to give away their labour 'for experience'. 

The another important part to remember is, next to the FACT THAT CHILDREN ARE FORCED TO WORK UNPAID, is that they are due to their age and inexpierience prone to any kind of abuse and harrasment. 

Unfortunatly, I'm kinda the only one who get's so angry about this, most people just shrug when i bring up these points.

.

Anyway, this post had been going on for too long already; I would love to hear your opinions/ideas and I might add a few more paragraphs to this rant, in case they come into my head.   

Remember kids, never work for free and fuck capitalism"

my_qualifications: BCA first year

She appeared for ISC board examinations last year and managed to score decent (&gt;80%), however both her attempts at jee went awfully bad, she would go on to take a drop year to prepare for the same but would drop out of tuitions at a private coaching institute she was attending due to extreme financial situations, which had left her with no hopes of clearing the entrance examinations this year since she was already scoring low at her mocks conducted at the coaching institute.

I don't know how it goes since I myself never prepared for jee, she had been adviced by her peers and an older family aquantaince of ours, who happens to be an engineer himself, to appear for the attempts anyways.

I have observed that throughout her high school days, she had developed quite an affinity for programming and would grind through MOOCs endlessly one after the other, on asking she would tell me that she would rather work full-stack web development than anything.

On her call, I've since looked at various distant learning programs offered by well-established institutes throughout India, most of them are quite affordable as I've been looking for the same, she would be self financing her degree, what are her prospects in terms of jobs, internships and campus placements?

I did a 2 year PLC prior to this course and I'm feeling burnt out, I'm 29 now and had a full-time job for years before deciding to go back to school and I'm desperate to start working full time again for a livable wage.

Would it be a bad move to leave with a level 7 and start applying for junior roles? Am I better off in the long run staying for the level 8 even if I go mad in the process?

I asked about evening part-time options at the college but they don't offer 'Computing with SDev' part-time, they do offer 'Computing with DevOps' or 'Computing with Data Science'.

Cheers for any advice and sorry for the moan!

edit: Also was wondering if level 7 bachelors are enough when applying for visa's overseas or are level 8's preferred?"

I'm kinda stuck between Java and .NET Core technologies, without idea what should I focus. So prior to my second year of studies I focused Java technolgies, I spent holiday learning base java and technologies connected with it (some frameworks like Jackson, Hibernate), when I started semester I signed up for a course regarding web dev in .NET, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework + some minor stuff regarding HTML, CSS, ReactJS. Now I have big dilemma, because I don't know which direction I should go. I have better understanding of core of the Java with some niuances in language characteristic, but I'm able to do more complicated things in .NET technology (creating full stack projects e. g. website or apps using frameworks, creating web APIs etc.). To do same things in Java, I guess I should learn at least spring + some frameworks which I even don't have idea now, but on the other side I have smaller knowledge in let's say ""pure"" C# comparing to my Java knowledge + there are less job offer in my region for .NET dev internship or junior dev.  I want to continue learning one of these technologies and focus only on one to increase efficiency of my learning, but it's really hard choice for me to abandom one of these language for some time. Both are very good for me and make me fun to create something with them. Can you suggest me what's should I choice?"

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

\--Nick

My high school is very small, and thus they gained a lot of advertising booster from my university admission results. Hence, they asked me if I wanted something as a present. I am thinking of asking them to pay for an online certificate program.

With cost out of consideration, is there a certification that I can work on, perhaps during the summer, that can boost my resume to land my first internship next year?"

I recently graduated with a master’s in the Netherlands and I’ve been open in the job market the last few months. I got myself the orientation year visa and I would require sponsorship after one year from now. 

A few highlights about me: I have bachelors and masters in Electronics related discipline, but during masters, I got to pick a lot of electives related to data science. I also did an internship and graduation project at a company in Machine Learning. I tick mostly all the boxes when it comes to skills (python, SQL, R, Git etc.). However I have no actual workex besides my internships. 

I started applying to DS jobs (data scientist, data analyst, data engineer). But I’ve had no luck with any offers yet. I got about 3-4 calls for interviews that went reasonably well in my opinion, but I ended up getting ghosted or rejected with vague reasons. Now I’m back to square one with one interview coming up and a bunch of applications sent. I feel hopeless and find it extremely hard to stay motivated. 

Please offer any advice and practical info on how long it would actually take before I get my first offer. Thanks in advance."

I'm an International student looking at applying to Waterloo for CS. The thing that makes me really want to go to UW is the co-op program here, as the university has lots of ties in Silicon Valley. So I was wondering if International students could actually get internships in the US or eventually work there without holding a Canadian or US citizenship?

Also, how competitive is it to get into UW for CS? I heard it is very competitive. Would I have a good shot with IB 42/45 predicted with 6 for Math AAHL, 7 for CS HL, and 7 for Physics HL?

Any help is appreciated!!! Thanks!

s0qkue,21,2022-01-10,ITI or CS for major,HayHayIsALoser_,rutgers,https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/s0qkue/iti_or_cs_for_major/,"So I'm kinda struggling w/ CS atm, not really because I find it difficult but because of some weird issues with my brain that doctors haven't been able to figure out for nearly a year now.Problem is, it's starting to really fuck with my grades. I failed Calc 2 and got a D in comp arch, so now I'm considering ITI instead because the course load isn't heavy at all in comparison to CS.

I've looked at the courses, as well as a lot of people on reddit in the past asking about ITI, and the general consensus is that it's all fluff and the job outlook isn't great. I feel like I'd hate myself if I did major in ITI and did a minor in CS or something. It seems like a colossal waste of time, but I'm not sure if I should just bite the bullet and do it anyways because I literally cannot work for extended periods of time right now.

A gap semester would be nice, unfortunately it isn't an option for me. 

Any advice? I'm quite unsure what to do. I actually love and enjoy CS for the most part, but I don't want to completely risk failing and tanking my GPA lower than it already is.

Edit: thank you all for chiming in with your experience and situations! It's helped me a ton! I really appreciate all the kind words and ideas people came up with, it really did help a lot.

The TL;DR for most people that stumble across this, the general consensus is just know what/where you wanna go, get experience and work on your own projects and such and get an internship! Though I do recommend if you're also on the fence to read through all the comments (="

I am a student in a computer science bachelors degree in Spain (grado en ingenieria informatica in spanish) and I'm about to finish my degree. I have been currently accepted in a short internship at NTT DATA and I've already received some other job offers from other companies for a junior dev position in Madrid. So my struggle here is that I've always thought it was necessary to get a Master's Degree to be competitive in today's job market so after these job offers I am wondering if it's even worth to get a Master in CS (Master en ingenieria informatica) anymore. Of course I get it that with a Masters you get paid more but maybe it is somewhat equal to the raise and experience you get from working the 2 years instead of doing the masters?
Also, I know there are probably culturistic differences  between EU countries (i.e. in France it is almost mandatory to get a Masters to become an Engineer) so opinions of ppl working in Spain are of course more valuable, but still I'll appreciate everyone's answer :)"

s0tetf,3,2022-01-10,Seeking Advice for Tackling Burnout,Weak_Grapefruit_1799,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/s0tetf/seeking_advice_for_tackling_burnout/,"Hey everyone, I’m a CS student (junior) that’s been working a full-time software engineering internship/co-op for the past several months now and I’m beginning to lose both interest in the work I’m doing for my company as well as writing software as a whole. 
 
When I first attended college, I was majoring in a different STEM field and ended up switching over to CS after landing myself a freshman research position that required some entry-level scripting and falling in love with it. Since then, I’ve gone on to work 3 additional internships (2 of which were research-based and for my university while the other is the position I’m currently working) in addition to publishing a research paper regarding deep learning and CNNs. I pushed myself to get as many internships as possible for two major reasons:
1. I wanted to maximize my chances with FAANG companies post-graduation
2. I’m extremely passionate about the field 

…or at least I was. 
 
It feels like such a short time ago that I would spend significant chunks of my free time studying Udemy courses about topics that interested me (databases, modern web frameworks, machine learning, compiler design, etc.) as well as working on personal projects and seeking out more esteemed/higher paying positions than what I currently have. Recently, I’ve had virtually no inclination to do any of these things and my productivity at work has dropped relatively significantly. Hours will go by in which I’m basically just staring at code then checking social media and repeating. 
 
I know that I was probably asking for it given how much time I was devoting to both building and learning about software, which is why I’ve tried to restrict all software-related endeavors to working hours. This doesn’t seemed to have helped much, however. I’m struggling to differentiate between a raw lack of interest in my particular tasks at work as of late (I’ve been assigned a pile of monotonous intern-y type work that I have very little interest in) and a loss of passion/motivation for the field as a whole. 
 
Aside from a little need to vent, I guess I’m just looking for advice from individuals with a bit more experience regarding this matter. Are these feelings normal? What did you do to overcome them? 
 
Thanks!"

I have applied to over 200 companies in the past few months for SWE intern positions. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong, I just don’t get interview calls!

Either they ghost me at the OA or reject the resume straight away. After getting rejected from Meta and Amazon in the last rounds, I feel too demotivated as I don’t see any interview calls in the future. What should I do now ? Mail recruiters? Change my resume ? Is it because of being an international student ? Is it because I have work experience of 2 years ?

Do companies hire in the spring semester or is there no hope for me now ?

TL;DR : international CS grad not getting interview calls inspite of having a decent profile."
s0v0rt,7,2022-01-10,About to complete a PhD in Biomedical Engineering but trying to pivot into Bioinformatics,spilledbeansinmylap,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/s0v0rt/about_to_complete_a_phd_in_biomedical_engineering/,"First off, I have searched for other threads for people in similar situations with little luck. I hope that I can get some insight, guidance, and advice by making this post.

I am currently a 5th year PhD student in biomedical engineering, scheduled to complete my degree this summer. A few months ago I came to the conclusion that wet lab work is not for me, and I would much rather be on the analysis end of things-- which led me to bioinformatics.

I have taken introductory coding courses in undergrad (Python, MATLAB, Java) but overall I am lacking much of the computational skills required for bioinformatics. I have been trying to brush up on my coding skills (primarily R and python) and doing practice analyses on Rosalind and other websites. Also, I was lucky to have the opportunity to part-time intern with a bioinformatics team at a company my family member has ties to, but they have mostly been showing me how to run pipelines on their software rather than directly coding. I have spoken to them about this and will change soon hopefully.

I will likely start applying to companies in early summer and I can't help but feel that I am running out of time and not making enough progress to replace a proper bioinfo degree. I am under immense pressure to finish out my PhD strong while simultaneously self-studying an entirely new discipline and completing my internship.

Before applying to jobs I hope to have completed RNAseq, WGS, and GWAS analyses and share my workflows and skillsets on a github profile. Also on my to-do is networking with bioinformaticians on Linkedin to start getting my foot in the door at some companies.

Am I on the right track? Has anyone here been in a similar situation? Advice is greatly appreciated. Feel free to DM me too.

s0v7k8,39,2022-01-10,I've fallen so low since I started at Temple. I'm disappointed and a failure,AppropriateDisplay67,Temple,https://www.reddit.com/r/Temple/comments/s0v7k8/ive_fallen_so_low_since_i_started_at_temple_im/,"I remember as a freshman coming to Temple, being happy and excited with the future. 23 now, but 18 at that time in 2017. I had hope for the future and thought depression would be a thing I experienced in the past. I thought things would just getting better and things would be great.

How wrong I was.

I've always struggled with mental health, but 2016-2018 was when it wasn't too bad and I was getting back on the ball. My freshman year at Temple was mostly really good.

At the very beginning, I met a woman who I lost my virginity to in a one-night stand, and I was very upset that she didn't like me back. She dropped out because she didn't feel safe at school. I moved on, still sad of course, but I enjoyed my freshman year and thought it was better than high school.

And then things got worse.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/asistf/crush\_hates\_me\_and\_thinks\_i\_am\_a\_creep/](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/asistf/crush_hates_me_and_thinks_i_am_a_creep/)

After all that, I switched to a semester of public health classes, and was getting back on the grind. I passed all them that semester, liked a hard class, and was feeling better. In the summer of 2019, I got an unpaid internship that was meh, and a shitty on the street sales job. But I was doing stuff in the city and closer to living a life I wanted that I moved to Philly for. Not there yet, but doing better.

Then after the 4th of July, my grandma died. I was depressed again, failed a class, got an incomplete on another. My classmates were complaining to me to professors, and I was having an existential crisis. I had lost interest in my classes and I was afraid Public Health wasn't going to pay well.

I started going to therapy, and then stopped for a while when the Pandemic hit because I didn't want to waste my parent's money because they were paying for an apartment I wasn't in because I moved back home. From the summer of 2020 to the beginning of 2021, I was an Amazon driver, so you can imagine how I felt. I took off in 2020, and went part time in 2021, before not registering for the last and this semester because of my mental health issues and then covid. I wanted to self-improve, get a new therapist but I still feel stuck and behind my peers.

I feel like such a loser and a failure wasting my youth and parents money. I thought college would be a place where I could mold myself into the man I wanted to be: a cool outgoing guy with a girlfriend with a good friend group, doing school clubs and being proactive in life. Now I'm a loser redditor busser in my home town, living with my parents, falling out of touch with acquittances, friends, lost and confused.  This is my hell

I can't catch a break.

What the hell happened?"

s0vut4,1,2022-01-10,How do I deal with my family not wanting my bf?,cellynew,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/s0vut4/how_do_i_deal_with_my_family_not_wanting_my_bf/,"Almost six months ago I (18F) got together with my boyfriend (19M) who I had known for three years. My family (mother and grandmother) don't like him at all. Worst thing is, I haven't even told them we're dating. I still live with them and I'm currently studying for some super important exams, while my bf is studying at a local university. I therefore do not have time to actually be in a relationship (I can only go out once or twice a month, though we text and talk on the phone everyday). My bf and I are ok with this, because we discussed it during summer and agreed that it's worth it to wait until I pass my exams. 

The thing is, my mother won't let me see him, even as a friend. She will only let me go out with him like once a month and if she hears me speaking to him on the phone she will yell at me. Her reasoning is that he is too inferior for me, plus he may have undiagnosed depression, which she thinks makes him a threat to my safety for some reason. Last week I had two huge fights (one with my mom and one with my grandma) because I told them that I will be with him once my exams are over and that they can't control my life forever. 

This situation is starting to take a toll on my relationship. My bf and I can't have a proper phone call without these issues kicking in. He's frustrated, because he knows that he could see me more (my mother says that I can go out more, just not with him) and he says he doesn't think we'll be able to be in a normal relationship even after my exams are over. We considered breaking up but neither of us wants that, so we just agreed to wait and see. My exams are in June, so there's only a few months left.

I have two major problems. The first one is that even after my exams, I'll still be depending on my mother and grandmother financially. I don't have a license yet, I don't have any money and I probably won't be able to spend time with my bf this summer (he will be doing an internship). 

The other problem is that it seems I have to come to terms with my family not wanting my bf. And I don't mean that they just don't like him, my mother *despises* him (she used to be very fond of him last year but as soon as the possible depression thing kicked in, she did a 180). My mother and I are very close so it hurts me that she doesn't support my choices. How do I deal with that?

Thanks for making it this far, I appreciate it. Any advice is welcome!"

White girl from NC, LGBTQ+, hearing-impaired, no financial aid, (hot) woman in STEM

Attending a T5/T10 (kinda on a cusp but either way, very selective) boarding school w/ really good matriculation

Also, I could possibly (we'll have to see) be a recruited athlete for track and field DIII schools (i have a bit of a niche ability in hurdles), so that might boost my chances at DIII schools? not sure

Also, my dad is a legacy at Dartmouth so i think i'd have a decent chance there? idk

Intended Major: computer science!!! (i also hope to minor in linguistics for the schools that im applying to that have that)

Stats:

35 ACT ( :'( took it sophomore year but never got around to taking it again)

school is weird but i have the equivalent of a 4.0 UW GPA

school still weird but i also have consistently taken the hardest classes available

school super weird does not have ""official"" AP classes, but i've taken the following AP exams:

AP CS A (10th grade) - 5; AP BC Calc (10th grade) - 5

AP Chem (11th grade) - 5; AP Stats (11th grade) - 5

AP Spanish Lang (11th grade) - 4 (i struggle to hear, and the college board accommodations did NOT help. listening section kicked my ass)

AP English Lit  (11th grade) - 4

I am also currently taking a class that leads to both Physics Cs. 

I have taken a bunch of advanced compsci electives, and engineering electives. I am also pretty advanced in math, and I took calc III last year, and I'm taking my school's max math beyond that (which is just a seminar). I am also maxed out on language.

I also submitted my work from my advanced compsci electives (like the lil robots that i made aha) to the schools that had portfolios for that

I am also top 5% of my class even tho my school doesn't do class rank, so i am cum laude.

ECs (non-leadership/non-award stuff):

\- Internship in AI and ML at a company lab. and not just a faux-internship, I studied abt ML approaches in the spring b4 and then worked there in the summer. so this is legit broo

\- Research intern in speech processing at a good local university (using what I learned from the previous internship)

\- Varsity track and field (9th, 10th, 11th, hasn't happened this year yet); set 300m hurdles record at school

\- JV Soccer (9th-12th): just for fun... i luv soccer

\- Teen consultant for accessible &amp; comprehensible birth control information

\- Coding club member (since 10th grade)

\- Orchestra (since 5th grade): not a good violinist (im at the back of the 2nd violins LMAO) but i like it a lot

\- Summer Camp Volunteer (summer after 10th grade): literally was only a week but i volunteered and took care of the CUTEST kids omg. they were sweethearts

\- Some volunteer hours tutoring and working at a local food bank; haven't been able to work there as much as I would have liked due to being a boarding student tho

Leadership:

\- Track and field captain (got position in 12th)

\- GAINS (Girls Advancing in STEM) Club Head (participated in from 9th-11th, got position in 12th)

\- Math and Science Peer Tutoring Head (participated in from 10th-11th, got position in 12th)

\- Missionary Society Officer (basically just community service stuff, but selective position)

\- Dorm prefect

\- Organizer at a (real, NOT bogus insta acc lmao) non-profit that sends gifts/cards to terminally ill children (from 11th-12th grade)

Awards:

ACSL Senior Division National Finalist

USACO Silver (i only learned abt it recently so i'm not v good LOL)

Congressional App Challenge District Winner

National Merit Commended Scholar (literally was so close to being a semifinalist but whatevs)

National AP Scholar w/ Distinction

I am kinda lacking in national awards unfortunately, BUT i do have a bunch of school ones:

School award for Spanish, school award for advanced math/science courses, school award for combination of athleticism/academia-nut-ism/citizenship or whatevs. Cum laude too if u want to include that in here as well. 

OH and Girls Track Award lolz

LORs:

Counselor: 10/10. The college counselors know what they are doing, so they write the best one possible for obvious reasons with all interests and stuff in mind.

Spanish teacher: probs a 7/10. i started out v quiet in her class bc it was hard for me to keep up in discussions due to my hearing, but i got much better as the year went on, and i did very well in her class. i am in her class again this year too, so lots of continuity.

Math teacher: probs aaaaa idk. 6/10 maybe? she's kind of a wild card, but i sincerely doubt she would be rude in her LOR. hopefully she liked me enough lol!

Essays:

My big essay was about my connection and interest in language (hence wanting to minor in linguistics), even as someone who is hearing-impaired. Connects to my struggle with Spanish classes at the start, my progress, and how my interest developed and led to my internship in speech processing (where my interests in comp sci and linguistics intersect). Good old-fashioned success story.

Terms of Sale:

Refund Policy: No refunds will be issued under any circumstances once a code has been sent unless the code does not work as advertised. Buyer mistake(s) do not constitute grounds for a refund. This includes, but is not limited to, already owning the title, purchasing a code for the wrong platform, and not adhering to notes associated with a code (i.e. do NOT click iTunes).

Code Redemption: You may not use any code on any site other than those associated with your purchase. Doing so will result in me requesting that you pay the listed price for the second use of the code, and refusal to do so will result in a report to the mods of this subreddit. Any points or other bonuses associated with a code are not included with your purchase unless specified in the post.

""Should Port/Upgrade To 4K"" Codes: I make no guarantees regarding 4K ports/upgrades. If a code that should port/upgrade to 4K does not do so, I will direct you to the relevant support team. I can, in most cases, provide any photo(s) of the code insert and/or Blu-ray upon request if needed for a support team. I will only provide a refund if I cannot produce them upon request when needed for a support team.

Payment/Fees: I accept only USD through Venmo and PayPal Friends &amp; Family (F&amp;F), preferred in that order. I do not cover any fee(s) associated with any purchase(s). When paying through PayPal, do not pay with Goods &amp; Services (G&amp;S) or with funds not from your PayPal wallet/linked bank account (i.e. credit/debit/pre-paid card, etc.). Doing so may result in a fee from PayPal. I do not accept eChecks, as they usually take 3-5 business days to clear and may have fees associated with them. I will refund any payments that do not adhere to this rule in the fullest amount without costing myself money.

Contact: If there is more than a half hour between our newest message and the one before it, don't expect a quick response. I respond to messages as soon as I am aware of them.

Dual Redeems/Splits: I can check any code upon request and provide a for-sure answer as to whether or not it is a dual redeem. Otherwise, assume all codes are dual redeems/splits."
s0wjcv,1,2022-01-10,"Reneging on an internship offer verbally accepted, unsigned - bad idea?",Alternative_Range111,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/s0wjcv/reneging_on_an_internship_offer_verbally_accepted/," I've been put in an extremely difficult position. I accepted an internship offer because I thought it was the best one I would get. I haven't signed a contract yet, nor have I been sent one by HR. I never even thought I'd get a response from this other company. Although I knew I'd already accepted an offer, I agreed to interview with the second company because to work with them is a bit of a childhood dream come true. The specific job profile also aligns much better with my future plans, and now I have an offer from them.

Is it common to blackball/remember a candidate from previous years, and to immediately remove them from consideration for graduate jobs because an intern reneged on an offer? (I'm in the UK, if that makes a difference). I of course know blackballing/remembering names is a thing for grad jobs, but do interns get a bit of benefit of doubt, or are we expected to be able to commit the same way as those entering full-time jobs?"

For other companies, do they test heavily on algorithm design? Or is it mainly just C programming, Linux questions, OS/concurrency, and tech-platform specific questions (ie, IP Networking, Memory Management, security…). Should I study algorithms heavily when searching for new jobs? I’m currently in my first job and a bit new to this process. Thanks!"
s0xmud,4,2022-01-10,Should I email recruiter?,PetsLink,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/s0xmud/should_i_email_recruiter/,"I recently completed an internship at a FAANG company in the Fall and I would really like to return to another internship next summer. They said they would get back to me regarding that decision, however I have yet to hear back. Since then, I have reached the final interviews at one other FAANG and one non-FAANG company. Obviously, no offer is guaranteed by either of them but if they do I would likely accept it, if I still haven’t heard back from the original one. Should I email the recruiter at the original company and let them know I have reached the late-stages of other interview processes at those companies and ask about the timeline of their decision?"

As of now, I have no FAANG offers or interviews (sent out apps in the last couple of months, mostly not rejected yet at this point so TBD). I've done Blind 75 and am constantly preparing more and more. At this point, is the best bet to do 1-2 years at some journeyman corporate dev job, keep Leetcode skills fresh, and then bounce? I only have one internship and it's not very prestigious. I also have a 3.9 GPA from a top 30 CS school (large R1 state university).

s0ym87,7,2022-01-10,Would it make sense to delay my graduation one semester in order to pursue additional internship/research opportunities?,LettersOnYourScreen,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/s0ym87/would_it_make_sense_to_delay_my_graduation_one/,"I’m currently a Junior expected to graduate in May 2023, so I have Spring 2022, Fall 2022, and Spring 2023 left to do. I currently have two internships; one IT internship last summer that didn’t involve any coding, and one Software Engineering internship lined up for next summer at a bank. 

I’m considering the prospect of not doing classes for Fall 2022. Instead, I’d want to do either a Fall internship or pursue some research opportunities at school if I’m unable to find one. This would delay my graduation one semester. I’d graduate after Fall 2023, which would mean that I would have Summer 2023 free to do one more summer internship before I graduate. 

I’m interested in doing this because doing two more internships/ one internship plus a semester as a research assistant would be a much stronger resume for me. It would give me one more opportunity to land a FAANG internship before I graduate. It would make sure I graduate with no debt and I’m a little burnt out taking college classes for 5 semesters. Working as an intern last summer was far less stressful. 

Would it be worth it to apply for Fall/Spring internships? Are they any different than summer internships? Is graduating in the Winter different than graduating in the Spring in terms of landing a job?"

It consists of two 1 hour interviews via Amazon chime and seems to focus mainly on behavioural / leadership principles and DS&amp;A / leetcode.

From reading online the leadership principles seem to be a very important aspect, however I don't really have any prior experience in the industry to draw from. Wondering if anyone here has any experience with this process ? Any advice or tips are greatly appreciated. Thanks."

Just graduated with my CS degree this past fall from the University of New Mexico, good GPA with honors. I applied to a single local job as the semester was finishing that I heard about from faculty. Two interviews and a month later I've received an offer letter. 

The company is a biotech startup with a team size of less than 15, most of their funding seems to be coming from government grants and some investors. They offered me a position as a software engineer developing ML models with python and some hardware stuff in C/C++. The job itself is considered a on-the-job training-style internship and partially funded by the state, with a training period of \~4 months. Originally, they offered \~50k/year and I negotiated up to \~55k. However, they said once the training period is done, my salary would increase to the level of the other engineers which is about \~60k. Additionally, they marketed that they're hoping to expand over the year and would likely see a pay increase with that as well. 

I didn't expect to get a job offer this soon to be honest, and haven't applied anywhere else. The offer seems a bit lower than the local average and am hesitant to take it as a result. However, the position  does seem to offer a lot of experimental autonomy in comparison to other entry-level positions from what I've seen, in the sense the company heads are very hands off, don't micromanage and the work itself is very scientific-research focused. Additionally, they have pretty good benefits and I can work my own hours and work from home. These extra amenities are what's making it difficulty to completely say no to the position. I'm slightly fearful that I apply to some other jobs and won't experience the same comfort beyond salary.

If you were in my shoes, would you take the position?"

I’m just looking for general advice as an aspiring computer science major. I’m currently a senior in high school, and I’ll be a freshman in college this fall.

A bit about me: I think I have good fundamentals as I’ve been programming for the last 4 years, mostly for robotics, a bit for a research project, and some independent learning. I was lucky enough to get a SWE internship last summer. I’m not sure if I want to go into industry or research, so I’ll probably use the next 4 years to figure that out.

What are some things you wish you knew as a freshman? Can be related to internship, education, life, whatever, I just want to hear about your experiences."

s151au,8,2022-01-11,Is it worth applying for a PhD?,greenteafr0g,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/s151au/is_it_worth_applying_for_a_phd/,"It’s been my dream since starting college to get my PhD. However, I did very poorly in undergrad, my overall GPA ended up being a 2.5. I worked full time, went to school full time, and lived in a very toxic environment with my parents. I only stayed there because I felt too guilty to leave my younger sisters alone in that type of environment. I never got to do any internships or research because I would be working multiple jobs during the summers to make ends meet. I also had an extremely bad car accident my senior year causing me to do worse. I don’t really even remember much about my last year at college because of concussion fog. 

I’m currently in a Masters program with a 3.95 GPA. I conducted research last summer and will hopefully have that paper published soon. I’ll be continuing this research this upcoming summer for my capstone project. 

It would be a dream come true to be accepted into a PhD program. However, I know it’s very competitive and I would be going against people who have accomplished what I have and more, plus doing well in their undergrad. 

I guess my question is, is it worth it for me to even try applying considering my past? Thank you for reading."

Q1) 

After 2 months of interviewing, I received an internship offer from a company, its a big one 50k+ employees so should have no excuses on this.

They sent an email with pay and telling me I have passed all the interviews and that they are offering me an internship on 23rd December 2021 and to fill out a form + passport picture. I accepted on 27th.  They sent an email same day saying they will get back to me after the holidays to go through the next steps.

Between then I have been speaking with an engineer in the department to talk about my projects over the internship and they respond same day.


HR still has not sent me a contract to sign and its 11th Jan now. 

What do I do? Do I send them an email saying "" i look forward to the next steps?"" How do i handle this professionally? 

I need to settle this ASAP as I accepted another offer before this one and I want to confirm this new internship through a signed offer before telling the older one I have found other opportunities and can't come.


Q2)

I just read a post over on the US version of this sub where someone had their internship rescinded a week before they started and I personally know people that had their internships rescinded due to the first COVID outbreak.

I don't want this to happen to me - would it be wise to  keep both offers and reject one a couple weeks before I start - I know this sounds awful and greedy but I need to protect myself from something like this happening as I NEED to do an internship to graduate otherwise I don't get my degree."

That being said here is where I stand with my skills

Languages: I am familiar with C, C#, Python, HTML/CSS, JS, SQL, PHP. Currently with my courses I am learning C++ and Java atm. In the future I plan on improving my JS knowledge and branch into learning JS frameworks like react, angular, node, etc.

Data Structures: as of today I am familiar with just the basic ones like linked list, stacks, queue/Priority Queue, Hash maps and hash sets.

Algorithms: DFS, BFS, A\*.

I still plan on continuing to apply but I am not optimistic I will get a job so in case I do not I want to spend the summer after this semester to improve myself as a programmer. Idm diving into backend, frontend or fullstack but im torn on what I should be learning by the time summer comes around. Any guidance is appreciated."

Sometimes I skip over whole steps. I often have to reread a sentence over and over before I can actually “pour 150 ml of X into a 50 ml flask”. It’s simple things like that. A lot of the times I mess up and have to start over. 

If it wasn’t for us always having to have a partner, I’m sure I’d be last out of lab every time. 

Maybe it’s because I’m a visual learner? Do I have some type of impairment? 

I’ve accepted that I’m the type that gets far due to working hard and not because of intelligence. But I feel like I’ve been fast at far harder things than this. 

I’m going to start applying to research internships soon, and it’s worrying me with how effective I’ll be in a lab setting. Can anyone relate and how did you deal with your inabilities?"
s16ief,4,2022-01-11,I'd like your opinion on which beginner course to take for cybersecurity,Macrocosmic_Explorer,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/s16ief/id_like_your_opinion_on_which_beginner_course_to/,"Hello everyone,

   My goal is to begin working in the cybersecurity field, even if it is extremely entry level work as an Intern or low wage job, in approximately one year's time. Within 2 years, I would like to have the ability to work mostly or completely remotely so that I can pursue my dream and move off-grid or back to a very rural area. Money isn't a problem at first because I currently have a very stable job that pays significantly well, and it offers me A LOT of time to pursue other education, I work 3-4 days on and have 3-4 days off each week, and I am mostly just on call and directing others from home. This affords me the opportunity to perform low-income work to learn cybersecurity at first. The only rush is that I am extremely sick of living in the city where my job is located. In case it's important, I work in the semiconductor industry, and I am also pursuing a degree in electrical engineering (3 classes per term).

**My current pathway I would like to take (I know all of this will take YEARS):**

Programming Education (programming concepts/scripting/object orientation basics) (In Order):

1. Python
2. SQL
3. C Language
4. C++
5. JavaScript
6. Assembly

&amp;#x200B;

Certification Education (In Order):

1. Introductory Course **(this is what this post is regarding and what I need help deciding the most)**
2. [CompTIA A+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/a)
3. [CompTIA Network+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/network)
4. [CompTIA Security+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security)
5. [CompTIA Linux+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/linux)
6. Some sort of cloud certification like AWS.
7. [CISA](https://www.isaca.org/credentialing/cisa)
8. [CISSP](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP) 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem I am having is deciding which course to take for the first introductory course into cybersecurity so that I can get the fundamentals down and begin pursuing #2, #3, or #4 certifications.

&amp;#x200B;

The main introductory courses I am considering are:

1. [IBM Cybersecurity Analyst Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-cybersecurity-analyst)
2. [Introduction to Cybersecurity Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/intro-cyber-security?ranMID=40328&amp;ranEAID=gsKJn8GIv3Q&amp;ranSiteID=gsKJn8GIv3Q-wBO8PSmXNX0cVHDZ5UWEMQ&amp;siteID=gsKJn8GIv3Q-wBO8PSmXNX0cVHDZ5UWEMQ&amp;utm_content=10&amp;utm_medium=partners&amp;utm_source=linkshare&amp;utm_campaign=gsKJn8GIv3Q) (NYU)
3. [Professional Certificate in Essentials of Cybersecurity](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/uwashingtonx-essentials-cybersecurity?source=aw&amp;awc=6798_1641705744_79ec2bd4458368ecaf24a1619ddb0697&amp;utm_source=aw&amp;utm_medium=affiliate_partner&amp;utm_content=text-link&amp;utm_term=646197_CodeSpaces) (UoW)
4.

Does anyone have any experience with any of these courses? Based on what you see, what do you think would be best? I am a lead engineer in the semiconductor industry, but I don't have a lot of software related experience. I do have a lot of experience installing hardware though. Things such as machine controllers, hard drives, building PC's, routing cables, setting IP's, etc. but nothing super in depth, and most of the work we perform has an extremely in-depth procedure.

I understand that there are a lot of you that are trained by just constantly doing research using free resources throughout the internet over years of time, but my brain has a tough time with that when I'm starting out on something new, especially something as in depth as infosec. I really like nicely laid out programs and I am willing to foot the cost if it is solid. 

I really appreciate your help!

Edit:

I've heard some people say that A+ is the way to go in regards to introductory coursework. They recommended having some basic knowledge of PC components, which I definitely do. So maybe I should just start with an A+ course and get that cert instead of doing an introductory course separately?"

I took a help desk role right after college in order to pay the bills and to be in the field of Information Technology. I graduated with a degree in IT and a concentration in HCI/UX. The degree focused a lot on full stack development more than anything. I did an amazing DBA internship in my last semester so that I could have some experience as well.  
Anyways, when I graduated I took a job as a help desk analyst so that I could pay the bills and now its taken so much passion out of me. The company has massive turnover and some higher ups make fun of the people that we are supposed to be supporting. It just seams like everyone hates their job here. I work night shifts because I wanted to be a ""team player"" but its a thankless job so my work feels worthless.

 I want to take my next step into getting a software developer job but I just don't feel like I meet the criteria at all. So I've sort of been looking into job hopping into QA for the time being so that I can get paid more and at the very least, look at and test code. I've gotten my resume reviewed by a few people who are in hiring roles and they all like my resume but I just haven't heard anything back from any applications I've submitted. I've submitted around 30 applications and I've gotten back a few rejections so far in the month I've been applying.   
Is the job search just a grueling and extensive process for someone with little experience? Do I just have to push through and keep my head up? I need this job to help provide but its killing all of my passion and motivation. My off days are spent trying to prepare myself mentally for the next work day so its hard to work on projects in my spare time.   
I would love any and all feedback on how to handle this job I currently hold while looking to branch out to something I can be more passionate about."

Hello everyone! I’m a 35yr old UK resident, studying for an MSc in computer science. I’m in my second year (part time study whilst i work full time as a lecturer and take care of my family) 

I’m see a lot of information on US positions/salaries/internships etc but not much on the UK side. 

I’m in the process of putting a cv together and applying for junior positions and internships. I know fundamentals in python and java and have scored well in my MSc so far (Distinction) which I’m super proud of given i had no prior knowledge before starting my course a year ago.

What can I do to prep for potential interviews? I see a lot of people say “grind leet code” Which actually seems fun to me but is that relevant for a UK position or is it only really policy for big US tech firms?

I’m hoping to switch careers but that means giving up my 30k job for an initial potential pay cut so I want to make sure I’m always improving my skills and that I get this right. I need to keeps roof over my family’s head in these expensive times.

Any advice, info or guidance on UK specific tips to get into this industry would be greatly appreciated. (I don’t have any industry experience but i’m looking to secure internships or junior roles in either SE or DS roles atm as thats where i have scored best so far)

TIA"

Now throw in the volatility of the crypto markets combined with a pandemic then you got something unlike any experience I've had before. It all started in 2015 when I started dollar cost averaging into Bitcoin. Towards the end of 2016 I experienced my first ever bull run in crypto. I made A LOT of money but as most entrepreneurs know and my first lesson in this post **it's not about making money, it's about keeping it.**

I pulled some profits and invested in real estate. The property was located in Playa Del Carmen in Mexico and was a hotel with 16 units. I was excited about this. Then the market turned and I found myself needing a job since I poured everything I had into this property and the market at its peek. I ended up applying to a social media position since I was working with influencers and thought it would be easy.

I applied to over 1,000 jobs and only 1 gave me a call back (which was very surprising because my resume was polished and my experience spoke for itself). I went to the interview and turns out years later the person who interviewed me and gave me the job ended up becoming my current business partner. In the next month I ended up learning so much about the agency world but then something unexpected happened. The digital marketing director who hired me had a falling out with the CEO and parted ways. This was my opportunity to step up.

While everyone in the agency reaction to the Marketing Director leaving was ""that's not my job"" when his responsibilities became an opportunity for someone to take over, I seized the opportunity. This led to the hands down the best learning experience ever and my second favorite lesson in this post; **as an entrepreneur I looked at the work I was doing as if I was a role player but at the same time as the owner and would ask myself, if I owned this company what would I be doing.** This led to 9 raises in 9 months bringing my salary from $45,000 starting to $125,000.

I was working on an eCommerce brand and when I started they were making about 6 million in sales a month when I left we were able to get them to 50 million a month. I only left because the CEO was toxic and my best friend at the time was tired of his job. So we both quit our jobs and started an agency together.

We hit the ground running having a client needed tech services which led us to invoicing $20,000 a month going straight to developers. We had a nice margin on top which went sideways when the client stiffed us on two months of invoices ultimately disappearing. We scrambled, went to Upwork for lead gen but ultimately relied on our personally network. We managed to pull two brands from this a Major League Soccer Team Inter Miami CF and now publicly traded billion dollar company.

I was the operations and person behind marketing. My CEO was all sales and the money. I had no need to be in the bank account and I trusted him. The first red flag I really had was when he started getting our employees that I recruited to our agency jobs at one of our clients. He eventually got everyone in our agency an in house job at the company besides me. His reasoning was that for optics he needed to make it look like he wasn't dependent on the client and I was handling our agency. Turns out this was his way to push me out.

At this time I just got my first payout on my hotel that I invested in 2016, I decided to double down and acquire another hotel twice the size in Tulum, Mexico. Things were great as in January I went to launch the hotel (exactly two years ago today). When I came back my business partner (who was also my roommate) grabbed all my stuff and moved it out of the apartment. I was livid and removing me from my agency was as easy as deleting my email which he had admin control too.

As I get situated figuring out my next move here comes a pandemic ultimately ruining my real estate investment. Following that Bitcoin decides to take off in price. The agency I've been building as well as the team I've been assembling are no longer an option. Turns out my partner at the agency just started a new LLC and when he handled taxes he didn't submit anything on my behalf leading to my third more technical lesson; **Should've submitted a 1032 form IRS which basically says ""hey I own part of this company but my partner hasn't said anything so not sure what to do.""** *This was over a year ago so if I wrote the incorrect form if someone can please correct me.*

At this point, I spoke to lawyers to explore my options and with the pandemic being full force I had to decide if I wanted to spend the next year (due to the court delays from COVID) chasing something that was clearly behind me. I decided to just let it go and focus on what comes next. During the time of my agency as an entrepreneur you never stop working on passion which to me was this project Furlough. At the time we were doing a lot of work with influencers and even coordinating content trips sponsored by brands using our real estate assets to offset cost. This model was changed entirely from the pandemic.

I found myself bored from the pandemic and ultimately connecting with people who wanted internships to really position them to win. One of those aspiring entrepreneurs recommended Discord. It was at that moment the Furlough brand pivoted into a Discord community. From that to my surprise what a culture of winners and an attitude of giving without strings attached for a year can do for a community. Today, we are much more than that.. we're an ecosystem. An ecosystem of digital freelancers, entrepreneurs, startups, students and professionals all in one place with the common goal of all of us winning.

My fourth and final lesson in this post seems to be the culture we're pushing. Being from Miami, FL I've been around some shady people and for some reason people believe in order to win a deal someone else must lose. Unfortunately that could not be further from the truth. The reality is **a winning deal is when both parties walk away believing they both won.**

We live in very exciting times and even though my path to where I am today was filled with volatility and betrayal I can reassure you I would not go back and change a thing because I have never been more excited for what comes next."

Looks like great experience, but the pay/benfits just seems very low for the work.. Like an internship but it's not an internship. I could literally make that same income working at staples.

1. Data Analytics in a research company
2. Software Engineering in a very well known bank in the UK (Involves roles like Product manager , Requirements Engineer)
3. Customer Engineer in Microsoft

The thing is, I don't know what a customer engineer does. I tried googling it, and I saw that it was a more supportive role rather than pure CS. But, it is Microsoft, so I don't know if i should turn down this offer.

As a 2018 college graduate who struggled with figuring out what the hell I wanted to do, and who blamed myself for not being able to get an entry level job for years, I thank you for opening my eyes to the cesspool that is our work/life situation in this country.

I feel like there were better decisions I could have made to set myself up better, but my parents were very adamant I go to college right after high school, even though I was in therapy for a dissociative disorder and had suicidal ideation. I could barely think straight after a few traumatic things had happened in my life, but I thought I could handle it. I thought I needed to pull myself up by my bootstraps.

Fast forward to today and I'm seeing more and more how worthless my degree is. I'm a writer through and through, and a good one at that. I should have gotten an internship while I was in college, but I had instead gotten customer service jobs to help me with costs. At one point I was going to school and working full time, and there was no way for me to take on an internship. All the internships I had looked into were unpaid.

At my last customer service job in the automotive industry last year, I was treated like the crap underneath someone's shoe because I'm a young woman. After COVID took away my one opportunity to work as an editor for a startup company (and after having to divorce my abusive spouse, long story) I quickly realized I was out of options. I had to move back in with my parents or be homeless. Thankfully my culture actually encourages children to live with their parents even years into adulthood. Plus, of course, my parents don't want me anywhere near my abusive ex. 

Anyway, I quit that cursed job back in October of last year to pursue freelance writing and editing. I thought I was crazy, maybe even lazy. But then I realized... I wasn't getting paid fairly at all. Not to give estimates for car damage when I wasn't even trained to learn how to do it from scratch like I was supposed to be. Not for inspecting fixed cars outside in sweltering 100°+ Texas weather while wearing the company mandated thick polo shirt and long pants (the shirts I had to pay for btw). Not for getting screamed at by belligerent men who wanted us to fix damage that wasn't even part of the accident. Not for getting sexually harassed by customers and sometimes coworkers almost weekly.

$15/hour with benefits, and I was supposed to be grateful. That was the highest paying customer service job I'd ever had and they ""treat their employees well."" Then I realized how much other body shops were paying their customer experience reps and saw how much of a scam most of these positions were. How they always wind up assigning extra duties without extra pay. They apparently gutted their workforce during the peak of Covid, but then decided ""Oh! We can save money by forcing one person to do the jobs of 5 different people."" They used to have 10 people work in the front office of this shop... Estimators, office managers, specialists for certain insurance companies. All of that got smashed down to two, sometimes ONE, person working in the entire office. And that's somehow fair. That somehow equates to $15/hour. 

My final straw was when I put in my two weeks. At first a few of my co-workers seemed happy for me. Then everything went to hell. I was sabotaged the first Saturday I worked after my two weeks notice and was left to deliver cars that had a ton of cleaning issues to turn into customers (Saturdays they make you run the shop completely alone so you have to pray that nothing else winds up being wrong with the car when the customer comes to pick up). Someone had hidden a key in a COMPLETELY different building, so it made me look like an idiot in front of one of our meanest customers while I searched for his key. 

The person who did the most sabotaging was a porter who would flirt with me on occasion, but I didn't reciprocate. When I put in my two weeks notice, he came into my office and told me ""It's a good thing you're leaving. No one likes you here. They think you're annoying and a stuck up college kid. I hear them talking shit all the time. But I got your back."" I immediately suspected what his game was and reported everything to HR, especially after the porter's sexual comments started getting more intense after that encounter. He kept coming into my office and staring at me too.

Their response after their ""investigation""? 

""Oh, the porter says he didn't say that. And we couldn't find any evidence of harassment. It has to be an ongoing thing for more than a month for it to classify sooo..."" 

I hung up the phone on them, left before my two weeks was up, and haven't looked back since. I'm now making almost as much as I was at that job doing freelance work, and I'm on the path to continue getting more as I keep it up. Screw the system, and screw anyone who tells you you're a lazy piece of crap for wanting better. I'm a hard worker dammit. I worked my ass off to work almost 50 hours a week at that dead end job (who said it was ✨possible✨ for me to move up to corporate when it wasn't) AND do my freelancing so I could have a cushion to fall back on if things got really really bad. And here I am now, discovering my worth and realizing how much I SHOULD be making. Especially as someone with a 5 star rating on my freelancing profile. 

If you got this far, thanks for reading. I wish the best for all of us. I'm honestly considering moving to Europe, and I continue to do what I can to apply for jobs there. Thankfully I have a lot of family there too."

s1j5vt,1,2022-01-11,Looking for advice..,KadoshKasoah,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/s1j5vt/looking_for_advice/,Hey everyone. I recently graduated from community college with an associates degree in Computer Science. The problem is I'm undocumented (which is why I went to cc). Is it still worth it to go get my Bachelor's? I won't be able to do any internships which will really suck unless DACA suddenly starts accepting new applicants which is unlikely.

I did 2 years cs bachelor in UK, get all As then transfer to US for rest of my undergrad.

However, I am doing another not too closely related degree to SWE. Tried a few eecs classes  aced in all of them.

I did USACO in highschool and got PLATINUM, did around 500 problems on USACO and a Chinese OJ then 400 leetcode and 200 codeforces in college.

I was still having competitive programming for fun, but even before this week my goal is not getting a job in US.

I had a Golang intern in one Chinese Big Name, my plan was to return for full time( in China recruiter does not care your major that much)

It is just that I have a serious relationship with an US permanent resident and I dont see any chance she will go back to China with me.

So right now I am considering finding a job in US. How is my chance as a Non major? what is the recruiters expectation...?"

I recently found out that I'm on academic probation at my university because I did miserably my last semester. I'm a senior in my undergrad program at 22, and yet I feel like a failure compared to those around me. Since Covid my motivation has felt like it's on a downward spiral but today it feels biting because I haven't even properly registered for my classes. I've started taking steps to get back on track and do better in school but I'm afraid I'm just going to end up the same as last semester.   


I gave up my gaming PC last semester so I wouldn't play video games and get distracted from homework, but that only made me more miserable. I'd spend hours at a time just alone with my thoughts tearing me down and the thought of taking action and doing my work just filled me with anxiety and dread that caused me to always put it off to the last second, which caught up with me by the end of the semester. I see people around me workings jobs and doing internships, and I haven't been able to land proper ones for quite a long time, and every time I try and apply I'm once again paralyzed with fear of rejection, despite knowing damn well a shot taken is a shot missed. The one thing going right in my life is my relationship with my partner, who I love to death, but I miss them all the time because we're long distance which can sometimes put me in even more of a funk when I'm not chatting with them online. But I think the biggest thing is my fear, on the path I'm on that I'm going to end up stuck in some dead end job the rest of my life- I want to find happy and fulfilling work for my life that I can enjoy (my field is politics) but I'm afraid I'll never make it now with how much I've tail spun.   


I haven't even been able to motivate to clean my space and motivation for even things i once enjoyed- such as my work I used to do with political organizing, that I felt zeal and passion about- has faded. I was hoping if anyone had advice on how to dig themselves out of this hole, I don't usually post on reddit but I feel like I don't have much elsewhere to go right now. I'm afraid of my family knowing exactly how much shit I'm in and my partner is dealing with the death of a loved one right now and I don't want to bother them with the problem, and all my friends I feel like a burden on.   


I want to become better and I'm looking for advice anyone might have for doing that. Thank you in advanced"
s1lzaw,4,2022-01-11,"Tried to kill myself a month ago, failed, can't stop thinking about trying again",malealcervello,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/s1lzaw/tried_to_kill_myself_a_month_ago_failed_cant_stop/,"So, here it goes.

In 2020 I was living my best life. Had a shared apartment in a city I loved, I graduated with full honors in my Bachelors' degree, in Comics and Illustration , had a fulfilling sex life and I was working in a fast food restaurant, barely making ends meet but happy overall. I have been struggling with BPD since 2015 but I was managing it well thanks to the psychiatric services in my area (European, free of charge services cuz I couldn't afford a private one).

Then I started to have widespread pain, starting from the legs and going all the way up to my neck. Imagine a pain so strong you cannot walk, brush your teeth or comb your hair. It was like someone was skinning my limbs all the time.

Got diagnosed with fibromyalgia; which is extremely painful and incurable.

Tried to kill myself, overdosing on paracetamol. Got forcibly brought to a psychiatric ward, then to a long term facility for a total of two months. Got back up with some hope, even if that meant moving back with my parents in a town I hate due to trauma. I had some prospects, at least to be able to find a cure and find a new job that was not so hard on my body.

Now, a year later, I work in a call center, extremely stressing and partially unpaid (internship sucks), with no warranties about my future apart for the 6 months I was able to negotiate. Tried every pill imaginable to reduce pain and give me back my freedom, just gained and gained weight going from barely 62kg to 73kg in a matter of months - don't know how many pounds, sorry. Had to buy a used car in order to go to work, and now every month I owe 100€ to a person, with 500€ as my overall wage - this is if I work every day without sick leaves or permits. Got really depressed because all my life was left in the town I studied in, all my friends, my social circle, my hobbies, everything. Can't draw anymore due to pain and extremely low self esteem, while I see my college mates getting published to major companies. No love, no sex - nor the will to have it -, nothing. Just a big ball of nothing. Spent a lot of euros on laser therapy, which proved uneffective. Got covid in july, waited four months to be able to get vaccinated, then got covid again two days away from my vaccine.

Tried again to kill myself, this time tried overdosing on Topamax, was stopped by one of my friends calling an ambulance. Was brought to a psych ward, discovered I tested positive again, got 18 days in an isolation room where I couldn't communicate with anyone, fresh from my suicide attempt. One of my coworker died during this time, car crash, he was only 23; I wasnt able to go to his funeral. I wish I could give him my life, I wish I was in his place instead, he was so lively and bubbly, why couldn't that be me in his place? Healed, then sent back to the regular psych ward, it did not go well. Stood there for a week, than faked my way to being discharged (saying that I was ok while in fact I still wanted to kms).

Went back to work. Was paid 84€ for last month work. Not enough to even buy gas for my car in order to commute to work. I feel useless, hopeless, surrounded by successfull people. Went ahead to see my psychiatrist yesterday, who doesn't give a shit about me and just like to toy around with meds, it did not help. Went today to see my psychologist, she literally told me she doesn't know how to help me. 

I have lost everything. I cannot bear this any longer but if I survive my next attempt I cannot afford another 84€ paycheck. I am a broken brain in a broken body. I have no hope, no hobbies, no aspirations, nothing, living in the shadow of the girl I used to be. I just want the pain to be over, I just want to have someone to say that they'll miss me if I die. I never went on a proper date (except forced sex dates), never been loved. I want to end it all. I want the pain to be over, I want to draw again without feeling my bones burning but even then - it will never be enough. It is never enough."

\-I was going to receive HR training at my old job but was laid off due to the pandemic and I am not returning to that company due to a variety of reasons

\-I wanted to apply to internships in 2020 but there were very few due to the pandemic, plus I didn't qualify for many of them because I was a sophomore (I ended up graduating a year early) at the time and they wanted juniors and seniors

\-I applied for internships this past year but there still weren't as many available due to the pandemic. I live in Seattle which has had pretty strict covid regulations. I didn't hear back from any of the ones I applied to

I've seen a number of postings that indicate they would like HR certification or that they would expect HR certification with a year of hiring. Would starting on this certification help me find a job? University of Washington has an HR Essentials certification program I could likely complete in the next 6-8 months but I don't want to spend the money if it doesn't help at all.

s1qszw,2,2022-01-11,Job Offer: Career Advice Needed,yippiyak,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/s1qszw/job_offer_career_advice_needed/,"Let me preface this by saying, I do understand that this is a personal decision where only I know the right answer. However, I would appreciate thoughts from those who may have some ability to relate.

&amp;#x200B;

Five years ago, I joined my current employer as an intern. I work in defense, and I have a TS clearance. I enjoy what I do, I feel like I am learning, and I love my team. I also love my office, and while I do feel overworked sometimes, this is often because I make the decision to work harder. I would believe myself to be relatively ambitious and out going in that regard. I have never been disciplined for poor performance, and I never intend to.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, I was temporarily laid off for about 9 months as covid changed the environment. I spent that time applying to jobs and finishing my master's in CSE, but ultimately the only offer I received was from my previous/current employer. Truthfully, that left a bit of a bitter taste in my mouth, both being let go and how the search ended.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a year(ish) later, and I recently interviewed with Walmart Labs. They've decided to make an offer on a remote position, and it is roughly 60% higher than what I currently make. Comparatively, my company likely won't offer me a comparable compensation package for at least another 3-5 years. In fact, I lightly indicated that I was not entirely happy with my current compensation, and, while my manager said I'd be due for a standard increase in a couple months (anywhere between 5-10%), my Boss got pretty irritated that I would even ask them to try to be competitive.

&amp;#x200B;

At both places, it sounds as if there is room for career growth. At both places, it sounds as if I have ample opportunity to learn. However, I live in California, and one day I would like to buy a house. Taking the higher pay gets me to that goal faster. I also know that deep down in my heart my life goal is to save enough money for retirement, so I can retire to become a teacher. I am not there yet, but I know that I will probably not be a SWE forever. I value my soft-skills far too much. ;)

&amp;#x200B;

So what I would like to ask those of you who took the time to read all of this, what do you think? **Should I jump from a position I enjoy and I team that I love for the higher pay?** Am I a fool to turn down such a massive pay increase? Does anyone have experience with Walmart Labs? If so, are you happy there? Does anyone intentionally choose the lower pay because it's more fulfilling in some regard? If so, why?

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts or experiences would be appreciated. I've been asking those around me for their opinions, and they're all supportive of whatever I decide, but ultimately, they aren't Computer engineers.

&amp;#x200B;

Plus, one of my coworkers has been here 3-4 years longer than I have, and is decidedly brilliant. He is also a harder worker than I am, and truly deeply passionate about what we do. He currently only makes 20% more than I do, which is concerning. He certainly would have 0 issue jumping to one of the Big Tech names, and would be worth every penny of a $200k+ salary. He is not as motivated by money as I am, but I feel like he is criminally underpaid. While it is possible my company matches Walmart's offer in 3-4 years, I certainly have my doubts given how stingy my current employer has been with my coworker.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you to those who take the time to read all of this, and especially those who respond. I really truthfully appreciate the help."

No suicidal thoughts or ideation, but I’m genuinely overwhelmed. 

I lost an acquaintance to a fire on Sunday. She died and the rest of her family died as well. Two days before that, I lost another acquaintance to a car accident. I didn’t know him too well, but he was very liked by everyone and it hit everyone pretty hard and broke everyone down. 

Same week, I got in a huge argument with my girlfriend. It was supposed to be our ten months anniversary, but we spent the entire days before and after that fighting over petty shit. I love her and I cherish that relationship, but the fight drained the smallest energy I had left in me. Then today, I got rejected by the company I was really excited to intern for. I had my hopes high and just like that everything crashed. 

On top of that, earlier that week my dad had a biopsy earlier and the doctors suspect it may be prostate cancer. We are still awaiting the results. More bad news. 


It’s just bad news after bad news, and I’m genuinely just tired.  I feel overwhelmed. I want to go away for a while to just recover and come back. But I don’t know how to. Please help.

s1ulw2,2,2022-01-11,Career crossroads,throwawayzeit,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/s1ulw2/career_crossroads/,"Hi, I have a choice between working at my family's 40-year old manufacturing business or re-entering the CS workforce. I have 6 months experience working in the family business and 6 months of CS internship experience (1 FAANG and 1 non-FAANG) along with a bachelor's + master's in CS from top public universities, but I feel a little conflicted in terms of my long-term future. 

My parents expect me to work in the family business and potentially inherit in 5-10+ years, but I'm worried that the transition won't go over well and I would fail the business on my own, leaving me with a really awkward job history if I ever wanted to do CS. My parents collectively work 150-200 hours for their business, so I would have to be more efficient than them or work significant hours like them in order to maintain the current business performance. Conversely, doing CS would most likely lock me out of the family business in terms of a skillset mismatch. Financially, I would say the family business is riskier but could definitely outperform me as a software engineer assuming I'm averageish, while emotionally it is really stressful to work with my parents because they're controlling and very critical. But I also understand that working at other companies might also be stressful depending on the team I'm on..."

When it comes to school or personal projects I have  no problems, but obviously writing professional code is very different and I always feel so lost. I look at a piece of code and it is so hard for me to understand what is going on with so many packages and files I don't even know where to start.

I somehow managed to get through my previous internships but now that I'm here I'm seriously considering that swe might not be for me. I am close to graduating and have more experience than most people but I still feel like I don't know anything. When I get assigned a task or project I may as well be brand new to coding. 

Anyone have suggestions for how to learn/improve at writing code for large companies, or is this just not for me? In my last internship my manager told me I asked too many questions so I also feel like that's made me more hesitant to ask questions in this internship."
s1veel,2,2022-01-11,I only ever wanted to be loved/liked by one person,Mysterious-Box2187,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/s1veel/i_only_ever_wanted_to_be_lovedliked_by_one_person/,"Over 3 years ago, I (23) started developping a depression. I had entered college in 2016 and had a blast, made new friends again, hoped that my life would change, adament on trying to make it change. I wanted to become a teacher, secondary education, subjects English &amp; history. I quickly was attracted to a girl who is 1 year older than me, but we had English classes together. I didn’t really talk to her much (if at all), but I knew, I liked her, I just didn’t dare to say something. Though it didn’t bother me much, as I was quite focussed on history (prehistoric times specifically) and a game called Overwatch. In that first year I started to develop feelings/get really attracted to her, but other than about 4 conversations max, nothing happened. After that we somehow did develop a friendship. A very good one according to me and my first ever friendship that wasn’t “bound by school.” It also existed outside of the classes we took together. It didn’t take long before I was madly in love. She had a boyfriend, which is why I never wanted to confess what I feel. My best friend knew, we often talked about it. During this time, one of my internships was delayed, due my college not being able to find one. I started focussing on my exams instead, but it became harder and harder to do things because I was constantly thinking about her, with pain in my heart and tears in my eyes. I confessed my feelings. She took it well, saying the thought had crossed her mind. I explained how I never wanted to confess because it didn’t feel right. That summer her boyfriend broke up with her, we met and talked about it a bit, talked about my feelings (a promise she made to me a while ago after I’d told her). Both of us felt that, well, nothing was going to happen... I started working on my delayed internship or at least wanted to, because the teachers of the school I’d be teaching in never gave me any assignments or lesson material to prepare... Needless to say the internship was a disaster and I had to stop halfway in. I had my first suicidal thoughts in that week. My feelings also started to get worse. The more our friendship evolved, the more we talked, the more I or my mind or my heart or all of them were convinced I wanted to share my life with her. I knew her for about 2 years at that point, with 1 year being (very) close friends. Things in college didn’t go well and only got worse due to the internship not being organised at all and because I knew she had a hard time getting over her break up. I started seeing a therapist, but it didn’t help much and it was already too late. I felt us getting distant, not having much to say, both our lives going through a rough time and I completely broke down. I couldn’t bear the thought and feeling of losing her, even if she would only ever be a friend. I had to talk to her about it, tell her what was going on and to also tell her the will to live was slipping... At some point I also started talking to one of my teachers. She was kind of aware that things weren’t fine and I asked her for help (at least for the matters at college). At the end of the term in december 2018, that teacher told my friend to block me on social media, phone, anything, explaining to me that “you couldn’t/shouldn’t manipulate someone into starting a relationship solely so I wouldn’t commit suicide.” The only reason I ever wanted to talk to my friend about my suicidal thoughts and everything in general really, was to say that I wasn’t doing well, never to make her feel guilty and hope she’d say “yes.” More importantly, I only ever wanted to tell her, just remind her of the fact that I love our friendship and that I would try to work with my therapist to improve my mental health and to make sure that she shouldn’t worry (she knew I wasn’t fine, but never had any idea of suicidal thoughts). When I saw her blocking me, I broke down... Out of nowhere... She was just... gone. I panicked, started talking to my friends (3 in total, that was our little group), only to get blocked as well... My teacher said to me we’d all sit together and talk after the Christmas break (of 2018). That never happened. After 3 years, none of my friends are here. I have not done much outside of sleeping and playing games, it’s the only thing that can still distract me from my only 2 thoughts: those about her and those about the fact that I do not want to live anymore. She still blocks me and apparently doesn’t want to talk to me... I have no contact anymore with anyone of my friends. I never finished the degree. Outside of the games that distract me, my life is empty.

I only ever wanted to tell you that it’d be all right. That I love our friendship, that I’d try to improve my mental health and return to the happy man she knew...

Now I just want to be gone. Now I hope every night is my last. I hope every night that I wouldn’t have to wake up anymore.

I’m sorry for the long post, tried to make it as short as possible. It’s a long story with a lot of important details missing (side effect of studying history: you want to be as complete as possible, because even a small detail could change much), but it’s as complete as possible and as concise as possible. Thanks if you read it all. I wanted the story to be out there, anywhere.

Maybe I can get some sleep now. Hopefully for the last time.

I only ever wanted to be liked by you, even as just a friend. I still love you. You still have my heart, you always will."

**Essays/LORs/Other:** Optionally, guess how strong these are and include any other relevant information or circumstances.

In terms of essays, I'm pretty confident in my writing skills so those should be around 7/10 or 8/10

For LORs, I'm considering asking my history teachers (which im really close with) since I'm planning on majoring in international relations and their classes were what introduced me to the field.

I'm not exactly the greatest student in my school but I do pretty ok especially considering how I really struggled last year with covid and anxiety.

**Schools:** List of colleges, ED/EA/RD, etc

My #1 dream school would definitely be Georgetown SFS doing the IPOL program but considering my stats right now without any substantial awards or extracurriculars I'm not too sure (sob) :((

If you made it to the end of this absurdly long post thank youuuu! I haven't yet complied a full college list so if anyone could leave some recommendations for schools that would fit my profile I would really appreciate it!!! I'm really interested in doing law later on after studying international relations undergrad and would really love some pointers on how I can make my application look more ""appealing"" to the AOs :))"

I reluctantly accepted my current job, as an IT tech for a local government agency, during my senior year of uni because the internship I was aiming for got cancelled from the pandemic. The original job duties were to do basic stuff like set up hardware, install software, simple webpage editing, aka stuff that a high school kid could do. Since I quickly got bored of that I ended setting up some increasingly elaborate automation systems, and then I was asked to shoehorn in a bunch of new features that added a lot of complexity to the website and database, which even my boss admitted was above my pay grade. Long story short now I am doing webdev, scripting, database stuff and vendor troubleshooting on top of my official job duties while still making $18/hr. I could probably get a raise to $20/hr if I asked, but now I'm getting several offers for up to $32/hr and all are remote. One of them wants me to start in not even two weeks if I agree. But now is an intense time of year at work where I'll definitely be needed. I kind of feel like I'd be an a-hole for quitting all of a sudden, but on the other hand I despise this job and wanted to quit a long time ago. What would you do in this situation?"

s1wllu,6,2022-01-11,Having doubts about my major,Angelic_Acid_0301,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/s1wllu/having_doubts_about_my_major/,"Hello,

To provide some background I'm currently a 3rd-year biomedical engineering student. For some time I've been anxious regarding my choice of major. I really love biomedical engineering but I feel like my school pushes me towards a specific branch I am not interested in and the professors ( like most of any major) just suck. Something I am very passionate about is learning how to code and integrate myself into the software part of medical devices, AI image detection, or even robotics. But it's been an uphill battle and with already my crazy workload and piled on top of actual work to pay the bills. I never can find time to really start anything. 

Now to the relevance. For a while, I've been looking into different internships to apply to. Many biomeds understand the harsh truth that no one wants to hire them ( another reason why I feel a bit off about my major). But even so, I've been hard trying to find anyone and what is even worse is that even when I find perfectly good internships they require a lot of skills I've yet to acquire, or worse of all a perfect GPA that I just don't have. This past fall I actually had a great shot at a company I was super excited about. The spokesperson really encouraged me to apply regardless of my major (I applied for a software internship in the company) and I passed two interviews. This was my first ever callback and also interview ( and I am in my 3rd year). Sadly, the next call wasn't all too happy and I was told they decided to move on to other candidates. When I asked what might have been the issue, he said it was due to my lack of skills required for the position. 

At that moment I felt very defeated and worst of all I felt like they kept me going even though they knew where I stood compared to what the other candidates' skills were. But before the call ended he told me if I improved my skills and gained some more experience I could apply for new openings in the spring. But I don't know if I should. I feel so down by the fact that I told them upfront my level in software and exactly what I was looking for. I wanted someone to be a mentor and teach me the ways. I just feel so lost with where I should go, and my own advisor hasn't helped me figure it out. All of those who've graduated my major apparently turn to be managers or deal in the law side of medical device safety or patenting. I don't want that though. I want to build things and explore new possibilities, I love to learn but feel I'm being pummeled by topics that either make no sense or are just not enjoyable due to the way its taught.

It's been a really tough time, and even right now as a junior I still feel I barely know anything and all the classes I took have just slipped away. Am I just a bad student? Should I bother re-applying for that job position again? How the heck do I even find the skills they want to add under my belt?? ( I have asked people who worked there and they weren't much help because all of them were software engineering students). 

But yeah, this was my rant. I feel a little better but if anyone wants to comment please do."

I'm just not sure what I should optimize for through the rest of my life. Every winter break when I have time to think I question what I'm working towards and what I should be doing. I really am grateful for all that I have; my difficulty is that I can picture that at the end of my life I will be disappointed in myself if I haven't made a good and active effort at... something, even while being grateful for the opportunities I've had. So, should I try to make a decent living and invest my extra efforts into fun hobbies/family? Should I try to develop a hobby to expert-level? Strive to accumulate wealth/create a successful startup by working hard as possible? Make a positive/lasting impact on the whole world? Not sure what goal to have, and think I will have some regret just living passively."

It’s an amazing school that I have been dreaming of going to, and was so excited when I finally got in. The school provides so many opportunities, with internships, clubs, and major opportunities that will help me in my future career. The only issue is that it is 10 hours away from home. I am super close with my family, and love spending time with them. The thought of being 10 hours away is quite frankly, terrifying. Where the school is located is in one of my absolute favorite places in the U.S, and I have dreamed of living there but I will be so far away from my family (except for my twin sister). I keep getting told that I just have to get through the first three weeks and then I will love it, but when I think about leaving home in 3 weeks, I panic. Last week I had a full on panic attack and nearly dropped out. I try to talk myself into it with my sister, but she is just as scared and makes things a little worse tbh. So I am asking in advice, in how can I take the first step towards going away from home for college? How do I ease my mind for the time being?"

I'm wondering how background checks work at Meta for interns. My internship at Meta would be my first in the US and my work experience has mostly been on campus positions like Software Developer, TA, RA etc. One thing that is bothering me is my unpaid remote informal internship at a family-owned company abroad which I participated in only for work experience and for making things more efficient at the company. At the time, I obviously mentioned it on my resume since it played a major role in helping me grow as a developer. I'm now wondering how such an experience would be perceived by Meta. 

Besides that, in general, would they also reach out to my school's individual departments to confirm my on campus employment?

Anything on this would be great!

PS: I haven't accepted the offer yet so I don't know if they'll send out a questionnaire from a third-party service yet."

Doubt it with my stats, but I see my lower gpa pals getting into ivies, soooo… it’s a solid maybe :) I also hear schools like when your ECs connect back to you personally and mine 110% reflect who I am, what I care about, and where my passions lie. I did absolutely none of them with college in mind, I did all of them because I genuinely wanted to!! Hopefully that will make me standout at least the tiniest bit."
s21x5u,104,2022-01-12,My parents disowned me because I only got into HYPSM :(,Simple-Marzipan2194,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/s21x5u/my_parents_disowned_me_because_i_only_got_into/,"So basically, I only got into HYPSM (Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, and MIT for you uncultured folk) and my parents threw me out of the window of our $69 million 40th story penthouse. On my way down, I heard them say things like ""She's such a disgrace, we shouldn't be donating to Harvard, but they should be giving her a full ride and offering her a million dollars just to attend the school!"" and other hurtful things like ""She would have never gotten in if we hadn't donated a Costco-sized building to each school!"" because I obviously got in on my own merit, their money has nothing to do with my admissions at all.

Fortunately, I used my quick thinking and ordered an Uber to come pick me up out of the sky before I could hit the ground, I was so grateful to the driver that I donated my free ride to Yale to him. We had a good talk, and he told me about how he tried to apply to Yale in the past, but didn't get in because he tried to kiss his interviewer? I never thought about doing that, maybe I'll kiss the dean of the school I commit to and ask him for grade inflation.

Anyway, I applied to all HYPSM schools Restrictive Early Action and got into all of them, so I think I might just divide myself into 5 parts and send them to each school. My head goes to Harvard, my arms go to Yale and Princeton, and my legs go to Stanford and MIT. That way, I can get 5 degrees at the same time and maybe even live 5 separate lives. I'll be the CEO of a tech company, a surgeon, a stripper, an author, and a depressed stay at home mother with 5 children and alchoholism.

Well, those are just my future plans, but you're probably wondering how I got into all these schools. The answer is hard work and perseverance. I believe that anyone can work there way up and go to a top university, it's not that hard, all you have to do is try! By the way, here are my hooks:

URM (my parents are white but my great-great-great grandpa was Latino so that technically counts), disabled (i've suffered from nearsightedness all my life, it's very difficult to cope with), my stepdad is Jeff Bezos, I'm a member of every single letter of the LGBTQIA+ community, and I'm technically a legacy student because my mother had a one-night stand with all of the deans and we're not sure which one is my biological father, so I just applied as a legacy at each school.

Here's some of my stats so that you can see that I got in based on merit only:

**GPA**: 4.0 unweighted,  42.0 unweighted

**Rank**: 1/666

**Classes**: I took every single AP during my freshman year, and the last three years I've spent making a network of ""connections"" with T5 alumni and professors...specifically the older male ones

**Scores**:

I gave Trevor Packer a blowjob so he gave me a 1600...in retrospect, that might be one of the reasons my parents were mad at me.

I got a perfect score on every AP exam without even glancing at the material (this is literally proof that it's not even that hard, it's all just logic and common sense)

**Extracurriculars**:

1. I started a nonprofit that raised over 25 million dollars to create sustainable farms in poor communities. I made an irrigation system that watered crops with the tears of children.
2. I attended RSI because I slept with the dean at MIT (should I list sleeping with the dean as a seperate EC? It was very time-consuming)
3. I was Captain of my regional rowing team.
4. I figured out how to reverse global warming so much that we might enter another ice age
5. I painted a nude portrait of the Harvard dean, and it's scheduled to replace the Mona Lisa in the Louvre
6. I enlisted the help of several older male colleagues, interviewers, and alumni in filming and producing ""films"" that won many awards on online hubs
7. I was the founder and president of all 200 clubs at my school. (I dedicated one minute to each club every week, I'm so glad I have amazing time management skills)
8. I interned at NASA and discovered a huge black hole. (Actually, it turned out that it wasn't a black hole, the lens of my telescope was just covered)
9. I started a small business for selling jewelry (it was actually a cover for a meth lab)
10. I did an internship where I found a universal cure for cancer (I listed this as my last activity because everyone does this, it's not very unique)

&amp;#x200B;

**Essays**:

*Personal Statement:*

I wrote a hot any heavy fanfic about the HYPSM schools as people during an orgy. I feel like this essay really demonstrated my writing skills.

The rest of my supplements were phenomenal, I copy and pasted them straight from the college essay guy website

**Letters of Rec:**

I got letters of rec from Malala, Barack Obama, and Queen Elizabeth. My teachers and counselors also gave good rec letters since I convinced my parents into giving them new Lamborghinis

**Accepted:**

HYPSM (all REA)

Brown (My safety. Don't even know why I applied though, why would I want to go to a school whose whose name is the same color as literal shit)

Dartmouth (Got in but I don't even know where tf it is, I tried searching it up on google maps but all I saw was grass and cows)

Cornell (jk i didnt apply here, it's for people with standards lower than their non-4.0 gpa)

USC (I got onto the rowing team...No, my mother's name isn't Lori Loughlin)

All other T20s - I'd never actually go to colleges so low on the list, I only applied so I can steal spots from other prospective students.

**Rejected:**

I asked Harvard's dean if he wanted to hook up, but he said no :(

&amp;#x200B;

Pls help, I have nowhere to go now that my parents disowned me. I'm considering to just book a first-class flight to our mansion on our private island in the Bahamas. Since I'm homeless for the next few hours until I get there, all donations are appreciated! Link down below if you wanna donate:

I want to know. I’ve had multiple business internship interviews I’ve ruined because I just can’t get myself focused to prepare for them (frankly I don’t even want to do business which makes it even worse, but it’s a well-paying job). Now I’m stuck with the prospect of not having done any internships in my junior year of college, approaching my senior year, and I’m almost outside looking in. I’d actually like to make music or make TV shows, but those are such big commitments that take a while (which is awful for my ADHD) and being home with my parents just saps all of my ability to work away because I just get so depressed. I’d like to get a high-paying job to get myself an apartment and work on those things, but it’s becoming less and less likely and i just can’t stop punching myself in the face for it. Additionally, I don’t have any experience with those things and you need to network to get seen in any way. Life seems so insurmountable right now and I feel like I’m gonna be a failure. It sucks, I felt like I managed to outsmart my ADHD; it seems like I’m gonna be the only person of my family to actually graduate college. I have a high GPA after nearly failing high school and that’s what got me my job interviews, but I can’t seem to get myself to actually get the jobs. Maybe it is because I don’t care, but it’s too late to switch from business.

Maybe I’ll go to Korea and be a teacher for a little to get a change of scenery. But then I fear I’ll be all alone, not even just in terms of friends but also a relationship haha

My classmate who is also getting his masters in data science from UK told it would be a better option to take any specialization degree with work placement, as we get an additional year , W.E and assistance from uni to get placed/ get an internship.

Does this seem like a right choice? And what are my chances of getting placed in an analyst role in UK if I take up an MIS degree with work placement?

My friends and I did something similar, but different. - I think this will fit here.
When we come together and drink a bit or getting goofy   because of beeing tired, it is kinda our hobby to troll people: Calling Customersupport, writing mails with absurd demands to officals and politicals and so on.
Nothing bad, nobody gets hurt.
That one evening we decided to write weird/inappropiate job applications.
We were putting things in it like an pupil internship in a whorehouse, smoking weed as Hobby, Whatsapp/Instagram as EDV Knowledge for a datascience job, offering the HR guy a promotion if he hires us as regional manager and a bunch more. - In the end we send about a hundret applications.

I have still no idea why; Didn't they read the applications? Were they just curious? Or desperatly searching employes? - But we got 8 invatations for an interview.
And we decided, that we have to take that opportunity and attend them. In the end only 3 of us got the balls to do it and this is how mine turned out:

(Note: English isnt my first language, so Im not 100% sure about terms for job titels and some stuff😅)

1. As a puplic relation manager in a conservative company:
I were 15 min late wearing a jogging suit. That women at the desk in front of the office was very nice and gave me the advice to change my cloth, but I told her that I knew what I was doing. She gave me that ""Do what you want""-gesture and said, I could go in. When I enterd I just said: ""Thanks for waiting, promise gonna worth it"" and giving him a finger gun. Up today I have still no idea, how I could hold my laugh, buuut - I was even more surprised he wasnt kicking me out right away and we were still doing an actual interview. Thats were my plan got a first scratch, cause I wasnt thinking getting so far, so I improvised. 
That conversation lasted about half an hour,  here some of my favorites:
-I talked about a not existing Bachelor degree (like invented one), 
-When he asked what would be my first advice as a puplic relation manager: I told him very very excited about that cool thing called a website. Where literally fucking everyone in the whole world could look up what we were doing. I explained it to him like he was from the 18. Century. He asked me if he looks that old, to not know what a website is. I told him, that Im bad at guessing age, but he still made me.
So I said 60 - he was about 40.
-I took out a bagel?(didnt found a proper translation - like a small bread with topping from a bakery ) and when the interviewer told me that was rude and  unappropiate to do, I appoligized and offerd him a half.
That was were I had to give up, his face was pure gold and I almost died  of laughing.
After that I admit what I was doing and he also started do laugh his ass off.
During the whole interview he stayed so calm and professional, I was hella impressed. We are now kinda friends sending us memes and stuff. 

2. Social Media manager (love how you US-guys just put manager in every jobtitel) in a startup:
I put on a neon bright shirt with ""addicted to bitches"" written on it. On accident i was in time but well prepeared for more than just the greeting.
But sadly I didnt survived the second question here.
I may responded to ""where do you see yourself in three years?"" with ""In your wife"". 
This was my first thought and said it without overthinking and that guy looked like hes gonna punch me in the face.
But he stayed kinda calm and told me to leave. I left, but in the moment I closed the door, I reopened it a bit and dropped a: ""So I got the job?""
He starts yelling and told me to piss off.😅

3. Insurgence Company - Some kind of Customer-Agend:
I was wearing a bad suiting suit, far too big.
That was a big company this time. I had to do a recruitmentest at that day and only 6 of us were allowed to stay for the interview. There were 5 people sitting infront of me during the interview, what kinda made me a bit insequre. I still wonder how it is possible, to got invited there. In that CV we put my favorite rap songs as a categorie and played two truth and a lie to ""make them wanna know the answer and meet us."" - Great idea for a drunk guy at 3 am.
Of course all 3 were a lie and inapropiate for CV even if you consider, putting 2 truth and a lie in a CV.
So I was sitting there and didnt made a whole plan, I just knew - Im gonna try to sell them a pyramide sheme for some superfood that cures cancer and let you loose wight. 
""Why Im here?""Im here to give you the opportunity of your LIIFEE!"" ""You giving me that damn job for my insurgence and I let you invest in my great buisness.""
Stuff like that. Doesnt matter what they were asking, answer always was about how great that superfood is and why they dont wanna get rich.
They quit the interview half way through and I got an generic answer as an mail.

If you want I can look up these CVs later and give some more examples."

Having taken an LoA to do an internship. 

The good memories: The Indian stall that I used to eat, 2 or 3 times a week in school. And another stall I always patron. Laughter during the tutorial classes for the level 1 and 2 language modules. Eating together with some friends. Today I tried out Frontier and TechnoEdge for the first time and it was great.

Regrets being, being too introverted to reach out to me around me, so I found it difficult to find friends. And I also tend to go to classes by myself so it was hard for me, not knowing how to reach out. Not really taking part in activities / CCAs because I was worried sick about flunking studies and spent too much time trying to study inefficiently and ineffectively. I still got mediocre grades despite the amount of time put in.

Also there are bad memories of having to work in groups every sem having to tank a large part of project, and all the frustrations working with certain people

But end of the day, I think I will miss this place a lot . Grateful for the group of friends who reached out and invited me because I don't have the courage to.  


P.S. I hope fellow peers who came in during COVID semester will eventually experience their youth too and make friends."

So I'm a Computer Science student at a super small (pretty bad university ngl) university in Ontario, Canada.

I managed to get an internship at BlackBerry for this Winter, and before that I worked at OpenText.

Now, I'm on my 4th internship so far, and I'm working part time for a small company in a Machine Learning Engineer role as well.


I'll probably graduate with 6 - 7 internships, but I wanted to ask... how can I move to the US from a shitty school in Canada which has zero industry connections to companies that are based out of the US.


I'm willing to put in the work, all I need is some direction. I think my best shot is FAANG but it's hard af to get the interview let alone passing it (I get interviews occasionally (got Google twice)), but struggle to pass it because I don't leetcode enough, although I'm changing that now.


Any advice?

Thank you!"

s2agwk,76,2022-01-12,I feel like I'm about to loose it. I'm seriously loosing any shred of hope I had left in finding a job.,TheGlowingWight,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/s2agwk/i_feel_like_im_about_to_loose_it_im_seriously/,"I graduated June 2021 and have been applying tirelessly to jobs since January 2021. Since then, I've had about a dozen or more interviews from idk how many applications I submitted (like hundreds).

At the time of graduation and from my inner circle of senior design team members plus friends, I was the most experienced of the bunch, in terms of skills and work experience. Only 2 friends had internship experience, the rest had no work experience. From that group, I was also the best in terms of programming and CAD work. I constantly tutored friends, including 2 master's degree students on projects. Literally helped them write their code or model their projects.

I had a 2.94 gpa upon graduation, not the highest in my group, but also not the lowest. Part of my senior design work was for a major US company, with my design being approved and used by that company. I thought that I would be an easy pick for any company looking to hire new grads! 

Well, the weeks came and went with nothing. Months passed and slowly, from my group of 8 friends, they all started getting hired. The 2 members with internship got jobs right away, then others with no internship or work experience, but they were 3.0 and above, so it was understandable. Then my friend with a 2.7 got a job 3 months after graduation, then my friend with 2.61 got a job in October. Finally, a friend of mine with a 2.4, someone who I constantly had to help to get him to pass his classes got a job.

I was the only one left out from the group. I started asking my friends and professors for help, including here on Reddit. I revised my resume countless times, even had 2 friends refer me to their companies. It's now mid January 2022 and I haven't had any luck, no offers and the last interview I had was back in early November 2021.

I haven't been sleeping right either, like right now I'm on 5 hours asleep in 2 days (since Monday). The only thing keeping my sanity and hopes in check was my own personal business keeping me afloat, but I caught COVID after avoiding it since the start, just finished recovering from it, but now girlfriend has it too. This shit just derailed my entire hopes and dreams. IDK what to do. Looking through some of my recent applications and rejections, I see that now most entry level jobs are looking for grads from Summer-Fall 2021. I fear I will end up like some of my other friends who graduated back in 2020 and have yet to find jobs in their field.

 I feel so defeated, stressed and depressed! I keep crying from all the anger I feel towards myself and just want to end it. My family went from congratulating me, to now asking if I'll ever get a job in engineering. It feels so unfair how friends I knew, who couldn't write a single line of code or couldn't even mate things in SolidWorks have jobs in fields where they use those skills!

It's aggravating too how in 2 recent interviews, where we were tested, I came out on top from the groups, but ultimately rejected due to lack of engineering experience. Like in one test, we were given a problem and asked to figure out dimensions, model the thing and run FEA on it. From my group, only 2 others managed to model it, the rest couldn't model it correctly or get dimensions right. I was the only one capable of modeling it correctly and running FEA (in the 30 min given), but I was rejected due to no engineering experience. The guy who got the job was some guy who had graduated Fall 2020, but had internship experience. He told me that he couldn't figure out one of the dimensions, yet he got the job after looking up his LinkedIn. The other test/interview I had was in modeling a car part and running a different type of FEA. I was congratulated on finishing it, was told that most other candidates couldn't finish it and that I'd be moving into a final interview. Got ultimately rejected again, due to the other guy having 2 years experience vs me.

I worked as a quality control/inspector in aerospace for 5+ years, before graduating! I can't even land an entry quality engineer position either! I feel like just giving up on this shit. All these years were wasted, only leading me into student debt and getting me nowhere. I feel so fucking stupid too. I recall some of my friends who quit, kept telling me that they could earn about the same as a newly hired engineer at their old jobs. One of them is a manager now earning $27/hr. A cousin of mine, who also worked as a quality control/inspector with me, is making $26/hr at the same company, the company I quit to finish school."
s2b11x,1,2022-01-12,I feel like the guy who took the wrong career for the wrong reasons and now I’m regretting it,throwthisaway181302,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/s2b11x/i_feel_like_the_guy_who_took_the_wrong_career_for/,"For context, I grew up in a family that didn’t have much money to spare. We weren’t struggling for entire time (there were spots where my parents couldn’t afford birthday or Christmas presents, but in terms of necessities, we had most of them), but the idea that money was sparse was very clear. 

I didn’t want to live like this when I was older, and I liked technology, so I went for coding. I knew the opportunities that this would lead to would be vast, I had decent  job security and the salary would also be enough to live off comfortably. I’ve been able to move to another country, which is something I’ve wanted to do for years. These are the benefits I thought about when I decided to pursue this career path. 

I had an intern year before my final year of college and I loved the company and I liked the work too. After graduating I went back to the same company to work permanently, but I hated it a year later. This I’d say was partly due to the pandemic, but I also kind of feel like I just didn’t like the work. I’ve now started my new job, and I’m not enjoying it. It’s starting to dawn on me that I prefer making my own schedule or at least not sitting at a desk all day. I need the interaction and sitting in meetings is near impossible. I have learning disabilities that don’t help with this. 

Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe it *is* the pandemic that’s getting me down and making me hate waking up in the morning for work, but I feel like at least some of it is to do with work. I feel like such an idiot because I knew that I shouldn’t have went this route since it only would lead to me hating my job and my life, but I wanted to live a good one. 

I guess this is just a long winded way to ask if there would be any related field with my experience and education (BSc Computer Science, 2.5 years of coding experience) that might be a good alternative? Part of me feels like the only thing that would make me happy is my own business, but I have no idea what I would do or how I would start that. Any help or advice is appreciated."

These are usually required/highly recommended for a master’s in statistics, which I think I would want to pursue. c) taking other CS electives, notably a programming languages course, an advanced database systems course, and a distributed systems course, which are recommended by my school for careers in SWE and information/data management. 

Any advice? Once again, I’d want to pursue a statistics masters after my BS, unless I am able to secure a decent job with good growth potential. I could also do two of the three options if I invest a summer in taking classes. I have three summers set aside for internships (including the summer immediately after graduation) and this would occupy one of those."
s2dujt,8,2022-01-12,Is job networking in engineering actually helpful?,Acrocane,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/s2dujt/is_job_networking_in_engineering_actually_helpful/,"I feel like it’s way more uncommon to find a job via networking. If I had to guess, maybe one in 50 engineering job applicants might actually get a job through knowing someone on LinkedIn. Maybe you can bump it down to one in 10 if they actually were lucky enough to get a genuine internship internship (that will never happen to me). With that said, what’s in it for me after I graduate with a computer engineering degree? Will networking actually get me somewhere or will I just be wasting my time? (I feel that it will be the latter—I’m not an outstanding or unique student in any regard so I won’t be impressive to any potential connection).

FYI even if I did bother wasting my time with a LinkedIn account, the only thing it would show is how unqualified I am for my degree when random people decide to look my name up. I have absolutely nothing outstanding in any regard.

Edit 1/13/2021: I just wanted to apologize if I sounded harsh in this post. I do sometimes have sporadic anger bursts and this was just one of them. I really appreciate what everyone has said in this thread and I read everything. In the end all I really want is a well paying job after college. It doesn’t have to be at Tesla or at google, as long as it can sustain me and the salary is average for my major I’ll be happy. I suppose that it is the current state of the world that has made me extremely demotivated. My gpa is weak and since I transferred schools I don’t have a strong reputation of myself in engineering clubs. I’m carefully evaluating my next steps for my upcoming senior year in the Fall, despite knowing I’ll be graduating a semester late. I’m neither optimistic nor pessimistic about it, I’m just hopeful for a full time engineering job that pays $60k in northeast US."
s2dv3g,3,2022-01-12,"""Paid"" Internship - You pay US, and we give minimal detail in the job description about how you will make money otherwise during the program.",Crabby-Cancer,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/s2dv3g/paid_internship_you_pay_us_and_we_give_minimal/,"I saw a listing for an internship on a job board for my field. The internship is essentially a 10-week long stay on an island in the US in which the interns focus on agriculture/food justice, environmental studies, etc. for people aged 18-27. Seems pretty cool to me!

So, I keep scrolling down the listing until I see... ""Cost"". Huh? So, turns out, they are CHARGING $350 for the internship. This will cover your housing, the curriculum, field trips, and *one* common meal per *week*. The price can be reduced to $200 if you already have housing on the island.

*However*, they do advertize this as a ""paid internship"" and that you will be doing 20-30 paid hours a week of farm/physical labor. Here is the problem with that:

1. Nowhere do they specify *how much* you'll be paid per hour.
2. They do not specify where you will be working. It's just a vague ""local farms or land-based organization"". No specific names. Not even if you look at the website.
3. The jobsites you would be doing farm/physical labor on ""may require an additional interview"".

So... you're expected to put down $350, which won't even go towards your transportation, the additional meals that won't be covered, clothing/gear for work, etc.? If you were to fail additional interviews, find out the farm work is extremely low paying, and therefore cannot afford food, transportation, etc., what are you supposed to do?

\[ADDED AFTER REVIEWING MY POST AND THEIR APPLICATION: They are incorrectly advertizing the labor hours as 20-30 on their website and job board, while their application itself actually advertizes 20-25. Not cool.\]  


I understand that jobs in my field tend to be quite low paying, especially for entry-level, but this is *ridiculous*. Let's compare this to when I spent 8 weeks working at a national park doing conservation/restoration work for a non-profit &amp; AmeriCorps.

We were paid $300 a week as a living stipend, which equals about $7.50 per hour if we stick to a strict 40hr/week schedule.

*However*, the non-profit covered housing, transportation/gas, food, and uniforms/gear COMPLETELY. So while I wasn't seeing as much money going directly into my bank account, I also wasn't seeing ANY leave for necessities. I also recieved a scholarship worth over 1k at the end.  


When I look at the field trip aspect, I think of my time working with the SCA for summer programs. We would work Mon-Thurs doing typical conservation/restoration work, but on Friday, we did educational field trips. Every week for a 6-8 week program. These field trips were PAID. You were paid your regular hourly rate for the hours you were on these field trips. Not only this, but our average work days were peppered with educational activities, which, of course, were paid as well.

Speaking of the SCA, if you were to do a program beyond crews in your local community, they will:

1. Provide housing OR pay you a rent stipend separate from your regular paycheck that covers rent in that area.
2. Provide a travel stipend to allow you to travel to and from the site from your home (as often, people will travel across the country for these jobs). Always at least 1k.  


This also makes me think of WWOOFing, where basically, in exchange for your labor on someone's farm, they typically provide housing, food, and education/experience. Obviously, that is NOT for everyone, but you are given a means to live and learn through the labor you provide to them.  


This internship listing was posted on a JOB BOARD. I have seen a handful of unpaid internships there which I do not agree with, but this is the only one I've seen where you are expected to pay THEM. I believe this opportunity should be advertized as some sort of ""summer/educational camp"" instead of a proper internship posted to a JOB BOARD.

Sure, this isn't *that* bad, but I think it will set a bad example for young people going into my field, or any field, for what matter. Either advertize it as a job/internship and provide sufficient pay, or advertize it as some sort of summer/educational camp. Young people shouldn't think they need to pay their employers in order to work. Instead, teach young people that their labor is VALUABLE.

If I could improve it, I'd do it like this:

1. The local farms/land-based organizations should have more of a presence on the job listing/website/application. People should kow who they will be working for and getting paid by (as they are not getting paid by the ones who created the listing). And of course, on the same note, elaborate on the *type* of work they will be expected to do and their WAGE, most importantly.
2. They should value the interns' labor more. Ex.: ""You're taking care of crops, picking the fruits and vegetables you grew, and making meals with them? That's a lot of work. But you still have to pay us for it."" NO! The work they put into it should equate whatever you think they should be paying.
3. Take a page from the books of other student/young adult organizations that strive to provide free (or even PAID) training, education, experience, etc. If this organization is passionate about educating the youth, they should look to their peers as an example.

Okay, rant over! Thank you for listening. I would hate if I had been taken advantage of like that when I started working in this field. Honestly, it would probably have been very discouraging. Jobs like this are already low-paid enough, and I was always worried about how I would get by, and this would definitely shatter any dreams I had of surviving as a worker in an environmental field if I thought I had to PAY someone to do it."

Can’t seem to pass any interview,Adventurous_Bat_8637,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/s2e8tv/anyone_else_on_a_cold_streak_cant_seem_to_pass/,"Got left swiped by Meta today after my phone screening. Junior in Uni, can’t seem to pass any interview out of the few companies who actually get back to me. Anyone else go through this?

I’ve been grinding so hard over break and this semester, and practicing with so many mocks, but still getting rejected over and over again is just so depressing and demotivating..

I guess I just need to get better at leetcode, idk. Got 2 LC mediums I believe. Got the first question in optimal time, but I screwed up the space complexity somehow. Was a String manipulation problem. I took a bit too long tho cause I only had 10-15 minutes left for the second question. I quickly gave a semi optimal algorithm, but he pushed for a better one to which I found. It involved binary search but short on time he told me to pretend I have a function that binary searches for me and code out the rest which I did. 

I feel like I did pretty solid, right? We agreed on my algorithms, I talked through test cases (not given access to compiler), talked about how the code could be improved. The parts I think I didn’t do so well was the space complexity of the first, a bit of time issue, and my initial algorithm for the second was only semi optimal. 

People always told me you don’t need to have perfect answers/their bar isn’t too high especially for phone screenings, but I guess I still wasn’t there yet? I know people who have passed this phase and they barely even got to the second question during the interview. Anyone have any tips on how to better prepare?

I have friends who don’t even do LC or competitive programming, but they just walk into interviews and ace them anyways; no idea how they do it. 

It’s not like I only apply to faang and the prestige companies either. I also had an internship at Fannie Mae last summer but I feel like I definitely only got it cause I had a referral...plus the interview was only behavioral, not much technical questions at all.

For anyone else out there who has been on a cold streak like me before, what did you guys do to get out? I hope one day my hard work will pay off!"

I am currently a junior studying CS at a university in California. I just transferred in the Fall of 2021 from a California community college. In the fall quarter here at uni, however, I didn't have the best time academically. I ended up needing to retake a class, but since this is the one and only term at this university, my GPA is &lt; 2.0 at the moment. I am currently retaking the course, so this grade will eventually be replaced, so I am not worried in the long run.

However, as a junior I have one last summer to try and get a SWE internship. I have been sending out lots of applications, (about 100 or so right now) but I am worried that I will be asked for a transcript. In fact one company has already reached out requesting a transcript (I quite literally forgot I applied to this particular company, so I'm not too worried about it, but I am worried this may happen with a company I really want to work for).

My problem is that the one and only completed term at my uni has a failing grade in it, so my term GPA from the fall is also my cumulative GPA ( less than 2.0). Would this be a problem when applying for SWE/PM internships?

1. I'm thinking that I can maybe average the two GPA's, as the courses all contribute to my progression towards completing a Bachelors degree. Is this a valid way to mediate my issue?
2. If asked for my transcript, would the best option be to send both my community college transcript (3.5+ GPA) and my uni transcript (with my one and only failing quarter on it)?
3. And also in general, is it common for big tech companies to ask for transcripts from prospective interns?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks."

In general, I have stumbled across 2 themes:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Requirements include one to be in a CO-OP, which my current university does not offer (this was not a problem in the past as I was still able to land 3 internships)
2. Forms ask for graduation date, in which I would be considered New Grad, but will not provide any ways to showcase that I will return to Full-time Studies. 

Would anyone have advice on the way to format my applications? What companies should I target that do not have strict ""CO-OP"" requirements? Any suggestions/comments?

**Demographics**

* Gender: Female
* Race/Ethnicity: Asian (Chinese)
* Residence: East Coast
* Income Bracket: upper-middle class
* Type of School: Large public, competitive county, non-feeder
* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): nothing &lt;3 

**Intended Major(s)**: Finance 

**Academics**

* GPA (UW/W): 4.0/4.93
* Rank (or percentile): school doesn't rank
* \# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: Total APs including senior year: 13, Honors Spanish for freshman - junior year, and the rest were G/T classes
* Senior Year Course Load: AP Physics C, AP Psychology, AP Micro/Macroeconomics (it's a two in one course), AP English Lit, AP Spanish, Differential Equations, Advanced Data Structures

10th: US Govt/Politics (5), Statistics (they lost my test so I had to retake in August with TEN DAYS NOTICE and I lowkey think I got a sympathy 5. Also self-study) (5). 

11th: Biology (5), English (5), Calc BC (5), World History (5). I also got a 3 on Chem which I didn't submit. Overall, I don't think AP tests matter very much and taking AP Chinese as a Chinese person definitely doesn't.

* Other (ex. IELTS, TOEFL, etc.): none

**Extracurriculars/Activities** 

This isn't the exact order

1. **Science Olympiad** \- 11th-12th - Co-captain and co-founder of the club at my school. Started while online, qualified for the State tournament in our first year.
2. **Debate** \- 9th-12th - Co-captain senior year, medalled a few times in local tournaments, qualified for Metros (basically regionals? states? idk) 10th and 11th
3. **Tennis** \- 9th-11th - Starter, but I'm not very good. My school is just bad at tennis.
4. **Local govt. official internship** \- 11th-12th - I canvassed and made calls for the campaign, conducted a research project that involved talking to local community members, and sat through really technical zoom calls where I understood absolutely nothing.
5. **Tutor** \- 9th-12th - I tutor(ed) people. About half were for free (volunteer hours), and half were paid. 
6. **Leader at tutoring organization** \- 9th-12th- Wrote lesson plans for other tutors and organized them, also don't remember if I had this separate from tutoring
7. **NEHS** \- 11th-12th - President 
8. I don't remember, but I don't think these were important (just honor societies w/o leadership)

**Awards/Honors**

I don't have many. I got a silver award on Reddit once!

1. **Governor's Service Award** \- in my state, there's a prestigious one that you have to be nominated for by a state senator/rep, and a nonprestigious one that you get if you complete x amount of service hours. I think I put down both.
2. **President's Volunteer Service Award** \- not sure of the exact name. Unfortunately, mine is signed by a domestic terrorist Cheeto and so it is absolutely worthless.
3. &amp;#x200B;
4. &amp;#x200B;
5. &amp;#x200B;

**Letters of Recommendation**

**10th Grade Science Teacher (pretty close)-** The funny thing here is that Penn wants junior year and senior year teachers, but I didn't read that on the website until December, so I started freaking out but whatever. She is the teacher sponsor for Science Olympiad, and she definitely saw my leadership skills firsthand. Also, I love her and she's the absolute best &lt;3.

**11th Grade English Teacher** \- We aren't particularly close, but I filled out a survey to help her write the letter. I also did well in her class. She is an English teacher, so I think her rec was probably very well-written if impersonal. 

**Counselor** \- We literally have no relationship. I didn't follow any of her advice (more safety schools etc.) because I didn't want to. We talked once a year during course-selection. She probably wrote a very basic, template-based recommendation.

**Interviews**

I misspelled my interviewer's name in my email LMAO, but the interview went ok. It wasn't anything special (basic why us, why major, etc. questions), and he was really busy (I think with back-to-back interviews) so it was short.

**Essays**

I wrote these by myself, and my college friends helped edit them after their midterms. Wouldn't  recommend doing things this way, but I didn't want to spend my parent's money on a counselor if I was going to get rejected.

**Common App** \- I talked about my Chinese identity, connected it with my grandma, and mahjong. This was pretty personal, very rushed (finished editing it at 11 pm November 1 oof), but good? I was inspired when writing the rough draft (literally got it done in one hour). 

**Supplementals** 

Major specific - I talked about how I developed my passion for business through baking 

Community - I talked about how I really wanted to help with Penn Science Olympiad and get involved with Penn Democrats, so I was able to connect this essay to two of my ecs

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* University of Pennsylvania (ED) 

**Additional Info:**

The Common App has this optional COVID-19 paragraph, but my English teacher and counselor told me it wasn't really optional so I wrote it even though I wasn't particularly affected by COVID. I talked about how I had to quickly adapt to teaching/tutoring online and how I picked up running and lifting to stay active.

**Takeaways/Reflection:**

I was originally going to apply to Brown ED because my friend (same high school) was a legacy at Penn and she and I have similar stats and I didn't want to ruin my chance at a T20 because I didn't think Penn was going to accept both of us ED. I decided to apply pretty last minute and ended up scrambling to write my supplementals. (Didn't get to use my Brown essays which were actually godly) But we did both get accepted so take this as an encouragement to just apply where you want to apply! I also used to doomscroll through r/ApplyingToCollege, which was horrible and I'm very grateful to my friends for making me stop.

Why I think I got in: I obviously have above average grades/SAT, but my extracurriculars were basic, and I didn't win any huge awards or do particularly well at any ec activity that I undertook. I didn't have a 'spike' or ecs that indicated particular interest in my major. I didn't demonstrate my interest in Penn. I think the factor that pushed my application over the edge was that I was a relatively well-rounded applicant with no red flags. There are only so many international award-winning USACO gold medalists. People with good grades, decent essays, and basic ecs will make up a large part of every entering class at any T20 school. Also, applying ED to Penn (or other schools that offer ED) will obviously increase your chances.

Feel free to ask any questions, I'll try my best to help (but I'm not an AO obviously)!"

So I am doing my co op internship and the company uses .NET/C#. I learned the language and feel comfortable enough on it.

Should I learn another language? I was interested in Java but I am not sure if it makes sense to do so. Most of the interviews questions are not available in C# so that was my reasoning
Would you recommend another? Go? Python? Keep brushing the skills on C#?

Should I bother going for JS and learn some frontend frameworks?

I know, it sounds dumb, but any advise is appreciated."

Should I try becoming an expert at the aforementioned frameworks? Or look into Java and Spring (still not 100% how they work lol)?

s2n1te,3,2022-01-12,Should I take fully remote offer that will greatly increase salary?,staugustinefanboy3,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/s2n1te/should_i_take_fully_remote_offer_that_will/,"Hello,

I am a developer with around 2 years of experience. I held one job from late 2019 to early 2021 in a small tech shop where I helped build C#/ASP.Net websites. There also was a ton of minor tickets + mindlessly a tool to build certain files from a provided .xcl file. So i learned some things, but not a lot.

In early 2021, I received a job from a defence contractor. For the first few months, I did barely anything. I should have used this time to study algos/prepare for future interview, but regrettably did not. This job is less stressful than my last, but very slow and very easy for me. My salary is around 60k. I want a new and intense job to sharpen my skills. Ideally, I would like to work at a company like Meta or Capitol One - a large tech firm with a strong team culture.

I think I will receive an offer from a respectable sap-style firm that does work similar to my first job. It also pays around 100k. Great, right? However, the role is fully remote. It sounds very similar to my first job-working ticket to ticket on ancient ASP.Net code and stored procedures and trying to modernize it. Once again, I also desire a strong sense of corporate culture that I think will be missing, because half the team is thousands of miles away in another state and the other half in india/phillipines. I've never really worked in a normal office environment my entire career, other than internships. The adjustment toward a new job will also take time away I could use on leetcode/brushing up on matrices, which now I am motivated to do after a year of nothing.

The upside is that it involves cloud computing. It also pays far better than my last job. I feel so ungrateful being critical of such a well-paying job. And i do not know if any of my other applications will yield results. Bird in hand vs two in the bush.

To be honest, I would rather work at a larger, sexier firm. However, when it comes to second or third rounds, I do badly on their technical interviews. Questions about multithreading, DFS, BFS. 

The other issue is job hopping. I'll have to put at least a year in, but even then, the job hopper label can stick, as I would have worked my last two jobs for just over a year.

If i could stick with my current job, brush up on my shit, and ace interviews at the bigger firms, that would be ideal. But there are no gaurentees in life.

TL;DR. Take 100k fully remote job doing C# work from a current 65k role, or wait for better opportunities?"

s2r7m3,1,2022-01-13,Does a master’s degree give any kind of advantage in the entry-level job search?,userforce,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/s2r7m3/does_a_masters_degree_give_any_kind_of_advantage/,"Hey all, I’m on track to graduate with a MS in CS from an accredited state program next fall (currently with a 4.0). 

I’m mid 30sish with a BS in film production and mass media (worked in the industry for a number of years before heading back to school for the CS MS). My only “tech” experience was working as a computer repair person (think Geek Squad) for a while about 15 years ago. I’ve also taught myself (through YouTube and some EE courses) how to do micro SMD repair. 

That’s it.  I have no professional experience as a programmer.  I know a bit of Java (from the early 00s), a decent amount of C++, Python, R, and assembly (for PIC32—which I really like). For my program, I’ve done a decent bit of coding: sorting and data structure algorithms (bubblesort, binary search trees, heaps, stacks, a manual implementation of linked list in Python and C++ (which was then used as the backbone for other projects, like the traveling salesman, etc.), and a manual implementation of an old programming language using C++ and Flex (big semester project)).  

I don’t use GitHub—in fact, I’ve been told by one professor explicitly not to use course projects or homework on GitHub, as they (the professor, department and school) would come after me for honor code violations, even after the fact (because they use a similar project every semester). That professor also mentioned to be careful about any other course materials for other classes, as those could be potential violations. That’s pretty disappointing, because the implementation of the programming language was very involved (spanned a semester), and it was 95% my own code (style, comments, etc.)—it ended up being something like 2500 lines, if I remember correctly.  However, since the instructor provided the ‘backbone’, apparently none of it can be considered my own or marketable. I’ve also done some graduate-level machine learning projects (computer vision (CNN) and time series HAR (CNN) using publicly available + self-generated datasets and ‘black box’ implementations).  I wouldn’t really call those projects ‘my code’, as I really just tweaked hyper-parameters and applied some domain knowledge towards making my manually generated datasets more robust to avoid model overtraining.  

I have no internships or graduate assistant experience. The extent of my programming knowledge and experience ends with the conclusion of my course work.  

My plan is to try to find an internship for this summer and hope it gives me just enough experience to find a job, but I’m worried about even finding and being accepted for that.  

I’m worried about my age being a big turn off (again, 30s) as an entry-level applicant.  

With learning conditions adapted to COVID, virtually (heh) none of my professors or instructors know me (other than the quality of work at the graduate level to maintain a 4.0), and I don’t really know any of my peers.  In other words, I have no one that could act as a reference for me, other than to regurgitate some surface-level information about my course grades.  Furthermore, I don’t even feel like I know any of these people (and vice versa) anywhere close to the level to ask them to be potential references.  

Do any of you have advice on how I should approach finding jobs? After perusing this sub, I feel like I’ve made an idiot decision spending the years I have working towards this MS at such an age (because of all the additional bachelors level courses I had to take just to apply for the MS program), with no contacts, marketable projects or intern experience.  

I’d really love to find a job making 65-90k+, so the pay, you know, actually makes the work, debt, and lost income during this period ‘worth it’ and not just a lateral move. Does a masters degree help me at all?"

My brother-in-law even put down a computer science degree that he dropped out of after the first semester (didn't mention that part though).Do you think there is benefit to exaggerating your achievements especially if everyone else seems to be doing it?

s2rad5,1,2022-01-13,[California] [High School Science] - Relatively new teacher looking to transition into academic advising/counseling,TchrThrowaway189,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/s2rad5/california_high_school_science_relatively_new/,"Hi r/Teachers. I'm using a throwaway because this is something I've been thinking about and planning, but I'm not too clear on the details yet and I don't want too many details to be attached to my main account and possibly reveal who I am. I guess I could add that I'm a part of LAUSD?

The main reason I'm posting here and asking is because I'm looking to continue working with students, but in a different capacity, and I have several questions related to that process. I hope anyone here with experience can maybe elaborate on some of my questions! I also plan on posting to r/schoolcounseling too!

I'm a newer teacher who's been teaching for less than 5 years. I want to provide some information I believe might be relevant to my specific situation, while keeping it not too identifying:

* I started out with a **District Intern Credential**.
   * This meant that I completed an ""intern preservice preparation"" and was participating in a ""Commission approved intern preparation program"".
   * I also finished my relevant CSETs and CBEST.
* Not sure how this is related, but I also received a **Certificate of Clearance** some time within the same year.
* Some amount of time later, which is what I have right now, I received a **Preliminary Single Subject Teaching Credential**. I want to make sure that I emphasize the word **Preliminary**. Below are some of the descriptions of this specific credential I have:
   * This credential may not be renewed. To qualify for the clear credential, the holder of this document must complete a Commission-approved Induction program including Verification of Completion by the program sponsor. 
   * Per Executive Order, the credential holder must complete the Commission-approved Teacher Performance Assessment (TPA) prior to issuance of the clear credential.

I understand both of those points above. The first point makes sense in that I am currently going through an *Induction program*, which I am currently in my first year of (out of two total years). Completing this Induction program, as well as finishing both cycles of my CalTPA (the second point above), will let me ""clear"" my credential. As far as I know, this is what will let me permanently and officially(?) become a teacher. I also understand that... I have to do this all within 5 years. That is as much as I know. 

I have a few questions about all that though! 

1. I've been teaching this whole time on the District Intern Credential, which eventually became the **Preliminary** Single Subject Teaching Credential. All of this was never meant to be permanent, correct? They were essentially... I suppose temporary ways for me to legally teach in the classroom while taking classes and doing classwork until I could become an official teacher, right? (These aren't ""questions"" but I'd like to confirm if I'm understanding correctly here.)
2. What happens if I don't finish the Induction program, and drop out halfway? What happens if I don't finish the CalTPA? I suppose answers I'm looking for include: what happens to my credentials I mentioned above, or my status as a teacher, or ability to teach in the classroom, or ability to work in a school?
3. I am considering transitioning to working in a different capacity, like say, academic advising or counseling. I understand that this requires a Master's degree as well as some form of a credential? I want to ask if this ""credential"" is different from the credentials I mentioned above, or the cleared one I'd receive from finishing the Induction program/CalTPA.
4. If I drop out of the Induction program/CalTPA, and depending on the answers to question #2, will I be unable to become a counselor? I suppose my question is, can I become a counselor with those &lt;5 years of actual teaching experience in the classroom with the **Preliminary** Single Subject Teaching Credential without having cleared that credential?
5. Will it somehow... look bad or show that I never cleared my **Preliminary** credential or something?

I'm sorry about all the vagueness. I'll do my best to elaborate if necessary. Thank you so much r/Teachers! This... has been a rough year, which is in part why I'm looking into this."

Before you wonder about my CV, I have gotten interviews and some job offers from almost all other FAANG (MANGA) companies, but due to my location and the work they do, Google would be optimal.

So all of this has left me wondering if there was any hiring blacklist in existance at such companies and if I should stop trying altogether, because at this point it feels like I'm making a fool of myself trying to get into a company that clearly does not want me there.

Oh, and explanations are vague AF.

Already established client: golden threads progress note that includes MSE followed by psychotherapy notes.  Not as heavily combed through by supervisor unless there's an audit going on.

Annually: reassessments, another dx/tx plan, or if the client was a transfer from another clinician gotta do the whole assessment, dx/tx crap all over again.

Other tasks: enter hours at end of each day, send out video links to each client before session, ensure correct session code is entered for insurance purposes, manage calendar/schedule"

I bailed out of one of my classes and failed 2 others in 2020. Didn't tell my parents. I failed all of my classes that following sumner. Didn't tell my parents. Got an internship and started classes again in the fall. Failed - Didnt tell my parents. They think I'm graduating this semester. I'm not even close. On top of that, somehow I'm still in a situation where I can possibly graduate this year regardless, but to do that I need $250 dollars in 3 days for the prerequisite to the capstone im taking and there's no way I can tell them I need that without them finding out.

I'm at a complete loss. I feel like telling them about me being depressed / suicidal, even before covid hit would make it sound like a cop-out. I could tell them any one of the sob stories about me standing on top of the parking garage or at the highway overpass trying to talk myself into it and it would just sound like an excuse, and who could blame them? Even typing it out right now it all feels like something thats just made up, a story to get me off the hook. If I told them about the periods of time where I would literally lie in bed for 30 hours what then? 

Do I tell them that the girl and family friend they thought I was dating and how she's dating another good friend of mine that they know and the impact that had on me, or do I keep it to myself because it has nothing to directly with my piss poor performance in school?

Do I tell them that the medicine I was taking gave me anxiety attacks, but I kept using it because it made those nights studying easier, even if many of them amounted to nothing?

I dont even know what Im saying anymore at this point - I just want everything to start over to before I screwed everything up. My window looks like an incredibly enticing leap but I could never bring myself to do it.

And the absolute worst part is how disappointed theyll be with me. I love them so dearly and I absolutely hate myself for what Im doing to them, knowing how much trust they put into me.

s2vzad,3,2022-01-13,Dropping out of master's at TUM,8991tech,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/s2vzad/dropping_out_of_masters_at_tum/,"Hi. I have recently started studying M.Sc in Informatics at the Technical University of Munich (right after finishing my bachelor's). I was quite happy that I got admitted (with an external scholarship of approximately 1000 EUR per month) and didn't think much about whether I wanted to study masters. But now I see that I don't want to study anymore and want to start working instead. The content of the courses is mostly theoretical, which I find boring. Also, the German education system, where your grade depends only on the final exam seems way too stressful to me. I don't have much work experience besides an internship in iOS development. I have finished my bachelor's (in CS) with honors at a university that has a high reputation in my homeland but not globally.

As the exams are getting closer I have noticed that it is very likely that I will fail several courses and possibly my masters will take longer than 2 years to finish. This made me consider dropping out before it gets too late and starting a career. I feel like studying is not what I want to do for the next 2-3 years. However, I know many people who would give anything to be in my position. What do you think I should do?

P.S: I want to pursue a career in mobile development (either after finishing my masters or after dropping out)"
s2wg0y,1,2022-01-13,What to Learn to become more Confident and Competent as a Programmer?,CobaltGecko9091,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/s2wg0y/what_to_learn_to_become_more_confident_and/,"Hi, I'm looking for some advice on what to learn to improve as a programmer in my particular situation. I feel like I am in a very awkward position. I have interned in a software development role and studied CS for 2 years now. I feel confident enough that many things feel trivial, but also many things feel so far out of my reach that I cannot even begin to think of how to approach them.

For example, for many people after learning how to program the next step might be to learn algorithms. Then to work with databases, etc. These are all topics I've been drilled into. What I cannot do is approach is an actual project. Make a maze solver with a GUI for BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, and A\*? No problem. Actually contribute to an open-source project? No chance.

I feel lost because it doesn't feel like an easy situation to solve. I would have thought my internship would have cleared these questions up, but working in one small section of code in a company for 3-4 months hasn't made me feel any more competent towards helping to develop on an actual project. If anything, it has made the process seem more unapproachable with how complicated it was to learn how even just a portion of a project works, and making meaningful contributions to that portion was even harder.

How do I learn how to work with existing software? How do you build software from the ground up? What types of projects should I actually be making for my resume? What skills should I be learning now that I have a solid foundation?

I'm wanting to search for materials on places like Udemy, Youtube, etc. but I'm not exactly sure what I should be learning to become more confident and more competent. Any direction or advice would be appreciated, thank you"
s2wmak,11,2022-01-13,[O levels] A really generic dilemma with really complicated circumstances,gonnafailolevels2021,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/s2wmak/o_levels_a_really_generic_dilemma_with_really/,"Just recieved my o level results and gotten results that were way below my expectations sadly (about 5 points off my target L1R5 mainly because of my frickin humanities). Initially I told myself that I would definitely be going onto JC no matter what as I expected myself to be able to get into a JC that I wouldn't mind being in. But now that the circumstances have shifted, these are the choices I have:

If I were to go to JC, I can only go to YIJC as it is pretty much the only school that is in reach in terms of distance and my L1R5 (MI and JPJC are way too far away for me, not saying YI is reachable either but its the closest if I can find a route there). In YIJC I would choose H2 Computing Math Chem and H1 Economics. I just found out YIJC offers H2 computing and am very interested in H2 Computing, so I wish to take it for A levels. However, looking at the past results for YIJC, it is kinda unsafe at an average of 69 RP. I said that as my interests lean towards IT/engineering, and my preferred courses would be CompSci or CompEng in NTU/NUS, which usually requires 80-85 RP, and realistically speaking, I have low chances of getting into as someone who is generally the ""average"" student, even if I work really hard. Yes, I might want to do something different after 2 years of thinking, but with around 69 RP I will have very few open doors for someone who wants to go to a local uni. My family are fine with me going to JC, but they are more supportive of me going to poly with this circumstance if I were to go to JC.

If I were to go to poly, I can get into probably 80% of the courses I want with my L1R4, and I would pick computer engineering in SP/TP, which boasts direct entry/course exemptions in CompSci/CompEng in unis, and also internships with companies like govtech. That is beneficial in quite a few ways as it brings me more exposure to computer engineering and computing in general, and that it literally gives me a diploma after grad. However my end goal is still to go to uni to get a degree, and in order to get into relevant courses, I will still need to get a gpa of over 3.7 for me to have multiple choices, which I might not be capable of maintaining such a high gpa for 3 entire years (I have no idea whether getting 3.7 is hard but i do know its relatively high). The modules seem fine and I do have interests in them now, but how about the future? I do not know whether I would have the same interests as I have now in the future.

So really in the end, its brings me to this really generic question, JC or Poly with my current circumstances? Any extra advice would be appreciated."

I'm a qualified lawyer (passed the Serbian bar exam). My experience: as a student worked for a couple NGV companies, legal intern for 2 years,  lawyer for 1 year, currently working as a legal counsel in global pharma company (10 months). My company is not offering relocation (they may support it if I have a good reason ex. if my boyfriend finds a job abroad). I have relatives in Switzerland.

Boyfriend has a degree in English language and literature. His experience: worked as a freelancer for an American company (3 years, content manager). Learned how to code and is currently working as a junior developer for a Serbian IT company.

We both speak only English.

We want to move to a first-world country for a higher quality of life.

If possible, we are willing to take 'detours' (ex. move somewhere with easier entry, then eventually move to one of the target destinations from there.)

Any advice is welcome."
s2xrx4,28,2022-01-13,"My manager got mad because I said I had a ""light workload""",doingmybestman,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/s2xrx4/my_manager_got_mad_because_i_said_i_had_a_light/,"I work as an intern for this big financial firm and started my job about two months back. When I started my manager, ""Daisy"", mentioned that she was having a hard time giving me tasks to do because she was so used to doing everything on her own. 

I'm usually given tasks to do here and there that take about maybe 30 min to an hour at a time but my main work was supposed to be on my big internship-long project. At this point, I have a month left at my job and finished the project weeks ago. Frankly, if I had wanted to I could have finished it within the first two weeks of my internship but I just wanted to buy more time for myself. So that left me with essentially nothing to do. From my project being done to my manager giving me nothing to work on, I was and have been doing nothing but hanging out and taking my occasional meetings and 1:1's. 

During most to all of my 1:1's, I would be asked ""how I was liking the internship?"" and ""what my work/workload was like?"" and I would say that it was going great (it's actually going really terrible but I can't say that lol) and that the workload was pretty light because I was ""finishing up my project"" (I finished a while ago I just say that to make it seem like I'm still doing something). It would also come up in conversations when others would ask for help I would say I have a good amount of bandwidth and would be happy to help. COME TO FIND OUT that one of the people I had a 1:1 with told my manager, Daisy, that I was going around saying I had a super light workload and was asking around for people to give me work (which is SO not true btw) but that PISSED Daisy off. It made her SO mad that she reached out to a woman I connected with through a 1:1, we'll call her Anne, and had mentioned to her that I had a lovely conversation with. Daisy reached out to Anne and asked to meet with her. 

Anne didn't know me very well being that we had only ever spoken once, but she had never spoken to my manager and so she was immediately thrown off when Daisy asked to chat. When they met Daisy started by asking Anne what she thought of me and Anne said that she immediately knew something was up so Anne gave a super positive review of me to which then Daisy said that working with me was like ""pulling teeth"" and that I had been going around saying I have nothing to do and am asking people for work and finally adding that if I asked Anne for work for her not to give me any and tell me to ask her. 

Anne being amazing reached out to me right after, told me everything that happened, and then gave me a bunch of stuff I could help her with because as she said, Daisy couldn't tell her what to do. I was ELATED when Anne asked me to help her because being an intern I wanted to gain skills and I wasn't doing anything. I of course loved not working but at minimum, I would prefer to not have a shit boss that tells people not to give me work/let me help them. According to Anne, it seems that the reason why Daisy was so mad that I told people I had a light workload was that it ""made her look bad"" so I guess if you're not overworking your employees you're a bad manager? 

I will forever be grateful to Anne for taking me under her wing and being so honest with me and have learned a valuable lesson: when you don't have a lot to do say nothing and just collect your checks.  There was even a point where Daisy passive-aggressively asked if I wanted to end my internship early because I was wrapping up my project HAHA NO I will be collecting every last check before my time ends. Looking forward to this internship being over and never having to work with Daisy ever again."

Working for Subaru in the past plus loads of freelance gigs as a director or videographer/photographer for local business commercials, small award winning short films, corporate events, weddings and more.

&amp;#x200B;

Treatment: at this current job I get treated like a elementary school kid and every task is constantly being micro-managed.   If I say something it's written off, a week later an employee who's been here longer says the same thing and the boss likes the idea.  ""Make sure you import the footage to premiere pro"" - no I was just going to let it sit on the SD card....what? lol   I've been told to come in at 11 at night to record extra segments for a show only for the boss to never show up and text me a 2am drunk saying never mind we'll do it tomorrow.  I bought small Christmas gifts for my 2 managers, and they bought the other employee's gifts but not me.   I attempted to move up the ladder in this job I've only been at for 9 months so far and instead my idea was given to another employee who's been here longer along with a raise.  I'll answer tech questions and the boss still asks someone else.  I'll give insight to how we should run YouTube and instead of listening they consult a YouTube expert who says all the same things I did and when they come to me to make the changes, I say ""we're already doing that""

&amp;#x200B;

Management:  let's sum it up like this.  the producer who was here when I got hired is quitting.  He has 20+ years' experience and he taught me so much.  He's leaving for multiple reasons and his replacement?  The owner's high school friend who has 0 experience in production or media.  can't even open an editing program b/c he doesn't know what it looks like.  so now I have to listen to a new producer who I also have to teach at the same time?  and he treats me like he's helping me and babying me through steps

I'm treated like I don't know how to do my job and like Im basically an intern.

I took this job because I thought it would get me out of my small town and while I have a ton of experience...its from a small town.  So I thought hey this is a good opportunity to build my resume and make good connections.  I realize now I'll never get those connections.  Its a small company. Very small.  10 people.   But I'm out.    Im tired of expecting to be available 24/7

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure what I'm doing yet.  Start my own business?  maybe.  but it also just seems like video production isnt wanted as much among small businesses and idk where else to start.  learn a new skill like coding?

&amp;#x200B;

Point is I'm going to work for myself.  but idk what to do.  Im quitting in February.  my physical and mental health is in the garbage and I cant wait to end it.  one more month."

Doesn’t really help that I feel like interview skills don’t necessarily translate to job skills, and am afraid of getting exposed as someone who doesn’t know much at these companies.

Current main skillset and experience include developing in Python and dabbling in 2-3 full stack/frontend projects, developed in Java on a basic level although that was quite rudimentary, and was mainly migration so I had a template for new stuff. I understand basic git well enough to develop and probably have minimal experience doing other full stack stuff (writing unit tests, brower testing, deployment)

I a woman with debilitating ADHD and functioning autism (I still call it Aspergers). Was diagnosed with ADHD (non hyperactive kind) at 16, and Autism at 24, I am 27 now. Since late 2017, after graduating college I struggled with health issues and depression. I haven't had a full time job only internships in Investment Banking and Real Estate Asset Management. Investment Banking was a passion of mine and I was en route to working at a top bank. However, when forced to study and prep for interviews or really learn the technicals I struggled and ended up getting an internship at a low end bank and struggled to get full time offers. If I just had the confidence and prepared I know I could have succeeded because I had so many final rounds and shots. I know I am hard on myself but the amount of perseverance and motivation I had at that time when I was interviewing was amazing when I look back at it. 

 I am smart, have a high level of intelligence and I went to a top school barely passing through my classes. However, when it comes to discipline, executive functioning I struggle. This manifested through not doing well on exams, not knowing how to study. 

My job history however, wasn't the best. I never really completed tasks, I was late to meetings. My internship gave me great reviews, but I know they were just being nice. From 2017 when I graduated college, till 2019 I was unemployed. Then I took a position randomly at a Software Company for ERP, my boss really thought I was smart and promoted me to developer. However I learned NOTHING and didn't have the discipline to learn things. He let me go last February 2021 due to ""pandemic"" but I know it was because I wasn't getting anything done.  I then took a full time job in June for a similar position, work place was toxic and I only lasted two weeks. 

NOW: 

My parents then tested their faith in me allowing me to be CFO of their company due to my prior financial knowledge. It allows me to work on my health issues and figure out what the heck I want to do in my life. However, their patience with me is dwindling, my mother says if I don't complete these things I will have to find a fulltime job elsewhere. I don't know how to do basic things like book keeping, what I have to file.. taxes, due dates, small details, organization. Our Annual financial reports were due December 31st, haven't even finished them, not even 1/4th done. 

My life is a complete chaotic mess. There is so much I want to do, and so much I need to do. I feel like I have no responsibilities and no accountability. My room is a mess, everything is a mess... it truly is debilitating. I just want to be an adult, not live at home, get stuff done. My younger sister is more ahead than me, and it embarrasses me. 

I did recently start seeing a new therapist and I do feel positive about that. Planners, I have, productivity systems, I am a productivity nerd. But none of them work. I just feel hopeless which is horrible because I have so much ambition, so many dreams, I know I am smart.. it just doesn't show in the normal ways society uses to measure intelligence (grades, success) 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR : I am a CFO and idk what the heck I am doing, I am overwhelmed and I am really struggling to complete my tasks and be organized along with maintain deadlines. I legit don't know what to do."

I'm a junior CS major at a Midwestern state school. I've always been academically talented, but I've never felt passionate about something like others around me. I feel like my family (extended included) has always put me on a pedestal since I'm the oldest of my generation (and have always excelled in school), and this causes me to feel pressured to know exactly what I want out of my life. I chose to major in CS because I got rejected from a different college for cybersecurity (I would have been miserable doing that anyway, but I'm just now learning to deal with rejection), and I'm not sure if I even want a career in tech. I enjoy the time I get to spend writing code, but as I've progressed through my major I've spent less and less time coding so I'm losing my motivation to continue (I will definitley finish my degree; I don't have any reason to stop this far in and some degree is better than no degree, right? :) ).

Recently, I got my first internship offer at an AWS premier partner as a Cloud Engineering Intern. I'll obtain the AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate certificate during this spring, and transition to developing (or designing, not really sure) internal tools during the summer. I was super excited to get the internship, until I started researching AWS Solutions Architect jobs and learn they focus on designing systems, not actually implementing them.

Now I'm not really sure what to do. I'm working on my anxiety and depression that were worsened by covid and addiction, but they still affect me heavily so I'm not really sure if I'm thinking clearly (hence why I'm asking for opinions).

Is this a bad internship to take if I want to get into more of a software engineering/development (SE/SD) position in the future? Should I take this intenship and see how I like this style of work?

Also, I hear that I should be wary of any position ""IT"" related (i.e. IT intern, networking intern, etc.) if I want to become a SE, so does this position classify as one?"

Would appreciate any and all advice.

First a little background,I've had an IT position for the past 4 years ( 2.5 years as an intern, 1.5 years as FT IT engineer ) doing mostly desktop support, server management, and other IT-related helpdesk tasks for a software company. I graduated with my bachelor's in comp sci in June of 2021, with a fairly low GPA (2.7).

I kind of feel like I'm spinning my wheels at my current job and don't really know where to go from here. Whether that may be continuing on the IT path, or starting fresh with programming.

Any advice from people here on what path to continue on? I am definitely over desktop support but probably wouldn't mind getting more involved with network engineering or more advanced IT work.

I also am interested in programming and would like to work an actual development job for once.My programming skills aren't the best(I struggle with some easy leetcode questions), however, but I've been doing more leetcode lately to beef them up. Is it too late for me to get into development?

Unfortunately, I don't have any mentors/friends in these fields to ask for advice or guidance."

I want to change my university, but it's complicated.  

I am currently studying CS at the KIT university in southern Germany. Among the german CS universities it's among the top 3. I used to really like my university until COVID hit. Eversince it's been a nightmare because they're almost completely closed, which other unis were too, I know, but the problem with the KIT is that the city has nothing to offer aside from the uni. Karlsruhe (the town where the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology is located) is, and will forever be one of my least favourite cities. I'm not gonna go into details, point is: My social life here sucks and i don't see it getting better. Furthermore I'd really like to experience something different. Germany gets boring fast.

I'd really like to transfer to the US or UK for my masters, but I don't know if that's possible. Before covid i was a decent student, but during the first 2 lockdowns I just barely passed and even had to redo certain exams. I don't really know, but isn't that already a nail in the coffin? I had a lot of private problems during covid but I at least tried to make it somewhat bearable, by engaging myself at uni to help create covid-safe learning spaces (which didnt work lol), but i have an attestation for my social engagement, so that's something I guess.  


I learned to cope with the pandemic by getting really into coding, and while asking for help on reddit, a friendly software engineer from ""stripe"", the online payment company, scheduled a call with me to help me out. He then said, I should send him my project once it's done and maybe we can work out an internship. I got done this week and will send him my project in a few days (after handling the obvious bugs). 

Sorry for the rant, all I want to ask is:  
\-Can I just completely forget about transferring to a good uni in the UK/US, if half my marks are pretty bad or do unis respect a performance drop during covid? How do I find out how good I have to be? Does it help if I have friends at Imperial College or LSE?

\-If this stripe guy gives me an offer to work, should I take it or should I rather focus on uni? Do unis like it when you already did internships?

\-Do you think it makes a difference which german university I have a major from, if I want to work in the UK/US anyway?

thank you for reading, would be happy if you can help me out :)"

Undergrad: Double Major in CS and DS  
Masters: Business Analytics  
Experience:

* Two Internships as a Data Engineer (4 months each).
   * I learned how to build database schemas from an ETL process to production.
   * Became familiar with Azure Synapse and Data bricks.

**Context about my situation:**   
I was recently hired as the first ""Data Scientist"" at a quickly growing startup (Mortgage firm entering Canada backed by a fortune 500). My first task is to move their on-premises database to a cloud-based data architecture. Our department is low on funding and I'm currently the only person working on this project. (This is subjected to change very soon as the company is exceeding expectations). I want to build the best architecture that I can given my experience (as a fresh grad, I know I still have a lot to learn, but I really want to prove to the company and myself that I can do this).

After building this data architecture I'm hoping to move into more analytical role where I would like to leverage data to make business decisions.

**The Current Data Model:** As of right now, the database is built in PowerBI using many DAX and PowerQuery statements. (I am shocked that this is working). Most of the data is populated out of salesforce.

**Objective and Advice:** Although I have experience in Azure Synapse and Databricks, I am open to learning any data architecture platform. I hear many good things about snowflake and I'm wondering if the company should pursue this tool. Before I start anything, I am focused on learning how the current database was built and I think I want to reverse engineer the process and build it from the ground up.

I have a lot of questions:

* What should I do first?
* Data Lake vs Data Warehouse?
* Which platform should I be using? (Snowflake/Azure/AWS/GCP)
* For those experienced in the field, what is one thing you wish you had known sooner?
   * What platform is the best in your opinion?

**TLDR:** I am a fresh grad tasked to build cloud data architecture, looking for any and all advice.  

Excited to hear your input :)"

I'm not quite sure if I messed up already or not. So, basically I interviewed for a low-level tech internship, and learned that it was for couple months longer than I thought. I wasn't expecting it and I asked if I could do a shorter term first and then extend to see how it goes and if I like it. However, they said it's easier to terminate earlier than extending afterwards, which makes sense.

The thing  is I  feel like I have given my university and boss the wrong impression like I'm uninterested or disrespectful, even though I really am grateful for the position and I know longer term is lot better professionally, but the longer term just makes me feel scared that I may get stuck (not sure why I feel that way)? I'm quite excited and interested for the offer, especially since I got it last minute after several months of trying and quite underqualified. How do I get this wrong impression away? I kind of wish I never told it in  the first place."

So even tho i am very young, I have experienced so many things. I lived in USA almost for a year, I have done a lot of jobs(worked in hotel,pizza store,amusement park,waterpark, real estate,blockchain company even in farm and more).

It’s crucial for me because if they hire me, I’ll get hired as “head of marketing” in the age of 23 which is super amazing thing you can achieve(at least for me). Another important thing is, I am having my internship in Europe as non-European and I don’t wanna go back to my country. It means starting over for me.

I have put a lot of work, days and nights to get this position and still not sure if they’re gonna want to work with me.

Has anyone had this kind of situation before? What can you advice me?

There are multiple fire drills and everything is due yesterday. And I’ve come to realize that the industry isn’t something I’m passionate about. Whereas at my old job, I enjoyed the work I did because the industry was enjoyable (entertainment). 

Today, my coworker gave me a call saying they were about to begin interviews but wanted to connect with me and see if I would consider coming back. It would be a Finance Manager position and an obviously higher pay. To be honest, I wouldn’t be going back for comfort since my coworkers and managers have always given me opportunities to learn, to be challenged and grow and be exposed to new things. The pay would help and my mental health would not suffer anymore. I didn’t leave on bad terms with them and in fact, I’ve been consulting for them as well since I have a great relationship.

Question is, should I take that offer? I’m considering it because:
1) My mental health is taking a toll
2) I don’t enjoy the work I do/the job is not what I expected"

Later in Nov-Dec I got several intern offers and decided upon Meta for Summer 22. However, Meta requires student to return to university to be eligible for internship, so if I want a Meta offer my early grad plan is out of the window.

Now given the circumstances I would ideally love Amazon to shift me to 2023 New Grad batch, so that I can collect competing offers and have a better negotiating hand.

My questions are:

1. Is Amazon flexible to this kind of changes? If so who do I talk to, I cant find any recruiter contact in my correspondence till now?
2. Meta vs Amazon 4 months earlier, whats your take?
3. If I choose to stick to Meta and decide to ghost Amazon interview mail, will it have negative impact on my future chances with Amazon.

* Company growing in general -&gt; more projects to do
* Increasing seniority -&gt; part of more high-level meetings
* Increasing experience -&gt; people give you more projects/ask you for more help
* More aware of team/company goals -&gt; see more opportunities to contribute; also, more sense of personal responsibility

However, from what I remember from my internship in university, I was actually less busy as time went on. There were other factors that played a role in this:

* Increasing seniority -&gt; less need to prove myself
* Increasing experience -&gt; more knowledge of what projects are worth doing and what aren't
* Team growing larger -&gt; projects can be split between multiple people

I thus started wondering - what other experiences have other people had? Do engineers generally get busier or less busy over time, or is it constantly changing? What factors other play a part in changing your level of busyness?

Would love to hear everyone's thoughts!"

Soon to be new grad here. I have accepted an offer from a company that uses .NET and React primarily. Most of my internship experience was in React, so I was excited about that and didn't think twice about .NET. 

However, one of my family members who has been a software engineer for 20 years doesn't like .NET. In his own words: “all of my professional experience has led me to believe this: there are .NET people, and there is everyone else. So if you’re worried about being set in a singular direction at the start of your career, the best course of action is to have solid work experience in java or python”. 

I’ve spent a little time building a small app in .NET from a tutorial, but from what I can tell it just feels like normal coding. Maybe there is some excessively opinionated boilerplate code and many commands to remember, but it didn't feel too foreign to me. I can’t imagine that working with .NET doesn't build transferable skills for working with Java, Python, Go, etc. 

1. If I start my career with .NET, are there any reasons I would find it harder to jump to another language/framework later in my career?
2. Will I only be recruited for .NET roles after working with it? 
3. Will companies not value my .NET experience for roles with other languages?"

I have a side hustle that might or might not suceed it has a frontend and backend.  I have professional experiences with front-end but never backend.

\- Knowing how to normalize to 3NF/BCNF (atleast I think so)

\- Starting to learn how to do ""database migrations"" for version control.

\- Building a pipeline for uat, prod, dev my API/databases

\- Basic queries. However, I require help on reddit  / trouble ''moving data around' (eg; hey we have x data in 1 table, break these into 2 tables, or vice verssa).

My experience: I went to an average university, had 1 SWE internship in a small company, some small side projects on Github, and I started applying late in November 2021.

Leetcode stat:

* 41 Easy
* 76 Medium
* 8 Hard
* Did every problem in the Blind 75 and it helps a ton in solidifying concepts and strat for me.

Job app (total of 68)

* 35 rejections without OA and phone screen
* 10 rejections after OA
* 4 rejections after a phone screen
* 5 rejections after second+ round
* 11 no response
* 3 offers (a witch company, a small but decent company, a unicorn startup)

Honestly, I had always thought that if I couldn't land a gig between Sep-Dec I would be done for, but no, in reality, those are the time for Big Tech like Manga. January-Feb is actually another good time since most companies would get their latest headcounts and budget and hire like crazy (as long as you are not picky).

TLDR; when it comes to Leetcoding, Quality &gt; Quantity (and make sure you understand every problem in blind 75). And when it comes to applying, don't stress too much at the beginning and bank everything on one app, try to face every app with constant effort and no expectation, and use previous failures/rejections to help revise/adjust your strategy. And don't think it is the end of the world if you are falling behind in applying for jobs, there's always more to come. Last but not least, use a good resume template instead of flashy ones.

s3oh3y,1,2022-01-14,Should I quit my job?,surprise98,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/s3oh3y/should_i_quit_my_job/,"I (23M) am thinking of quitting my job.

So I've been on this job for not much over a year. My plan was after finishing my studies just focus on working on the field I studied. But once the year past by I just decided to study again.

I found something where I could just study at home and going to class only to do exams (my boss knows that and he's fine with me not coming one day to assist an exam).

The thing is I thought I could manage my full time job with my studies but in reality when I get home I'm just so tired that I'm not really in the mood of studying...

My job is like 1 hour from my house so every day it's a 2 hours drive + 8 hours of shift + 1 hour of meal break. So that would make like 11 hours.

I'm also kinda gaining weight since my job requires me to sit down on a chair and be in front of a computer and that's making me doing less exercise. In over a year I've gained like 10kg (like 22 pounds). I'm out of shape.

The thing is, I recently got a raise and my superior is trying to convince the boss to raise it even more.

My coworkers are amazing, I have a lot of fun with them and this is my first job on this field so I'm kinda afraid of quitting the job before having 2 years of experience (I don't know if somewhere else companies also ask for at least 2 years of experience on the same field you're applying to).

Quitting the job would give me enough time to go to class and be able to ask professors everything I have doubts on that take me a lot of time of investigation on the net, be able to exercise again and give me enough time to spend with my gf.

But on the other hand I really wanna save up some money to be able to leave my house (I have a good relationship with my parents, I just want to leave my house so they can move back to their home town, they're stuck here until I find something by myself and I feel bad about it) and the fact that I can buy things by myself without having to ask my parents is really great for both me and my parents.

But to be honest, with my current salary I won't be able to afford to rent a house, pay the bills and food hence my parents are really insisting me to find a new job.

And to be honest sooner or later I will have to quit this job since I will have to do internships of what I'm studying.

What should I do?

Honestly, I don't think I would have made it this far if I went to a prestigious uni. I'll detail my personal reasons for enjoying my ""low-ranked"" college experience, and then a couple tips and paths to ""high-paying careers"" I've seen colleagues achieve.

&amp;#x200B;

1. An easygoing culture and simpler academics gives you more time to focus on ECs (for me it was research, MCAT studying, etc). I was able to graduate a year early and develop my CV a lot faster because I was able to skip class and keep high grades.
2. Being a big fish in a small pond lets you distinguish yourself early on - early publications and winning intramural competitions let me get a few important internships (1 at a well-known school, 1 @ a big tech company) and I got my dream job working for, then contracting, for the Army. I even got a bunch of OR experience and got to practice my sutures/ligatures on pigs lmao. If you are interested in Fulbrights, Rhodes, or Goldwaters then you have a better shot since you have to compete with people from your college.
3. The environment is less toxic. Idk how I'd feel attending a school with gunners, in undergrad I avoided even premeds. If this sub is any indication, a significant chunk of people at t20s are engaged in perpetual academic dick-measuring contests. I was able to meet a lot of people who were easy going and make great memories. Greek life is less toxic (IMHO) and easier to participate in and balance w academics.

&amp;#x200B;

6 Figure Career Examples:

**CS Careers (CS major):**

Year 1: Start up your github, work with a professor to make projects which have publishable elements. I had a friend who made databases and dashboards for public health research. Easily accomplished in 1-1.5 semesters. Work a unpaid/below market internship (same friend leveraged the work into a devops internship with our state's PUH department).

Year 2: Start studying data structures/algorithms hard, start grinding leetcode, buff up your github projects but make sure they are being utilized by someone somewhere willing to write an LoR (same friend did bioinformatics stuff and wrote a few simple algorithms, got published again), if your school has a startup center for students which awards money, then create a ""company"". Apply for contracts with the US Gov under the auspices of a professor you worked with (its very easy to do, pm me for more info), and immediately fulfill a few of them. My friend and I did this, got 3 10-25k contracts, paid our university and our PI for using lab equipment, fulfilled in about 9 months. Doesn't make much money at the end of the day but is actually not very high effort and looks good. Then, apply for a better CS internship (he got a decent amazon one in a nontarget location).

Year 3: Find a niche CS role you are good at, keep grinding leetcode, stay in touch with your interviewers, buff up your github a few more times with your ""high level"" shit, try to get an internship at a FAANG in a better location (or any other high paying prestigious internship). He got an internship @ netflix in a better location

Year 4: Network, grind ass off for interviews w leetcode and studying data structures AGAIN. Apply to several dozen positions, avoid death by burnout in the horrible interview process, profit. A month or so ago he got a job at Amazon, 210k total comp.

I have friends who just did leetcode and a few internships (tougher to get prestigious internships without significant CS ECs if you're from a nontarget institution), they started between 90 and 140k TC.

**Law (any major):**

Literally just focus on maxing your GPA, doing mock trial ECs, choose an easy major/courses based on usefulness for LSAT. Score 170+ . Friend who did this will attend Duke for law. If you attend a T14 you have decent odds at NY placement and institutional supported clerkships. Anything lower than t20 and you won't make as much and probably won't place in NY. Edit: reflecting u/HappyCava 's comment: Still take some rigorous courses, my friend was in marketing but took some finance courses on the side. Also, T14 or bust if you wanna work in NY. Keep in mind law is hella oversaturated so if you're gunning for a top firm you gotta be at a top school. I'd still say its easier to dedicate time to the LSAT and maintaining a high GPA/good ECs and awards if you're from a college like mine vs a place where you gotta fight tooth and nail just to keep a 3.5+.

**Consulting (Math/Stats, engineering, CS, PUH majors, Business majors):**

Major in applied math/engineering/CS. Network with people in your fraternity/use linkedin to find alums and try to meet with a partner for ""coffee"". Your first internship is probably going to be botique. Friend easily got a Deloitte internship offer for tech consulting (EE major). Don't turn it down (since you aren't from an ivy), just take it. He got a full time offer from Deloitte later on, idk the total compensation but is def 6figs. He wanted to do S&amp;O consulting not tech, but it is difficult to move between roles so I think he is going to get an MBA from a prestigious area after working for a few years.

I anecdotally know 2 people with PUH majors getting boutique consulting offers. MBB (especially McKinsey) snatches PUH majors, and it isn't extremely hard to do an internship there. Friend at a low ranked texas uni did 1 year public health internship, then a McKinsey internship, then got an offer. I'm a PUH major and got a consulting offer from a Big 4 but starting TC was lower than my Ivy-educated counterparts with limited room for upwards mobility.

If you want to do S&amp;O consulting or work w supply chain you gotta be a business major period.

TC 110-160k

**Accounting (Accounting major):**

If you major in accounting you can get a Big 4 audit internship or work for a risk assurance practice. Gotta get your CPA eventually and you probably won't ever transition to consulting. Accounting is pretty safe in general though, easy to get internships and a decent salary is down the line. Idk tho, balance sheets seem boring to me.

**Med School (Any major):**

Learn from r/mcat and r/premed and get a 3.7+ and 515+. Do research and get a clinical job. If you take your prereqs seriously its easy to manage and keep a social life. It is all about managing your time wisely though.

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully this post reassures you guys, college is a means to an end (a high-paying stable career and an enjoyable 4 years), there are many paths to this and most are possible through ""low tier"" institutions. Pm if y'all have questions.

Edit; Hope this gains enough visibility to calm the latest generation of neurotic highschoolers lmfao."

How do I use them right?,LuggageMan,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/s3qnxy/i_have_6_months_before_i_graduate_how_do_i_use/,"My college (Electrical and Computer Engineering degree) sucks (to put it lightly) and I was stuck trying to self-study early on but I was overwhelmed with many different things I wanted to learn.  I wanted to at least finish something equivalent to a undergrad Computer Engineering degree.

Over the years, started many courses and books but only managed to finish a few due to lack of discipline and direction.  Depression and anxiety were a contributing factor too.

This helped me get some surface-level knowledge of many things but that's not good enough.

I am still not sure what area of CS I want to pursue.  I had only one software engineering internship for around 5 months in a startup.

Currently working on my graduation project as well so that takes up a good portion of my time.

I have around 6 months give or take before graduation and I want to figure out how to use them right.  A lot of people said I should focus on the theoretical subjects (which I have been trying to do) but I feel like I've neglected the practical aspect for a while and that would also be more motivating.

I started programming when I was 9 and I always loved CS (and still do) so I didn't think I'd end up a failure.  Guess not everyone can be the Zucc."

s3rodg,4,2022-01-14,Which of these 2 job offers should I go with?,WaffleDood,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/s3rodg/which_of_these_2_job_offers_should_i_go_with/,"Hey all,

I am a Mechanical Engineering senior graduating this May. I'm currently in a dilemma deciding between 2 job offers. I've already secured a job offer (signed contract) as a software engineer (web development) with an american bank. The other job offer is from an ex-professor who I used to work closely with.

He's currently the deputy head at a national research institute &amp; took over last June. He's set up &amp; is driving new initiatives to ramp up the ""technological innovation"" of their model factory. These initiatives will cut across different fields such as AI, ML, data analytics, AR/VR &amp; UI/UX as he wants to introduce these verticals into the different business operations the model factory has.

He stated that his team maintains a healthy &amp; open working environment &amp; are always receptive to new ideas. Having worked with him before, he is easy-going &amp; quite open-minded but can be very firm on certain things that he wants done his way. The compensation at this research institute will not be as much as the position at the american bank but he repeatedly stressed that I will get the chance to dabble in the different fields before I choose which one I wish to specialize in.

On a personal level, these are all areas I'm truly excited about &amp; hope to be a part of. But some details about the job are still hazy &amp; I will get a chance to clear this up when I met my ex-professor &amp; his supervisor in out 1st interview next week.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'd like to seek the opinion &amp; advice of fellow engineers here on which job offer I should consider? And if anyone has worked at a national research institute, would you be able to share your experience there? I'm afraid that the work there will be a slog &amp; the management will be very hierarchical &amp; rigid &amp; that I won't actually get a chance to hop around the different fields of AI, ML, data analytics, AR/VR &amp; UI/UX. I'm just afraid I get baited in &amp; I don't get to do anything that was mentioned.

I personally feel that I'm lagging behind my peers as I spread myself pretty thin between AI/ML, data analytics, web development &amp; robotics during my college years to find a field I'm truly passionate about &amp; my friends have had many personal projects &amp; internships in web development under their belt

Is it okay that I recently found out my passion in software engineering? I didn't feel like my past 4 years has been put to waste, but my professor kept saying it's a ""waste to throw all those 4 years of foundational knowledge"" away. I never felt this way before we met to chat about this job offer because I've read &amp; seen people's stories on YouTube &amp; blogs how they decided their major in college wasn't what they wanted to do &amp; made the switch to another field/career

&amp;#x200B;

A little about myself, I'm quite certain I don't want to pursue a career in the mechanical design field of engineering &amp; would want to delve deeper into software engineering, whether it be robotics software engineering, web development or data analytics or AI/ML. I've completed 2 internships, 1 in data analytics, another in web development &amp; did a graduate-level module in deep reinforcement learning (&amp; got an A yay!)

I also have these following career aspirations:

1. A move to USA/Canada
2. Work in future/advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Web Development, UI/UX or Robotics
3. I want to work in a role that has high compensation

&amp;#x200B;

My parents suggested sticking with the american bank &amp; shelving the position at the research institute for the future, where perhaps things are more defined &amp; proper roles/jobs have been set up

What questions should I ask during next week's interview? Here's some I had, because my professor only kept going on about how exciting this opportunity will be

1. What will my initial role be?
2. Am I guaranteed &amp; allowed moves between the different fields?
3. What are the opportunities for mentorship?

s3sqfb,2,2022-01-14,Idk how much longer I can do this,PastelSprite,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/s3sqfb/idk_how_much_longer_i_can_do_this/,"Idk if it’s even needed here, but TW for talk of eating disorders and suicidal ideation.

&amp;nbsp;

I feel like I’m losing my mind, losing touch with reality, and becoming a person I don’t want to be. I’m so, so lonely. But I’m so depressed that I don’t have the energy to talk to people. And, the pandemic is a thing. I’m tired, but I can’t sleep. I’m hungry, starving even; I haven’t eaten in 2 weeks, but I can’t eat. 

&amp;nbsp;

Every time I get incredibly lonely, I go online. Lately, even in places where I didn’t see it before, people are arguing **all the time.** I’m a highly sensitive person and curious, so I read but then I’m just more sad.
Everyone is angry, all the time. I’m lonely, but I don’t want to talk to these people. But I do. I’m angry too. But I also don’t. I don’t have the energy, I don’t have the time, I don’t want to waste my time and deplete my energy further into the negative.

&amp;nbsp;

I just feel so alone, and I feel like the pandemic has added this additional layer of helplessness. I have a crap immune system and get sick easily. I worked with kids for a while and was sick constantly, and sometimes for months at a time. I was alone much of my life and unsure what vaccines I was given as a child, but also suspect that I never really built up the immunity that a lot of people do. Plus, I have a congenital degenerative disease and suspected sleep apnea due to said disease, so that probably doesn’t help.

&amp;bnsp;

I had long covid. I got sick early on when it was nearly impossible to see doctors. I had just gone back to college after almost a decade hiatus, just surviving. I’m completely traumatized by the whole thing. I realized this recently when I noticed how my body reacts when I talk about covid or recite my own experience. I never want to feel that way again. I thought I’d never be able to even go outside again or have air hit my face. When I tell people about this, they don’t even believe me. But it happened, and I’m totally scarred by it so much that I don’t want to ever experience it again. I felt so helpless. I literally thought I was going to die and it was so painful; yes, I am suicidal, but I don’t want to die a painful death(if I did, I’d be dead by now). Most people I know are not safe on top of everything. So I’m just stuck in my home. I have a SO, but the pandemic has dulled our relationship and depressed us both. He is often distracted by YouTube. 

&amp;nbsp;


I was alone in a room for nearly 18 years of my life. I wasn’t allowed out, because my grandma was very scared of what could happen to me because I’m female. She’d had bad experiences and didn’t want me to experience the same. That, and I lived with my mom who was extremely neglectful and unavailable. So I was always alone. I spent all that time alone in my room, going back and forth to the bathroom and sometimes the kitchen(I’ve had an eating disorder most of my life). I was often exhausted by family and spent most of my time exercising. I remember always feeling this longing ache in my chest like something was missing. At 18, I made friends and realized what was missing. Long tangent short, that was short lived and I found out a lot of my friends weren’t my friends/didn’t actually want to be friends. 

&amp;nbsp;

I went through years in an abusive situation, and finally went back to college in 2020, totally determined. This is my last opportunity that I’m giving myself. This is it. I’m 30. I joined clubs, even acquired my own, I got straight A’s, I talked to everyone in hopes that that could help me with accountability. I was stressed, but having a great time overall, until a month or so in when I heard about covid. I was the last to leave my classes, only due to quarantine. I’d hoped the virus wouldn’t come here, but it did and here we are. I never imagined it would get so bad.

&amp;nbsp;

Last year, my cat(my ESA) passed away unexpectedly right after my grandma passed away. One day she was fine, the next she just couldn’t breathe, and a day later she was gone. I relapsed so badly into my ED that I lost about 20-25lbs and went down to about a 17 bmi. I still miss my cat, and don’t know how to really live without her. She was my best friend. And now I feel all alone. She was the only living entity that was unconditionally there for me and loved me and I never once had to question it. She’d literally hug me and put her paw in my hand or on my chest when we went to sleep. I feel dead inside without her. And no one seems to understand. She was truly my best friend. She followed me everywhere, was just always there. After my grandma died, I didn’t tell anyone for a while and she was my only comfort. She’d always run up to me when I’d cry. I miss her so much. I’m still in shock that she died so young and was even sick. It’s almost been a year and I still haven’t gone through her things. 

&amp;nbsp;

I have a long distance friend that I talk to often, but I feel a little like maybe I’ve offended or annoyed her recently somehow. I know she’s extremely busy, but I kind of hate myself(understatement) so I can’t help but wonder if I did something also. I can think of about 100 stupid things I could’ve said or done. My family is also heavily politicized and only one person speaks to me. The rest think I’m their enemy for no actual reason besides my own choices(like wearing a mask and not going to giant gatherings). All of this, politics and the pandemic, made my tiny world nearly non-existent. And here I am, only about a decade after I escaped my room, back in a room. I genuinely don’t think I can do this. I knew I needed social interaction and a life to survive college, and that’s not something that’s really possible anymore. Not for me.

&amp;nbsp;


I did contact my doctor recently for an increased dosage for my antidepressants. Covid had been surging here, I live in a city, so I requested telemedicine. They scheduled me for in person and wouldn’t allow me to schedule telemed because suddenly they require every other visit to be in person. I got sick around the 4th, and I’m still a little sick and waiting to get a covid test, so I canceled the appointment. I don’t want to spread it if I have it, and I don’t want to get it if I don’t. I know this sounds paranoid, but as I said, I am truly traumatized by what I went through in 2020. I greatly dislike a lot of people, and I wouldn’t wish that on anyone, ever. I felt so helpless. I just don’t know why with something as vital as mental health medication, they have to make it so hard.. it’s hard enough to get the courage to even make that appointment. It’s absolutely unnecessary to go into the office just to confirm that I am feeling more depressed. 

&amp;nbsp;


I start classes again soon and I genuinely don’t know how I’m going to do this. I have no motivation. I have an extra curricular competition scheduled for spring break with possibility of getting an internship for a dream job. And I’m literally running on empty. I haven’t been eating and my anxiety won’t allow me to. I was attempting recovery, followed terrible non-professional advice because I couldn’t afford a therapist, and gained a ton of weight and then relapsed into bulimia. That was bound to happen from what I did, but I trusted random people on the internet. I’m so angry with myself. I was doing ok with recovery when I was going slower. I did this to myself and that’s the worst feeling.

&amp;nbsp;

I don’t know why I’m posting this really. I write too much and no one reads anyway. And I don’t know if I’ll have any energy to respond. I guess I just have no one right now and I don’t know where else to turn. I feel like any day now I’m going to have a nervous breakdown. I have major recurrent depression, and I have an “episode” every few years where I become extremely suicidal. It’s definitely been sped up after all this craziness. I have only stayed alive for a select few people because I don’t want to be alive in this world, and my little world gets smaller every day. I don’t know how I’m going to hold myself together. I have so much to do before classes start, already took off last semester, though I took an extra curricular course that kind of drained my remaining energy. I wish I could just have someone to hold me, I know that sounds so dumb but I just feel so alone and void of human connection. As I said, I have a SO but he’s not really “here” mentally. He’s pretty checked out. My irritability probably doesn’t help honestly. I find myself being crabbier than usual and I worry that it is my fault. I just don’t know what to do. I feel desperate to get out of my head."
s3t8p8,1,2022-01-14,"How do I avoid ""falling behind"" in the job market?",TWON-1776,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/s3t8p8/how_do_i_avoid_falling_behind_in_the_job_market/,"**TLDR: I'm graduating in 2022, have been rejected from every single graduate scheme that I applied for. In my mind, this will make me even less employable since I will now not have any chance to build any experience. What should someone in this position do?**

&amp;#x200B;

Hello everyone,

I am around 6 months from graduating from a fairly well regarded university with a degree in economics. While I do not wish to speak prematurely, based on achieved grades, I should graduate with a very respectable grade, not top marks, but beyond what is required by most jobs in the field of finance.

During my time at university, I did apply to various internships, yet was rejected from every one of them. With that in mind, I have undertaken a number of measures to try and differentiate myself in my employability while also making up for lacking the experience that I would have gained in those internships.

Being close to graduation, I have been applying to a wide range of financial institutions via their graduate schemes. 

However, once again, I have either not heard back from any of them, or received a rejection letter. 

This has led me to become very concerned about the medium and long term effects of not getting a job once I graduate. I am not under the illusion that I will graduate on the 27th and be in the office on the 28th, but I was certainly hoping to have some sort of offer lined up for myself by this stage.

I am not dismayed or beaten down (yet) as much as I am worried about the prospects of falling into a death cycle of: no job --&gt; no experience --&gt; no job offer --&gt; no job.

I have spoken to a few people and they have suggested getting a job that is not finance/economics related, however I fail to see how this would meaningfully boost chances of getting a job in one of these businesses since I still would have no experience in that world.

While I have no issue being in a different kind of job in the short term, I feel as if that will just end up leading to being in that job for the long term.

As I say, I know that the world is not as simple as my parents/grandparents seem to think it is where jobs/firms throw themselves at you as soon as you graduate, but I am very concerned at the idea of falling behind (arguably even more than I already am given the lack of experience already) and having ever decreasing chances of getting a job in this field.

Thank you all for taking the time to read this. I tried to not make it a sob-post since that is honestly not my intention at all."
s3uesg,0,2022-01-14,Getting a referral from an employee... will that make up for my COMPLETE lack of ECs?,ArianaVentiButera,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/s3uesg/getting_a_referral_from_an_employee_will_that/,"Ok. I'm a high school senior. I have good grades, definitely not the best, but top 5% so it's decent. I have an average SAT of 1410. HOWEVER, I have done no ECs at all. Absolutely none. I have done absolutely no sort of activity outside of school or any hobby or talent. Besides working at Target for like, 5 months after the end of my junior year. I know it doesn't mean anything. I took 4 APs from freshman to junior and I failed all the exams. I'm taking 2 APs right now, and I haven't taken the exam yet OFC. I have no programming experience as of right now, but I started CS50.

I wanted to try getting a referral for ANY company for a freshman internship. Luckily, I met this college freshman on Reddit here, and they are an incoming Google Step intern! We have known each other for months, and he's really sort of mentored me and given me advice about entering Computer Science.

I wanted to take the CS50 course over the next few months, which my friend personally thought was a very good class for me to take. I plan on doing projects AFTER CS50 during the summer. My friend said that if I impressed him with projects and showed him that I'm competent not only in CS but in soft skills as well, that he would give me a referral, since he's gonna be an intern at Google.

I wanted to ask him to consider referring me in the future, because he's very good at programming. He said that he easily passed the coding questions for Google, and that the recruiter was impressed by him. He was also accepted by Microsoft, received an OA from Amazon, AND recruiters from Facebook and Apple have even reached out to him. I looked at his high school resume, and he has incredible ECs that showcase his leadership skills. Also, we have known each other for quite a while now, so I feel like he would know me more and have more of a reason to refer me since we know each other  even sorta personally.

BUT the thing is, it's freaking Google. Of course it's gonna be competitive. I know that I am really pushing my luck here applying for Google and other MAANG/big tech companies. But I just wanted to know... IF this person refers me, would this be able to make me competitive?"
s3uq9h,1038,2022-01-14,I think a lot of people don't realize just how easily opportunities come to you at elite schools.,_Dark_Forest,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/s3uq9h/i_think_a_lot_of_people_dont_realize_just_how/,"I recently made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/rzw1r9/ive_decided_to_empirically_test_if_school/) post about testing if school name matters when applying for internships. (still working on those applications)


One thing that's become very clear though, is how easy it  is for people at CMU to get internships /jobs versus someone at Pitt. And I have friends at other top universities with similar stories.

* Big tech companies recruit directly from campus here. 

* Professors at elite schools have a LOT of connections in industry and a lot of weight. I've had 3 professors offer to make a phone call and get me an internship this summer.

* I know at least 5 people starting to build their own startups (2 of them already have VC funding). Those people are of course recruiting other students to work with /for them.

* Speaking of VCs, they also love big name schools because it provides better PR for them or something.

* The alumni network is pretty absurd. There's currently a few different spreadsheets circulating with alumni email /phone numbers for people to reach out to at almost all major companies in any field.


So yeah, being at an elite school does have a lot of perks."

s3vchr,0,2022-01-14,Advice for phone screens and moving on to final rounds?,pro_juggler,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/s3vchr/advice_for_phone_screens_and_moving_on_to_final/,"I’m a sophomore who still hasn’t gotten any offers for the summer yet. I’ve gotten about 5-10 hirevue-like virtual interviews, about 10-15 OAs, and about 5-10 phones screens from my ~145 total applications sent out. Out of my phone screens, I’ve been rejected by all but one, and that one only had one round so I’m just waiting for a final decision.

With the phone screens, I feel like I give pretty decent responses to all the stuff they ask, I stutter occasionally(like saying “uh” sometime) but that’s just how I normally talk. I try to ask one or two questions at the end everytime too. Is there anything I could do better to improve my chances of getting past these phone screens? It’s just annoying to talk to someone and believe in the moment I’m a really good fit for the role, but get a rejection email a few days after. After I get the rejection email, I think myself, “I just a pretty meaningful conversation about my qualifications and how I’d be a decent fit for this role, so what could they possibly have not liked about me?” 

I have CS-related intern experience at a smaller company from last summer and I got that offer in late March last year and CS related student organization experience too.

Does anyone have any advice for how they handle phone screens and how they receive more final round invitations? 

TLDR: How do you advance to next round after first phone screen?"

I’m fortunate to have both of these options, but I’m struggling to know which one to choose.

Internship:
It’s a great opportunity, local, good pay for location. The only issue I really have with it is, is it necessary to start working 40 hr weeks throughout the entire summer right now when I’ll be doing that for the rest of my life? Should I enjoy the study abroad experience which I probably won’t ever get again and just do some classes to stay ahead and overall enjoy some free time?

In regards to the study abroad, it’s far less studying. It’s one ethics class for the entire program and more about abroad. But with COVID, not sure how much of a full experience I can get or if one at all depending on the situation here in the US and in Denmark.


I’d just like some advice about the situation if y’all have any. Thank you in advance."

1. I am only now learning ReactJS and Native, having also learned some HTML and CSS, and a bit of JS on my own. Something that we don't seem to have s single class for. We learn pretty advanced things, but without knowing how to apply it with APIs

2. When they ask for prior work experience... if this is my first time working, obviously I have nothing. Right now the only thing I'm trying squeeze out is my game I put into the app store and play store through my single employee ""company"". 

3. It feels like no matter what I put time into learning, there always going to be a skillset which a company demands that I don't have. I've been thinking of just adding it to my resume and cramp it with some udemy courses if I get a technical.

I honestly feel very strong in coding and syntax with the languages I know, and I put a whole game on to the App Store (its called 797 if you wanna check it out), but still feel underqualified for some reason and expect a lot of rejections."

Unfortunately, I haven't gotten close to any of my professors except one, and my big class sizes guarantee that most of them don't remember me.  I have two professors that I want to ask in mind, so that's not a problem.  The thing is that I'm honestly not likely to get the internship. Most of the selected people listed on their website (they do a presentation at the end) are in their senior year and have had volunteer/job experience + done more courses in their field.  And I don't have any job/volunteer/internship experiences to write about in the application.

If I ask for the LORs and then don't get the internship, I would have ""wasted"" them.  I'd feel hesitant to ask these professors for another LOR later on, and they're basically the only ones I can count on right now.  

Has anyone else been in this situation?"

I am now working as an Reporting&amp;Analytics Intern at a big US company in Germany. 

Since my chef was absent for most of the time I didn't get any experience and wanted to switch to Data Analytics internship at pwc, but they offered me another one. 

It's going to be about german ERP Accounting System, where I am going to do some SQL and PowerBI work. They said it's only for 3 months which is rather unusual here in Germany and looks like they don't have anyone else for the busy season. 

I'm not sure if it would be more beneficial for my CV than to just stay where I am right now and trying to find something more maybe secure than this offer. 

If someone has experience with pwc tech consulting positions, please share with me."

I have an interview next week for a ""Real Estate Data Entry &amp; Analysis"" position. I'm desperate for work and it lets me work from home so short of it turning out to be some sort of sales job I'll do whatever I can to get it. 

I don't have a lot going for me. I have a degree in finance but thats about it. no internships, no job experience outside some retail jobs I worked.

part of the job description says 

&gt;Develop a basic understanding of real estate financial calculations to include but not limited to net operating income, net cash flow, debt service coverage ratio, loan to value, interest calculation, debt yield, occupancy, percentage rent, per square foot/unit, and capitalization rates

So Ive been going through these terms trying to get a basic understanding of them since Ive not seen some of them since college (Finished summer 2020). 

I'm not sure what else I can do to prepare for the interview, or what questions to prepare for in advance. I'm leaving basically nothing to chance if I can. I'm making sure to be dressed appropriately and have a clean backdrop and solid mic for the zoom interview. Truthfully though I'm pretty clueless on what else I can do to prepare."
s40b7u,23,2022-01-14,My Experience As A Hollywood Assistant,Hefty_Comparison_980,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/s40b7u/my_experience_as_a_hollywood_assistant/,"Throwaway for privacy and safety.

For those that are out of the loop, IATSE – the union that represents film and tv workers – nearly went on strike this year to protest poor pay and grueling work schedules (among many other justified grievances). While the film and tv communities largely unified behind their crews, I couldn’t help but think about a group that was left out of the conversation: Hollywood assistants. These individuals are not represented by any union and usually don't end up on set, yet they are prolific in the industry; most representation, production, and post-production companies rely heavily on assistants, and they suffer immensely as a result. I thought I’d share my experience, as it feels increasingly relevant and unethical.

In the mid-2010s, I completed my undergraduate program in Los Angeles and was able to secure a paid internship, which covered my first few months of post-graduate rent and expenses. However, after a half-year, my contract was not renewed and I had to look for other work.

I secured an interview with a multi-million dollar film and tv marketing company as an assistant and runner. The position required a college degree (preferably in the same field), specialized knowledge of multiple editing software (Premiere, Final Cut, and AVID), and a functioning car. So, how did they value those very specific asks? By paying minimum wage. But I was young, broke, desperate for work, and bought into the tired ""pay your dues"" mentality. During my interview, the owners told me about all the perks: the early access to feature films and shows, the family-like atmosphere, and the potential for upward mobility. The pros seemed to outweigh the cons and so I signed on, eager to start a new chapter *in the industry*. I was sorely mistaken. The company would go on to steal a year of my life, leaving a wake of anxiety and trashed relationships.

The expectations of assistants were ridiculous and unreasonable, worsened by the fact that we were ludicrously understaffed (aka, cheap). As I said, the starting pay was minimum wage, with overtime after 8 hours and double time after 12. This wouldn’t have been terrible if overtime wasn’t compulsory. I regularly worked days in excess of 10-12 hours, often leaving work at 1 or 2 o’clock in the morning (having arrived between 10 AM ad 12 PM those days). Assistants were expected to be on-call during the weekends and because we didn’t have enough hands, that sometimes meant working multiple weekends a month. And if you worked the whole weekend? Tough shit. We had to show up for work that Monday. My personal record for most days worked in succession was 21.

Assistants were responsible for taking the company’s lunch/dinner orders. By “the company,” I mean whoever the owners decided should be on the order, which 95% of the time did not include any of the assistants. So we’d take orders for 25+ people, place it, pick it up (we wouldn’t tip the restaurants though; management said it was too expensive), drive it back, then pass it out. Oh, and you’d better hope to God that nothing was missing or you’d be getting an earful. So, obviously, we were just supposed to get our own lunch after getting everyone else’s right? Wrong. The assistant didn’t actually get lunch breaks; it was an unspoken rule that you’d have to work throughout the day, stealing a bite here or there between various tasks. To add further insult to injury, we were expected to pad our timecards with an additional half-hour each day to make it seem we took our legally required reprieve.

All of that was just the tip of the iceberg. We were talked down to by default, screamed at for the slightest inconvenience, and baited with empty promises and nonexistent cash prizes. When I gave my two weeks, everyone acted dumbfounded. They asked if there was anything they could do to get me to stay, but the damage was done at that point. I left and have never gone back.

And the worst part of all this is it isn’t unique. It is rampant throughout the Los Angeles film and TV industries. To this day, I have friends that continue to be exploited and mistreated by Hollywood management. Production companies, agencies, rental houses, studios… they all do it. I’ve worked at multiple companies and the story is always the same. Forcing assistants to grovel for food. Mandatory overtime. Unpaid overtime. Limited holidays. Discouraging sick days. Lack of PTO. ell, I even knew of an extremely prolific reality TV executive that was so lazy that instead of printing documents at her own home, she’d make her assistant print them, then drive across the city and hand-deliver them to her house at the top of each day.

The saddest part of it is that many of the people who are exploiting their assistants were simultaneously posting in solidarity with IATSE. None of the assholes actually want any change. Fuck Hollywood. Stand with assistants."

These are the issues: 
1) my current role was initially “intern developer” and was meant to be a 3 month period but I ended up staying on for 10 months. It’s a startup so I’m one of only 3 software developers and we each have to manage our own systems. On my resume I put my job title as Software Developer not intern developer.

2) In University I did some vacation work / student internships at various companies. I did 2 weeks at a particular company. On my CV, I put Jun-Jul 2019. I just didn’t want to put dates in my CV because it looks bad. Now I’m the background check I’m putting the exact dates. Would this make me look like a liar in my CV ? 

3) Similar to (2), I worked for Three weeks at the end of Nov 2019 - Dec 2019. Then did another week in Jan 2020. On my CV I put Nov 2019-Jan 2020. If I now give the exact dates will it make me look bad ?

But in the meantime I want to look towards any position I can work at, I have been looking and applying to hundreds of jobs all entry levels but I never hear back. I'm not too sure what specific positions I should be applying for given my experience but I mainly for for Admin Assistant Positions, Recruiting, HR too many to name.

I wanted some insight on what you would do if you where me? I am mainly applying on LinkedIn and some on job websites but I don't know what I am doing wrong..

Thank you for reading this I appreciate all the responses I will get!"

The cherry on top is I recently found out I'm pregnant and due at the end of this Summer. From what I've read this is just enough time to start to getting into the swing of things at a new company, and considering I won't be eligible for maternity leave, I'm assuming once baby is here, they'll fire me and that will be that. All of this resulting in another six month stint with not a lot of experience gained and then.. won't putting that on my resume just make it look worse?

s42mmo,198,2022-01-14,Struggling Heavily Socially at my MBA,lickerticker2,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/s42mmo/struggling_heavily_socially_at_my_mba/,"I am an international student from India at one of the M7s. While things have been looking promising in the recruiting and academic front, I have been really struggling to make friends and be part of the social scene. I grew up in a very traditional Indian family where I only focused on engineering academics, and I do not have good social skills compared to my peers. My education system through high school and college reinforced this, and my role as an engineer was not one where I developed strong soft skills. My culture is also one where I was told by parents and elders never to talk back, and my education system prioritized rote memorization over creativity. ""Fun"" was never something I really did except secretly under helicopter tiger parents, and I never grew up playing a sport or having a cool hobby.

My hard stats were VERY GOOD, and I had strong leadership which probably helped my M7 admission. I am very nerdy, and my hobbies include Nintendo Switch video games, Japanese anime, movies, watching theatre productions, and talking about tech and politics. Back in India, I had a lot of fellow nerdy friends in STEM , and I have an engineering background. A main motivation for me is to increase my social skills at my MBA. 

However, while I have been trying to put myself out there and getting to know people, it has been hard to connect with people. Both the culture shock of how different American culture is to Indian culture, and adapting to the MBA environment. Most people are much more extroverted, and socially smooth. I find myself either talking too little or too much, and when most people talk about things like racing marathons or skiing or DJing, I have little to relate to. I never took a ""shot"" of alcohol before my MBA in fact, I only drank alcohol very mildly in corporate functions. My MBA is diverse, but I feel the ""cool kids"" are mainly white people (I am not meaning this in a negative way), but I am not super acclimated to American culture outside of watching the Office and Friends. 

I have never gotten invited to any MBA trips, and very few people showed up to an Indian cooking session I hosted in my apartment. People have said they think I am very nice, but probably don't view me as a ""fun"" one to be around. I have heard other people describe me as well meaning but socially awkward with poor fashion sense. I have tried playing tennis or doing improv or other things, but it seems all of my peers are much more socially developed than me. I like to go on walks and hikes though, but I still feel really out of place with the popular people. I have a thick Indian accent too, which I have heard a few (not a lot) of people mock me for, although several other Indian internationals usually have the accent as well and seem to be doing ok socially I guess their parents were less strict. And while I want to better myself, and have been doing so, I am still too socially far behind my peers for them to want to accept me as a friend it seems. 

Even when I try tennis or skiing, every one else is so talented since they have been doing that sport since they were kids and I feel too far behind, and I felt the others on my trip got a bit frustrated at how ""new"" I was to every activity. I have such incredible imposter syndrome: I don't doubt my IQ skills, but my peers have such strong IQ in addition to EQ, and can do things like crazy hip hop dancing or painting that I never the opportunity to learn growing up. 

The other international students are very hardcore ravers at big music festivals like Coachella, and I don't fit in well with them. It seems the cool, popular kids are ones who are physically fit, attractive, socially suave, and have a ""popular"" hobby like playing an instrument or a sport, and I am very far from all of those things. Things are going well in getting an internship and my classes, and people are cordial to me (a lot of people asked me to help tutor them in finance), but I don't want to leave an MBA without having made actual friends that I do fun non-academic and non-work things with. 

Any advice would be helpful on how I can have a meaningful social life at my MBA despite my current deficiencies."
s42voa,8,2022-01-14,"I think I'm in a weird situation, can someone help me to figure out what to do?",MaxReed06,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/s42voa/i_think_im_in_a_weird_situation_can_someone_help/,"Hi everyone,

first of all, I read the wiki already. I already knew most of the information related to my problem but still I can't figure out what really applies to me and what I should really do. I might just be dumb tbh.

So, my situation is as follows:

I'm an EU citizen, italian to be precise, and I'm studying in an Hochschule in Germany. I am currently in my 7th semester, I'll hopefully graduate during the summer semester and I'm planning to start a master degree in the same university. I'm working as SHK at the university for roughly 170€/month for three months every semester. At the same time I'm having now my mandatory internship in a company that pays me 800€/month. My steuerklasse is 6 but at the same time 1. Someone messed up with that between uni and company and I'm trying to get it fixed since I don't want to pay too much taxes for that relatively small amount of money I get.

What concerns me the most, though, is the health insurance. I have...none. I basically have only the EHIC and I was told it was enough as long as I didn't get a job that was going to pay me more than 450€. I found out last month that the EHIC is practically useless since I had to pay an Hausarzt for a Krankenbescheinigung and I didn't get the money back. 

Now, the problem is that the company will definitely get rid off of me after the end of the internship, so, I would be back to just earning coins from the university, as long as my professor will need me, plus the monthly 500€ my father send me for food and rent. Ah btw...I'll turn 30 in a few months.

It doesn't make sense to me to pay for an health insurance if I have no money to pay for it and as I said I will not have a job (except the one at the university) after the end of the internship. Before you ask, no my father can't send me more than that.

It would be nice if I could get some opinions on my situation. Let me know what you think.

Thank you"

s43eat,5,2022-01-14,Worst Interview Experience,GamerFelix,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/s43eat/worst_interview_experience/,"TL;DR: Never completely trust or follow an interviewer if you get a gut feeling something is off. This is an experience that happened 3 years ago but I thought it would be nice to share especially for those starting out. 

As I am starting to read about people having bad experiences during interviews, I thought I would share my worst experience so those who are just starting out and don’t know what the process looks like can learn from my bad experience.

I had my very first CS interview (ever) and it happened to be with Amazon after passing the three preliminary rounds. After grinding Leetcode and reading a bunch of CS interview books, I felt very confident and ready to tackle the problem thrown at me. 

On the day of the interview, my interviewer and I introduced ourselves to each other and then we began the coding problem. The problem I received was a dynamic programming graph problem (which was tough for me at the time as I had not yet taken Algorithms/learned DP). I mentioned this to my interviewer during my introduction, and when it came to the problem, they asked me to just give them a brute force solution. I then began to talk through what I planned to implement and then began writing code. Once I started writing code, my interviewer not only stopped me in the middle multiple times to ask questions, but also began writing code FOR me if I stopped typing for more than 5 seconds. I found this awfully weird since I expected the interviewer to wait till I finished and then ask me questions. However, since this was my first interview experience, I went with it. I ended up finishing the problem and giving the correct run time, but it obviously was not the fastest solution since I was not familiar with DP (he said my solution was fine but DP would’ve been better). However, I didn’t think this would affect my performance since I know that they give problems like Two Sum to many people so they probably don’t require interns to know DP. After answering some behavioral questions, my interviewer seemed happy with my performance so I felt confident about how the interview went. 

I had interviewed on a Friday evening so I knew I would have to wait till the following week for a response so I didn’t stress about it. On the following Monday at 7am in the morning, I received a rejection email from Amazon. This means that the interview most likely did not go well in the interviewer’s eyes as Amazon didn’t even take one full business day to look over my feedback. I was absolutely devastated as I had solved such a tough problem and my interviewer seemed happy with the performance. But now, sometimes I wonder if it was because they had started typing my code for me while I was talking through my solution rather than waiting for me type myself. I was so upset with myself for not following my gut feeling that something was off, but now I always make sure that I don’t give the interviewer a chance to take over like they did."

I got the FAANG one and decided to go with that so I had accepted it, but since I was in the middle of interviewing with the other non-FAANG company I thought I’ll just finish interviewing with them for the practice and if they give me an offer which I thought they wouldn’t, I would just decline.
Anyway, they do end up giving me the offer so I decline it and I thank my recruiter for her time and tell her that at this time, I had decided to go with another internship offer because I felt like at that moment that it aligned more closely with my goals (lol) but that I greatly enjoyed talking to the other people on the team and would love to keep in touch. 
She emails back and asks me if I could tell her which company I’d be interning at instead and what my primary factors where and that it would help her recruiting process.
So I actually did go ahead and email back the FAANG company name and now I am kinda thinking maybe I shouldn’t have done that. At the time I felt weird sharing the name but I didn’t wanna ghost her because I don’t wanna blacklist myself from that company just in case and I again told her I’d love to stay in touch for future opportunities. Anyway she didn’t say anything after that.

I am very clueless if what I did was something unethical. Did I ruin my chances of getting interviews from that non-FAANG company in the future??"

Currently I am pursuing a Data Analytics Certificate offered by coursera in addition to school with an expected completion date of end of February. This course ends with a capstone project which I can add on my resume. I know the job search is expected to be hard but I didn't expect so many no's. It seems like a lot of analyst roles also hire CS majors so I think it's hard to compete with them. What I'm wondering is take a 5th year and potentially grind out a CS minor or just graduate on time while doing what I'm doing and keep on cold applying. The fear of entering the real world has slowly crept in and honestly I'm terrified of not getting a job out of college. Any advice?

Pros:

* I want to work in tech companies in my future career
* higher return rate(?)

Cons:

* not sure what project I will be working on. I heard some people say sometimes interns would only do trivia stuff and couldn't learn much
* not sure which team I would be working on (bad cultures etc)

Overall both companies don't have good ratings on blind or glassdoor, but both pay well. I plan to graduate fall 2022 and do grad school. If I could get a return offer from Amazon at least I could have something to do before grad school starts. The only reason I am hesitating now is that I had a really good experience interviewing with that finance company. The interviewer was super nice and seemed very knowledgeable. Even though I may not be on his team, we had a meeting after I got the offer and he showed me a past internship project. It was an individual full-stack project and seemed very intense, but a good opportunity to learn new technology. 

Any advice is appreciated."

- Work there until I get my green card

I think what worries me most is that the H1B is still a lottery. As I understand it, I could do everything right and still lose by getting rejected 3 years in a row. If that happens, are there any options left?

**Background**  
ME graduating Apr 2022Good grades  
From Washington State, currently at BYU (Utah)  
Lots of outdoor hobbies: Hiking, climbing, skiing, mineral collecting/prospecting  
Career Interests: Natural Resources (**Minerals and Mining, Water Resources, Agriculture?**)

**Problem**  
I did engineering, like many, because it was natural (math, tinkerer, etc.). However, around the beginning of my Junior year, **I realized that the details of mechanical engineering bore me, and I didn't want to follow the path** that most of my classmates seem content with which generally seems to be accepting a job with a major aerospace, defense, or oil&amp;gas firm. I like engineering concepts and applying the things I've learned to solve problems but I like looking at things more big picture. I would hate, for example, to sit at a desk doing FEA on a bolt or trying to calculate the difference in performance with this bearing or that. So **I'm trying to find out about other options that I'm not aware of or haven't considered yet. I'm looking for something that aligns with my interests, has high earning potential, and excellent work-life balance (flexibility).**

As stated above I'm interested in mining and natural resources. I don't know if I would want to necessarily work at a mine, however, because I don't want to be tied down to living by whatever mine I happen to get a job at. I'd sure like to visit mines though, so maybe something tangentially related to the business... . My capstone project right now has to do with drinking water treatment in the developing world which I'd love to work with as well. I also had an internship at a robotics startup where the goal was automated harvest. I think tech is cool but in the end, whatever I do, I'd rather be in some essential business rather than general consumer goods, entertainment, etc.

**My dream is to be an entrepreneur** in any of these fields. I am spending time over at the business school to learn about this, but I don't know if I should try to do something before I have much industry experience.

**Things I have considered**  
Medicine - not interested, unfortunately  
Law - can't see myself as a lawyer and I think patent law would get too boring  
Grad School - I thought about a MS in Geology (Environmental emphasis). The professors like me and have interesting work, but I can't see it as a necessary step in progressing me towards any goal at the moment.  
Finding another startup to work for - This seems like the most interesting option so far, however, I don't know how keen I am on living in California.  
Engineering/Technical Sales - Seems interesting but I don't think of myself as a salesman type.  
Computer Science - My brother in law likes his job at Amazon, and I've talked to some ex-MEs who flipped who like it and are making $$$. I'm dipping my toes into CS but I don't know if I'll like sitting at the screen staring at code all the time. Apparently, some do.

**What else ya got?**"
s4dwmf,5,2022-01-15,What to Learn to improve Confidence and Competence as a Programmer?,CobaltGecko9091,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/s4dwmf/what_to_learn_to_improve_confidence_and/," 

Hi, I'm looking for some advice on what to learn to improve as a programmer in my particular situation. I feel like I am in a very awkward position. I have interned in a software development role and studied CS for 2 years now. I feel confident enough that many things feel trivial, but also many things feel so far out of my reach that I cannot even begin to think of how to approach them.

For example, for many people after learning how to program the next step might be to learn algorithms. Then to work with databases, etc. These are all topics I've been drilled into. What I cannot do is approach is an actual project. Make a maze solver with a GUI for BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, and A\*? No problem. Actually contribute to an open-source project? No chance.

I feel lost because it doesn't feel like an easy situation to solve. I would have thought my internship would have cleared these questions up, but working in one small section of code in a company for 3-4 months hasn't made me feel any more competent towards helping to develop on an actual project. If anything, it has made the process seem more unapproachable with how complicated it was to learn how even just a portion of a project works, and making meaningful contributions to that portion was even harder.

How do I learn how to work with existing software? How do you build software from the ground up? What types of projects should I actually be making for my resume? What skills should I be learning now that I have a solid foundation?

I'm wanting to search for materials on places like Udemy, Youtube, etc. but I'm not exactly sure what I should be learning to become more confident and more competent. Any direction or advice would be appreciated, thank you"

I am 24 and I have been through a lot (not as much as some people, but a lot) and I am feeling very discouraged. I was diagnosed with depression at 12, but I always tried to remain optimistic, sort of like ""Okay, we got through that, we can get through anything"" but lately it seems like I have run out of gas, I can't keep up the act. All I want to do is sleep, so I don't eat and so I don't have to think (read the book After Dark by Haruki Murakami, there is a girl who just sleeps and I want to be like her). I always thought ""It is going to get better"" but now I always feel like I can never do the right thing, I have been trying to work on myself, but no matter what at the end of the day I am some how getting yelled at or feeling inadequate.  Despite being depressed, I used to day dream a lot about the future, about falling in love, having me dream home, getting my dream job, going back to school, starting a family and all sorts of stuff. Now I can't dream of anything, I see no future at all, like it crumbled to a little pile of sand and blow away and I can't rebuild it. I have reached a new level where I am stuck. Do much of a coward to live, to much of a coward to die, so all I want is sleep. I just want to sleep all day and stay sleeping and have no one bother me ever again, but that is no way to live life, so then I feel so guilty about it. I had a little bit of hope left, until today when I didn't get the publishing company internship I applied for. It really was my last bit of ""future"" I was holding on to. I am tired of people telling me to just get over it, like I can control being depressed. 

So, how do I find purpose in my life again? and please don't tell me to go for a walk or read a book, there are certain things I have heard over and over."

First of all, thanks to everyone in this subreddit because all the success stories were a huge confidence booster and I believe I wouldn't have made it without your contribution, guys!

The first step was the OA1, only coding. There were 2 LC problems, the first one was pretty straightforward greedy problem, LC Easy I would say, and the second one was a LC Medium string manipulation problem. I got the first one from the first try, and for the second problem, initially I only got 6/10 tests because of Time Limit Exceeded, but in the end I optimized it so I got full score on the OA1.

Next day I receive the OA2, fortunately before I started it, I read some posts from this subreddit, and to my surprise, I found out that the Leadership Principles are extremely important in order to pass the OA2 and all the subsequent interviews, and now I can confirm it, you should definitely brush up on all the leadership principles, because an answer that would contradict one of the LPs could be a dealbreaker for them.

Two weeks passed and I receive an email saying that we're moving forward and there is only the final interview left. This is where things get interesting :P Apparently there was only one time slot available for the interview, and I only had 5 days to prepare. So for the strategy that I approached, well, nothing special. Just grinding LC problems, but I kind of have a background in competitive programming so I was way more confident on my coding skills than my communication/LP skills, considering english is not my native language and I don't really practice it. That's why I decided to focus more on LP and think of any potential questions and prepare answers for them in advance, because I can confirm it's almost impossible to pass the LP part without preparing some answers beforehand. It's literally unreal to improvise in these kind of situations, so I suggest you prepare at least 1 story for each LP.

5 days passed and here I am, having the final interview in 1 hour and the hassle was indescribable :D Usually I'm a really chill person and can keep my calm in stressful situations, but this was something different, palms are sweaty, knees are weak, arms are heavy, never experienced something like this before and I think it was because I wanted it so bad but was realising that I can't do anything to improve the situation. Now that it's over, I can say that overall the final interview is not that hard, definitely doable on a cold mind, the problem is that when you're there, it just comes down to a battle between you and your emotions and feelings, and that's just awful, it made the whole thing sooo much harder.

When it was all finished, I actually thought that my final round was a complete flop, even though I guess I did very good for the coding part, I just knew I have to think about edge cases and the best time/space complexity and that's what I did. The problems were a bit tricky, like all the probs could be solved by pure brute implementation that you could do in O(N\^2) or worse, but there existed math solutions that would solve the probs in O(N) or O(1), and probably they were looking for them. So yeah, like 70% it was logic/math optimization and only 30% implementation skills. The interviewer didn't even add anything, just kept saying words like, ""very good"", ""perfect"". But then came the second part of the interview, and this was the big flop I was talking about earlier. I answered the leadership principles so poorly, I could see it on the face of the interviewer that he was not really impressed by those answers, and he tried to help me, literally indicating that my story is kind of too generic and I should focus more specifically on the LP, but I was so disappointed of myself that I couldn't even remember the stories that I prepared earlier.

So, when it all ended, my estimation was something like 70% chance that I will get rejected, all because I knew LP were so important for Amazon and I failed them so hard (at least I thought I failed them, it was not like I was just saying pure bullshit to answer the LP or wasn't saying anything at all, I answered them but the answers were poor in my opinion and could have been done much much better).

After a few days, I receive an email from Amazon saying they would like to have a brief call with me in order to give me a final update on my application. Now this confused me a lot because it would be really cruel to call someone just to say he was rejected, instead of just saying that in the email, but on the other hand, knowing that my LP answers were not the best and that Amazon insist so much on LP, they could still weed me out.

In the end, they called me to say I got the offer, and as a small feedback, indeed they said my LP answers were not the best and there's definitely room for improvement, but the coding part was almost flawless and I guess that's why they decided to move forward, despite of my LP fails. Or idk, maybe the LP part wasn't that bad at all, I just know I could have done it much better.

So, to sum up, guys, for anyone that is stressed, we're all getting through this and the stress is probably inevitable, I just want to let you know that it's all about persevering through and you should definitely not underestimate any interview even if it seems easy, never say things like ""whatever, I'm just going to YOLO it"" because consistency and perseverance is the key.

My position is in huge shortage and full-time remote was always taken for granted and standard even when I was an intern 9 years ago. 

The job that I got wanted me to relocate to a certain EU country, which I thought it was going to be cool, experience something new, after all, I could always come back home and work from home if I don't like it. 

I checked my employment contract before signing and it clearly states, with these exact words:

""Employee can work from our \[CITY\] office but is free to work from any location he or she desires.""

Eventually, I ended up not liking the country I moved to (especially when the new wave hit), but my manager told me that I could only be remote if I stay in the same country I moved to and not anywhere else, which is weird because it never states that anywhere in my job offer or contract and half of my team are not in that country too. 

I thought about leaving cuz I could always get a new job in my field, but I really like the company and the team is super, it's just that the country I moved to ended up being far worse than I thought. 

So any advice what shall I do?"
s4jpvw,3,2022-01-15,Advice on becoming a quant/ Is this realistic?,4yo2zk6,quant,https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/s4jpvw/advice_on_becoming_a_quant_is_this_realistic/,"For some background, I’m 23, graduated with a BEng Mechanical Engineering in May (GPA 3.38/4.2, (2.1)). And am due to begin a one-year MSc in Financial Economics at the beginning of February. 

My goal is to start my first “big boy,” job as a quant in January 2023 (hopefully finding a job before graduating to avoid any hanging around). For reference, I will be focusing my job search on London and Amsterdam. I am internationally flexible but am based in Europe and only speak English, so these cities are most realistic.

Luckily, I’ve completed modules in most mathematical areas quants are required to be familiar with as part of my engineering undergraduate (Stochastic Calculus, Stats &amp; probability, Linear Algebra, etc.). These “pure maths,” modules tended to be my favourites throughout university and were some of my strongest.

In terms of work experience, I’ve held many part-time and seasonal jobs over the last four or five years. However, the only “relevant,” experience I have at a financial institution is a two-week online assurance summer internship at one of the big 4. I was initially supposed to spend 12 weeks in the office, however, this was not possible due to government restrictions. While having a reputable name on my resume shows some merit, it’s unfortunate it did not translate into any real hands-on experience due to the circumstances. Even still, the work wouldn’t have been very relevant to quant anyway. 

One area I will have to work on is coding. I have some experience with C++, MatLab, and R, however wouldn’t consider myself proficient in any. Earning a certification such as “Python for Data Science IBM edX” has been recommended to me to begin learning the coding skills required for the job. I am keen to begin this soon (likely Monday or sometime next week). Does anyone have experience with this course? Can anyone recommend a certification they believe to be more applicable? 

In terms of networking, should I begin now? Or should I wait until I know how to code first? (sorry if that’s a stupid question). Does anyone have networking tips specific to quant roles? Also, has anyone had positive experiences with any recruiters for these roles in London/Amsterdam? 

Aside from this, is there anything else I should do over the next year to bring myself closer to my goal? I have found this reading list [https://www.fancyquantnation.com/books](https://www.fancyquantnation.com/books) and these interview question books [https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rlp2h/iama\_wall\_street\_quant\_amaa/c471itv/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rlp2h/iama_wall_street_quant_amaa/c471itv/) \- can anyone else recommend any more resources/skills/actions? 

Thanks for your time in reading this, am open to talking with anyone with any interest/experience in the field. Thanks again!"

And is it stupid to draw the line when they changed the contract to graphic design contractor on what I will do for them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just started ""intern"" recently, having graduated without an intern experience (had to made do with a project work for that)

The company, I will just call it ""lXT"" here, as I was told has only 2 other full-time, the boss and the support staff (not design staff). As a intern, I was requested to work on design stuff and also their website which was not setup at all.

That was before I signed anything on contract as the boss is very busy and  I decided to have the boss or a ""superior"" signed the contract before I signed it. (To be safe) At first, the contract is a pretty boilerplate intern contract, except for one bit: no CPF (amount offered are on the lower end of the average intern rate). Later that night as I found out, no CPF is ok for those still in school i.e. poly and other schools. So since I haven't signed anything just yet, so I communicated something to that effect as a warning it might not have been legal for me as a graduate.

Next day, the direct supervisor informed me that due to some situation with them being a ""start-up"" and in a risky-ish sector, they would attempt to rectify it by converting me to contractor and a bit of raise as self CPF contribution bits (I has since signed it to that effect, so some details are obfuscated to reduce ident for myself and the company) , with a later view to convert me. (Pretty standard stuff)

As a result, from the change I informed them that I will only deal with the graphic design side of stuff and will not help them with the web design (of which I had a low fidelity mockup only) anymore

So my question : is that this situation is sus as a design intern for not having any one else to learn from? And is it stupid to draw the line when they changed the contract to graphic design contractor on what I will do for them to protect my self."

I have never really made posts on Reddit so I'm hoping for some leniency in my post formatting and abilities, but given this will be a very exciting time for me, I am seeking all of the input that I can get. I apologize for the length in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:** 

This Tuesday I begin my ST internship and I am very excited! I am your stereotypical teaching candidate. I have always wanted to be a teacher since I was little and quickly found out that I wanted to specialize in Math 6-12 since I enjoy Math a bunch. I am also attending a Teacher Preparation Program as a part of my degree which is supposed to be one of the best in the state. This allows me to graduate with my certificate already. I have passed all FTCEs as a result. I have also gained lots of experience as an LA for various math courses at the university I attend, and I guess you can say I would specialize in Calculus when I picked up different LA contracts.  I have probably seen that course content 10-15 times over. I am placed at a High School (which I wanted) for Math. I am graduating with a BA in Math w/ a Major in Math Ed this spring. I am also located in South Florida if that helps! I have a few math major friends who might also read up on this advice, so I am sure they will also benefit from this post.

&amp;#x200B;

I finished my University's orientation already, so now we're all just waiting to start the actual experience. I am getting together as much as I can think of, like some professional clothes, a lunch box, protein bars, a teacher survival kit, practicing how to apply simple makeup since I'm not much of a makeup person and anything else I can think of. I am 5'2 and look somewhat young still even though I am 23, so I am trying to ""age myself up"" so to speak. This does concern me since I will be in a high school and the age gap isn't too much of a difference. If you guys have any input it will be very much appreciated! Some covid specific advice is also welcome since I do want to care for my family's health while I teach. I also didn't get many chances to learn and apply classroom management techniques because of covid and am very cautious of what techniques would benefit most in a high school setting. Many techniques can be tailored towards the primary grades. I can't think of any other concerns at the moment but anything is welcome!

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all in advance!"

There are many embedded jobs here in Southern California (Qualcomm, Viasat, Defense, etc...). I likely won't be relocating any time soon.

Personally, I think Job 1 would be better because it's remote and I like the idea of continuing to work remotely. On the other hand, I would enjoy working with embedded systems at these other local companies as well. Compensation and job security seems like it would tip the scale one way or the other.

s4oz63,5,2022-01-15,How do I break into the Software Engineering field?,Alornoth,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/s4oz63/how_do_i_break_into_the_software_engineering_field/,"Hi 

I am currently doing a Bachelors degree in Software Engineering. I have no prior experience in the industry and I’ve joined the degree as a “mature age” student, all my prior experience has been in management/operations for logistic companies. So it’s different to what I am doing now at university. 

I’m having a hard time finding an internship, and just getting my foot in the door, any advice would be appreciated. I’ve tried doing little programs/projects to put on my resume, but admittedly my programming skills are average at best. But my grades are good, if that makes any difference."

I know there is web development (front &amp; back), mobile development, ai/machine learning related.. these are the ones I mostly know of and even of those I only have a little knowledge about.  


For a bit of a background info, I'm a 2nd year electronic and electrical student and I'm looking to transition to software engineering. I don't have any work experience or that much experience with programming in general, I am taking CS50's introduction to computer science for now and I think I will finish it in 2 weeks. After that, I will focus on a data structures and algorithms course, both for interview questions and just for programming problems experience in general. I know I definitely need to work on some personal projects if I want to get at least one internship before graduating but I'm not sure what to focus on, maybe having an engineering degree instead of a computer science one could give me an advantage in some areas over others? Or can you still get into the big tech companies with a different type of degree than CS like mine? Any feedback or help would be appreciated, thank you!"

s4rc9b,138,2022-01-15,I worked for the shadow government,withbite,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/s4rc9b/i_worked_for_the_shadow_government/,"I was fresh out of college, ambitious, hard-working and in debt.

I applied for hundreds of jobs and attended dozens of interviews, all while working the night shift at a twenty-four-hour convenience store.

But I kept hitting the brick wall of not having the right experience. It was so frustrating. I knew I could do ninety per-cent of what the job specs asked for. The other ten per-cent I was sure I could work out when I needed to.

It was a *no* every time though, and, it did not matter how many times I read on feedback emails that I was ‘very talented’ and the interviewers had ‘enjoyed meeting me’, each and every rejection sucked.

I did not need compliments I needed a damn job.

So, I wasn’t feeling very positive as I filled in yet another application form for a job I had seen online. It wasn’t even a proper job. It was for an internship with a research company, unpaid and for three months.

*For the experience*, I told myself as I fought to finish the form.

I finally did. Just before I had to leave for work I pressed ‘send’. Then I threw on my coat and hurried out the door. The shelves would not stack themselves.

The next morning I was dragging myself into bed when I noticed I had a reply to my latest application showing on my phone.

Thinking, *At least the rejections are getting quicker*, I almost did not read it. But my finger twitched and I opened – and, to my amazement, I was told I had been accepted onto the internship programme.

All I needed to do was read and accept the terms and conditions. But who does that, right?

I scrolled down and accepted, then rolled over and went to sleep.

The alarm on my mobile woke me at one in the afternoon. I couldn’t remember setting an alarm but obviously I must have. Then I thought: *the internship*. And rushed to look at the message again.

There it was: ‘Please arrive promptly at three p.m. for your induction’. This was followed by an address.

It was way out of town but thanks to the alarm I had time.

*I am so on it*, I told myself and hurried for the shower.

As it was, I was almost late. There was a line to get through the security checks at the entrance to the building. The place didn’t look anything special. It could have been a stock image brought up from a search for ‘big faceless office block’.

When my turn came I was asked to empty my pockets and walk through a body scanner. This was a fancy looking piece of kit and gave me a 360 degrees going over.

I felt kind of violated to be honest and, as I stepped out, I was about to protest that I had not consented to be searched in this way, when I remembered the terms and conditions.

That had been a long long list and, I guessed, in there somewhere there had been a line about intimate electronic searches.

*Better than a latex glove up the butt*, I decided and accepted a lanyard with my face looking out from it.

It wasn’t a great photograph. I was wearing my sweatshirt rather than the white shirt and tie I had on.

*Hang on*, I thought and turned to ask one of the people at the security desk where they had got this picture from, when I heard someone say my name.

“Alan Chambers.”

The woman who had spoken was maybe thirty and had on a dark blue business suit. Her blond hair was in a ponytail and she wore what I believe are called ‘sensible shoes’.

I was not checking her out in a seedy way, I was just, you know, looking. I blushed anyway.

She seemed oblivious to my discomfort and held out her hand. “I’m Jane Mitchell. Though everyone calls me Jane One.”

“Is that because there are two Jane Mitchells that work here?” I asked as we shook hands.

She smiled. “There used to be. Now, let’s get you to work.”

Looking back, the short space of time between application, acceptance and me actually sitting at a work station and being assigned tasks, should have made me realise something was off.

The fact they had a picture of me and I did not know how, should have bothered me more.

But I was just too plain excited.

After months and months of frustration I was finally getting somewhere.

The only niggle I had was that I hadn’t resigned from my job at the store.

*Don’t sweat the small stuff*, I told myself and focused on the task at hand.

My desktop was showing twelve different shared screens. Each was of a domestic setting and by clicking into one I could enlarge it. The one I chose first looked to be a view of a home office. There was an old-fashioned calendar on a wall, a cactus in a pot and a bookshelf. I was clearly seeing this room via a camera on a computer.

The next setting I enlarged was a kitchen. It was a spacious room, with pots lined up on a wall hanger in the background.

My task was to observe the activity taking place and note down timings of anything unusual. I had been told that another, experienced member of staff would then review the footage.

Both the first two rooms were empty, so I checked out a third, and there was a young man, a bit older than me. He looked to be working on a device while lying on a sofa.

To me, the young man’s behaviour seemed perfectly normal. So, should I move on to someone else and come back to him later in the hope that he would be doing something weird?

I rubbed my face, a habit I have when the cogs are moving inside my head. This was tricky, and fascinating.

“How’s it going, Alan?”

I turned to see Jane One was standing behind me. For the life of me, though she had told me her actual surname, Jane One had stuck in my mind.

“Ok,” I said. “I suppose. I guess I just need to get used to thinking in a certain way. To be able to decide quickly what constitutes unusual.”

Jane One frowned and checked the tablet she was holding. After a moment she looked up and said, “Your records show acute observational skills.”

I tried to remember the responses I had given in the application form that she must have been referring to, but I drew a blank.

I tried to look, if not wise then at least competent, and said, “Of course. That is a key skill of mine.”

This seemed to do the trick as Jane One looked less perturbed and started to move on. There were more people at work stations that ran the length of the room. I guessed she was a busy lady with a lot of people to supervise.

But a question had just occurred to me.

“Er,” I said. “Ms One. I mean, Jane.”

She paused. “Yes, Alan.”

“The people I am observing, well, presumably they know they’re being watched because they must have given us permission. But won’t that change their behaviour?”

Jane One looked at me like I had just slipped down a couple of rungs of the evolutionary ladder, and said, “They don’t know they are being observed, Alan. What would be the point if they did?”

Then she walked away.

I rubbed my face. A whole host of new questions were forming, but they all got shoved to one side when the woman screamed.

It was a small sound, coming from my computer, and I could not spot who it was at first glance. Then on one of the screens I saw a woman running into a room. I clicked to enlarge and could see that she was in a bedroom. The computer camera that I was observing through must have been on a bedside table or chair. Either way, I had clear view as the man walked into the room. He was breathing heavily as he approached the woman. She backed away from him but there was no place to go. And then he hit her. And he kept hitting her.

I took out my phone to dial 911 but realised I had no idea where this appalling assault was taking place. I stood up, looked around the other work stations. Would anyone else know? I doubted it, but I knew who probably would.

“Jane,” I shouted. “Get Jane One.”

I don’t know if someone called for her, or she heard me herself, but a minute later she made her way over to me.

I felt sick at what I had seen and struggled to get my words out. “A woman has been attacked. I saw everything. We need to tell the police. Give them the details.”

On the screen, the woman was alone again. She lay on the floor not moving. I did not know if she was still breathing.

Jane did not interrupt me. Did not ask any questions. I don’t think she even glanced at the screen. When she spoke, it was in a calm voice. “Sit down, Alan. Your job is to observe and pass your contribution on to the next stage in the system.”

“We have to help,” I gasped.

“The system will help. I believe that, because I trust the system. Do you, Alan?”

“Yes,” I replied, “but…”

She talked over me: “Good. Now please go back to work.”

The rest of that first day passed in a blur. I felt disorientated and confused. I tried to concentrate on what I was seeing on the screens but I could not stop thinking about the woman who had been attacked.

Even though, shortly after Jane had finished speaking to me, I watched as police or paramedics – I’m not sure as I did not recognise their uniforms - arrived and began to tend to the woman before taking her away on a stretcher.

The system had worked, I supposed. Perhaps a neighbour had heard the screams and called the authorities.

I did not know and by the time I left the building around midnight – after another turn through the body scanner – I decided I would not be going back.

I’d email. Say the internship was not one for me. Thank them for the experience. Some kind of B.S. along those lines.

I decided to do this when I had a clearer head, but after I got home I could not go to sleep for ages. And when the alarm on my phone went off, I woke with a start.

I looked at my phone. Saw it was one o’clock in the afternoon. What the hell! I had not set that alarm.

I rubbed my face, realised I had new messages.

The first was my bank. It said I had received a payment. One that ran into tens of thousands of dollars. Enough to pay off my student loans in one fell swoop.

“What the hell!” I said it aloud this time.

The second was from Jane One. ‘As per the terms and conditions you accepted, now you have formally entered the internship programme, we have deposited an amount equal to your debt in your account. Should you not complete the programme, we will require immediate repayment, with an administration fee of eighty percent of the original amount added to the outstanding balance. We look forward to seeing you at the office later today. PS, nice PJs’.

I pulled the bed sheet up to my neck and looked at my laptop. It was open and facing me.

I just about made it to the toilet before I was violently sick.

Resigning there and then was now out of the question. I had been screwed financially before I joined the programme. Add on another eighty percent and I would be hounded by debt for decades.

I was pretty angry by the time I arrived at the office.

The security guard who processed me gave me a dirty look throughout. “What’s your problem?” I snapped as I stepped out of the body scanner.

“Just concerned about your heart rate and temperature. They’ve been through the roof for the last two hours,” he replied.

“How…?” I began, but had no need to ask the question as it dawned on me. Like a lot of people, I had an app on my phone which registered how many steps I took a day.

That and clearly much more. I went to the restroom, turned my phone off, decided to take the battery out as well.

Swearing under my breath I went to have things out with Jane One. I had a growing list, with spying on me at the top.

A man I had never seen before was waiting for me outside the restroom door. He held his hand out, displayed all the signs of a very good dental plan, and said: “Hi Alan, I’m Tony. I’m your supervisor for the day.”

“Jane,” I began. “I want to speak to…”

“Jane is First Floor, today you’ll be working with me in Basement. If you’d like to come with me.”

He swept his hands in the direction of the lift.

I counted to ten, promised myself that before I left the office, I would find a way out of this mess, then followed him to the lift.

Tony wore a dark blue suit, a subtly striped tie, and black shoes. His hair was parted immaculately. He smelt of something woody.

I could feel the sweat gathering in my armpits and hoped he was wearing enough expensive deodorant for two.

The doors clicked open and Tony led me out into a grey corridor. For my exit plan, I needed options. I decided to try sounding him out.

“Do people ever drop out?” I asked him as casually as I could.

He looked thoughtful and, after a moment’s pause, he replied, “Self-termination does occasionally occur. Or, sometimes, we will decide it’s simply not working and call time on an internship. It’s such a shame when this happens, to see a young person become one of life’s leftovers. Why do you ask, Alan? Are you thinking of leaving us?

“No,” I answered, still trying to process what he had said.

Tony nodded. “Glad to hear that.”

We had reached a double set of steel doors and Tony was opening them by placing his hand on a scanner fixed to the wall. They whooshed close to silently and we stepped through into a massive open space. Lines of desks with laptops on them ran the length of the room. There were seats by the desks. I noticed that each seat had restraints on the arms.

And that there were more restraints by the legs of the desks.

Something cold touched the back of my neck. I reached round, realised it was sweat trickling down my skin.

What was this place? I wondered.

Tony, for his part, beamed like a proud parent on awards day. He clamped his hands together and said, “Today, Alan, I am going to introduce you to our latest project. I can tell you, there is significant excitement about it at all levels of the organisation. It could, we believe, significantly improve the way we run the country.”

I held up my hand. “Wait,” I said. “The government runs the country. The people we elect.”

He looked at me with what seemed like pity in his eyes then shook his head. “Alan,” he said, “The men and women you see braying into the camera every day. Are you seriously telling me they are fit to run this country?”

I could not answer. This was one shock too many. He must have taken my silence for acquiescence because he went on:

“This building is one outlying office of the most effective administration there has ever been. We have been covertly in charge of this country for more than half a century, and that is why this is the greatest nation in the goddamn world.”

He slapped his fist into the palm of his other hand, straightened his tie and said, “Now, if you will move over to the wall and stand behind the safety line.”

I looked to my left. A red line had been painted on the floor.

I had a very bad feeling about this but did as I was told. My legs felt very shaky as I moved behind the red line.

Tony joined me, still beaming.

A buzzer sounded, and at the far side of the room a large shutter door opened.

The smell hit me instantly. It was something... rancid.

I wanted to ask Tony what it was, but I could not speak anymore because the first of them had appeared through the door.

Their clothes were filthy and torn. Each had a lanyard. These were not held on a by a cord but fixed with a bolt directly into their chests.

Their skin, where it was exposed, was shrivelled and, in places, fallen away completely to reveal the flesh beneath.

None spoke though their mouths moved constantly.

Tony must had seen my attention was fixed on this because he leaned over and said in a quiet voice, “Their tongues are clipped during induction.”

I looked at him blankly.

There were men wearing overalls and carrying long tasers flanking the things that had entered the room. If one started to veer off to the side it was shocked back into its place.

Soon the smell of burning flesh was added to the foul, sickly sweet odour that now filled the room.

I was aware that my heart was beating at a crazy speed, that I was now soaked in sweat, but all I could do was stand and stare as they continued to shuffle forwards.

I was too scared to move, too scared to speak.

Prodded and shouted at by the men in overalls, the things each sat at a desk. As they did so, the restraints clamped closed around their wrists and ankles.

Eventually all of them were seated before one of the laptops – which were powering up. From where I stood I could see images start to flicker on the laptops, one after another in rapid succession.

Slowly at first but then picking up speed, the things started to press the keyboards in front of them – one finger at a time.

Soon they were in sync with the changing images.

My God, I realised, they were responding to what they were being shown.

“The… the… they…” I tried to say.  “The… the… they are…”

“Absolutely amazing,” Tony said. “You see, Alan, the zombie brain is uncluttered. It does not worry about what the other zombies think. It is not distracted by romantic or sexual feelings. It does not have personal ambition or fear. The zombies are ideal.”

“For what?” I managed to ask.

“To help us create the algorithms that will guide every aspect of the lives of people all across this country for years to come.”

I could not respond. I stood and stared as waves of pure fear passed through me.

I can’t tell you how long the zombies were kept at their task but when a new buzzer sounded and their restraints clicked open I felt a glimmer of hope that the worst was over.

I had no idea that this waking nightmare was only just beginning.

The zombies got slowly to their feet and were herded towards one corner of the room where there were no desks. Once again a buzzer sounded and a hatch opened in the ceiling.

A glistening slab fell through, and then another. It was meat, I realised. Blood dripped from fat chunks of matter now rushing towards the ground.

The zombies did not hesitate.

Afterwards, Tony took me back to the lift, and up to the ground floor. He got me a can of soda from a vending machine and told me it would help settle my stomach. And then he said he would see me tomorrow.

I did not go home. I walked the streets for a long time and am still walking. It’s close to dawn and I have decided I am not going back to the office.

I am going off-grid, to somewhere remote.

I have to do this. I have to get away.

Tony said that the interns that don’t make it become life’s leftovers.

Seeing the zombies feeding, I understood what he meant.

It was not the way that they tore at the meat with their teeth or the drool speckled with bone and gristle hanging from their chins.

It was when the meat was released from the hatch in the ceiling and landed in a pile on the floor. It was glimpsing the movement among the slabs of meat: the hand raised, the terrified face, before the zombies began their feast."
s4rh9a,0,2022-01-15,SWE Internship: Addepar vs. Capital One vs. Nuro,Superb-Bug447,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/s4rh9a/swe_internship_addepar_vs_capital_one_vs_nuro/,"Super lucky to have received offers from these places. Considering this is my last internship before I graduate, which company would you pick and why?

Factors I'm considering:

* Learning opportunities matters the most! I think I'll get the most out of Addepar and Nuro.
* TC matters somewhat: I don't care about internship TC, only full-time TC. Moreover, full-Time TC only matters if the disparity is large e.g 40k+ in the same location. If anyone is curious about internship TC it's Nuro &gt; C1 &gt; Addepar. 
* Applying to a trading firm for new grad: In the future, I'll potentially apply to a trading firm for a new grad position e.g JaneStreet, Two Sigma, etc (Depending on how much I enjoy the internship I choose this summer).  Perhaps Addepar and C1 has an edge over Nuro because Nuro is non-finance? But I think the difference is negligible. IMO the reputation of these three companies is good enough to score an interview at a trading firm. Although I could be very wrong about this.

If you have any qs, I'll try my best to answer them!

I'm currently a year-round intern at a different company and have a standing offer to intern there for summer 2022. 

Right now, Google is the only company I have late stage interviews with, so I feel like Google is my only option aside from my current company. 

My current company and team is great, and I wouldn't mind working there full-time in the future, but it doesn't really compare to an opportunity at Google. However, I don't want to burn any bridges by suddenly leaving the team without an intern for the summer. 

I'll ask my Google recruiter to try to speed up the process, but I'm not sure exactly what to say, given I don't have a hard deadline on when I need to tell my team that I would be leaving. 

Keep in mind, I didn't tell my manager that I'm looking for other positions, although I think he's assuming I am. Should I tell him now, or do I just communicate with the Google recruiter?"

I strategically block aisles with carts, totes and explicitly give customers the wrong directions to their favorite out-of-stock product. You need to give us space while we try to do our jobs.

In contrast, if an elderly person wearing a mask comes and ask me to help them with something, I will drop what I'm doing and help them find it, as I walk through the horde of mouthbreathers... leaving a rancid trail of farts in my wake.

Who else fucks with maskless customers at a grocery store?

Edit: I am a lowly Kroger Associate with Covid scheduled to work on Monday. Customers should not be allowed to come within one meter of an employee and breathe in their faces. Be sensible, make people stand 6 feet apart, and wear a mask. I am being asked to work one day shy of the CDC isolation guidelines by an incompetent cult of middle management. 

Edit 2: Stop politicizing science, give us hazard pay, and sanitize the fucking stores. I am not a fucking liberal because I don't want to catch or transmit a communicable disease from or to another human being. I am tired of seeing you wingnuts, Karens, and bootlickers dragging your children around a septic tank. No wonder we can't keep our schools open.

Edit 3: Imagine how long it takes an understaffed store to break down the equipment and sanitize our workstations by the end of our shifts. Managers call in workers from other stores and clean up before corporate shows up for an inspection. Trust me, you don't want to eat anything from the meat department. Have you ever read The Jungle? I've found curdled milk in dairy. New hires take up to 4 hours to work dairy carts or just leave them in an aisle if they get pinged to work in another department. That is two hours outside of the basic food safety zone. I am surprised that there has not been a salmonella outbreak in the produce department. Did I mention that almost nobody is trained to do work in another department and we're shuffled around the store when another employee calls in sick? We do not know what we're doing. It is reckless to keep these stores running at this point. Employees should NOT be working some of these jobs by themselves.

Edit 4: Good luck finding groceries next week guys. I am tired of people giving me shit because there isn't a product on the shelf. Order your fucking groceries online.

Edit 5: My rant hit the front page. I'll post a TikTok video of this foul shitshow of a store on Monday.

Edit 6: Boycott Kroger. Fuck scabs, shills, and your corporate social media accounts. Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, you're cool, peace y'all, I'm out.

Edit 7: Have you ever worked in constuction or a related field that requires wearing a respirator? If you answered yes, did the NIOSH approved face mask stop the silica from scarring your lungs? Do you or a loved one have meso-theoia-fucking-oma? If you answered no... you are admitting that a well-fitting N95 mask stops 95% of particles in the air from going inside of your lungs. Face masks ""work."" When somebody brings up this fact, they often say that they only work if ""they're used correctly."" Well, can you drop the whataboutism and read the instructions? It takes 30 seconds.What is your major malfunction Private Pyle?

Edit 8: People fucking died a horrible death over a century ago in the trenches of WWI for your fucking freedom. My great grandfather was mustard gassed by the Germans. My greatmother lived through the Great Depression and would slap the fuck out of you. Have you ever seen a book of ration stamps from WWII? Have you ever heard somebody say ""Duck and Cover?"" Your ancestors would be ashamed of you. We are the most useless and entitled generation to befoul this planet (which is round for future reference). My inbox looks like a Fox News intern used speech to text to try and put a spell on me through Reddit. Some have called me a stockboy, and others have called me a hero. If I am a hero... I'm the hero that nobody asked for but everybody needs. Eat shit."

This is my first real internship (I've had one before but it wasn't really an internship and it was kind of weird). I really want to get the most out of this opportunity so I was wondering if you guys had any advice on what I should do. So far I have two:

\- Ask lots of questions

\- Keep track of any accomplishments I achieve (no matter how small)

Thank you in advanced!"

s4ukiv,12,2022-01-15,just had my lehigh interview!,glossyducky,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/s4ukiv/just_had_my_lehigh_interview/,"it went pretty good! the interviewer was super nice and he said he’ll try his best to put in a good word about me to the admissions committee and even try to work with me to get me opportunities if i get in because he was also a student in the school of comp sci and engineering! he wished me good luck about the college app process :) here are some questions he asked and i asked him. first off i told him abt myself —

he asked -

• What made you to apply to Lehigh?
• What made you interested in computer science (my prospective major)?
• What is something you are passionate about (outside of ur main academic focus)?
• What is an aspect that you would value in a campus? (like dorms, good food, etc).

i asked -

• How has the alumni network at Lehigh helped in your career?
• How is the school spirit at Lehigh and what are some of your favorite campus traditions?
• How has Lehigh helped you in obtaining internships while being a student?
• How is Lehigh with giving students a good way to study topics outside of their main academic focus, in an interdisciplinary manner?

Beforehand I was nervous but the actual thing felt so natural! Feeling accomplished and excited!"
s4unz7,6,2022-01-15,What is being a bioinformatician really like?,rocket_wow,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/s4unz7/what_is_being_a_bioinformatician_really_like/,"I’m a junior studying biomedical engineering. To keep things short, I’ve developed a very strong interest in cs (reading cs textbooks and programming in my own time, took cs classes I could fit in). 

For some more background I’ve realized I really like programming. I find it enjoyable, and I guess I actually really like “leetcode” tye algo/ds problems. 

Question: 
What is it really like to be a bioinformatician? How much programming are you doing? Is it glamarous work? 

I am planning on going to grad school. I see myself either being a software engineer, completely unrelated to bio (going to study cs in a course based masters in this case although its probably not “needed), OR as a bioinformatician (which means I will be pursuing a masters in bioinformatics). 

-I’ve done an internship and found myself to really want to work in a “meaningful” field. I know that software engineering is known to be much more lucrative, but perhaps bioinformatics can make up for that by being more “meaningful” and “exciting”?

Thoughts?"
s4vmjk,30,2022-01-15,Are Data Analytics tools necessary?,chaitanyaishere,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/s4vmjk/are_data_analytics_tools_necessary/,"Sorry for the title couldn’t elaborate my question.

I have read alot about the consultants grabbing 160k salaries at MBB post their T15 MBA. 

Do the people recruiting students for these prestigious MBB Interns and Full Time roles look for proficiency in any Data Analytics tools like Tableau, Power BI, Alteryx, SQL or R/Python?

Or is it fine to not have knowledge of anything of the like.

Would appreciate an answer from anyone from a T15 or these firms who knows."
s4w869,141,2022-01-15,Can't get any interviews for internships. Is my resume fine?,Dex-Max,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/s4w869/cant_get_any_interviews_for_internships_is_my/,"I'm currently in my second year of college and I'm trying to get an internship for this summer. I've applied to around 200 places and I've received 10 assessments but no interviews. Is the application/assessment ratio about normal for someone with no previous internships? Also please take a look at my resume and let me know if I should focus on that or if I can continue studying Leetcode. Thanks!

Kemper is an insurance company and I don't know shit about insurance, but I want to show them that I am interested in working for the company and supporting their objectives. Of the opportunities this internship provides, I'm most interested in App development and project management. I get that the goal of this kind of interview is showing them that I'm enthusiastic and eager to learn, but is there something else I can do to give myself an edge?"
s50bv8,20,2022-01-15,Tips on increasing employability come graduation? (Springboard higher diploma student),awqwardsilence,DevelEire,https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/s50bv8/tips_on_increasing_employability_come_graduation/,"Hey all, I am about to start the part-time higher diploma in software dev at GMIT and I have a few questions for any recent grads that could help someone who doesn't come from a traditional 4 year CS degree route. 

I would like to make the most of this course but also do anything extra that would give me an edge at landing a graduate job, as I know the competition will be high and I'll be up against CS grads with a lot more experience than me. I have a small bit of coding experience from completing half of CS50 and a little bit of HTML and CSS too.

My questions are as follows:

1. What sort of things could I be doing alongside my course to add relevant skills, is it side projects? Getting a job in tech support? etc.
2. Is finding a Summer internship in development a realistic goal for a springboard student with little programming experience? be it Summer 2022 or 2023.
3. Is securing an IT graduate program a realistic aim? And would this be a suitable route to gaining experience as a graduate? I am also open to moving abroad for graduate opportunities although I have heard that it is best to gain experience in Ireland first.

I understand that this is just the start of my journey in software dev but any tips would be helpful as I'd like to be realistic about my job opportunities and what I can do, in my own time to maximize them. 

Any tips/advice are really appreciated!"

s525ja,1,2022-01-15,College Senior intending to withdraw for a semester for mental health reasons - Need advice on possible career effects,donttossman,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/s525ja/college_senior_intending_to_withdraw_for_a/,"I am currently a 4th year senior CS major. Over the course of the last few years, my academic performance as well as my overall mental and physical health have been declining severely, and very recently, I went to see a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with ADHD and Depression, and started treatment this past week. Although I am in good academic standing and believe that I would probably still be able to at least pass all my classes and thus graduate on time if I chose to enroll for Spring 2022, I strongly believe that my grades, social life and health would be as poor as they were in the last few semesters. As such, I believe I currently have two options:

* Take the L, enroll in Spring 2022, and finish my degree. High chance of poor academic performance, which will not help my already mediocre GPA (~3.4). Slight chance of failing a class completely and not being able to graduate on time anyways. Will have to juggle the decently high workload classes I need to graduate with recruiting for full time positions, which I am already disadvantaged for given that I have no internships and very few side projects.

* Withdraw from school for Spring 2022, and spend it working on improving my mental health and searching for an internship for Summer 2022 (which I will now still be eligible for), which I can hopefully then convert into a full-time offer after I finish my degree in Fall 2022.

Right now, I am heavily leaning towards the latter since my priority is finding a job, and my understanding is that internships are easier to get than full-time offers, and many internships have high frequency conversions to full-time offers afterwards. My questions are as follows - Would the decision to withdraw from school for health reasons look bad to potential employers? Would being withdrawn in and of itself make internships less likely to be interested in you than if you were still enrolled? Also, what looks worse, graduating on time and then taking some months to focus on your health before applying to full time roles, or taking a semester off? Because as things stand, there is a very decent possibility that if I am enrolled this spring that I will not be able to find a full-time offer during the semester and will end up graduating with no job lined up."
s52nun,71,2022-01-15,"Starting a position officially labeled as ""Senior Software - Backend Engineer"" but Ive never worked professionally as an SE and im very anxious!",Haunting-Leading-652,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/s52nun/starting_a_position_officially_labeled_as_senior/,"So I met a recruiter for Delta Airlines last year in a career fair and he looked at my resume and talked with me a little bit about what the company does. He probably noticed that I was wearing a tag for professional engineers(there were different tags for graduates and undergraduates and since I was not in college anymore, I could not register as either one of those so I had to register as a professional, despite the fact that I have never worked as a SE). He told me to come back tomorrow for an interview.

After the interview, he sent me an email saying that I had to formally apply for the role. I looked at the role title and it read ""Senior Software - Backend Engineer"" I knew that he knew that I've never worked professionally or had an internship before so I thought it was weird but I figured that they were probably willing to take in someone who wasn't really a Senior to help their team. I did a second interview with them where I further explained what I have done.

I told them that during the 2 years from when I graduated until now, I participated in 4 hackathons, led 2 teams in a span of 2 college semesters(one per semester), and tried to make a startup with a friend doing a VR project in Unreal Engine. All of these things are true! The problem is that how I presented them, I feel, was probably a bit too over the top. I did not want to downplay myself, but I had no idea how to accurately convey what I know about software engineering through those experiences. They probably think that I am very experienced using Agile, but in reality, I barely know anything about Agile. During the time that I led 2 teams, I just used a simple Trello kanban board and had 2 meetings a week. They probably also think that I have a lot of experience using various design patterns when the only design pattern that I feel like I am familiar with is MVC.

It just hit me that how I presented myself may have been too good for what I really am for a Senior role and that they probably will be expecting me to do **waaaaayyy** more than what I am actually capable of doing at the moment. I have never even put any one of my projects into production, so my experience and knowledge of CI/CD is not very good either! I barely know anything about Software Engineering and yet, I accepted the offer for a f\*\*\*\*\*g Senior role!

And on top of that, they use PHP and MySQL. They knew that I didnt know PHP when I first interviewed with them, so they probably won't expect me to be an expert at it, but I really wanted to impress them so I took up a 78 video long course in modern PHP that covered all beginner-advanced programming topics in PHP. I've been working on that these past few weeks(and im almost done with it) on top of looking for apartments since I have to relocate and keeping track of the pre-employment process and everything else needed to make sure that I don't get disqualified or delay my start date.

The more I think about what I need to do to make sure I hit the ground running as soon as I start, the more I feel that no matter how I much I try to learn from now on, it's probably not going to be enough to not get fired within a month, given that this is a senior role and I have no idea what they are going to expect from me. It's my first professional job ever, which I am starting exactly a month from now) and realizing that I signed up for a Senior position is freaking me the fuck out right now, so I am very sorry for this long essay.

TL;DR:

I got an offer to work as a Senior backend engineer but I have never worked as Software Engineer before and my experiences did not prepare me to work as one. I don't feel like I can learn enough about Software Engineering now before I start a month from now."
s52tty,5,2022-01-15,Job searching is draining me,champaaagnemami,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/s52tty/job_searching_is_draining_me/,"Just like the title reads and is very similar to those who have posted before me, job searching is killing me. I graduated in Dec. of 2020 with my master's degree. I am in the nonprofit/public service sector. I was able to hold an internship in 2019 during my undergrad but when I started my masters I was unable to find anything due to the pandemic. This past year I was lucky enough to find a part-time position at a small nonprofit in my state doing grant writing/development work but was told recently that we did not have the funding for me to even be on part-time, but for special projects only. I have been looking for full-time work since August of 2021 and have had no luck whatsoever. I have had a handful of interviews (phone screening, 2nd rounds, 3rd rounds) but have never ever received an offer. I've been told in interviews that ""this seems like a perfect fit for you etc..."" but as I said, nothing follows through, or I have been ghosted. I've applied to everything and anything, tried using a recruiter (who ghosted me), part-time, entry-level, associate, and even internship positions and no luck.

I have tried to reach out to the people I have interviewed (who have emailed me to reject me) to see what I could do better but most of them ghost me afterward. I did have one person tell me that she thought I was the perfect candidate and wanted me for the position but someone on the hiring team was unsure about my skills so ultimately I didn't get the job. I have utilized my connections and everything and there is still nothing. I am not sure what I can change to make me more appealing to my interviewers and I am so frustrated. 

If anyone has had success after being in a situation like this, can you tell me what was your turning point?"

s548as,318,2022-01-16,Any Other Hiring Managers/Leaders Out There Petrified About The Future Of DS?,ticktocktoe,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/s548as/any_other_hiring_managersleaders_out_there/,"I've been interviewing/hiring DS for about 6-7 years, and I'm honestly very concerned about what I've been seeing over the past ~18 months. Wanted to get others pulse on the situation. 

The past 2 weeks have been my push to secure our summer interns. We're planning on bringing in 3 for the team, a mix of BS and MS candidates. So far I've interviewed over 30 candidates, and it honestly has me concerned. For interns we focus mostly on behavioral based interview questions - truthfully I don't think its fair to really drill someone on technical questions when they're still learning and looking for a developmental role. 

That being said, I do as a handful (2-4) of rather simple 'technical' questions. One of which, being:

*Explain the difference between linear and logistic regression.*

I'm not expecting much, maybe a mention of continuous/binary response would suffice... Of the 30+ people I have interviewed over the past weeks, 3 have been able to formulate a remotely passable response (2 MS, 1 BS candidate). 

Now these aren't bad candidates, they're coming from well known state schools, reputable private institutions, and even a couple of Ivy's scattered in there. They are bright, do well at the behavioral questions, good previous work experience, etc.. and the majority of these resumes also mention things like machine/deep learning, tensorflow, specific algorithms, and related projects they've done. 

**The most concerning however is the number of people applying for DS/Sr. DS that struggle with the exact same question.** We use one of the big name tech recruiters to funnel us full-time candidates, many of them have held roles as a DS for some extended period of time. The Linear/Logistic regression question is something I use in a meet and greet 1st round interview (we go much deeper in later rounds). I would say we're batting 50% of candidates being able to field it. 

So I want to know:

1) Is this a trend that others responsible for hiring are noticing, if so, has it got noticeably worse over the past ~12m? 

2) If so, where does the blame lie? Is it with the academic institutions? The general perception of DS? Somewhere else?

3) Do I have unrealistic expectations? 

4) Do you think the influx underqualified individuals is giving/will give data science a bad rep?"

s5fvzz,2,2022-01-16,Recently diagnosed and two weeks on medication. I am lost.,SomeSayAllWillEnd,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/s5fvzz/recently_diagnosed_and_two_weeks_on_medication_i/,"TW: Self harm, substance abuse  


On Thursday December 30th, I (28F) got diagnosed with ADHD. I always knew there was something up - from a young age I often felt depressed not knowing why, which resulted in cutting myself regularly in my teen years. I stopped self harming when I was 19, but after getting kicked out of my dream college before the second year I started drinking a lot. Ever since then alcohol has been my way to calm down, forget or simply not giving a fuck. 

I have been trying to get my bachelor's degree since 2014. Writing that out makes me feel sick. I quit my second education after three years because I figured out I didn't want to be in the field it would lead me to and I immediately started my third (and current) education. As of right now I am in my final year, with about one and a half year's of delay. COVID sucks.

I've never been able to study consistently, everything was done at the last moment which worked out for me until the lockdowns started. Ever since then I've been an anxious mess, not being able to get out of bed or off the couch because all the responsibilities, deadlines and whatever 'you-shoulds' there were, were weighing me down. I started therapy in November 2020 and it has helped me recognize my Inner Critic - she is a huge, unforgiving asshole but it's what got me through my studies up until the lockdowns. It also made me realise I am not an alcoholic, I was simply self-medicating. I've been drinking a lot less as of last year.

So when I got diagnosed and was given a trial medication right then and there, I was really excited to wave that version of me goodbye. The medication made everything more quiet, if that makes sense. On the way home I almost missed my bus stop (': I excitedly announced to the people around me that I felt so much better and that I was hopeful for the future. But right now I am back to where I started: weighed down by my responsibilities, feeling guilty because I am letting people down and simply being ashamed of going back to people with the same issues over and over. I haven't really reached out to anyone yet, except for my boyfriend seeing me sitting on the couch doing nothing all day, except for the occasional cry. He tries to comfort me, but is at a loss. Right now I am happily home alone, because the guilt of putting my misery on his plate adds to the anxiety. 

Tomorrow I have a appointment (by phone) with my internship mentor, where I will have to explain why I still haven't been able to finish the deadline that was originally on December 1st. She is an absolute sweetheart and has been amazing throughout, but I don't think she is aware of how little I have to turn in. Somewhere in the back of my mind is a small voice that says she won't mind and wants me healthy, but that gets drowned out quick and easily. 

I really need some support. Advice is more than welcome.

s5g72r,5,2022-01-16,Summer internship after graduation? And maybe some career advice needed!,Na_linez,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/s5g72r/summer_internship_after_graduation_and_maybe_some/,"Hi everyone! 

I'm a student in engineering, graduating soon, so I'd love to hear your opinions/thoughts on this.

I've recently received an offer to start working in late September 2022, but it's not in my field of studies. Though, the pay is good and it has quite a few benefits. Since I'm graduating this year, I'm thinking of trying to apply for an internship during summer that is a little more in line with what I've studied, since I've never really done any internships that included a more technical aspect in the job.

Do you think it's a viable plan? Have any of you gotten internships after graduation, and how did that turn out for you?

I'm really confused right now since I'm still unsure in which direction I want to build my career. More in the management consulting side, or more on the technical engineering side. But that's one of the main reasons I want to try getting one last internship.

Any advice would be amazing!"

Some things to note about jameslyonsswe: 

- Graduated from Stanford 
- Got his first internship in the 10th grade 
- Interned at NASA during highschool 
- Got an associates degree while in highschool
- Worked as a researcher at Stanford
- Currently works as a SWE at Airbnb
- Apparently completed 400 leetcode questions in 6 weeks 
- is Black 

One of the commenters under the thread mentioned that they weren’t really a fan of jameslyonsswe because he seemed like he was just a diversity hire and didn’t seem particularly talented. 

As a black person in tech who has similar accomplishments to jameslyonsswe (but honestly not Stanford-grad-and-NASA-intern-in-highschool level), I’m no stranger to the diversity hire comments but I quite frankly don’t give a fuck about them and I’ve always dismissed it as a mixture of racism and jealousy. I’ve always known I’m more accomplished than the average cs student and my resume speaks for itself. However, reading that commenter’s posts in the thread sparked something inside me for some reason. 

I realized that if people on here are willing to dismiss jameslyonsswe as a diversity hire, it’s a symptom of a much deeper issue of blatant racism and hatred. At this point you must just view all black people as inherently inferior in order to justify that mentality and I would just like to say in the most honest way possible that there is something deeply wrong with you. The black people in tech that you come across are not the problem, you are. You’re a racist. 

So if you would like to continue living that way, good luck and enjoy being broke and bitter &amp;amp;lt;3. 

If not, here’s a few questions to ask yourself in order to figure out whether someone’s a diversity hire or if you’re just a bigot (it’s most likely the latter) : 

- If their race, gender, sexuality were switched to straight white/asian male (i’m adding asian men to this because asian men make up a large portion of tech workers relative to their population in western countries. i’m not dismissing all the hardships and discrimination faced by the asian community. I will always be an ally to asians), would  they still seem like a diversity hire?

- Are there any prejudices you might have about an element of that person’s identity? 

- Do you have any role models with a similar identity to that person? If not, is there a reason? (are you likely to dismiss everyone with a similar background to this person as unqualified?)

- Do you know enough about them and they’re background and accomplishment to even make an accurate assessment? (the answers is probably no). 

If you answered yes to one or more of the questions above you probably have an issue. 

It’s 2022 guys, this type of thinking is frankly ridiculous and i’m especially disappointed to see so many asian guys sharing the same mentality. As fellow minorities in western countries we share an understanding of what it’s like to be discriminated against and shouldn’t perpetuate that.


Edit: Wow, what an experience. I’ve never had a post this “controversial” blow up like this. Here are some takeaways i got. 

- A lot of people on this community are kinda dumb. Judging from the really immature or blatantly irrelevant responses i got I would say their reading comprehension and argumentative skills could definitely be improved. But alas, it’s impossible to win an argument with a stupid person, so i had to give up in those instances. 

- The tension between black and asian students is definitely a delicate matter. I noticed a lot of the comments I made in defence of black students were automatically seen as disses towards asian students. I’m not sure why that was but I did find that interesting. however, there was no point in which i was trying to say anything offensive towards asians. 

- I stand by everything in my original post and i think the reception of this post is reflective of the dissonance a lot of non-minority CS students have about Affirmative Action and American race relations as a whole. Educate yourselves and stop being a piece of shit towards others : )


Edit 2: Thanks to everyone who’s been PMing me. That’s really sweet but I just wanted to say it’s completely fine. Like I’m not really taking any of the negative comments seriously so don’t worry! I was also mostly expecting this reaction to my post based off other comments in this community.

Edit 3: Holy shit, jameslyonswe made a tiktok about this!!"

I'm applying for Fall 22. What is more beneficial for my application? 3 academic LORs or 2 academic + 1 professional? 

If 2Acad. + 1Prof. is more worthy, is it more valuable to get one from my current Supervisor (I joined the current company recently 5 months ago) or the LOR from a previous manager who managed me for a year would be more valid? 

About me:
I have a 4 year B.Tech IT Degree from India. My degree was closely related to CS and I had all the subjects that's mentioned on the requirements. 3.04/4 on raw conversion. Actually 7.65/10 on Indian scale.

7 months internship, 1.5 years professional work experience as a Software Dev. 

My expectations from this course: To learn more about CS, to be a subject matter expert in deep technical concepts to tackle the problems that might arise later on when I am promoted. Maybe even wishing for this course to act as a catalyst when I'm considered to be given more technical responsibilities.

Are my expectations right?

Help is appreciated. Thank you :)"

Project is very interesting to me involving additive manufacturing and control systems type work. 

My Question is how have other Engineers navigated the industry with a PhD or masters Degree and does it make a huge difference ? 
I’m currently torn on doing the PhD because I feel burnt out after 5-6 years of straight school with internships here and there in the summers. 
No one is getting any younger and if I go through with the PhD I would have spent most of my twenties in school. Not saying it’s a bad thing but I also believe there’s more to life than school and grad student pay isn’t exactly opening to many things outside of living a basic student lifestyle. 

If this post needs to be posted somewhere else please let me know and I will do so. 

TLDR: 
how is navigating industry with a PhD and did you personally feel it was worth it the time spent?"
s5iwvw,15,2022-01-16,"Racism and sizism disguised as ""not the right fit"" in hiring",aagifford,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/s5iwvw/racism_and_sizism_disguised_as_not_the_right_fit/,"I have a few stories where I could see the racism sizism (small person discrimination) or ""not the right fit"" look on the interviewers face. First, some background for context. I'm half Asian, mother is Japanese, father is white from Pennsylvania, and I was raised and live in California not far from Los Angeles. I look a bit young for my age. Finally I'm also really small, at the time 105 pounds.

First story: I interviewed at a place just after graduating that had an aptitude test, they made robotic automation equipment for removing parts from molding machines. When I met the interviewer I could see that he was taken aback when he saw me. But in school I was responsible for building a major part of a Rose parade float, I led the build team, cut and welded metal did woodworking designed and built stuff, and so on. So they hand out this aptitude  test, I blew threw it in a few minutes, was really easy. Guy came back to score it, perfect score, he was obviously surprised.  Guy went away, then came back to say he'd ""get back to me"" if there was an opportunity but I could tell he was blowing me off, and as I'm led out as a tall white male candidate was walked in, big smiles and and I could overhear before I left that he would be a great fit. Chosen without an interview or test it seems. Hmmm.

Second story: I interviewed at a place a few years later that designed and built simulator rides, one they built may have been Star Trek related, however they are long ago out of business now. Anyway I met the engineering manager and had a great interview, am told that I would be a great fit and look forward to working with you but had to meet the CEO as a formality. I go to meet him in his office. He takes a look at me, and disdain and disgust cross his face instantly, then changes to some level of anger that stays the rest of the 15 minutes. I see that he looks Japanese, he has a samurai sword hanging on the wall. Interesting I think, what the hell is going on? He rips me apart for 10 minutes, your school, we had an intern from there, he sucked. You live where? That place sucks. You say you built Rose Floats, the parade is worthless and a waste of time. I don't know what he was projecting. Engineering manager picks me up, asks how it went, he is all smiles, I say looks bad, CEO didn't like me. Manager calls me a week later, says CEO wouldn't budge and wouldn't say why and that he wanted to hire me but couldn't.

Third story: Interviewed an an automation company, met with the CEO. Interview went OK. My interview was entirely technical, strength of materials, pneumatics and hydraulics, a couple calculations, pressure and I forget what else. Also there was some type of written test and aptitude test, again pretty easy. He said something to the effect of well they would keep looking. Anyway I was brought in a week later because the engineering manager wanted to interview me, he like me and offered me a job, the CEO didn't want to hire me. Very similar story to the above, except I was hired. I worked there for a few years, and when I left the CEO apologized to me for not wanting to hire me. While I was there, one of the other engineers was a tall white male, who also interviewed with the CEO and his interview was about cars, hired on the spot.

Fourth story: Not a job interview exactly, but similar enough I think. My wife made friends with a lady, finds out lady's husband wanted to learn how to weld and offered me up to teach the guy. Thanks for roping me into that, but anyway the couple show up and I try to teach him stick welding. Shouldn't be that hard to learn, but this gentleman just doesn't listen. 30 minutes of instruction, coaching, demonstrate and copy, nothing works on him. I finally realized that the man doesn't want to listen to ME. He flat out ignores everything I say. Thinking back, when he first arrived I saw the look. Same as the other stories. He was expecting some big bearded brute, not some 105 pound half-asian that looks 20 when he's 35. I ask him straight up if he has a problem learning from me, he says yes. I asked him ""Is it because I'm not the kind of guy you expected?"" he said ""Yeah, I was expecting a man."" Jeez, really... So he thinks I'm a kid, and I'm 35 years old at the time. Wow. Ok, time to stop, no point in teaching someone who won't listen.

These are the ones that stand out to me the most. I expect with people of color and women that there are many stories that are either more brutal or more subtle that happen every day during hiring, then once hired are a constant factor in keeping your job where you can't say anything to keep out of trouble."

And someone said that my projects are not good enough, so my questions is what should i make to step up my coding

These are the projects listed on my resume

* [Raspberry Pi Web Thermostat](https://github.com/Iuliean/PiThermostatCPP) written in c++. i still try to develop this and i personally use it in my home i am even working on a Android app for it since my html sucks ass. i am fond of this project actually even though it's janky in some places. It uses CrowCPP as a web framework, Sqlite3 for a database, And NlohmannJson for some json parsing. The program manages a web thermostat made with a Raspberry Pi Zero. It takes care of reading the tempratures, turining on and off the heating, provides cookies for authentification, stores data about the temperature and state of the thermostat (on/off), endpoints for getting the current temperature and the upper and lower threshold of the thermostat, for settings the lower and upper thresholds, and endpoints for getting the data stored in the database and averages per day, last 24h, or a specified period
* [PongSFML](https://github.com/Iuliean/PongSFML) it a pong written with sfml. it has no build system. it is played online. i just used the sfml stuff to make it. it's my first serious c++ project and i was still learning basic stuff. It's built on top of SFML's shapes like Circle and Rectangle, that get abstracted into Ball and Paddle objects, it also has a ""server"" that runs on a different thread built into it so you can play with a friend also written with SFML's networking abstraction
* [PongGL](https://github.com/Iuliean/PongGL) It's just a simple pong game that is written in c++ with openGL, i followed some the cherno videos for openGL so my abstraction it's pretty much the same with his, but i then built on top of that and abstracted even further to have Circle object and Rectangle objects and those also get abstracted into Paddle and Circle objects.
* [Discord Bot](https://github.com/Iuliean/Bot) written with python it's actually the first time i decided i am gonna make a more ""serious"" project not just a console app. it actually has a database and it was used alot by me and my friends.

Right now i want to make a Android app for my RPI thermostat with xamarin forms and C# and i was also thinking of making an esports notifier (just notifies you when a league of legends match is live and i could problably add more games)"

s5m1nc,3,2022-01-16,"My Mom is a Principal at a Non-Profit School for Students with Special Needs, Many of Her Employees Have No Choice But to Work after Work. Toured Her School and They Told Me",KingN0,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/s5m1nc/my_mom_is_a_principal_at_a_nonprofit_school_for/,"I would like to first say that my mom by no means had it easy getting to where she is today. She came out of school and got a job as a teacher back when there was a shortage in the 1990s. Worked in a elementary school where kids got bit by rats at home and a little kid brought a knife to school without even realizing it was wrong. By no means do I see her as a bad person. She looks out for her family like everyone else does. Before becoming a principal she started out in administration in very crappy and violent schools that severely underpaid in comparison to the education she had under her belt. 2 masters I can only imagine were pricey. 

This non profit is run by some guy who sues school districts that don’t give children with special needs the proper attention that they deserve. Children with special needs are very neglected in this country.. even in a state like New York, so I can only imagine how horrible it is in places like Texas and Florida. I know because I work with them. I have two jobs myself. My first job is the easiest thing in the world. Looking after my brother who has severe autism and gets seizures. He hated all his workers and wants to have independence so he’s been extremely resistant to every worker that tried to work towards his goals. Unfortunately I believe he’s too far gone because of the neglect in his middle-high school years and at this point I’m just there to make sure he doesn’t fall and hit his head. But don’t get me wrong I do as much as I can to add value beyond that. I go food shopping, do his laundry, clean up after him, cook for him. But at the same time he hates being helped yet won’t do anything for himself half the time. It is really sad. He’s got awesome qualities but he’s been babied too much and it’s a mess. But now I get paid $20 an hour for doing what I essentially did for him since I was 12. It’s a full time role so I get 40 hrs. 

He goes to a special program at a university upstate for young adults with special needs. My parents begged me to go up and support him for his final year since I’ve been doing school online, so I decided to go because it’s easy money. To keep myself busy since my brother hates me being on top of him, I got a part time job working with his friends at the university. This university charges their students 70K for room and board it is so sickening. The ‘students’ with special needs go for free since they aren’t getting a degrees in anything. They pay me $14 an hour but it’s just to keep myself busy. Long story short the situation at the program is to the point where many of the the helpers at this program capitulate and do all their homework for the classes they’re in. I wasn’t with that so I literally told them to absorb what they could and tried to encourage independence as much as I could. But if you have the brain of an elementary schooler…. it’s an impossible task. 

So back to my mom’s school. This non-profit has a lot of money coming in. They have a backlog of students coming in from multiple school districts. The problem? They pay their paraprofessionals, teacher’s assistants, and teachers… not so well. That’s normally the case in non profit schools though. Each kid needs a dedicated Paraprofessional and the budget for each kid is maybe like 80-100K. Rough estimates. Para’s make 15-16 hourly, TAs make 18, and teachers have a salary range between 42-65K depending on experience and education. So when you crunch the numbers it makes sense why they are paid so little. Because the budget is garbage for all the needs they have. Because of the needs for students they run 12 months but they do get holidays and smaller break periods like Christmas Eve to New Years and spring break and a few weeks off in the summer. 

I took a tour of the school when I returned with my brother during thanksgiving and helped out for the day. Towards the end of the day one of the employees mentioned that after this they were heading to their next job. She told me to stay in school and work hard. That’s the goal you know? I’ve worked in Dunkin’ Donuts, Target and I’ve worked for a family outside my own that bullied me to the point where I had to abandon the young adult I had spent the last 8 weeks building a friendship with. Good kid, but his psycho dad made me give them the finger. That’s a whole other story. 

It’s so sad though. America is a shadow of its former self. Back in the day you’d get a job right out of high school 40 hrs a week and get full benefits, pension, and be able to buy real estate with 2-3 years pay. Nowadays that’s laughably impossible. But my mom still has this delusion that I’ll make 6 figures coming out of college in spite of how terribly her employees get paid. Some of the paras/ TAs have bachelors. If I’m lucky I’ll come out of school making ~75K in total compensation for a managerial job that’s going to work me 50-70 hours a week. That’s…. If I’m lucky and the slave drivers at my internship this summer like me. Most of the marketing gigs that are out there are either freelance or have salaries well below the 50s. Was a finance major but then I was mentored by a VP of a smaller institutional firm. He was so out of touch and told me that I would need 3-4 internships to get my foot in the door anywhere. And if I complain about that my parents would just tell me I picked the wrong major or something. The fucking hypocrisy."

I have a 4.0 GPA, am well known around my school community, and have a strong connection with teachers, faculty, and other kids. Furthermore, I'm a very involved student in terms of extracurriculars; I'm president of a few clubs in school, I do a couple of internships outside of school, and I do a lot of volunteer service. What I'm trying to get at is the fact that I'm the ""high-achieving good kid"", for whatever that's worth.

Alright, time to actually get into the meat of this situation, and just so I'm not beating around the bush this is what happened to me: In my 9th-grade year during a school party, a large group of students took edibles and smoked weed. Everyone was at some fast-food joint, and my friend and I were only around that crowd because my friend's cousin was there -- so, I guess you could say this was just a wrong place wrong time situation. The person who was selling the drugs saw us, peer-pressured us to buy them, and eventually we took them. Now, I take full accountability for purchasing the drugs and then consuming them, but there is a lot of nuance in this situation. In terms of this being my fault, I was definitely being a dumb teenager who didn't actually understand how marijuana worked (even though I sat through plenty of health classes explaining drugs), so I ""underestimated"" my tolerance for weed. When everyone goes to the party, everything is fine for the first hour, and then the high finally hits -- I had never been high before, so naturally, I was panicking. I think the weed was just bad because everyone was having a terrible high, and we were all caught. Some kids were throwing up in the hallway, eyes were blood-shot red, and everyone was just acting really sus. Even though it's not important to the story, I got caught because a security guard saw that I was trying to leave the party early and thought it was sus, and then she involved the Assistant Principal. I managed to play it off as a panic attack, but once they noticed that a lot of kids weren't ""feeling well"", they assumed I also took something and my whole ruse was shamed.

For all the students who got caught, we were sent into the Principal's office the following day to discuss punishment. The person who was distributing the drugs got the worse punishment (I think they even involved the police with her, but I'm not quite sure), but for everyone else who simply took the drugs, we got it off pretty easy. We had some lunch detention and a one-day in-school suspension; we also had to tell our parents and sign a bunch of papers, was forbidden from going to the next dance, etc. However, we barely got to serve our punishment because two weeks later, quarantine hit -- everything went online, and the whole situation sort of got swept under the rug. The administration never forgot about us or our punishment, but they determined that all remaining lunch detentions and punishments would be voided; so, I never actually served my in-school suspension.

Now that you're briefed on the situation, here's my issue: I'm stressed the fuck out about my disciplinary record in terms of applying to college. Like, I think about it at least once a day, and I just feel really shitty about it. Before I ask for some advice, here's a list of relevant things that could be helpful to know:

* The whole situation is not listed on my transcript, nor will my school actively send out any form of my disciplinary record to colleges unless specifically requested.
* Since the in-school suspension was voided, I never served it, and it's technically not on any form of record -- just the fact that I received it.
* All of this happened when I was in the 9th grade, a lot of time has passed since then. I've shown genuine remorse about the whole ordeal and demonstrated character growth -- after being rejected from National Honor's Society in the 10th grade, I reapplied this year and got in because of how much improvement I showed (basically I became a more active member of the school community by being a tutor, joining clubs, etc).
* I have an incredibly strong relationship with my Principal, Assistant Principals, and Guidance Counselor. Ironically, I have the closest relationship with the Assistant Principal who handles everything discipline-related -- so, I'm assured that they will write me a letter about the situation if I need it and that they will be on my side throughout the whole college process.
* Just to sum it all up, if you really think about it, it's almost as if this whole discipline situation never even happened. It's not on any record, none of the administration will actively go out of their way to mention it, and the punishment itself was voided.

Everything I've listed may work in my favor, but here's the thing: I don't want to lie on my applications -- even though the whole situation may appear as though it never had even happened on paper, I know in my heart that it did happen, and that's what matters. I don't want to lie and have that diminish my character, but I don't want to say too much to the point where it's unnecessary and simply hurts my chances of getting into a competitive college. I'm looking for some general advice on this topic, but here are some specific questions that I would love to have answered:

* I know Common App removed their disciplinary question, but I also know specific colleges can still ask for any disciplinary history. Seniors, have you come across the disciplinary questions on college applications? I'm asking in terms of T20 schools, if you could list any that you remember that would be really appreciated.
* When applying to colleges, I think I want to be practical about this situation; if a college doesn't ask about anything disciplinary-related, I won't reveal it. However, how do I go about the colleges that do ask for it? I've read some Reddit posts and a lot of them advise against revealing any of those details because 1) colleges don't care that much 2) if it's not on any record, it's better to just not say anything because the chances of an AO directly calling the school to double-check is abysmally low. But, I also don't want to lie and get blacklisted from every college -- what is the best course of action for me?
* Has anyone been in a situation similar to the one I'm currently experiencing, and how did it work out for you? I need some peace of mind knowing that it's still possible for me to have a bright future.

I know this is a very long post, so I'm going to wrap it up here. I'm a very high-achieving student who's looking to apply to T20 and Ivy schools next year, and this whole disciplinary situation is a poor demonstration of who I am as a student -- this was really out-of-character for me, and I've been ashamed of myself for this for a while. Thanks for reading!

TLDR: I'm a Junior applying to colleges next year, but I have a drug-related disciplinary offense. However, it will not appear on any transcript, the administration will be on my side during the admission process, and my punishment was voided due to the pandemic/quarantine. How should I go about applying to colleges, specifically the T20, if they ask for my disciplinary history?"

I am a freshman, started applying a little later than I should've so I missed out on the big tech fresh/soph programs. 

Instead, I've been trying to target startups that would be a fun place to work. I interned last summer as a software engineer, got a lot of practical work experience in a \~20 employee environment. This year, I want to try and intern at a bigger startup, like high growth, Series C, etc. 

Is emailing recruiters at companies with about \~100-600 employees a viable strategy to try and find internships? If not, where can I find companies specifically in this range? Not super small but not super big either.

Background: I previously went to a well known university for 3 years studying psychology/women’s and gender studies. Roughly a year ago, I decided to withdraw for various reasons: I already have about $60k in student loans, I 100% knew I would not want to work in ANY of those fields and was not in a good mindset at the time for college, I already had a job lined up with a previous internship unrelated to the programs studied (roughly $35k/year), and I wanted to have time to really decide if college is for me and if so, what I wanted to study before I went further into debt. 

Now the real struggle. After the year off, I’ve really come to decide I’m super passionate about computer science and more specifically, interested in going into either software engineering or data science after taking the Harvard CS50 course. I know I want to go back to school and study computer science and minor in data science or statistics, but I cannot decide whether I want to go online or in person. While the online course is $1k cheaper/semester and can work around my 9-5, it would take me twice as long since a lot of my credits won’t transfer. On the other hand, I could go back to my previous 4-year school in half the time (roughly 1-2 years) but I would need to quit my 9-5 job. 

I don’t want to make a dumb decision especially with being so far in debt, but I really want to set up my future well and I’ve heard from other software engineers that a computer science degree is typically a weed out (regarding applicants) for major employers. Any advice?"

it would take me approximately 4 years to get a degree and I might be able to do an internship during this time, on the other hand, from reading online it says that a lot of self-taught programmers are able to get their first job after 1 year of learning.

so in these 4 years, I would spend in college I could learn by myself and already get 2-3 years of work  I also think I would enjoy this path more.

so am I crazy to be thinking this way? how important is it to have a degree? please tell me what I'm missing"

s5qkzl,20,2022-01-16,The Broken Bell (Final),AM_Hathazard,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/s5qkzl/the_broken_bell_final/,"[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/s2jwvp/the_broken_bell_part_1/)

I lurched backward, body thudding against the opposite wall. The bathroom door swung shut, blocking Blaine's lifeless body from view and sinking me back into darkness. Even then, the sight of his crimson blood contrasting against the stark tile stayed imprinted in my vision. I blinked desperately, trying to shake it away.

It wasn't until a few seconds later that I started to scream.

""If that one's occupied,"" a bored voice cut through my terror. I turned to find the bartender at the end of the hall, leaning against the entranceway. She flashed a wicked grin. ""You can always use the ladies room. I won't tell. Promise.""

""What did you...who are...what-""

""Dude, what the fuck?"" Keagan appeared next to her, swaying slightly, as though his feet were rounded at the bottom. His rocks glass was still gripped tight.

""Blaine,"" I stammered, straining to lift one finger toward the door. ""He's dead. Oh God, he's dead.""

The words swirled around him, failing to penetrate the brow-raised confusion etched into his face. ""He's…?"" he began.

""Dead,"" the bartender finished, and then jerked forward, one arm raising to connect with his lower back. He let out a single grunt, staggering forward. It wasn't until his face was buried in the carpet that I saw the hilt of a blade sticking up from him.

This time the screams began from the sitting area.

A crashing noise followed, and over the bartender's shoulder I saw Emma and Amanda scrambling toward the door. I was frozen in place by the bartender's piercing smile, though my heart seemed convinced we were running a marathon.

She raised her empty hands to me and my eyes caught on her eagle tattoo. She raised them further, running her fingers through her thick dark hair, drawing my attention to her face. The smattering of freckles along the bridge of her nose was just barely illuminated by the light from the rail behind her. I gasped, feet shuffling backward. She hadn't had freckles when I spoke to her earlier

She hadn't. But Keagan did.

A high top chair crashed through the air, connecting with a thick crunch to the back of her head and sending her sprawling onto all fours. Behind her, Rob shook like a leaf, legs of the chair still gripped in his hands, his knuckles pale.

""Come on!""

I took off after him, brushing past the woman writhing on the floor, leaping over the chair he dropped when he turned. We'd just made it to the mouth of the entrance hall when Amanda and Emma emerged, inky tears staining their cheeks.

""It's locked,"" Amanda sobbed.

""What do we do?"" Emma grabbed my arm.

I was still in a numb state, talking in the scene before me in fits and flashes. They seemed to exist parallel to the still images that came before them, of that night so many years ago which changed my life completely. My shoulder, colliding with the wall as I stumbled toward the exit. Rob, cigarette dangling from his lips, calling me a pussy when I face planted on the cold cement just outside. Finishing our smokes and trying to head back…

Only to find the door had been locked behind us.

Rob fished his cell out of his pocket, punching in the emergency number. I came back to myself, turning to find that our attacker was no longer on the floor where we'd left her. Wasn't anywhere at all.

""Do you see where she went?"" I said. Next to me, Emma trembled.

""I don't understand,"" she whispered, again and again as though on a loop. ""I don't understand.""

""No signal."" Rob shoved his phone back in his pocket. ""We need the keys.""

I'd often thought, over the years, that Rob was cold. Harsh. It caused more than a few clashes between the two of us. At that moment, I appreciated his practicality more than I could put into words.

Both of our eyes fell to the deserted bar rail, the same thought flashing through our minds. Emma was nearing hysteria. Amanda pulled her into a hug, stroking her hair to calm her. I sucked in a deep breath, and then nodded. We took a couple tentative steps toward the bar.

The music cut out with a single burst of static, so loud it made me cringe, and then silence bubbled up in its place. The coolers buzzed from the other side of the room. My heart pitter patterned in my ears.

Rob pushed forward, taking the corner leading behind the bar before pausing. ""She's not back here."" My eyes fell on the swinging door leading further into the establishment.

And then another sound cut through, bursting from the speakers and echoing throughout the empty room. Engulfing us. A laugh, high-pitched and sweet. It made my stomach sink to the floor.

""Isn't this place awesome?"" The voice asked. Marjorie's voice, blaring all around.

""Yeah, super cool."" That was Amanda, but not from where she stood behind me. I glanced back at her. Her face was pale.

""I guess,"" said Emma's voice from the recording, bored and clipped.

""Hey, what's your issue? You've been snappy all night."" Marjorie was always a straight to the point kind of person. It resulted in a fair share of clashes between her and Emma.

""What the fuck do you think is wrong?"" past Emma snapped, words clear, well enunciated. The opposite of how she'd sounded all night. She'd said she'd blacked out that night, all those years ago.

""This is ridiculous,"" said Amanda, here and now, pulling away from Emma and stalking to the bar. She brushed past Rob, who looked just as confused as I was. Soon she was digging around near the register, pulling at the visible cords plugged into the stereo box near the register.

""I really don't know."" The recording, Marjorie, continued unabated. My knees felt weak, as if I were melting into the floor. Her voice...I hadn't heard it in a decade. It threatened to rupture a wound I'd thought had long since healed.

Behind me, Emma whispered, ""I don't understand.""

And then her voice carried over the speaker.

""What, Ben wasn't enough for you? You need everything that's mine?"" My gaze dropped to my feet. Before Marjorie and I had gotten together, I'd gone on a date or two with Emma. It was an easy, fun sort of thing, but it's been clear enough there was no big connection there. Or I’d thought it had. It wasn't anything like what I felt when Marjorie and I kissed for the first time.

Past Emma continued.

""You want my earrings, too? How about my shoes? Maybe I should whip my panties off and hand them over, huh?""

Amanda's howling laughter spilled from the speakers, joined by some hooping and hollering from Blaine or Keagan, maybe both.

""Emma."" Marjorie’s voice was low and careful. ""I didn't take the internship away from you. They just chose me instead.""

""Oh, fuck off!""

Behind the bar, Amanda jerked her hand back, yanking a cord free and burying us all in heavy silence. No one seemed to know what to say. If they were anything like me, they didn't know what to think, either.

""You didn't say you fought with her that night."" Rob was the one who finally broke the silence, glancing back and forth between the two women. I instinctively took a step closer to him, feeling suddenly exposed.

""It wasn't a big deal,"" Amanda insisted. ""We were just drunk.""

""Then why didn't you mention it?"" I asked.

""Because it didn't matter!"" Emma shouted. I spun to look at her. She'd snapped out of her trance, face now a mask of rage. Rage and something else, something more desperate.

But my attention was drawn beyond her, to the smattering of paintings hanging on the wall. I wasn't sure what to make of them. I rubbed my eyes and focused in. They were different than they'd been only moments before. They were moving. Not the pictures themselves, but the images captured within.

They were changing.

Suddenly, there was Marjorie, smiling out at me from an decades-old oil painting.

She pulled me forward like a magnet, until I brushed past Emma and became lost in the measured strokes. There she was, my Marjorie, sitting in a booth, surrounded by our friends. I was there too, head in my hands. If the picture was in full motion I would've been rocking in my seat.

The next painting to the right was a different style, more abstract, clearly made by another artist. It continued where the previous one left off, showing me heading off toward the door, Rob nowhere to be seen as it focused in on the group that remained.

The next was a pencil drawing. In it Marjorie was standing, and Emma was pushing up from the table to join her, mouth a snarl.

""Ben, don't look. Stop!"" Emma grabbed my arm and I jerked it away. When she reached again, Rob grabbed her by the elbow, face grim. He was looking up at the pictures as well.

My eyes flicked through the pictures quickly, following them to the next wall as they carried on around the corner. Emma's hand collided with Marjorie's cheek. She shoved Emma back toward the table. Amanda rushed in to bury her hand in Marjorie’s long brown hair. Several more blows occurred. Blaine cheered from the background. Keagan stood, trying to get in between them.

They were separated, but Amanda gave her one last shove for good measure.

Marjorie's head connected with the edge of a nearby table. Everyone stared as she lay motionless on the barroom floor.

A gasp tore me away from the scene unwinding before me. Amanda was still at the bar, the bartender now behind her. She glanced down at her chest where a long knife protruded out the front. Blood welled around the wound, then rushed out like a tide when the blade was pulled clean. She collapsed onto the floor.

""They killed her,"" I whispered, lingering on the shock of dark hair around the bartender's face. ""They killed you.""

""I'm not Marjorie,"" she said simply, folding her arms over her chest. ""But I am what's left. Enough to make a difference.""

I looked back toward the pictures, saw Blaine and Keagan dragging Marjorie toward the bathrooms.

""They stuffed her into the supply cabinet,"" the bartender explained. ""She wasn't dead, though. Not yet.""

""What do you want from us?"" Emma snapped, pushing past Rob to point a finger in her direction. Rob shrank away, disgusted. ""What does this even have to do with you?""

""She waited,"" the bartender continued, a sly grin lighting her face, eyes fixed on Emma. ""Until they turned away. They were scared, but she was calm. She grabbed the bleach off the ground and opened Marjorie’s mouth.""

""Shut up! Just shut up! It was an accident."" Wild eyes looked back in my direction. ""An accident. I never would have hurt her on purpose!""

""No one ends up here by accident, Emma."" The bartender flickered, disappeared, and a moment later stood on the other side of the rail, knife once more in her hand. ""You wanted her to hurt, so we came. We gave you what you asked for.""

She took a step forward, and all three of us reeled back. Emma stumbled and reached for me. I yanked my arm back and kept moving until my back hit the wall. She turned to Rob, who held his hands up defensively.

""I didn't ask for this! I don't want anyone to die!""

""No,"" the bartender agreed. ""This time, Marjorie asked for you.""

A flash and she was on her, knife sunk deep in her gut. Rob and I watched in horror as she slipped to the floor, fingers grasping at the gaping wound. The bartender turned and headed off toward the back, emerging with an open bottle of bleach and a wicked grin. My stomach lurched when she trained her eyes on me. That only made her laugh.

It was a high, good natured laugh. A laugh I'd once loved.

""You should leave,"" she told us, motioning with the bottle towards the door. ""Before one of us decides it wants you as well.""

Even with that opening, I couldn't move. My feet were frozen in place, my mind longing to make sense of it all. Longer to touch her, hold her. Run my fingers through her hair. It was Rob that finally shook me out of it, pulled me off and out into the alley.

For the second time in our lives we stood outside the now locked Broken Bell Speakeasy. Shaken. Lives forever changed. Only this time we knew it. Knew that the second we walked away, the bar would fade back into obscurity, swallowing up the bodies of our friends like a beast in the night.

This time, I was happy to let it keep [them.](https://www.reddit.com/user/AM_Hathazard)"

Is knowing the basics of common front end and back end languages, APIs, and how they all work together the minimum requirements of landing a job? I’m asking purely about web dev skills, disregarding interview skills on DS and Algos. I’d appreciate the responses."

I try to look up on LinkedIn, Indeed and etc using ""software engineer I"" or ""new grad"" or ""entry-level"" but there are not that many jobs and some still expect years of experience.

Since I am a sophomore, this is my first internship and will probably do atleast 1 or 2 more in the future.

What can I realistically do over the course of 1 year to not only improve my job prospects but also make me a better SWE? I know that LC would help me with clearing more interviews but atm, I am not getting many interviews to start with. 

I've added some of my background info to provide more context.

I've been at my current (first) job for around 6 months (3 months internship + 3 mo FE). I get paid 64k a year (working from home in NJ). 

 Most of my work is front end development with the occasional python scripting. I graduated with my Masters in IS in 2021. My portfolio website currently has two projects: 

* A react based movie ticket booking application 

* A flask based restaurant finding project

My primary language is python. My day to day work doesn't really require me to learn a lot, it isn't very challenging. 

I've been thinking of working on an AWS project and the certificate to maybe add more value to my Portfolio. 

I would love to hear any suggestions that you guys have. Thanks!"

I’m about halfway through my bachelors in CompSc and while I’m enjoying the challenges and learning, I am starting to doubt some of my initial assumptions about this path. I was under the impression that going CompSc instead of Cyber was beneficial because they could both lead into the same careers but the aforementioned would give me greater depth and more options. However, as I have peeled back the layers on things I begin to feel more and more that going cybersecurity would be an underutilization of the abilities I have been procuring. The interviews that I have gotten for internships all assume that I am going devops or cloud, and are visibly confused when I begin talking about cybersecurity specific paths and roles. This prompted me to look into them and it immediately became clear why. They don’t understand why I would get a bachelors and then go be on help desk or another jr. role to learn a different discipline. Conversely, the impression that I’ve been getting from Cyber guys is that no one cares about a CompSc degree in that industry. Further, no ones wasting time on something that hard that isn’t a certification. I don’t know what to do honestly. I’m too far along in my degree to change it. I’m not sure I’d want to, I enjoy coding… I also enjoy working with people though. 

So my questions, for those of you who have done one or the other of these is; what are the benefits of these paths? I want to be as efficient as possible with my pursuits but I don’t know enough about the differences to confidently put my chips on anything. Will I actually be overqualified in cybersecurity roles with this degree, does it even help me there? Is the pay and career growth/potential better for one or the other? Honestly just hoping someone with some insight would be willing to share..

Anyways, sorry for the barrage of questions and thanks for reading."

Here's my story, hopefully it motivates someone out there to keep going. The blood, sweat, and tears spent studying &amp; grinding Leetcode/CTCI is all worth it.

I grew up in poverty. My single mother barely had the money to cover the electricity bills. I was only allowed to plug in my internet router and use my computer from 7PM to 10PM because those were off-peak hours (lower hydro costs). I was working at McDonalds for $9.60/hour at one point. I was young and naive, I had no idea what I would do for a living but I chose Computer Science because I thought it would be cool to learn how to code and hopefully make video games as a profession. I applied to my universities CS program after high school, but was initially rejected because I didn't meet the 75% average cutoff (I was at 74%), so I was admitted into Cognitive Science instead. My only chance at CS from this point was to grind the math courses needed for me to transfer into CS (Discrete Math &amp; Calculus) of which were brutally difficult for me at the time, but I managed to secure a B+ average in my math courses and was accepted into the CS program a year later. As a first year CS student, I was so passionate and determined to do well. To cut it short, I maintained a 3.8 GPA throughout my studies and completed 16 months of internship experience receiving extremely positive grades from my internship supervisors. I then returned to my final year of CS with the mission to secure a New Grad opportunity after graduation. The last few months have been the most painful of my life. Almost all of my relationships have suffered, if not ended because of the grind mentality I had. I was locked in, grinding Leetcode questions, receiving a ton of OA's and applying almost everyday. November was the worst, as I got a record number of rejections and was contemplating suicide at one point. Then December comes around and I get some calls for final round interviews. I'm thinking this is my only shot, so I grinded through the winter break. While my family &amp; friends were partying on Christmas and New Years, I was completing Grokking the Sys Design &amp; Top Interview Questions from Leetcode. Needless to say, I ended up getting an amazing offer with an income that no one in my family would ever dream of seeing. My parents came to Canada for us (me &amp; siblings) to get a good education, and while they struggled to adapt and make ends meet, I hope they're proud of me now and I hope to repay them all that I can.

Lately, I haven't been able to sleep just thinking about how this amount of income would change my life so that's why I'm writing this post. I'm usually just lurking on this subreddit, but I thought it would be nice to give back in some way."

Everyone says how lucky I am to have a big 4 job in UAE but they literally have no ideal so I refrain from talking about my job and pretend to be happy around people. 

To put it in perspective: in my first year of joining the I was happy. I loved loved my job. I was very quick with my deliverables and they were always accurate. Then, the underappreciation began and the pressure. Then I something snapped and I became a shadow of myself. It's going 2 a year now since I started feeling this way but I don't know how to retrace to get my sanity back. I get anxiety every end of weekend (literally crippling anxiety). I'm stuck.

[Context]

I will be finished with my Bachelors degree in a couple weeks. I am currently working as a Tier 2 agent in HelpDesk to pay bills, but am looking forward to a career in DevOps/Cloud Architecture as those are the things that interest me the most.

I am moving soon, and I plan to work on self improvement and certifications to change career paths.

I have read a lot of recent posts about DevOps and Cloud Architecture not being entry level friendly but rather mid/late career options, and, while I have some experience fiddling with some of those, I am not sure what my career and experience should look like moving forward.

[About my skills]

I have fullstack knowledge (Javascript - Angular, PHP - Laravel/CakePHP, SQL - MySQL, MariaDB). Not senior level but enough to make decent responsive websites with good escalation and coding practices and query optimization (in SQL mostly).

As for other languajes, I know what Id call basic Java (Threads and concurrency too) C++ , Pyton (Pandas, numpy, BOTO3 and flask), bash (basic scripting and bunch of linux commands).

I also have pretty basic UML and GIT knowledge.

I also know some AWS (Firehose, Datastreams, EC2, lambda and S3) and some other random stuff.

[Previous experience]

Before my Helpdesk job I did an internship testing components in the car industry (C testing and documention) which I did not like much, but I learned a bunch.

(at this point I realise I could have just posted my resume).

[TL:DR]

Given my knowledge and experience, what jobs should I search for to pave my way into DevOps/Cloud architecture roles and what should I look into the most to prepare for these?

Thank you so much for reading and any comments are really appreciated."

I was still allowed to do my bachelor thesis if I would get the missed credits next year. I keep trying to write the first chapters, I know I can do it but i’m not able to. I feel burnt out for pushing too hard. I want to make it but I can’t.

I want to take a gap semester so that I can work, recharge and get back in September with a year of delay.

I know I should but it seems unconventional and don’t want to seem too weak. If I can’t handle it now, how will I be able to handle a career after graduation?

Summer of 2020, I was approached by a recruitment company to interview for a London-based start-up. I was shortlisted on Friday, had the interview with Shamil\*, the owner of the company, on Sunday.

Shamil said that he was hiring because he was growing his company, which didn't set off any alarms as I did some research and the company just seemed like a run of the mill, poorly marketed start-up. My background was perfect to help get his company's marketing going. I got the job and was asked to start on Monday (immediately).

I was with the company for a few months:

1. LinkedIn said that this company had over 20 employees, with a couple of poorly filled out profiles that I now realise are fake - there were actually 3 interns and I was the only other employee (he hired a Project Manager (Sarah) 2 weeks after he hired me)
2. During this time, he worked his employees to death. Texting and emailing us at all hours of the day, including sundays. Expecting 1 person to do the work of 3. Bullying employees, gaslighting, talking down to us like we were idiots, basically creating a toxic work environment.
3. He isolated us, and said things in private that made us become wary of each other in group spaces. Nobody in the company trusted each other. People started to become very vile towards each other.
4. He got me to send him an invoice monthly that basically said I was a contractor, and told me not to use the word ""Salary"". I was a new immigrant and didn't know what PAYE was, and my NI was delayed due to situations (offices were shut). Didn't know that I didn't need an NI for PAYE.
5. According to employees, he didn't pay into their pension fund (as stipulated in the contract), and kept making excuses. They had to threaten to report Shamil to HMRC to get their pension. It had been ongoing for over 6 months, and it took legal threats to get Shamil to pay up.
6. He used an accounting firm that ""somehow"" kept making mistakes with our salary. Salaries were often delayed for weeks. Towards the end, we refused to work until he deposited the salary into our accounts and he accused us of being bad team players.
7. The product that we launched costs over £5,000 to apply for. The content of the product is filled with content that the interns Googled, and would only be exported on the day of publication. It's completely shoddy work, and definitely not worth the money. The amount he charges is arbitrary as well, as he would make up a number and tell me to plug it on the website/send it to a potential client.

Unsurprisingly when I left the company, he outsourced my role to contractors and my job had to be split between a total 4 different people - he was saving a fortune by hiring me. He bad-mouthed me for months after I left.

I found out about this via Sarah, who valiantly stuck around for a few more months before handing in her resignation. 

When she left, Shamil gave her a good reference - only to call Sarah's new boss a few weeks later to say that she was lazy and a poor leader. Luckily for Sarah, her new boss wrote Shamil off as a vindictive asshole.

So Reddit, is there anything we can do to warn others about this man and his business? 

There will be severe repercussions if he finds out that we've posted about him online, but it's disgusting how he goes about ruining lives and careers.

**TLDR: Old boss is a vile and vindictive asshole. Created a toxic work environment, delayed salaries, and might be avoiding taxes. Is there anything we can do to warn people about him?**"

I'm 24, I was hired as a paid intern out of my relevant MA degree for £18k (I live in London) in February of last year. In September I was taken on full time for £26k. As a first job, from home and honestly fairly low stress that seemed fair to me.

Now, since then I have honestly taken on and, to an extent, been required to take on, much more than my role entails. My colleague in the same position does much less than me (and I'm starting to think she's onto something). This has been noticed by my old manager, my current manager, and pretty much every other high level person I've interacted with. I'm constantly going above and beyond and it is certainly noticed. However, considering I'm taking on the responsibilities of a strategist more than a talent manager, my current pay and position are starting to feel too tight.

I'm not very assertive in these situations, but my boyfriend is encouraging me to bring up the matter of promotion or raise before the 1 year mark. I don't know how to feel about it as the situation gives me a lot of anxiety. At the same time it's just not me to do less knowing I could do more, if that makes sense.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think I should wait it out? Bring it up? We have enough in savings that I can dedicate a month to job search worse case scenario, and I'm always sending out a few cvs every week with mixed results.

My old company has drained me from all my motivation to work and I have been on a huge burnout for the past few months, which is why I decided to quit. How do I ensure that that burnout won't affect my new job as well?""  


And for those of you that need some more info. I have been working in my current company for more than a year. I started working there as part of a three month internship for my Uni, and they decided to keep me full-time. The three month internship was ok-ish, learnt some stuff etc, and because I still had to write my Master Thesis, and I thought that it would look good on my CV to have some work experience in my field (Machine Learning Engineering) before finishing my studies, I decided to agree to the offer.   
The pay wasn't great but as I was still a student, living with my mom, i didn't really think much of it, as long as I had projects to do, and could learn more stuff, which I thought I had. Ohh how the turntables.... The moment I started working there full-time, my Senior left the company. As the months progressed I realized that the company had zero vision on ML, I didn't have stuff to do unless I suggested some nice features on projects I was on, the rest of the Data Science Team was excluding both me and my project partner from the DS Team (they are doing mostly Data Analysis etc while we were more into Deep Learning etc), which didn't help at all considering both me and her were new to the company, started working there remotely, and had no prior work experience (she was a Phd grad and started working at the company few days before me). So we both were very alienated and decided to search for a new job.

She was luckier than I was since she had a Phd and in that field it is a huge plus, and unfortunately there are not many Junior job openings in that field in my country. So she left first, which meant I was all alone. As my burnout was getting bigger and bigger I finally landed a huge opportunity for me, working as a Researcher in a company with a clear vision etc. 

Which brings us to today. I am currently 2 weeks away from starting working at the new company. Right now my burnout from my current position is humongous. To the point I can barely get focused for more than 30 minutes, which is rare for me considering I was always the person to work my a\*\* off to do the best possible job I could, without procrastinating. I am scared that the burnout will affect me at my new position, especially because I will keep working remotely for the first few months (the company is currently renovating the offices and till they are done I will have to work from home).   


Is there a way to just relax my mind, and get rid of the burnout somehow because it's really affecting me mentally and I really don't want to screw up the new job, since it is a position I am so excited for."

it would take me approximately 4 years to get a degree and I might be able to do an internship during this time, on the other hand, from reading online it says that a lot of self-taught programmers are able to get their first job after 1 year of learning.

so in these 4 years, I would spend in college I could learn by myself and already get 2-3 years of work I also think I would enjoy this path more.

so am I crazy to be thinking this way? how important is it to have a degree? please tell me what I'm missing"

However, as a first-year student like me, I do not know much about how to get one. I looked for their requirements and most of them states that I only need to have experience with at least one object-oriented programming language (i'm currently studying Java so that's OK for me) and I must be willing to work as a team (which is also fine). The question is, although the requirements are easy to satisfy, are there anything that I could do in order to get an internship easier? (I think it might be competitive as everyone is applying too). 

Also, I have heard that for an internship I need to be interviewed as well, but I have no experiences about this, nor have I participated one before, so what should I do?

Each being simple but needed to be tracked off. 

My issue is that I don’t know if I have an unaddressed mental issue but unlike others I can’t keep track of those many small things. Like growing up I was the smart kid that forgot things all the time. I cruised through college because inherently tests and exams came easy for me and for projects my friends would cover reminding me of homework’s and covering up that flaw of mine. 

Now a year into my career as an engineer this issue with short term memory is causing problems at my job. This job unlike all my other internships and experiences is very heavy into small things needing to be kept track of. Toss in it being in a fab my old technique of setting up my desk and laptop to have sticky notes to keep track of things isn’t a viable option. 

After a year I’m realizing this is a perfect storm of incompatibility between my job and how I function. If the job kept up the level of small things that constantly need to be tracked of but it was mostly from my desk and not in a fab where 10 things get tossed on me without the ability to sit down and digest I’d be fine. Or if it was more like a data science job where it’s highly complicated but less projects with there being 1-2 large ones I’d be fine also. 

Wondering how to bring this up to my boss. I just had my annual performance review and I barely just barely met requirements while in other types of jobs I’ve had I aced with flying colors. 

I work in a large tech adjacent company so I’m trying to figure out how to ask to be moved to another engineering division.

Here is the 107th installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

I have been working for an inpatient substance abuse treatment facility for the last 6 months. I handle intakes for new admissions including signing all documentation and completing assessments within 24 or 72 hours upon admission to the program. It’s a small facility with a max of 6-7 patients. As of late I have been made to feel inadequate at my job by the CEO who nitpicks small details within my clinical documentation such as: bullet points rather than a narrative, adding info not stated by the patient directly (he calls it conceptualizing), and not time stamping/signing documentation prior to its completion within the 24 hour or 72 hour period.

I work 3-11pm most days and when I facilitate an intake (two in the last 4 weeks) and he is unhappy with the work, he expects me to drop what I am doing on my days off (or 4 hours prior my shift) to come in and review and fix ‘mistakes’. My clinical hours are being supervised by a contracted LCSW and the last time this happened, I talked to him about this (not even a 1.5 week ago). He told me that it might be best to brush it off and just talk to him about it in supervision, or call/text.

This hasn’t been an issue before, I have done multiple intakes (maybe 8-9 total: PPO insurance and private pay makes it difficult for people needing help) Treatment is very expensive. It seems like his standards are constantly changing and I don’t know what to expect. Last time this happened he stated that only one person, the substance abuse counselor,  is the only person who knows how to do it properly. I know that he recycles the template and changes relevant information to match the patient.

I feel inadequate and miserable. My anxiety increases and I have worked very hard to keep it in check for the last 4 years. I am proud of the work that I do, the field that I chose, and hold myself to a high standard to ensure client care.

I just don’t know what do to, and would greatly appreciate advice or insight. I feel like I’ve reached the end of my patience.
Hopefully this made sense, kind of at a loss for words."

I got my first after-graduating job as software engineer almost 1,5 year ago. It started all good and we were using Bitbucket, AWS, Java, Angular and all the front-end family. I got to know a lot especially about AWS where I knew nothing and I also did the first AWS Certificate. We were two devs, a senior and me as a junior.

During the summer my company decided to move the software we were developing to another platform called Appian. It is a low code platform, with integrated cloud and pipeline and a very specific scripting language and logic which is not found in any other tool. So I am down to using one tool basically which is low-code and feels very limited. The senior dev moved to another team and a business analyst became dev like me. So we are two juniors now in a new platform.

My previous experience was a one year job with C# .NET and a 6-month internship with C++ and C#.   
My question is, since I am in the beginning of my career and already have worked with OOP which are considered a bit more advanced, is it good to go to low-code? To be honest it feels like a downgrade or a turn to the wrong direction. I am also curious if this will affect my future ""employ-ability"".

Hello. I (17M) am a high school student from Colombia and I’m kinda lost rn, so I decided to come here for some advice. I am a bit nervous about this future thing.

So, where am I right now? 

Well, I’m graduating from school in June. I have pretty clear what I want to study (Computer Science or Math or both or maybe some other engineering). I speak Spanish, Italian, English and a bit of German. I am not amazingly wealthy but my family earns in Colombian pesos, which is like a shit tier currency so I can’t expect a lot of financial support from them, specially in foreign countries. To help you imagine my situation my mother, whom has a pretty high ranking job in the education sector, earns 1500 dollars a mont. My father earns a bit more but the point is clear, money is not abundant. I have good grades even if my work ethic is nonexistent and I spend most of my time watching YouTube and playing videogames. I am specially good at English (it is really easy if you can just understand basic vocabulary), Maths, Physics, Informatics and Spanish. I have a basic understanding of coding and did an internship in a small software company. I was miserable while working on there, but I think it was mostly due to my poor work ethic and not understanding completely the subject in question (I had to document some micro services in Springboot using Swagger). What else, what else? I have several extracurricular activities such as student representative, athletics practice, participation in several U.N. models, founder of debate, literature and cinema clubs, social service specially working with children from poor families, I have won several essay and short story prizes in inter school competitions, studied German and have done the internship mentioned before. Oh, I have also done several short films but they are not great. 

What are my objectives?

Well, ignoring the unavoidable societal collapse during in the next 30 years I want to have a job which would let me live comfortably since the beginning. I also would like to do something stimulating with management involved. I think engineering carriers are check all this marks so is kinda the path that I am more likely to choose. I also want to leave Colombia. Like rn. So studying outside is fundamental for me. I really have to leave.

Where do I need the advice?

Well, I have several questions for which I would like to get answers. Firstly is where should I study. I’ve been looking at Italian universities like La Sapienza and the Politecnico di Milano and they rank pretty high among the top universities, around 40 in maths and CS. Other places are also possible and my last option is the university of Andes here in Colombia. Which University would you recommend for this subjects (extra points if it is public, has a great scholarship program or is really cheap). I also like to build things with Arduino so I don’t know if something related to that could be a career path to follow (like designing computer parts or something like that). Another possible carrier path is cybersecurity. I am really interested in encryption methods and cryptography and I’m not really interested in becoming a code monkey so something related to the design of this algorithms could be interesting. Also I wanted to ask about employment opportunities for pure mathematicians outside of the academic world. What works can they perform and which companies are employing them? 

So yeah, I’m really lost. Any help is appreciated. Also thank you for standing my kinda awful English."

I'm currently residing in Reno, NV. 
Any information is quite welcome. 

Thank you!"

I’m currently applying to many places for an internship and feel like I’m still behind with skills and experience in the field. I will graduate college next year with a bachelors of business admin in cyber defense with a minor in computer information systems. I have basic C++ skills and just made a Hack the box academy account. Also I’m working on getting my security plus in the coming summer. Is that enough to potentially be hired as an intern somewhere?"

s6io6d,247,2022-01-17,One of my Nurses has an Unhealthy Relationship with her Patient,Voodoo_Clerk,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/s6io6d/one_of_my_nurses_has_an_unhealthy_relationship/,"When Jennifer first came into my practice I didn’t exactly think much of her. She was just like many other bright-eyed and eager nurses who walked through the hospital doors. I soon however watched as she quickly took on the roles that would have tripped many a freshly graduated nurse. I took her under my wing as her attending physician and she took to me like I was another one of her professors. 

We made a great duo with her ability to connect to our patients better than I could and me being the great physician that I already was, we were the talk of the hospital. Though contrary to the rumors our relationship was purely professional and we never so much as entertained the idea of dating each other. We were far too absorbed in our work to bother with anything like that. 

I still remember the day I walked over to a group of nurses, Jennifer among them, who were whispering and chatting up a storm. When they saw me they instantly pulled me into the huddle and asked me a million questions a minute. Finally able to calm them all down I asked them to repeat whatever it had been that they had tried to tell me. Of course, they put Jennifer up to it.

“Jackson LeBlanc is coming here for treatment!” She said in excitement. Now that really got my attention. The name LeBlanc is known throughout the city and maybe even the state. The family is famed for their reclusive nature and the fact that few are ever seen outside their stately home mansion. Despite this, they are big hospital doners, and this LeBlanc, Jackson is believed to be the last living member of the family. 

“Any idea what’s wrong with him?” I asked the nurses, though really just asking Jennifer. They all looked at each other and shook their heads at me. Not a surprise since nobody ever sees or hears from him. “Well even if it is Jackson LeBlanc he’s going to be treated just like any other patient. So let's make sure we’re ready for his arrival.” They all nodded at me and dispersed with Jennifer following after me to make sure we had a room open and ready for Jackson when he arrived. 

As it turned out we didn’t have long to wait as the reclusive rich man arrived less than two hours later. As I stood in the waiting room I watched as he was rolled in on an almost medieval-looking wheelchair. His body was thin and decrepit looking. He looked like he was moments away from expiring just by the looks of him. He sat in his ancient wheelchair with a blanket across his lap. Although what really drew my attention was the shinny metal mask that he wore as he was rolled in. It covered his entire face and left any trace of what he might look like a mystery to us all. 

A thin and tired-looking woman wheeled him in and stepped in front of him as he looked up to me. I couldn’t see any traces of eyes staring back at me as he looked at me. His mask shone as he looked up at me. His head soon drooped to the side to look at Jennifer standing next to me. 

“Monsieur LeBlanc has come here to receive treatment for his illness.” The thin woman said in a tired french accent. I raised a brow at her, never having thought that LeBlanc spoke any kind of French despite his last name. 

“We’re very happy to have you. And will do everything we can to help you. Uhm, Monsieur?” I said in my best imitation of the woman’s french. LeBlanc looked up at me and seemed to process what I was saying before nodding and letting out a strained wheezed breath. 

“I do truly appreciate that, doctor.” His voice was surprisingly young and vibrant despite his obvious deteriorating body. “I’m ready to be treated.” He told us, at which Jennifer stepped away from my side and took control of LeBlanc’s ancient wheelchair. I followed along as we wheeled him into the elevator and up to his room. All eyes were on us as we wheeled him towards his room. People turned to each other and whispered as they watched to display. 

Once we were finally in his room we encountered a problem right away. LeBlanc refused to be taken from his chair and onto the bed. He also refused to change out of his suit or take his mask off. I’ve dealt with my fair share of difficult patients but he certainly took the cake. Soon we were led outside by his maid, the woman who had wheeled him into the hospital. 

“Monsieur LeBlanc is suffering from…” She looked around and leaned in so that we could keep the secret. “Syphilis.” She told us, looking back towards him in his room as he had been placed in front of the window to enjoy some sun on his almost grey skin. I raised a brow at this and looked back at him. 

“For how long?” I asked her, Jennifer also found that hard to believe if her face was any inclination. The maid looked back towards LeBlanc and closed his door so he wouldn’t hear us. And so that we could lose our direct line of sight with him. 

“I believe he inherited it from his mother.” She told us. Which really made me raise a brow. If that was the case and Jackson had gone untreated for this long, it would make sense for the mask and his odd behavior. He was suffering from Neurosyphilis. 

“Nurse?” I turned to Jennifer, finding myself smiling at just calling her that. She returned the smile back at me and perked up at me calling her that. “Order some penicillin for Mr-” But before I could even finish that sentence the maid quickly gripped my arm with her boney and clawlike hands.

“No! Monsieur LeBlanc is allergic to penicillin!” She quickly told me. That was going to be a problem then. As to my knowledge at least, penicillin is the only effective treatment for Neurosyphilis. At that point and with how long he had been suffering from it, the prospects weren’t exactly encouraging. 

Entering back into his room, I was surprised to see that he had somehow made it into his bed and had covered himself up in the blanket that was draped across the bed. He looked over to us as we entered and walked over to his bed. His mass of black hair acted almost like a hood that really kept any idea of how he looked like a mystery to us all. 

“Mr. LeBlanc,” I started to speak but again was quickly grabbed by the woman who was quickly starting to get on my nerves. Looking down at her I watched as she stared pleadingly at me. 

“Monsieur,” She said in an almost whimper. “Call him Monsieur.” She told me, clutching to me like I was the only thing keeping her afloat after the ship she had been on had sunk. Jennifer soon stepped up and over to the reclusive patient and carefully took his hand.

“Monsieur LeBlanc,” She said in an almost perfect French accent. “We’re going to do everything we can to treat you.” Offering him a smile, and a soft pat of his hand the masked figure looked at her for a good long time before he let out a haggard wheeze and a noise I think was a laugh. 

“Merci.” He said, laying back in bed and letting out some soft breathes and wheezes. I could tell he really was suffering from what we thought was Neurosyphilis. And if he was allergic to penicillin as his maid would have us believe. Then he didn’t have much time left. After we left him and his maid alone in their room Jennifer looked back to the room as we were walking away.

“His skin was really cold and clammy.” She told me as she stopped in her place. “We should really order some tests for him. I don’t think he’s suffering from just Neurosyphilis.” She said in a worried tone I had only seen in her when she had emotionally attached herself to a patient. Something not too common with her, but when it happened she would make sure she took charge of said patient. 

“I’ll be sure to run the whole nine yards on him. Though in his condition he’d be lucky if he could even get past the starting line.” I joked which got me an elbow into my ribs by here. We chuckled as we headed off together. And the horrorshow that was ‘Monsieur’ LeBlanc really began. 

Jackson LeBlanc soon turned into the patient from hell. As he would refuse to be treated or even have the simplest things done to him. Anything we tried to do with him was either blocked by his maid, Irene. Or by the man himself. It was like pulling teeth just to get his blood pressure. And when we did take it we were shocked to see it was 50 over 33. So low that I was wondering how he was even functioning at all. 

“How is he even functioning? At these ratings, he should be seconds from dropping dead.” I said as I scrolled down on the bare patient’s chart we had set up for LeBlanc. Jennifer hovered around me as she usually did, though her attention was completely focused on Leblanc’s room. The door was firmly shut and his curtains were drawn down. 

“He certainly is…eccentric.” She finally said after a bit. Turning to me and checking the chart along with me. Suddenly his door opened up and Irene came shuffling out. The woman was haggard and clearly exhausted. She was pale and by just looking at her I could tell she was malnourished. Making it to the counter she handed up a vial of blood which really got our attention. 

“He finally agreed to a blood test.” Her voice was soft and tired as she handed up this sample. The man had never heaven let us roll up his sleeve to get his blood and here he had somehow gotten us a sample of it. Jennifer took it and handed it over to a passing nurse to take it to get tested. Irene seemingly stood for a solid few minutes before she grabbed her head and started to stumble. 

I stood and tried to reach out to catch her, but she fell backward and collapsed onto the hospital floor like a sack of potatoes. Jennifer and I rushed to her side and quickly checked her vitals. Seeing she was normal but having low blood pressure. Not as low as LeBlanc but low enough for this to occur obviously. We got her sitting up and quickly surmised that she need an IV bag. 

“I need to check on him.” Irene kept mumbling to us. Shrugging off any questions we tried to ask of her involving how this might have happened, or when was the last time she had eaten. All she kept mumbling was her need to check on LeBlanc. Jennifer looked up at me and then stood to go and check on the enigmatic patient. Leaving me to continue my check on Irene. Getting the IV, I started to roll up her sleeve to insert the needle into her. Upon doing so I found her arm was completely covered in tens of bite marks. 

“How on earth did you get these?” I asked her, quickly rolling her sleeve up all the way and just staring in concern at just how many of these deep punctures she had. It was almost like she had been attacked by a million insects. She seemingly came to her senses and ripped her arm away from my grip. 

“Don’t touch me.” That was all she said in response. I respected her boundaries but eventually got her to at least give me her hand so that I could begin to get the IV into her and get her some kind of nutrients. She stared off into space for a bit before she mechanically stood up and nearly caused her needle to get ripped out of her hand as she walked without grabbing her IV stand. I had to pus it after her as she entered the room of LeBlanc. 

Jennifer was sitting in a chair next to the masked man as he was calmly sitting down in his bed. The calmest I had ever seen him since he had checked into the hospital. Jennifer looked over to us with a smile and vacated her seat so that Irene could take her place back at her master’s side. Leaving the two of them I looked to Jennifer with a raised brow. 

“What’d he say?” I asked her, following her back to the nurse’s station as she started to fill up a bit more of the enigmatic man’s medical profile. She looked at me as she typed and was clearly more than a bit excited to tell me what she had experienced. 

“Well, I learned a little about him and his family. Learned that he’s 24. His blood type you know, the stuff we haven’t been able to get out of him?” She said with a confident smirk as she continued to fill up the profile with more of his information. But while she was happy and confident with what she was writing I was a bit more skeptical. 

“24? He looks like he’s in his 90s.” I said as I looked over what she was typing. Occasionally looking up towards the sealed-off room that healed our mysterious patient. “If he does have Neurosyphilis how in the hell is he even functioning? He’s allergic to penicillin and is untreated? He’s barely exhibiting any of the signs.” I thought aloud as I started to add some things together. 

“Well, the mask is to cover the scars he’s gotten from syphilis.” She explained, finishing up the basic profile on him and tapping the enter key. “Not to mention the whole paralyzed thing?” She said, pointing over to his room. But I still wasn’t convinced. Not only had he somehow managed to get himself into his own bed, but I could also at times notice that his legs did in fact move under his covers. 

“Dr. Grant?” A nurse asked as she handed me some papers. Nodding to her I looked down at them and was really confused now. Looking back at Jennifer I showed her the papers I’d been handed. 

“His blood tests,” I explained to her when she looked up just as confused as I was. “The blood is either contaminated or expired?” I said looking at her with a confused glance. She was flipping through the pages and just stared at them in the same confusion I had. 

“That doesn’t make sense. If Irene just took his blood it shouldn’t be expired or contaminated.” She said. I tapped my chin in thought as I looked back over to the room. A thought formed in my mind as I started to get a picture forming in my head. 

“Unless this blood was already drawn beforehand,” I said aloud, turning back to Jennifer to see if she was also thinking along these lines. She looked over at me inquisitively and then looked back at the results, shaking her head. 

“That makes sense. Maybe Irene drew his blood at his home?” She said, handing me the results back. Sighing as she rubbed her face and eyes. She was probably just as tired as I was of dealing with ‘Monsuier LeBlanc’. If only I knew the hell that he was about to put us all through. 

His constant refusal to cooperate with us began to weigh heavy on us. He wouldn’t eat anything we gave him and refused to have an IV placed in him. He refused any kind of treatment we tried to recommend him. And all the while I kept a close watch on Irene as her condition deteriorated. She could barely stand and it was obvious she was wasting away before my very eyes. 

“I’m worried about Irene,” I told Jennifer as we checked on another patient who was thankfully much more cooperative than LeBlanc was. She nodded as she took the patient's blood pressure and we continued our conversation after we had finished the check-up. 

“She looks like she's dying before our eyes.” She told me, looking in the direction of the private room. Looking back at me I could tell she had something on her mind. Waiting for her to gain the courage to tell me she soon turned to me and brought up something she had been thinking of for a while. 

“You want to become his private nurse?” I asked in disbelief. She nodded and turned back to me. I should’ve noticed just how close she seemed to have become with LeBlanc. While I struggled to keep my composure around him, Jennifer seemed to be able to at least convince him to at least to the bare basics. 

“I think it would be good for him and Irene. She’s clearly at the end of her rope and LeBlanc clearly needs round-the-clock care.” She had a point but I still wasn’t fully convinced. But whatever I was thinking was erased when LeBlanc’s patient light suddenly turned on and began to beep. The conversation was put on hold as we entered his room and quickly went into action as we saw Irene on the floor unresponsive. 

“She suddenly just collapsed.” That was all the masked man told us as we quickly started CPR on Irene. Getting a good look at her it was obvious she was extremely malnourished and near death. After a few minutes of chest compressions, we managed to get her back to us. It was at that moment that I decided to have Irene checked into the hospital as a patient much to LeBlanc’s protests. 

Jennifer soon was forced to take Irene’s place as LeBlanc’s caregiver. Getting what she wanted while I took care of Irene. She was almost like a husk of a person when she was separated from LeBlanc. She was unresponsive and just merely nodded when asked if she was ok. Getting her into a hospital gown allowed me to see just how many punctures she had all over her body. From her arms and legs to even her shoulder. 

“How did you get these marks?” I asked her, taking careful hold of her arm and getting a closer look at them. It was under closer scrutiny that I saw that all these punctures were bite marks. The discovery shocked me to all hell. It explained how she had deteriorated in such a short amount of time. These clearly weren’t human teeth so I was raking my head over how it could’ve happened to her. 

“Monsieur LeBlanc?” She suddenly asked me. Her head turned to me and suddenly looked confused. “Where is he?” She asked in confusion, starting to try and get out of bed to go search for him. I was easily able to keep her in bed. She soon drifted off to bed and I went to check on Jennifer and our masked patient. 

“Bonjour, Dr. Grant.” LeBlanc greeted me, sitting up in bed like he always did and conversing with Jennifer who was all smiles and staring at him like a schoolgirl with a crush. “Is Irene doing well?” He asked me in that voice that didn’t seem to match his body. It was so young and with only a slight french accent. It didn’t fit the decaying creature that was sitting before me. 

“She’s stable. But I discovered that her entire body is full of bite marks.” I told them, causing a head tilt from the masked man and a look of concern on Jennifer’s face. “Any idea how she got these?” I asked my patient. He stared at me from the black eyeholes of the mask. 

“No.” That was his only response. Every question I laid at him, anything was just responded to with a ‘no’. Which pissed me off so much that I had to leave the room before I did something that would’ve gotten my medical license revoked. I wish I would’ve done something to him. Maybe I could’ve saved Jennifer. 

It was as the days passed that I saw a definite change in Jennifer. Her usual chipper attitude was slowly being lost and replaced. It was subtle at first but soon I took notice that she was becoming more distant and emotionless. Anytime I tried to have a conversation with her she was distant and seemingly not paying attention to me. And all the while her attention was solely focused on LeBlanc. 

Irene on the other hand was showing signs of improvement and I saw her smile for the first time since I had met her when I told her she was recovering nicely. She was asking about LeBlanc less and less and her personality was almost nothing like it had been when she had been around LeBlanc round the clock. However, any signs of her improvement were dashed when Jennifer wheeled LeBlanc in to visit her. Her eyes went wide when she saw him and she quickly got out of bed and went over to him. 

“M-monsieur! A-are you alright?” She quickly asked, checking him over and looking at him like a lost puppy. The masked man looked at her and then over to Jennifer. Irene looked up at Jennifer and then down at him and a sense of forlorn came over her and it was like all will left her body. “Oh…you’ve found another.” 

“You know what will happen.” He told her, a soft almost growl came out of him. And suddenly drool began to drop from beneath his mask. Jennifer looked at him and quickly began to wipe it off of him. Irene stared up in horror and backed away from him and Jennifer, into my arms. 

“Jennifer, please take Mr. LeBlanc back to his room,” I told Jennifer as I hugged Irene protectively. She looked at me and then down to LeBlanc before taking ahold of his wheelchair and starting to wheel him away. Turning back to me with her newly found emotionless gaze. 

“Please call him Monsueir LeBlanc.” She then rolled him out of Irene’s room and left me alone with her. I got her back into bed and decided to stay with her. Delegating all my other patients to my interns and nurses. Irene kept fidgeting and looking at the door, the windows even the ceiling. 

“He’s going to dispose of me.” She mumbled to herself, clutching her blanket and staring at me. I walked over to her and held her as I tried to calm her down. Trying to get any piece of information out of her. Until finally as the sun went down she opened up a little bit about Jackson LeBlanc. 

“A Parasite?” I asked her, a bit taken back by the choice of words. 

“A parasite,” She nodded quickly. “That’s what he is. Sucks you dry and when you’re no longer useful he…” Looking around and breathing rapidly I could tell she was terrified. Her heart rate was through the roof and in her state I was sure she was going to overwork her poor heart. “He’s been trying to find a suitable host for his spawn. But none of them live past birth. He’s tried so many times.” She said, her eyes wide and bloodshot as she looked over at me. 

“Irene, you’re not making any sense. I need you to take a few breathes-” I was cut off by her grabbing me by the collar and shaking me furiously. Catching me by surprise by just how much strength she had. 

“H-he gets in your head! Makes you serve him a-and help him with his breeding. M-makes you an emotionless husk.” Her words were going a mile a minute as she desperately tried to relay me these incoherent messages. “H-he has this creature on his farm…” She started again but was cut off when all the lights in the building suddenly shut off. 

“A power outage?!” I stood up quickly as the emergency generator kicked on and all the blaring alarms were suddenly shut off as the nurses restarted everyone’s monitors. While it was only a momentary outage, the temporary darkness had cost Irene the last few shreds of her sanity as she started to scream. It was even louder when once again the lights shut off and plunged us into complete darkness. 

“Please, please, please, please,” Irene kept mumbling to herself as she clutched onto me for dear life. Reaching into my pocket I pulled out my phone and illuminated our pitch-black room. Irene kept pleading with something as I tried to figure out what was going on. First, an outage, and now the backup generators had all failed. What the hell had caused that? 

A tapping sound soon derailed my train of thought as I and Irene both fell silent. It was quick and audible amounts of tapping. Like something running quickly across the walls or ceiling. Training my flashlight towards any place I thought it could be coming from I soon started to feel an impending sense of doom as the scurrying picked up in intensity and speed. 

“Dr. Grant,” Irene’s terrified voice spoke up from the darkness as her hold on me strengthened and her body began to shiver uncontrollably. “H-he’s coming for me.” 

When she said that the window to her room burst open in a flurry of sharp glass shards. Training the flashlight towards it I let out a scream as I saw a row of sharp teeth lunging towards us. Irene was ripped from my grip as she let out an ear-piercing scream. The lights finally kicked back on and I stared in absolute horror at the creature devouring Irene before my very eyes. 

It was a towering figure with four long spindly limbs that ended in two-toed claws. Its face was chewing on Irene’s body with a mouth rowed with jagged sharp teeth. And as the lights once again turned on to give me the full view of the creature. It was LeBlanc. His mask pulled up to reveal an animal-like jaw that was easily shredding Irene’s body and pincers brought the chunks into his mouth. As I crawled away from him I saw that the mask wasn’t really pulled up, he’d simply been holding his face down, and now that he was eating he was free to look up and around. 

“Dr. Grant?” Jennifer’s monotone voice spoke up, as she suddenly appeared from behind me as I backed up away from the horrifying scene before me. Staring up I saw that she had LeBlanc’s wheelchair and her blank expression. “Monsieur LeBlanc is checking out today.” Turning back around I saw that the creature had devoured every inch of Irene. It crawled over to me, shoving its face into mine, a horrible stench filling my nostrils. 

“I thank you for your hospitality, Dr. Grant,” LeBlanc told me. His mouth hanging open and the words seemingly just emanating from his open mouth. He crawled past me, crawling on his arms and his four legs. Crawling into his chair, his back legs snapped and cracked as they seemingly reentered his body and he sat in his chair. His frail facade returned. 

“Good day, Dr. Grant,” Jennifer told me, wheeling LeBlanc away and leaving the hospital. Causing me to stare in disbelief and horror as everything I had known had been suddenly thrown out the window. LeBlanc isn’t human. And he now has my nurse under whatever spell he possesses. 

I still have nightmares of what I saw that night. LeBlanc’s enormous stance and how he had been mere inches away and could’ve eaten me then and there. And no amount of alcohol could help me forget about him. Or Jennifer suffering under his spell. He comes in every so often. But Jennifer still remains the same. He doesn’t feed on her. In fact, just by looking at her, I can tell that she’s helping him in more ways than one. 

One day they came in with a heavily pregnant woman. Who was screaming and thrashing in pain. Not just from labor pains but from what was inside of her. As when we got her into a room I could clearly see whatever was in her stomach was trying its damndest to leave. And when Jennifer sent the other nurses away to get some cold water for the mother. When it was just the four of us, I watched in terror and disgust as what was inside the mother, tore and chewed its way out of her. 

Turning to vomit on the floor I could hear the ungodly screeching and gnashing of the fetus creature. Which looked like a mini LeBlanc. Thankfully for the whole world, the creature died less than five minutes after birth. Unfortunately for me, I had a front-row seat to LeBlanc devouring his own dead spawn. 

“Pity,” Jennifer said with a sigh, wiping her bloody hands off on a towel. “Just have to keep trying. Thank you for your help, Dr. Grant.” She told me as she wheeled LeBlanc out of the hospital and left me to explain how the woman had died. 

I put in my two weeks. And moved far away from them after this incident. And I pray to whatever fucked up god that exists. That LeBlanc never finds a way to have a child."

I want to build a career in America where the salaries are almost double what they are here. What's the best course of action? This is an x-post from r/cscareerquestions.

Here is my plan:

Start applying now to American universities' MS programs

Enter US on F1 student visa

Work part time and take an unpaid internship while I study

Take advantage of the 3 year OPT to get a job somewhere that will sponsor my H1B visa, which has a high chance of approval due to being in the MS pool rather than the regular pool

Work there until I get my green card

Is this a good plan? Have I missed anything?

I think what worries me most is that the H1B is still a lottery. As I understand it, I could do everything right and still lose by getting rejected 3 years in a row. If that happens, are there any options left?

Finally, is this a good idea in general? I want to move to the US for a number of reasons but chief among them is the number of high paying CS jobs. If this would end up costing me, both in terms of money and the career setback entailed by being chained to one company until I get my green card, more than I will benefit from the US tech sector - then I don't suppose it's worth it. What do you think?

edit: follow up question -  CS masters or MBA?"

TLDR; Black trans guy who loves bikes and fixing them up, but works 50-60hr weeks for survival. If I do not work, I am homeless with no family or therapy support. No time for ECs. 3.8 GPA. Cognitive sci Major. California Community College student

I’m a low income, POC student who is trans. Been providing for myself (food, transportation, high school extracurriculars, medical). I include the trans part because it’s freaking hard to find good, compassionate care for trans people; some are adjusting more than others.

Anyway, I work 40-60hr weeks and am 20yrs old. Cannot even get a promotion due to my age despite shift leads usually asking me to do the managerial work. I work retail. I work several departments of the store to provide for my education (Rx, cashier, photo). Hard shit especially since I’m voluntarily going through a “second puberty” in the trial and error of relieving sex and gender dysphoria. It’s been successful in terms of gender dysphoria - I am gendered and referred to how I am on auto. Most of the battle is inside now, which I am okay with. It’s led me into philosophy and cognitive science to fight that battle.

I have 3.84 Cumulative and work my ass off for it, but I’ve had to withdraw classes due to adjusting to my hormones and also work. I’ve withdrew because I wanted to save my GPA from tanking due to classes I knew couldn’t finish without an A. This was when my work hours went from 40-60hr. My store manager was fired for misconduct, so I had to make up for the loss labor along with my one and only competent coworker. I really could not handle 50hr weeks, then 46, then 62, then 40, 40, 40 with 4 classes. 

I don’t feel I have nice of ECs because of COVID and my situation at home. My situation at home being that if I am not working full-time and I am unable to stay there. My parents do not support my testosterone usage and its cosmetic changes unless I am financing medical expenses, food, and transportation. Will be kicked out nonetheless. I have couch hopped because of this before, often at my girlfriend’s. 

Having to be away from home got me into fixed gear bikes and supporting/collaborating with my local bike businesses. Also because fixed gear bikes force you to use your legs as the engine and brake. Great way to put my testosterone to use. Your legs never stop moving and if you want to stop, you best have the leg weight to press back on how much you’ve been pushing. No brakes, btw ;)

Bikes and work are the only ECs that are really me. I am sending apps in Fall 2022/Spring 2023, should I try doing research under a professor when I can? I have some short ECs such as an internship teaching math at Freedom schools, primarily for African American kids living in Section 8 housing and being a youth aide for a county-based landscaping program.

Since I have three semesters for grades, I can maybe bump to 3.9, but even I do not know. My essays despite my struggles will demonstrate positive growth rather than the negative implications it left me.

What do you think? Be honest. Tops are UCB, UCLA, USC. Big dreams are Stanford, Cornell, Carnegie, Brown. Middle kingdom is UCD, Sacramento State, and San Diego State. My college list is not fixed (unlike my bike) so it can change with some recommendations.

Edit: You guys, writing this post and connecting with some of you on it has made me really reflect a lot. Thank you all for the insight, truly. I can breathe a little better now.

Edit #2: My counselors are expediting to have my W’s not be problem for applying to classes this term. I’ll be able to finish my IGETC reqs!"
s6mu0k,1,2022-01-17,Asking for my first raise,AnnapurnaFive,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/s6mu0k/asking_for_my_first_raise/,"Hey all,

I'm 5 years into my career and I am going to ask for my first raise ( I graduated in public relations). I started my career with the Ontario government on a 4 month internship working crisis management and media relations.

Did a good job, was offered a contract position after the 4 months and  worked there for another 2 and a half years on that same contract, having it renewed several times throughout (very common practice at the govt). My pay increased steadily as my roles and time progressed, I never felt I needed a raise because I was bumped up every so often as part of our union agreement and pay category I fell under.  Was offered a fulltime role, but turned it down to move to BC.

I moved to a mid size city in BC, my cost of living went down but so did my salary.

Took a job at a start up marketing firm where I was paid 10gs less then I was making in Toronto. Stayed there for a year and a half (At that point I was doing side work which made me back that 10gs). Eventually I decided to leave because I wasn't seeing eye to eye with my boss. Took a job doing communications and marketing for a credible non for profit in the area. I was offered a one year contract which ending in a few months.

I'm a one man show for all comms and marketing and have learned a lot on how to manage an entire department, it's been a big change from being on a team with multiple other comms professionals. I should note that when I moved from the marketing company to the non for profit my pay remained the same but I had to give up my side work due to the higher demand of my new position. So ultimately I took another 10 g loss.

Long story short, I've been asked by my boss to list my what I'm looking for as the end of my contract approaches.

This is where I need some advice. How do I calculate a fair dollar figure to present to them?

I'm running this position solo and being asked a lot at times. I don't mind the work but I feel underpaid for what I'm doing.

I want full time (for the benefits and pension) and a good size raise, but I don't know what is reasonable and what's not. Ideally I'd like minimum $5000 a more extra, is that too much, too little? $10,000 would be ideal, but that sounds like too much to ask for.

I don't care about a title change but i'm pretty much a manager and I want a manager wage.

I'm currently on $65,000.

Has someone been in a similar position or have any advice on how I approach this with my boss?

Any insight would be appreciated."

A few questions..",nen_del,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/s6o239/hi_guys_looking_to_get_into_programming_after_my/,"Tl;dr: hate my major, hate the job, definitely is not what I want to do. Super depressed working this internship and feel that I wasted my time in school. Have some questions about programming/coding as a profession. 


Long story short, I’m a supply chain management major and I’m finishing up an internship in mid February. I fucking hate it. My boss is an absolute jerk, everything in the automotive industry sucks, and this is not at all what I want to do. 

I’ve come to learn that the one and only thing I enjoy about my internship is that I get to work from home two days a week and on those days hardly have to interact with boss. I’ve always been huge into computers, and I’ve learned a decent bit in excel since beginning my internship. I’ve been a PC gamer for 18 years now, beginning when WoW was released (I’m currently 25). I’d love to start programming/coding in my off-time instead of continuing another 40 years in a shit occupation. 

Okay enough with my backstory! Now for the questions. 

-Is it relatively easy to find a work from home programming/coding job?

-How long of consistent practice does it take to become career ready?

-How high stress is an average couple of months?

-Is there a best digital workstation to use? (Currently starting in python)

-Will I need to create a portfolio of projects for a job typically?

-is there an easy field to start with? (I.e. developer vs data analysis)

-I’ve read both good and bad things about boot camps. Personal thoughts?

If you took the time to read this, I truly appreciate you. Please feel free to add anything additional that you find important. 

EDIT: my boss is a manager of all purchasing for our company. I hate her because she expects me to work at her level (she’s been in this industry for 30 years, this is my first taste of the job…) I get that bosses can be trash and I wanted to clarify this before people say “a lot of your bosses are going to suck.”"

The cop was extremely cool, but I walked away with a possession of THC, possession of drug Paraphernalia, and Possesion of Psyllicibin citations. I am from Illinois (under 21) but i go to college in Missouri. I have a few questions about how to best handle my proceedings.

1. I know it says mandatory appearance, but i have no car at college and will most likely not be able to make it back up to WI until at least June (January at time of writing with an early march court date). I told the officer this and he said a zoom option may be a possibility for me. either way i will need a lawyer, so should i hire one that i’ve used before from Illinois, one from near my college in Missouri, or one near the place of the citation in WI?

2. Obviously I could plead guilty, but what other options do I have for somehow making sure this stays off my record and out of background checks from companies? I have no prior drug convictions or felonies but i do have an internship lined up this summer that will be doing a background check.


3. following up on that, what kind of fees or penalties will i be facing? In the end it’s up to the DA to decide which citations they act on, but i’m wondering how they usually handle these situations in WI.

Thanks guys for all the help, definitely learned my lesson on this one.

UPDATE: I plan on calling the DA office tomorrow (on advisement from the officer and fellow redditers) and will update when i have more info. Thanks again guys

UPDATE 2:Called today and they said all initial appearances are handled over zoom so The mandatory court date isn’t a problem. Thanks in advance for any more help."

So, I just had this test for a Frontend internship, and I really don't know what happened for me to do this BAD. I tried to start applying at least now that my portfolio is up and running and my resume is up-to-date. Had this test yesterday, some logic, numerical reasoning and critical thinking, which was okay so far. Then the code tests came in and I froze! Literally didn't write a single line.

I haven't been studying since I came back from the army, but I thought at least I'd remember everything at the spot, and I was wrong. The tests weren't even hard, I knew it. It's just a FizzBuzz, and the other one was some debugging I had to do to a fibonnaci generator function. But I completely lost it. Now, it feels like I have to start everything all over again. Actually, start learning from 0, and act as if I knew nothing. Problem is, I feel bad about making myself, my resume, my GitHub and portfolio look like a fraud, like they're not mine. All those projects I worked on. All the tools I worked hard to learn and use. Gone. I wamted to email the employer but it feels wrong.  


Tl;DR: A little back story, I've been self-studying since July 2019 up until October 2020, and I've been doing my best, coding literally every day, reading books, studying general Computer Science and trying to dive as deep as I can and solve problems, and I felt I was getting relatively better.

Then, I HAD to leave everything behind, get drafted to do my mandatory year of army service. I only had a chance to touch a computer when I got back home once every month. During this period, I worked on my portfolio and added the old projects I worked on and it felt I had something to show for my skills. But I only did that for 2 or 3 days every month, and that was the only chance I had.

Then thankfully, my period was over this last December, and I'm back with a numb brain, and it felt like I left my brain and memory in 2020. I thought that it's just me with my imposter syndrome and actually everything will be back to normal, but apparently, it's not that easy..."

I graduated from CEGEP (college in Quebec) and received my DEC in 2018 in a 3 year technical computer science program. My school sent me to an internship at a company in Longueuil who offered me a job and I accepted.

I'm currently paid 63k which I feel is severely low and I want to find something much higher paying this year. I also feel like the stack I'm familiar with is really limiting me since it's so outdated.

My concern is my degree, which is basically one notch below a Bachelor's (I'm not sure what a DEC is equivalent to everywhere else). Am I better off going back to school (I'm thinking Concordia) to get a Bachelor's so I can a 100k+ job? Or is my current experience enough to get me through some interviews?

Since the post I wrote a lot have happened. Sorry for my English and writing style, but let's go.

 Let's start from the beginning. I started studying Masters in Digital Marketing in 2020 and at one point last year I decided to get firsthand experience, so started searching for internship. Found one guy who mentored me for 2 months and even let me write in my CV that I was intern in his company(i actually went daily at the office and worked with some of the people there). 

 After that I went on another internship hunt and found my current job. They offered me a minimum wage(510lv; I live in Bulgaria) for 3 months and If they liked me, they would offer me a job contract(also I needed to work full time). I started there and after one week the girl which worked there as a Digital Marketing Specialist left, so I was left with no one to teach me. We got 11 clients and I need to work with all of them just after a week. Because the guy which mentored me, taught me well, I started performing well with all of the clients just after a month. At this time I saw a few red flags but I choose to ignore them, because I was happy that I got internship. My boss talked shit about the previous girl and also one more coworker left. Also, I get to know that there were 2 people in my position but both left, so 2 people were dealing with 11 clients. 

 After 3 months of internship my contract was about to expire. The boss never came to me to talk about extending, although I was working like a regular specialist not intern for 2 of the 3 months there. I went and spoke with him, if they are going to offer me a job, because my internship was about to finish. My ego blinded me that I was being exploited, because I was happy that I am doing the job which took 2 people to do before me. I got an offer for 800lv which was really low because the average in this sector is 1800, but I decided to accept in order to gain more experience. I was promised to get to 1000lv after 3 months, even got shown a salary plan. 

 Probably the worst part was that my boss always wanted to do my work in the way he wanted, not how it was supposed to be, and we often got bad results. I was always the one to blame for bad results and because I got little experience started to blame myself and always tried to find solutions, but in the end always did what my boss wanted. And the cycle continued. During summer months my boss was always missing, and I got to work remotely so things got better. Implemented changes in most of the clients and we started to see good results. At one point one of our clients called and said that he never had seen such amazing results for his business. We get to see good results and our clients started to increase.

 In September my salary was supposed to be 1000lv, but still was 800lv. I asked what happened and my boss first said that he never promised me an increase. I told him that not only he promised me, the salary rise was planned. After few hours he came and said that he likes my work and will rise my salary the amount it was promised. At that point I told my self that I will stay at this company until I got 1 year of working experience and will leave after that. 

 At one point found a document with all the previous coworkers and since 2016, 25 out of 26 people have left. I was there for 8 months and only one coworker was hired before me. In the next months our clients increased to 19, all operated by myself. We got 72% increase in clients I got 0% increase in my salary. I didn't mind not get raise, because only thing in my mind was my getting 1 year of work experience. But at one point I started to struggle. 19 clients were too much for me, mind you before me 2 people were working with 11 clients total. In December I got burned out, luckily the vacation time came and I rested a lot. 

 Last week, on Monday we got our task from clients. They usually took me about a week but my boss wanted me to do them in one day. It was impossible but I gave my best and did half of the tasks in one day. Just 30 minutes before me leaving my boss came and wanted me to do a task that was about to take me 3 hours, so I said I will do it tomorrow. He said nothing. Next day he called me in his office to express his frustration with me not working extra hours and not staying to do the job he wanted me to do, although the company did not pay extra hours. For the next days he called me twice to talk to me how me not working extra hours is a problem. On Friday his wife reached out to me on Skype. She has given me a task in Monday that I didn't do because on Monday I did 3 days worth of work. She was furious and said some mean things. I said that I had a lot of work, but she said that I didn't have a lot of work. After that I decided to quit one moth earlier than planned. 

 Yesterday I gave my notice. The boss was not there and I emailed it to him. He called me after some hours to ask me to explain. I said that I wanted to leave because I am doing work for 2 people and that my salary was low although we got increase from 11 clients to 19.  He said that he is surprised by my notice and I was supposed to talk to him before giving it. He tried for 30 minutes to talk me to stay but I said I am leaving. He said that he will give we an offer the next day and he didn't even imagine I will leave. Today he called me and offered me 30% increase in pay, also he will find someone to help me with my work and will give me 1 month to work from home. I said I will think about it, but I am going to refuse. After my notice he became really kind but I can see behind his mask. 

\*This week I am going to 3 job interviews. At one of the companies, the guy that contacted me asked how many clients our company have. I said 19, he asked if I work with 5-6 of them. I answered that I work with all of them, he started laughing and said he never heard of a guy that has ever worked with 19 clients.

 Thank you for reading my story."
s70bho,246,2022-01-18,Placed!,Secure-Elk-2248,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/s70bho/placed/,"TLDR: Got placed with 18 lpa base and 30 CTC, studied for like 5 months.

I'm a long time lurker of this sub-reddit. A little info about me. I am a circuit branch student from Tier-1 college. Did nothing much in first three years of my college life. Wasted all time sleeping or playing games. But I definitely used to study like a week before my mid-terms and end semester exams. Took everything in between lite, such as quizzes. Had a decent CGPA of around 8. By the end of 5th semester, I figured out that getting into core sector was not possible for me, because of the scarcity of jobs and I hardly took any interests in those subjects. Low-key hated my degree. (FYI I cannot even explain to someone what a MOSFET is lol)

Wanted to enter the IT sector, seeing all those high paying IT jobs. Knew I couldn't get a job in the first semester placement season. Every other guy knew CP and had been grinding leetcode for the past three years. My resume was basically empty, no projects, no dev experience etc etc(you guys understood lol). Decided to sit in placements in the next placement season, which starts from December ending.

In the meantime, got a five month long internship in an IT company starting from July, thanks to my university and a decent CG. Joined the company, in the first two weeks figured out I don't know shit. I did coding only in my first year as a part of the curriculum (basic C programming). Decided I would start preparing seriously now or else I would be jobless. Started serious prep from August, worked really hard on the job as well as studying DSA. Initially watched Apna College placement playlist to get an idea on what to do and how much to do. Decided to use C++. Worked really hard, waking up at 10-12, doing office work till 5-6, and then practising DSA. Opened leetcode for the first time by the end of August. Saw leetcode 1 (famous Two Sum) question lol which was marked as easy. Couldn't solve it. Got very demotivated.

Closed leetcode, decided to improve my Data Structures knowledge first. Mainly read GFG articles for that. Seriously solved leetcode problems from September onwards, when I was pretty confident in C++ syntax, STL and Data structures. Started liking leetcode a lot. Never used any other platform for practising. Used to practice hard on weekends, no days off basically. Office was from Monday to Friday, and thanks to Covid I was at my home, so didn't have to worry about any stuff such as food, laundry etc etc. Started getting hang of office work and basically figured out to complete all that within 3-4 hours and then I just grinded DSA.

This continued till December. By now I had completed all the major topics of DSA such as graph and DP. Studied basic OOP, completely ignored all other core CS subjects. Placements started. Initially could clear coding rounds of like 40 percent of the companies. Used to get knocked out in the first round of interviews itself. Peers were too smart, they had really worked hard from the past few years and there was no way I could compete with them. Used to feel very depressed after all the interviews. Sometimes I had multiple interviews on the same day, and getting rejected in all of them was the worst. Used to be very stressed at night and couldn't sleep multiple times.

But now after about a month of the beginning of placement cycle, I finally got placed with a very high salary, i.e. 18 LPA base and 30 CTC, which is all cash(JB etc). Now I am really happy. Although I feel I don't know shit about IT industry. Don't have any dev experience, all those fancy tech stacks, I don't know what MERN is wtf React Node angular etc etc etc. I don't know exactly what work will I be doing in the company, but I am really good at Problem Solving and my intuition is very good. That's how I was able to impress my interviewer. If you guys want any help feel free to DM/Comment. I can help you guys with DSA.

And now I really want to know would I be able to survive the IT industry? Any tips for the future? Thanks all!

s70s19,6,2022-01-18,Problems with career choice,Lopsided_Vegetable72,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/s70s19/problems_with_career_choice/,"So I've almost finished my 1st semester (CS major) and on the 2nd one we have to choose a course for our future careers but the problem is that I still don't know precisely who I want to be as a programmer. At first I wanted to go frontend but I understood that idea of making sites is kinda boring to me. I want something challenging and that will make me feel that not everybody who got interested in IT yesterday can take my job (it actually can be pretty important). However I'm more of a visual person whose strong side is creativity and this technically makes Frontend job fitting for me. 

I also thought about game development (who didn't really) and even probably being a game designer. I have experience of making little games but that's all. I've made some research but I'm still in question (like it definitely has some cons but it's not everywhere). However I definitely plan to do some games on my own even if my career path won't do anything with game development.

On the other side I've passed my Math Analysis and Theory of Probability exams and it's not that bad (A and B). I thought about Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer (even before applying to uni) because I find the stuff that they do very interesting. I considered about taking my interests together like doing Machine Learning in Game Development, I found only one job offering in my country and it requires minimum 7(!) years of experience. 

However one thing that bothers me that it's hard to imagine that your work routine will be, will you be able to fit in it. Maybe I'm just delusional and all that I know about these fields I've written here before are misconceptions so it just creates a circle of self-gaslighting and when I question myself I become more confused. I watched videos and listened to podcasts about everyday life of ML engineer or Frontend developer but it still doesn't convince me.   


I'm not very intelligent but hard-working and creative and I'm afraid to choose wrong option because we'll have an internship job offering based on our choice. So can anybody help me or had similar problem?"

After a couple of failed attempts, I've finally managed to get an actual software development internship.

This is my first internship and I'm very apprehensive about it. They were looking for people comfortable with C/C++, and my interview was mostly C++ as well. But I honestly have no idea what my role entails.

I have absolutely NO experience of working with enterprise code, and I'm worried about not being able to do my tasks because I don't know shit. What if I can't keep up with the rest of my team? This is supposed to be a 6 months internship, but will they kick me out if I'm overwhelmed and can't do my tasks?

How can I cope with this, and what can I expect when I start this internship? How was your experience in a similar situation, and what advice would you give to a newbie in this field?"
s73eae,1,2022-01-18,Offered internship non paid. Should I negotiate a pay rate?,itsfendijett,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/s73eae/offered_internship_non_paid_should_i_negotiate_a/,"Currently offered a internship doing web dev and other small task within a small company. They are offering me to work in office on Mondays 3pm to 6pm + remote work.

Unfortunately I would work free of charge for 42 days under contract and after 42 days if they decide to keep me, pay rate will be discussed and determined. 

I would be leaving my current $18 hr role doing unrelated job duties. Maybe I could just use my sick time off for Mondays.

Should I ask for some sort of payment or just take the opportunity and hope for the best. Still good to have on my resume either way but these days money is tight

What do you think?"

s73omu,17,2022-01-18,No sleep in the deep.,lontanadascienza,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/s73omu/no_sleep_in_the_deep/,"Take a moment to think about the creatures of the deep ocean, beyond the touch of the sun. It doesn't matter what you're doing - you could be driving home or mourning your late dog or fucking your wife - those creatures just keep relentlessly existing, thousands of miles from you and hidden in the abyssal depths. Their sightless white eyes sweep the blackness, uncomprehending of the world of light so far above. Slack jaws rimmed with jagged, transparent teeth, chasing after flashes of glowing movement in the utterly silent void - only to sometimes find a bigger set of jaws waiting. The fact that most people will never see them, never even think of them, changes nothing about the fact that they are \*real\* by the millions, and as I recently learned, they are filled with hate.

Full disclosure, I actually was inside my wife the first time I noticed it. The heat of the moment literally evaporated as I felt a bone deep chill run through on my back. Startled, I looked up to find the lights dimmed to a whisper. The room almost felt... murky. Then, as quick as it came, the cold feeling was gone and the room was back to normal. I wasn't too concerned, moreso annoyed that the draft we'd had fixed less than a month ago must be acting up and that something was going on with the lights, but I still stopped... what I was doing. I got up to check the windows' seals. Helen propped herself up on her elbows and feigned distress, not quite managing to disguise a smile:

""Honey what's wrong? Not like you to leave unfinished business.""

Nothing from the edges of the windows. Weird.

""Did you notice the lights dimming? This is a new apartment in a new building, I swear if we are having electrical problems already I'm gonna go after that inspector.""

""And how was I supposed to notice that with my face pressed into the pillow, dear? You know you should always finish what you start, otherwise \*I\* might go after that inspector...""

Ha-ha, always with the jokes this one. I put it out of my head and got back to business, after all it was work for both of us tomorrow and who knows how tired we'd be during the week.

The next time it happened was eight days later exactly, and it was much worse. I was at work, frantically prepping for an onboarding presentation later that day to a new client. Our company's management consulting contract came with a two week trial period during which the client could decide not to work with us at no cost. After that point our company claimed 20% of the value of the contract no matter what. The ""reason"" we gave was that we would so totally restructure our teams around helping clients that premature contract terminations were damaging, but the reality was that after hustling for two weeks we could revert to our lackluster selves on the assumption that our clients were unfamiliar with the sunk cost fallacy.

Anyway, I was rattling off my prepared line about ""the efficiencies of pipelined management practices"" to an empty conference room when my world imploded. I felt a pulling, not steady but tearing, like hundreds of wet hands grabbing my skin at once. It was as if no single hand could find a firm grip, but the overall effect of their slipping grasps was a terrible pull. The world went pitch black. I would have screamed but the cold punched the air out of my lungs. It lasted a bare fraction of a second before the world snapped back into existence. I gasped desperately for air as the drab conference room came back into focus, heaving  as I fumbled out the door and past one very confused intern on my way to the bathroom. My vision was still blurry but as I looked in the bathroom mirror I could see my eyes were bloodshot, burst blood vessels turning my left eye almost completely red. What the FUCK was happening to me? As my breathing slowed I noticed that my suit was damp, and smelled like a mix of algae and salt. I'd always thought I was cool headed and would respond well under pressure, keep a lid on my most negative emotions and get on with it, but right now I was bordering on a full blown panic attack. This didn't make any fucking sense. What the FUCK!

Somehow I managed to make it home and text my boss that I'd come down sick. I knew she wouldn't take it well but I couldn't bring myself to care, all I wanted to do was sleep and not think. I'd tell Helen when she got home that a blood vessel had randomly burst in my eye and that I couldn't give a presentation looking like that. She'd laugh and no doubt come up with some story about a red eyed man stalking the night. She loves that kind of thing. I'd schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist in the morning. I must be having some kind of psychotic break. So much for having a normal life, I thought grimly, and drifted off to sleep.

The psychiatrist did his job remarkably well. He convinced me that my high stress work could easily have induced a temporary psychosis, and that it was possible my body's response had included an immense blood pressure spike that burst a vessel or two in my eye. I agreed to take a week off work, and while I couldn't bear thinking about the likely impact on my performance review I also couldn't stomach the thought of returning to that office after the experience I'd just had. Stupid me, associating my ""psychotic break"" with a place rather than a time. I wasn't remotely prepared exactly eight days later when shit really hit the fan.

I'm writing this from my hospital bed, ten days since my office blackout. All the bones in my body are broken, my left eye is gone and the vision in my right eye is pretty blurry so I'm sorry if their are any typos. I have to warn you. Two days ago it happened again. The cold. The blackness. The feeling of being crushed in a vice. But this time I was there long enough to catch a glimpse, if only for an instant. The image is burned into me. Thousands of female angler fish illuminated only by the orbs pulsing on their stalks as they beat up and down in synchrony. The anglers are in concentric circles, surrounding an immense orange-yellow eye with a black pupil that swivels towards me. Above, bathed in the pale green light, are hundreds of empty sets of clothing leaking reddish goo.

I have six more days."

What I would ideally like to do is work in a game dev company somewhere in EU, while also working normal hours and not want to work overtime(I would much rather work in a different field and make my own crappy games for fun in the weekend than work overtime). Totally willing to take up newcomer roles like Junior programmer, intern whatever(I think these are the only roles I can even get...). 

What I do not know is how do I start my search for companies. Like is there a site with a list of game dev companies so that I can go hunt for their career pages? Also, how do you guys learn about the company culture and attitude to crunch? 

Im pretty new to the job market, and would love any advice and suggestions as well."

He basically said that they were impressed by what they saw. He said he would let me know what the next steps are shortly. Anyways didn't hear back from him so I emailed him 2 weeks ago to follow up and see if I'm still being considered and he Said yes he was just giving the managers some more time because of the holidays. He said I would hear back probably last week about the next steps. Stull haven't heard anything.

My story is not on par with people who usually consider applying for an mba.

I finished HS in 2010 in a third world country but international school.

Rushed into going to college in Europe with zero idea about what I wanted to do, not ready at all basically.

Struggled for about 10 years, with dropping out from no less than 4 different colleges, being a mess, substance abuse that lead to depression and all the bad stuff that follows, including contemplating suicide.

About two years ago, at the age of 28, decided to stop being on survival mode, start living and stop feeling sorry for myself.

Went back to my family, in Africa, started a business, and decided to complete a bachelors degree. Out here you need at least a masters degree just to get an internship.

I'm currently in the best business school in the country and region actually. 

For the first time in my life, I know what I want do for the rest of my life.

I am sober, voracious reader and after struggling the first few months in class, starting to catch up.

My goal is to finish my masters, will be around 2024, get some work experience since I have close to none, and then an MBA.

For the MBA, I am really not going to say that I'm aiming for so and so. I just want the most realistic option.

My 2 year college gpa's as you can imagine are not glorious. I'm in the French system so the grading is not the same and people rarely give an A. 

I have done some extra- curricular  work, speak 3 languages and lived in 5 different countries. 

I am starting over from zero and just need honest takes on my situation and options. 

Thanks for reading. 

Good day"

For the past 2 months I have been battling depression, extreme anxiety and even burnout. I barely was able to finish last session and even failed  one of my classes because I just was not able to study for it and gave up after 30 mins of writing it. Thinking that it was just related to school, I wanted to take a break and started to look for internships and was able to land one.

I also thought that by setting up appointments with a psychologist and taking a break during the short 3 weeks would be enough for me to heal and give it my all during the internship.

However, after the first day of the internship I just wanted to stop for some reason and cried myself to sleep thinking of all the possible consequences that could result from me quitting there. This process kept repeating itself everyday and I am just so tired of it all. Suicides thoughts keep flooding my brain and I just end up crying all day for literally no reason at all I just don't know what to do. 

The thing is that what they are asking me to do isn't even hard and I know that it's normal to be lost and to ask questions but for some reason I just end up crying and have no motivation whatsoever. I also don't want to give up this opportunity and rush any decisions that I might regret.

I'm sorry if it doesn't make sense or if I'm just exaggerating but I don't know what to do and I need help please. Should I just give up on the internship? If I do what are the consequences? What should I do if I do decide to give up? I just have so many questions"

My SO and I would like to move to Europe for various reasons, and I was wondering how prevalent “fully remote” data jobs are? 

While it’s possible to get a job in whatever country we move to, a lot of our education won’t be fully transferable because of the language barriers that come with learning a second language (ie never gaining total fluency). 

Another benefit is the countries we are considering have currency that is weak against the dollar. So a little extra spending power wouldn’t hurt. 

Obviously the time difference and lack of face to face contact is the barrier, but is this a common enough practice or more of a “unicorn” kind of scenario? Has anyone else taken their data or STEM training abroad?"

My GPA is pretty average average, my school is decent, and I only have one internship that was part time and the ""company"" LLC is really early stage start up, sponsored by universities and ran by students and some professor advisors. The only time I made deans list was last sem even tho during covid I had a sub 3 GPA. I have quite the amount Cs lol. I also have some projects that I exaggerate a teeny bit on my resume.


I feel like the hiring process I got put through was so extraordinarily easy that they don't know any details about me. There was a behavorial screening and then a code challenge, which was realllyyy easy. After that, I met with a senior person to go over my code, which prior to the interview I looked up and found out that at this stage they'll ask about imptovements and stuff i would make to my code.


So I studied for a few hours, optimized run time efficiency and got ready to bring out all the terminology as well as things I could improve my code on— only to find out that guy opening admitted to actually sucked at coding and algorithms and couldn't read python. He was surprised thought that I already knew the improvements I could make, and that I brought them up before he was going to ask, which makes me feel like I cheated some brownie points. We then talked about experiences on my resume, behavorial questions, and some technical questions, for like 20-30 minutes and I answered them pretty well. It was informal. I was told he gave me really good feedback.


And now I have the offer, unless they rescind me from realizing my internship was part time or not a legit internship or something, and I feel way underqualified. Or maybe not underqualified, but no way was I a top candidate.

Is this a normal experience?"
s7be0u,5,2022-01-18,Some Questions about Consulting Recruitment for a Deferred Admit,awaycart,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/s7be0u/some_questions_about_consulting_recruitment_for_a/,"I'm a deferred admit that's planning on joining my program in Fall 2023. I had a few questions about consulting recruitment, and I was hoping to get some answers from current students; thanks in advance!

As a bit of background, I graduated with a BBA, then went straight into an MS in a technical field (Operations Research) from a decent school (think UNC level). Since graduating, I've bounced around at a few T2 tech companies and am currently at a FAANG as a data scientist. I've had a few different titles (Product Analyst, Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer), but the bulk of my work has been  technical. I'm looking to get into strategy at a tech firm as a long-term goal and consulting as a short-term goal.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I was dinged by two of MBB and by a few T2 firms as an undergrad/grad student for both internships and full-time roles. I was too cocky and never joined my school's consulting club, so I never learned how to case well. Will this affect my chances at these firms in any way?
2. My GRE score will no longer be valid by Fall 2023--will this be a problem for recruitment?
3. Do I even need to go the consulting route to get into tech strategy? I've seen that some top strategy groups only take ex-MBBers and not those that go into corporate strategy straight away. I'm not particular about only getting into a FAANG-level company, but I also don't want to harm my chances at those groups.

Thanks again!"

The recruiter said he was going to try to push me to the front of the team because he thought I was a good candidate. This was after I passed the coding assessment. So I really thought I would at least get the chance to get an interview. But nope. Weeks later(today) I get a reply saying they are pursuing other candidates better suited for the role.

This is like the 15th internship I've been denied from and I've also been rejected from like 30 actual jobs I applied for. I go to school for computer science and I have a 4.0 GPA. I work so hard and when I'm not working 40 hours a week and doing college work, I'm studying on my free time to get better.

I never thought it would be so hard just to get a Software Developer Internship. I graduate in December of this year and I'm running out of time. If I graduate without a internship it is going to be even harder for me to get a actual job in the field. It doesn't help that I'm 30 years old either and I'll be 31 when I graduate. 

Being rejected so many times makes me feel like I'll never be good enough. I don't want to feel like that. I have so much motivation to get better and I look forward to coding everyday because it's my passion. I wish I could at least get an interview so I could actually talk to them and show them my passion for it and how much I'm willing to learn even if I'm not talented enough yet.

Just wanted to vent a little. I'm just very upset because I work so hard to get a Software Developer Internship and it sucks that nobody will give me the time of day.

EDIT:  I switched my major to CS in the beginning of November so I've only really been programming for like 3 months if that. I was doing Computer Information Systems and Security. I realized I don't like fixing computers and I enjoyed programming.(Wish I realized it sooner) I did take a class in C++ a year ago but I didn't really get onto programming until a couple months ago. I graduate in December of this year and I'm running out of time to get a internship.

Now, however, I kinda realize that my social circle/network isn't very big and I honestly want to meet more people involved with tech, and have a better overall social scene.

Fortunately, I was able to get a FAANG internship for the summer, so I'm not too worried about resume value etc, and I'm more interested in working on **genuinely** cool projects and having a good time.

I know a lot of the tech/consulting clubs here have a reputation for being prestige competitions, but I'm wondering if there are any that actually do interesting work(that don't require too much knowledge beforehand). Currently I'm thinking about Valley, Venture, and Voyager for consulting and Launchpad, ML@B, Blockchain and Codebase(although I'd prefer not just doing full stack stuff) for core tech.

Do you guys have any opinions about these clubs and/or do you think there are better ways to get involved with the tech community here while also having a good social scene(I'd like to go on retreats etc)? I know research is one option, but I'd prefer something slightly more real-world and social."

So I just recently started my internship (2nd week rn) and I got my first task and I’m completely lost. All the skills I had (DS &amp; A, leetcode, OOP, memory management) did not transfer over one bit or become useful in any way at all. The task that I’m doing is completely brand new stuff to me. I’ve been asking multiple questions to multiple people especially my mentor but it just seems like they’re always busy and it seems like I’m always disturbing them with my stupid questions. My lead SWE has an accent and it’s very hard for me to understand him which only makes it harder for me. And when he gave the task I expected him to go through at least one example with me but I think he expected me to already know some things. In terms of asking for help, Instead of setting meetings with me most people would just give me an answer through text which is only even more confusing because just going through the process there’s so many bugs and outdated things that will happen and are impossible to do without someone literally walking you through an example step by step. I was told to read through a code script to try and understand what was happening but how can someone just joining a company have any idea about what the hell is happening inside this code? They have so many of their own libraries and things that I have no idea what they do. I’m super overwhelmed and it feels like I’m asking for too much help and I don’t know what to do.

Don’t get me wrong - this is a great company and my manager (not technical manager) is always looking out for me and making sure I’m okay and is very helpful but I don’t wanna be that guy and say yeah the lead has an accent I can’t understand him and no one’s really helping me that much and I want someone to literally walk me through it because I literally don’t even know what half this stuff means. Sometimes I wonder why they even hired me :( I’m trying my best to try and learn and understand it but I don’t know how to. I guess it could just be the team I’m on as I heard it is one of the harder teams and all the engineers are just busy. But I learn best when a concept is explained from the ground up so I can apply my base knowledge I have but it feels like I was jus thrown into bunch of code. 

Any suggestions on what I should do? It’s only my first task so I’m guessing it’ll get better through time but has anyone else felt like this"

s7dz0z,1,2022-01-18,The start date of the job I interviewed keeps postponed,ForBiden2020,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/s7dz0z/the_start_date_of_the_job_i_interviewed_keeps/,"I finished a good job interview 10 days ago.

It was a working student position and I answered all the technical questions well.

The person who interviewed me sometimes really liked my answers and even said if I would also want to take an internship position. 

At the end of the 1 hour interview, I asked him when will I hear back from the company and he said I would have to wait 2 weeks because they still have other candidates to interview and it depends on their availability. (which I didn't understand why)

Ever since I haven't heard back from them and am very hopeless..

So I checked their job page and they haven't taken down the job posting. 

The start date when I applied was in January. When I finished the interview, the start date was postponed to the 1st of February and now it is the 15th of February. 

Does this mean that they haven't found the right candidate yet?"
s7e7oz,28,2022-01-18,feeling overwhelmed,123swea,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/s7e7oz/feeling_overwhelmed/,"i am a graduating senior majoring in data science and am finding the recruiting process daunting. I don't have any internships to my name and the only relevant experience I have is research through the data science discovery program. because of this, i have very low confidence in myself and have put off recruiting until now. some other background info, i suffered from sexual assault my sophomore year which took a massive toll on me mentally and physically. My grades tanked my junior year and i ended up having to take a gap semester because i was struggling so much mentally. healing from my trauma and improving my mental health have been my main priorities for the past couple of years so unfortunately i don't have as much professional experience as most people seem to have. can anyone share advice when it comes to job hunting, especially for someone with little to no experience? any reassurance in general would also be appreciated"

I’ll probably get to help with backend too…

I’ve read “never do work for free”…this is unpaid, the internship counts as college credit =]

My senior project is a full stack web page…the entire spring quarter will be all web development

s7fm2a,116,2022-01-18,How to stop caring about the fact that I'm 28 and still in college?,csealine,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/s7fm2a/how_to_stop_caring_about_the_fact_that_im_28_and/,"So I started college right after high school at the age of 18, but for the first two years I only took one class at a local community college and worked full time to establish residency. I then became full time student, but didn't know what to major in so I went into business. After a year, I switched my major to biomedical engineering, but my college made me go all the way back and start from basic algebra because business math isn't ""real math""... 

My depression got worse and I stayed in toxic relationships that made it even worse. I failed 1.5 years of school and ended up dropping out when I burst into tears at my counselor's office. I went back the next quarter, but failed two quarters in a row because I couldn't handle working full-time and taking physics and calculus, all while searching for a new place to move into because my host father gave me a month notice to move out. This lead me to further depression and suicidal thoughts and I ended up moving to Texas for my toxic boyfriend at the time. He kicked me out a month later and I was a homeless. 

I moved in with my brother and his roommates in Nebraska and he pushed me to go back to school. This was in 2019 and now it's 2022 and I only have two more semesters to go until I graduate with a pretty good GPA in Biomedical Engineering. I have a part time job, internship lined up with Pfizer, and my mental health has never been better. Life is finally good....but I feel down sometimes when I see my classmates graduate with bachelor's at the age of 22 and I'm still here at 28. I know life isn't a race, but it makes me upset that depression got the best of me. 

How do I stop caring about where I'm at in my life and learn to let go of my past? 

TL;DR severe depression delayed my graduation date and now I feel like a loser"

Or the prospect of having a lot of loans? Despite recently graduating from a no-name CS school, I got a great job making about 90k not including stocks. I am finally getting on my feet enough to start paying them off since I started my first job this month. Totally not complaining about how I did with interviewing and TC... but I'm about 80k in debt, 60k private at 9% interest and 20k federal, and I just want out from under this feeling. I know CS degrees pay themselves in dividends (as I'm seeing all the 200k+ new grad TC posts), but it honestly just doesn't feel like it right now. 

I'm a first-gen low income student, and I was late completing my degree because I've taken off three spring semesters to work CS internships as well as throughout four summers. Sure, it's a lot of intern experience, but I had to do it to get myself through living expenses + chunks of tuition each semester. I guess this is kind of a rant because I hate to look back at myself already taking off so much time and money to pay some of my way through school just to have to pay so much more now that I'm finally done with my degree.  I even had to move back in with my parents so I can try to make a somewhat significant dent this year, but I'll probably be in debt for a few more years just throwing 50% or more of my paycheck to loan payments each month. I just can't see the end, and what feels like throwing hard earned money away makes me lose my passion for a career in tech.  Just wondering if anyone has advice or could empathize a little lol"

As the title suggests, I’m very very close to leaving my current role (consultant at big 4 in Canada) that I’ve been in for 2.3 years + a 4 month internship. 

Background: 
I’ve always struggled with what feels suspiciously like imposter syndrome, but I feel like my current role has really shown me that, no - I really am just not always that bright (lol)

Current project (July - Dec)
My current project is an implementation project and it’s the first time I’ve really taken a full hands-on role in this type of project. My project manager had high expectations of me coming in (based on reviews from other managers, who admittedly, I think I fooled into thinking I did well or performed better than I actually did - Aka imposter syndrome or just ‘fooling everyone’??)

But this project manager saw that I was struggling significantly (although in part because we had major changes on the team that impacted us all, but I WAS the worst at coping with these change). I was therefore held back from a promotion that, up until this project, was considered an absolute given (even told by our partner that I was top talent - again, I think he didn’t know the whole story and may not have an ear to the ground as to how mediocre I could be at times). 

At any rate, the promotion didn’t come, and the raises for our whole service line that were strongly insinuated didn’t come either. I felt upset by this, enough to start looking at other roles, some consulting and some in industry. 

Flash forward to the last 2 weeks:
Despite the missed promotion and non-raise,
I was starting to recover, bounce back, and was even feeling like I was in an ideal position for the last few weeks - I had my current position at my firm which (although I hated my current role), would allow me to roll off EVENTUALLY and came with the familiarity of the team nationwide. On the other hand, I was getting some interviews with other roles too - some as a senior consultant and some lateral roles in industry. Either way, if I could just get through the next little while, I’d come out happier on the other side…

Again, I felt relatively optimistic about it all …until today, when my project manager made me feel like a complete dunce for the umpteenth time on this project. To be fair, I didn’t know what I was doing completely, but was asking him for help &amp; his perspective. I could tell he was getting frustrated with me AGAIN and struggling to understand how I could still not grasp the concepts associated with the software weve been working on. 

I broke down. I don’t think he noticed, but I was totally done - I had a moment where I wanted to hang up and quit right then. We got through the call but it solidified my long standing fear - I’m just *not* getting the concepts and I am a low performer who’s my been able to fool everyone until now. Really, I’m not able to understand the technical specs and I just … can’t get my brain to work through it. 

I now know that I want to at least get off this project as soon as possible, but ideally want to leave the firm and maybe consulting. I just feel … deflated. I want to excel in my career but I am just getting more and more the sense that I’m not as smart as I’d hope. 

How do I ‘sell’ myself in interviews now? Any ideas on how to accept this realization / gain back some confidence?

TLDR - finally found out as a low performer but (bad timing) because now, despite this realization fresh in my mind, I still need to retain *some* confidence so that I can leave consulting, and sell my skills in order to secure another role. How do I retain some confidence / does anyone have any thoughts at all? 

Thank you!"

s7kynx,0,2022-01-19,Help me Search for Jobs and Build a Portfolio Based on my Current Skill Set?,New_Tangerine_179,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/s7kynx/help_me_search_for_jobs_and_build_a_portfolio/,"I am looking to leave my current job soon. I graduated with a degree in Computer Engineering in December 2020. Started working full time for a military contractor on a project with a big hardware component. Found out while working there that:

1) I actually would rather focus on software only (instead of the jack of all trades CmpE path I was going down) and that 
2) I don't care about military contracts. 

I am also not living up to my full potential there since a closed lab environment is not good for my ADHD. 

Problem is I am not fully aware of my options. In school, the majority of my work was in C or C++. I originally learned programming with Python and have done internship projects in that language. My current job consisted of more firmware in C and C++, and then I was working on a GUI in WinForms and WPF using C# .NET. When just searching for those keywords a lot of mid-level to senior level jobs came up. When just searching software remote jobs I got mostly web development, which I have nearly zero experience in. 

Advice for finding a web development job seems really straightforward. If you want to be a front end dev then you learn the basics, pick up a framework, and create projects with it. Then you can search for jobs with ""Front-end"" and ""&lt;framework&gt;"" as keywords to see if your skills fit. 

I am not sure how to do that with my skills. A lot of Python jobs seem to be data science or DevOps, which would mean I'd need to teach myself stuff like numpy or Selenium or something right? If I were using the same formula as web development. I wanted to get into game dev, which would mean I would need to pick a game engine and then make a game, but the lack of work life balance seems to be sad.

I don't really care about the industry I'm in at the moment, as long as I can work remote. 

I want to find a remote job because it will allow me to work with my disability. Being able to work remote should also give me the flexibility I need to learn independently. A big part of staying motivated in college was the ability to continue with a lesson on my own when I got bored. Ex: if I finished a game for a programming assignment I could keep adding to it and making it better in my own time bc there are so many resources on the internet for self teaching.

It hasn't been possible to do that at my job because I can only work on the hardware at specific times, the space is limited, I never got any formal training, and the team is extremely small so no one has time to teach me. 

TL;DR:

I am a new grad with mostly embedded systems experience trying to find a fully remote software job. I am good with C, C++, Python, and C# in that order. 

What jobs would I be good at *right now*? 

What keywords should I be using in my job search (think frameworks and higher level technolgies not just the programming language)? 

What projects can I do to get enough experience to get a software only job?"

s7mp7v,128,2022-01-19,DSA Preparation,Secure-Elk-2248,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/s7mp7v/dsa_preparation/,"So my last post kind of blew up, and the most common question was how to do DSA, Coding, get placements, I am currently in X semester and have Y months to prepare for placements etc etc. This post will be very long, please bear with me.

This post may or may NOT be applicable for people who are already in the IT industry. It is for people still in the university and searching for entry level jobs.

So a little background about me. I live in a small town having population around 10k. My schooling till 10th was very bad. I was really good in Maths and really wanted to be an engineer. Had no idea what IITs, NITs, BITS, JEE Mains, Advanced etc is. I have a really bad anxiety and lack self confidence. I cannot speak English, basically I fumble a lot, make a lot of grammatical errors while speaking. I am very bad at remembering stuff. I have very bad memorisation skills. Cannot remember formulas, names, etc etc. So my chemistry/bio was shit basically and this was one of the reasons I loved maths and physics so much because I don't have to remember stuff.

First time I studied in my life was for NTSE. I knew it was a big thing and wanted to crack it. But there was no one to guide me basically. Internet was not there at that time. My dad bought a massive book(Arihant NTSE). I studied religiously for NTSE for like 6 months. Cracked Stage-1 exam on my own.

Then dad sent me to a Tier-1 city for JEE coaching. As I had cleared Stage-1 NTSE, so there was a bootcamp going on in my coaching centre for Stage-2. First time saw competition in my life and I was shocked to the core. Long story short did not qualify Stage-2 and I was broken. PCM which was taught here was going over my head. Was not able to keep with the pace of teaching. JEE Mains came, remember about my anxiety thing lol? Couldn't sleep a whole night before the exam. Anxiety levels were over the roof. Messed up JEE Mains (30k rank). Decided to take a drop there and then. Stopped studying and gave BITSAT and JEE Adv without studying basically. Couldn't qualify Adv but somehow managed to score decent in BITSAT, which fetched me circuit branch in BITS. I still remember I was so happy when I saw my score. Didn't take a drop and joined BITS.

Entered college. BITS has 0 percent attendance lol. Misused my freedom and never attended classes. First year was decent. Could score 8+ CGPA with just studying two weeks before mid-sem and end-sem exams. Used to play PUB-G a lot(addiction levels). 2nd year was a tragedy. Core Electronics subjects came and I was clean bowled. CGPA dropped in 2-1. Decided to study in 2-2. Attended all the classes, did pretty good in Mid-Sem and then came the pandemic. Back home and I just did nothing at all. Used to wake up, eat, sleep repeat. Didn't even bother to apply for Summer Internships. This continued till June 2021 and then I realised how big I have fucked up. My batchmates were interning in FAANG, Uber, Microsoft, big core companies in the summer after the 3rd year, and here I was sitting in my home having 0 skills and nothing to show. They started getting PPOs, placements etc etc. Now I was under pressure. Got the 5 month internship starting from July and I knew this was my last opportunity to do something. Decided starting from August 1, I will just do DSA and work hard in my company to secure a PPO.

DSA PREP:

I spent a total of INR 0 for learning DSA. No fancy courses, no premium accounts, just Youtube and Google.

Prior Knowledge: Basic C which they taught in 1st year in college.

So like most of you guys I didn't know where to start, what to study and what not to. Friend recommended me to start with Apna College([Playlist Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfqMhTWNBTe0b2nM6JHVCnAkhQRGiZMSJ)).  Liked them initially as they taught in Hindi and from very basics. First time installed VSCode on my laptop. Stared writing basic programs and learning C++ syntax(STL). I would recommend to use only C++ or Java for DSA(No Python). Read GFG articles for learning Data Structures. Realised Apna College were just typing code and not teaching how to approach problems. Their backtracking/recursion videos are so shit. Once I had basic knowledge of Data Structures, jumped to LeetCode and decided to do stuff on my own. Only open leetcode when you know basics of DS(array, vector, stack, queue, set, multiset, map, unordered\_map, heaps, etc).

**LeetCode:**

Don't even think of buying premium. It is way overpriced and you don't even need that. So many don't know how to use leetcode. Do you have to solve all the problems there? NO. My recommendation would be to go topic wise. Suppose today you learnt Stack. Then filter all the questions of Stack and start solving them. The questions which has way too many likes are the most important ones. Check Like/Dislike ratio and you will know if you should spend your time on that problem.

Always attend weekly/biweekly contests. Don't think I don't know much DSA so maybe I should not participate in them. They will give you an overview of where you stand and how much efforts do you need to put in. Weekly contests is at 8 am but I generally wake up at 11 so never attended weekly one. Have attended almost all biweekly contests(8 pm). You can give virtual contests also if you have missed the real one.

Now comes the difficulty. My biggest dilemma was do you need to solve Hard level questions from Leetcode? Answer would be what companies are you targeting, how much time do you have etc. First solve medium level questions and once you are confident in them, only then move to hard.

How to solve, what if I am unable to solve some questions then what?Just spend around 20-30 min on a particular question. If you couldn't figure out the approach then jump to the Discuss section. Sort by most votes. Start reading how others solved that question. Ignore such titles: ""3 LINE C++ CODE, 1 LINE PYTHON CODE"" Open the articles where they have explained in depth approach of solving questions. If you are still unable to figure out, search on YouTube for that particular question.

Leetcode Discuss:Very very important. This is where people share their hiring process, interview experiences and just some general stuff. Before any interview, just search for name of the company here. You might get some insights.

YouTube resoruces:Aditya Verma(Recursion, DP, but would recommend to watch all his videos)Tech Dose(Graph theory, Random leetcode questions)Pepcoding(Randomly watched for leetcode questions)

Random questions people asked:

Do we need to do CP?   No. Leetcode is more than enough.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not fluent in English, English is bad etc etc.

Guys, remember you are being hired for your brain. Communication skills matter but you don't need to be Sashi Tharoor. Just sound confident in the interviews and make sure you can explain others your thought process while solving questions. This is enough.

Anxiety during interviews: I would recommend giving mock interviews for this. I have very high levels of anxiety, but once you start giving interviews it will go away. Maybe after bombing first 2-3 interviews, you will automatically gain confidence.

&amp;#x200B;

CS Core Subjects:

Sorted according to their importance: 1. OOP  2. DBMS  3. OS  4. CN

If you are from CS, you need to have knowledge of all the four CS subjects. For Non-CS, it basically depends on the company. Companies like Browserstack, Cisco will focus on CN, some may ask you OS, but OOP and DBMS will be asked by almost all the companies. You don't need to have an in depth knowledge of these subjects, just basic theory part. I got kicked out of some companies after rocking DSA rounds because I had not studied DBMS and OS.

&amp;#x200B;

This is based on my experience and may not be applicable for you so take everything with a pinch of salt. You can ask questions or correct me I will update this post."

The fact that really bothers me is that people who didn't know how to code properly and people who had backlogs, 0 internships, 0 good projects have got packages of CTC higher than 15. 
Many of them blindly copied in OA and somehow passed the interviews (was relatively very very easy). Few even cheated in interviews but weren't caught. 
A few others did Leetcode for a month after placements began and that was enough to get 15+ CTC.

What happens to those who copy and crack the companies?
Do they survive in the job? 
How easy is it to switch companies to get a higher CTC in the first 2 years? 

I sometimes think that there is no point of internships, projects, networking, CGPA, etc if all it takes to get a good package is one month of Leetcode or cheating."

Anyhow, I’m currently working in a company where I am managing 80+ clients. Google Ads, Facebook Ads, organic and SMS. Not only that, but we also do the billing for our clients, and the reporting. Essentially, all of this… for £26k per year!

I was recently put on a PIP as I wasn’t able to keep on top of my work, and am now considering to quit the job and do some temp-working instead (it’ll be temporary, doing some hospitality stuff whilst I’m looking for a more decent job, so money won’t be an issue).

Do you feel that this is justifiable? I’ve tried all I can to improve my performance, but to no avail. I am based in London.

My aim is to be in a data engineer role and i am trying to learn and create projects on Spark, Kafka etc tools for building my skills.

Questions i require guidance on:

1. Current company has bond (1.3 months remaining) and 3 months notice period, with both of these, new company has no problems and will even look to buyout.Considering i have been rejected by multiple companies on 3 months notice period constraint, should i switch and keep preparing my skills for internal switch to a data engineer position or to move out after a year to more relevant position.
2. Is my current role more relevant for a data engineer position or both the jobs will have no relevance for a data engineer position.

This is my first full time job after internship and i would not like to waste any company's resources and time.Any guidance will be highly helpful to me!!

s7siw1,2,2022-01-19,"Leaving a ""Dream Job"" after a year for a less ideal, more realistic position (Data Analyst)",MiledRoasttt,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/s7siw1/leaving_a_dream_job_after_a_year_for_a_less_ideal/,"So TLDR; My internship turned job hired me to do data analysis, but so far have not gotten any experience in doing it. After over a year, I started applying to jobs and found a remote job back home that promises hands data experience but just with SQL and PowerBI. Not sure if the move is worth the hands on benefits.

So pros of current job: Hugely well known organization, looks good on a resume. My temporary rotation I worked with some data engineers and could do a few data related side projects here and there that would never get shared or presented, but could do it. There are aome experienced professionals there that **if*** I got an opportunity to work with, I could learn a lot. The job is in a major city I adore living in and would like to go to grad school in. 

Cons: I really really dislike the culture of my organization and have had a lot of terribly unprofessional experiences on a daily basis. I have started to find it difficult to be positive because the turn over rate is so high and management is largely inexperienced. The job is more of an MBA type job, not a data job and it has done nothing to prepare me for a data analyst/data science role because I do not get any hands-on coding or modelling experience. 

Pros of new offered job: work from home, better benefits, hands on data and analytic experience. More access to enterprise wide data and management tools.

Cons: small company, teammates are nearly as experienced as I am, would have to move back home, work is not in my ideal field. If I took the job, I would be leaving only a year and a half of my current job right as half my team resigned.

So...based on this information, should I suck it up and stay at my well known but very frustrating job until grad school? Or take the risk of a smaller company where I can get more hands on experience and deal with the moving expenses?"

s7t1io,3,2022-01-19,"Quit Without Two Weeks and Went Back to Old Company, How To Manage My Future?",grapedranksoda,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/s7t1io/quit_without_two_weeks_and_went_back_to_old/,"I know employers frown upon gaps and lack of a two week notice on a resume/background check, so I wanted to get some feedback on how to manage my future as I continue to develop in my career. During college I had a year long internship, which then turned into a nearly two year long full time position out of college. This job really enjoyed the work I brought to the team and built great connections there.

Thinking the grass was a little greener, and wanting to work at a larger company, I put my two weeks notice in and left to work for a very large consulting company for just under 6 months, however, due to some personal issues with the position and company, I quit without putting in my two week notice and quit with a one day notice. I enjoyed the work and atmosphere of my prior company, so I have returned back to my prior company, which I found much more growth opportunities, interesting projects, and a better work environment overall. I plan to continue work there for the next two+ years.

As I think about my future, how much will some of these decisions set me back in my next job search? I want to list the consulting company on my resume, as I learned valuable skills and to not have a gap; however, I’m concerned how employers will view my abrupt exit (or perhaps if I don’t list a reference from this company, they will never know?) in future background checks as well as the only 6 month stay at the company. Will this short stay potentially hurt future employment chances? Does returning to an old company look bad on a resume? And if so, how do I best frame those discussions going forward?"

I have applied for Shopee software engineering internship earlier and was rejected after I replied the recruitment team of my interested positions and CAP without any interview/coding test. At that point in time, I just took it as they’ve filled the vacancy or my CAP wasn’t strong enough for them. However, I realised one of my friends applied for a similar role last week and has swiftly progressed to the coding test round. I can’t help but feel baffled and demoralised by the rejection now. Does anyone have any experience with this, or can advise on why the HR would bother to ask me about my interested positions and reject me immediately after? I don’t think my CAP is that much of an issue as the said friend has a slightly lower CAP than me. Portfolio wise, I think we are more or less the same too. Or is my resume really that bad?"

I would also like to start off with this isn't a joke.

I started my coding journey seriously speaking a few months ago. I feel I have a decent grip in ruby and Javascript however I never touched HTML, CSS, SQL, I haven't even worked in an IDE. I tried giving myself strict guidelines to be job ready before and I got frustrated and quit so I am taking it slow. 

I had a friend who just graduated and got an internship as a lead for a large contracting company for the DoD with no prior experience and said I should apply. I said what the hell thinking nothing of it and they called me back. They asked me about my technical experience and I was honest about never working with HTML, CSS, or any frameworks however I am eager to learn. The hiring manager I am not joking said ""Anyone can learn to code. It's no big deal."" Then asked me to come in for a technical interview. My skill set is at the point where I can answer code wars easy and I have very basic knowledge of strictly problem solving in ruby and Javascript and I am more proficient in ruby. 

What do I do here? I don't know whether to go take the job and get fired for knowing nothing or to let him know I am not the best fit and I would love to get in touch after I refine my skills more. I doubt it makes a difference but this is for a junior Javascript developer position."

We met at work but do actually go to the same college and have the same major as well. Throughout work we started talking and I became more interested in her and let her know. She seemed like she was interested in this and said that she’d also like to go out with me outside of work. We have been talking every day for these two months now and a few times I attempted to set up a date where she would agree and then back out or change the plans at the last second, which is fine we are both busy with school, work, internships, etc. 

Although this last weekend we went out as a group with us and 3 other girls from where we work, one of the girls being a mutual friend but also very close with the girl I like. We had a great time where we spent a lot of time with each other and this mutual friend that we both work with and go to school with was telling me that I need to spend a lot of the night with this girl I like because she was very interested. It was good to hear since I was receiving these mixed signals. After our great night out when I dropped her and her friend off at their house, I made sure to say goodbye and also attempted one more time to set up a date with just us. She agreed and was seemed very excited to go out. Once the day came around, I was ghosted and never heard from her the whole day and then we talked the next day and she played it off like nothing happened. I then asked her the next day of everything was ok because I didn’t hear from her at all when I thought we had plans and she told me she was sorry and that she didn’t realize she kinda ghosted me because she was getting ready to start our next semester of school which was the next day and I haven’t heard from her again for a little while now. 

I’m just very confused in this situation and it’s really hard to figure out what to do because I really like this girl and we have a lot in common but it’s starting to get a little frustrating on my end. Any advice on what I should do here?"

I've been denied by at least 50 different companies, and those are only the ones that actually responded.

Despite that I kept my persistence, I wanted a great job and something I'll enjoy. I found about Lockheed Martin through a friend, and I went on their website and applied to positions. I kept applying for almost any internship position they had posted, with no response for weeks. Then, all of a sudden, on nearly my 30th LM application, I received a request to interview for a SE position within 12 hours of applying.

I interviewed at this position, had a great connection with the hiring manager, and 2 days later was offered the job. After thinking hard about it, two weeks later, I accepted this offer. My heart was pounding and I felt so good. I had clear job security at a fantastic company that many would say is their dream job. I could practically say I was a rocket scientist.

Five days later, I had scheduled an interview with a small bank for their Data Science intern position. I went into this interview not caring, full confidence that regardless, I was going to take the LM job. Knowing that I had a job accepted and lined up gave me so much confidence. My hope was to do the LM position during the summer, and this data science position from now until the summer began. Data science has always been my passion, and I absolutely loved my interview and how well we bonded.

I was extended a position at this company too, and I explained my special situation. They congratulated me on the LM position, but unfortunately they required someone for longer that could also intern during the summer, so because of that an offer could not be extended.

I spent so much time considering what I want with my life. Do I want a world-renowned company? Complete job security? Outstanding benefits? Excellent work-life balance?  LM had all of these, but the DS position did not.

I made the decision to take the DS position instead, for a company 50x smaller, and almost 40% lower pay, with no clear job security, and much less benefits. What made me do it you might ask, to give up a job many dream of having?

I don't want to take the safe way, I want to be a leader in this industry, and refusing myself a ""safe"" and stable environment is exactly what defines an entrepreneur. I will either achieve greatness, or I will go trying.

I'm happy.

Three things I want you to take from this:

1. Never give up. Always persist, in your personal life, in your professional career, in the stressful job seeking game we all must play.
2. Trust in yourself. Know your worth. You are unique, and when you apply, if you get accepted the company is being graced with your presence. If you get denied, it's their loss and they will miss out on you enriching their environment.
3. Do what makes you happy, even if it in the view of logic it doesn't make sense. Happiness trumps logic."

Before covid, my ex and I were engaged. She was in college and had gotten into an internship program which was going to take her across the country after her graduation. I didn't like the idea, but she was excited because she was going to work directly under some older british dude who was, in her words, ""the best of the best"". She's always been a smart girl, so I'm not surprised she was picked but I still hated the idea.

My job allows me to move and since we were engaged we talked about me putting in for a transfer order. However, I hated the idea and let her know it and told her I'd prefer if she took an internship somewhere closer instead. She agreed to think it about because she didn't want to jeopardized our relationship. However, her family was very supportive of her going, saying an opportunity like this would never happen again.

She became very busy with the end of her senior year of college and looking through different internships she was accepted to, most being out of state. I felt like our relationship was destined to fail now, even though she insisted we'd work it out, so I started an affair with a friend of mine. My friend felt guilty because she knew my ex and told my ex, who then broke up with me. Me and the friend stayed together, however.

Over covid, I realized that I still wanted to be with my ex and tried to get into contact with her but after the breakup she blocked me on everything. So, I got into contact with her mother who refused to give me her number no matter my pleas. We live in the same town and every time I saw her I asked, to the point that she relented and gave me the number. It was different, so I assumed she changed it once she moved.

I called the number that night (around 11pm, so for her it should have been around 9pm) but a man answered, when I asked to speak to my ex, he asked who was calling and said she was getting ready for bed. The accent was that of a british man, so I hung up, and then called my family to tell them that my ex is sleeping with her boss (?). My mom is the mouth of the south so she started telling people too. I then contacted her mother to ask if she knew about this as her boss is older than her parents.

Her mother laughed at me. Apparently, it wasn't her boss that answered but actually his son who she had met after her move pre-covid and is now her live in boyfriend-her mother gave me her boyfriends number instead of hers because I wouldn't leave her alone.

Now, a lot of people in our town think that she's sleeping with her boss although her family insists that's not true, and I haven't told them that isn't true because I'm embarrassed. I don't know what to do because even if I deny it now, people will still think it's true. Any advice?"

So pros of current job: Hugely well known organization, looks good on a resume.

Cons: I really really dislike the culture of my organization and have had a lot of terribly unprofessional experiences on a daily basis.

Pros of new offered job: work from home, better benefits, hands on data and analytic experience. More access to enterprise wide data and management tools.

Cons: small company, teammates are nearly as experienced as I am, would have to move back home, work is not in my ideal field. If I took the job, I would be leaving only a year and a half of my current job right as half my team resigned.

So...based on this information, should I suck it up and stay at my well known but very frustrating job until grad school? Or take the risk of a smaller company where I can get more hands on experience and deal with the moving expenses?"

After that I didnt get any offers until August 2021 I worked at a private equity company imaging and distributing laptops for 9 weeks. I am now working as an IT specialist at a very large global luxury fashion brand. The team here is very small 6 including myself, we are in charge of everything left of the Atlantic lol all of NALA. The main issue I have about working here is 

 1. No benefits ( insurance 401k)
 2. They company ""cant pay for my overtime"" so I'm unelligibale for it
3. I have no option to wfh until they hire me full time 

So far I've been working here since Nov 1st and its very hectic and management sucks everything we do has to be approved by HQ and I see it limiting my experience as to what I can and cannot do. The contract was supposed to end jan 31 and they were supposed to hire me then but now they want to extend it til April. 

Tldr; I've already started looking for work but they claim that they want me full time. My only question is, is it worth working here with no benefits and managing over 1800 devices for $30 worth it? I can see that its kind of a free for all I can learn almost whatever I want, but the work environment is toxic af I got in trouble for taking my full 1hr lunch instead of the working thru it. 

Is this sort of thing normal or should I find somewhere where I can get all these benefits for more than $30/hr"

Thank you for taking the time to interview with Microsoft. We have been incredibly impressed by the talent that we’ve seen thus far. You are no exception. Unfortunately, this means that the competition for our small number of open roles was very tough, and we are not able to extend you an offer at this moment in time.
 
We are not done with intern hiring, so there is a chance you could receive an offer depending on candidates that decline or if another position opens up. I did want to provide a status update as some of the other candidates have received a final interview round response whether it be an offer (or not).
 
You are still under consideration should you want to be. Alternatively, let me know if you are not interested in being considered further. In that case, I wish you all the best going forward!"

My college does co-op programs where I am able to participate in internships at companies for 6 months and then I’ll have school for 6 months. I am currently an Engineering Technology major which focuses on the applications of engineering. When applying to my first co-op it was difficult cause I didn’t have any experience in the field, and besides my classes I didn’t know much outside of it. However, I had always had a knack for computers but never thought of making a career out of it because at the time I was applying I thought that the only jobs involving computers was programming and I didn’t really like programming. However, in my first co-op I was fortunate enough to get a position as a computer support technician, I provided IT service for multiple schools, repaired all different types of devices, etc. I absolutely loved it, and everyday was different, it was hectic but I enjoyed being under pressure and the unpredictability of it all. I want to further my knowledge in IT and pursue IT certifications. Also, I recently just passed an interview to become a programmer analyst co-op at an Ivy League college. My new passion for IT has made me lose interest in my current major. I don’t want to transfer or change my major because I do not like school, I was fortunate enough to receive a decent amount of scholarships and funding so I would only need to pay for the subsidized loans that I’ve taken out when I graduate. But I’ve recently been upset at myself because it feels like I am wasting my college experience. For anyone that reads this, thank you for listening to my story."

I had already completed the HireVue interview (digital interview) weeks prior to this meeting.

She told me that next week, around January 28th, I should receive an email about whether or not I move on to the next rounds. Apparently, there are 2 extra rounds (interviews) after this phone call with the ""teams"". I have only had a digital interview so far.

She mentioned there are 17 open slots and more than 22 candidates so I am very nervous. She also mentioned that some people receive other offers and drop out of the role which opens up more space for the role. They say they want to close the role in 4-6 weeks..

It also depends on whether there are enough slots for the service areas people are interested in because if there isn't one available in what you want then you are least likely to get a position (that's how it sounded like to me...?)  I really want this internship. I am so excited yet really anxious and hoping for the best! 

Does anyone know what my chances are of getting the role? Have I made it far into the interview process in comparison to others? What will determine if I make it to the next round or not? 

Any helpful words of encouragement or advice? hahaha 

Is anyone else in the same boat?

I’m currently a college student who works for our campus dining. My base pay is $10 an hour and because of how short staffed we are across campus, management has been doing different things to incentivize us to pick up extra shift. Mid last semester management started talking about  a $3.00 shift bonus that would be for after 8pm to encourage people to pick up shifts at our late night dining options such as the pizza place I work at. They didn’t know when it would actually be happening, but kept reminding us about it, I’m guessing hoping that more of us would return after winter break. 
On January 9th, I got an email which I’ll copy and paste here (no screenshots because it has my university name all over it). 
 
(Email begins)
(College) Dining is hiring and we are excited to have you be a part of our team!
Flexible Schedules
Competitive Pay starting at $10 an hour
Premium Shift Bonuses! Receive an additional $2.50/hr when you work weekdays after 8pm or anytime during the weekend
Free Meals
Scholarship Opportunity
Growth Opportunities and Internships Available

As you can see they advertised in this hiring email that got sent out that there was now a “Shift Bonus” of $2.50 an hour when you work after 8pm or anytime on the weekend. Needless to say we were excited! As broke college students this is a great pay increase especially because the majority of my personal hours fall in those times. I work 2 shifts the first week that I’m back: Tuesday the 11th from 7-11:30, and Wednesday the 12th from 7-11:30pm. The pay period cuts off on that Thursday, so those hours are all that’s going to be on my first paycheck back. I check my online pay stub and to my surprise I see my normal hourly rate of $10 an hour times the 8.60 hours I had worked, for a total of $86 before taxes. 
So I’m obviously confused and ask my coworkers who also work after 8pm about it, none of us have the shift bonus on our checks. So I decided to email our HR person  on Saturday January 16th knowing that I won’t get a reply until the next Tuesday. 

Email I sent to HR:
I just checked my upcoming pay stub and found that  I didn't receive the new $2.50 an hour bonus for working after 8pm and on weekends. I'm estimating that my paycheck is about $16.5 short, and when asking around several of my coworkers don't have the $2.50 reflected on their pay stub either. I'll attach a screen shot of my upcoming pay stub along with the email confirming the $2.50 bonus. Please let me know how this issue will be resolved. 

Rather than the HR person I emailed, our general manager replies on Tuesday:

(Start of email from GM) 
The new $2.50 Shift Premium has not been enacted yet.  They are currently working the details out and it will go into effect later this semester.  Once we start doing it there will be a communication sent out of some sort to let everyone know.  They may have jumped the gun a little putting that out on the website.  Sorry about the confusion.  
If you have further questions or know anybody else that does, please send them my way and I'd be glad to talk about it with them.  Thanks.

So I’m pissed. I didn’t get this from the website, but from an email that they send out. But my coworker checked the website and it says “We offer FLEXIBLE SCHEDULES, VALUABLE WORK EXPERIENCES and COMPETITIVE WAGES including Late Night and Weekend Shift PREMIUM Pay Rates” (yes all that is in capitals).

So to the point of legal advice, am I legally owed the shift bonus because of the communication they sent out which implies that it’s currently ongoing? And if I am owed this how can I approach them (in an email at first) proving that they own myself and my coworkers this money. 
Second, are they allowed to only pay me the shift bonus for the shifts I worked while under the impression I was receiving it or does it have to be ongoing from January 9th onward. 
Anything else you think I should be aware of? 

I hope that was all clear, again apologies for any format issues I did my best! And thank you reading and giving advice."

I'm 29 and unfortunately I still don't have a stable career.   
I used to work in the aviation field but I didn't like it that much. In 2020 I lost my job due covid-19 and tbh the Aviation Industry is not doing very well lately.

I've been a pc gamer for my whole life (loved to build own my pc etc) and I was tempted to pursue a computer science degree when I was younger but, since I was extremely bad at math, I decided to take another path.

Current Situation:

During the lockdown I had a lot of time to think about my life and I decided to start studying something IT-related. I started studying for the CCNA exam, I bought the books and a couple of resources. It started really well but after a couple of months I got overwhelmed and quit.

Almost 1 year later I decided to give the CCNA another try. This time I went slowly, taking my time absorbing and digesting the information.  
While I was studying I also applied for a junior network engineer position even without having the CCNA yet.  
I did the interview and it went very well.  
After a while they called me, offering me a payed internship with the goal of helping me getting the CCNA as soon as possible. (probably they are desperate for people)  
The office is far away from my city (about 1hour driving), and the job will also require to travel a lot to get to the clients (delivery). But I accepted anyways, after all I was at home doing nothing but studying.  
It has been roughly 2 months since I started  the internship and I was called to go to the office just a few times. I barely put my hands on a switch.

Now, I continued study for my CCNA and I would say I'm halfway through, but things are getting complicated and a bit boring. The amount of information to memorize is daunting!   
And soon my boss is going to ask me when I want to schedule the exam..

I'm starting to think that maybe this is not my path, that I'm forcing myself into this field. I feel old and maybe not enough passionate about, what should I do?

Should I continue to study for the CCNA at this point? 

Should I quit?

I feel like I got extremely lucky in getting this internship without experience at my age, but I don't know.. I'm so confused right now"

I studied this major because my mom wanted something that would help me find a job, and something that would have, I don't know, a big job market. I never liked my major, but I sucked it up and graduated with a good average (9.3/10)

Before going into college, I worked briefly as a receptionist, about 8 months. I liked the job, and they hired me because they needed someone who could speak English, I quit that job because I wanted to focus on starting school.

While in school I struggled a lot in finding an internship, I needed 200 hours to graduate, internships in your field are obligatory here in Mexico. A teacher helped me, and hired me as her ""assistant"". I never did much, and she basically just signed the paper.

I graduated in May last year, and I got a job as an Accounting Assistant in September. I liked the job, it was secure, and It was a small nice firm, but a week into December, a few days before renewing my three month contract I had a huge fall out with my coworker, she had a very particular personality and I was made aware of that when I was hired, by our boss and by HR. She has worked there for years and she is like a daughter to the owner.

I fixed the problem, and everything was good, but while the problem was going on, I told HR that I was on a medication for depression, as a way to let them know that she wasn't the only one with problems and she couldn't use them as a excuse to behave as she did.

A day before renewing my contract I went to HR office, and she told me that I should reconsider if I really wanted to work there, since I was ""sick"" and I probably wasn't a fit due to my ""mental health"". I felt like shit, I was heartbroken. I felt like a weird bug, and I felt pushed to not renew the contract. I worked in that place for only 3 months

After that I have been struggling a lot to find a job. I have very little experience, and my confidence is really low. There is also certain expectations on how a woman is supposed to look here in Mexico, feminine and all. I have very short hair and I am athletic, and I feel judged when I go to interviews, I have a few tattoos (nothing scary, flowers and trees), but I cover them always, because I know it's going to make it worse.

I know I'm a smart, I know I learn fast, but nobody gives me a chance. I feel like they see how little I have lasted in other jobs and just go ""oh she isn't going to last here"", but the truth it's I want to last, I want security, I let them know that I am committed to learn and to be loyal to the company, but nobody calls me back.

I feel like a leech in my house, my mom supports me, she says I will find something, but everyday I feel more and more like I am going to end up in the streets or worse. 

What can I do? How can I present myself better? What am I doing wrong? Have I been the problem all along? Help"

I went to college in Montana and went through most of a teacher education program there and took and passed the PRAXIS. Except for student teaching. I did have to return to my home state of California due to personal matters. Now California is its own beast when it comes to credentialing. So in the meantime I worked as a para, then both a day to day and long term sub. This year, I was offered a contracted position under a short term staff permit, which from my understanding is California’s answer to an emergency cert. I accepted, planning to enroll in an internship program. Then my house literally started falling apart around me. Literally part of the ceiling came down. It’s an old place and was a long time coming. So I had to get a new place. The cost resulted in me not being able to afford the internship program right now, which would take 2k monthly out of my little over 3k paychecks. The permit I have covers me for this year, and apparently there are others to prolong my employment, but I do feel like continuing to hold the position devalues the job. Fact is I’m not a fully credentialed teacher. Now my district has building sub jobs, which I AM fully qualified for, and they’re not terrible as far as pay.

I want to know if I'm aiming too high and should improve myself first, or I should keep applying.  
I'll be somewhat vague because my boss is active on reddit lol.   
About me:  
I'm in my late 20s, I live in a small midwestern US city with fairly low COL, population 80-120k. Regular family homes 200-300k, regular 1 bedroom apts are $700-900.  
I have some prior college credit in an accreddited online BS in Software Dev program, but am not currently enrolled. Relevant college classes I've taken are Data Structures &amp; Algorithms, C++ 1, C++ 2, Linux Programming (basically intro to Bash), 2 intro security classes, Discrete Math, Networking Fundamentals, and others.  
Basically I've taken a good chunk of what people consider most valuable (esp. data structures/algo) in a comp sci/software bachelors, but for mostly financial reasons I'm not enrolled or planning on finishing it at the moment.   


  
I taught myself Python in 2016-17, and did some basic freelance work on the freelancing sites, mostly web scraping and some basic scripting.   
Learned basic front-end webdev skills. HTML/CSS/jQuery/Bootstrap and some vanilla JS.  


  
I did a summer internship in 2018 for a smaller local engineering firm, where I did mostly Python GIS work. It was a phenomenal learning experience for me, I benefited greatly.   
I worked for \~1.5 year as an SDET, mostly writing C# Selenium scripts.   
Full time, salaried 40k.   


  
Current job: I maintain and add to a few mostly Python repos that collect and clean a certain type of data, a bit over 1 year now. Basic SQL skills. Lots of smaller tasks around devops, ETL, Linux, ect.  
Started 45k, got raise at 1 year mark to 65k where it's at currently. (I didn't ask for it, but am obviously happy to get it.)  


  
Languages from most to least exp: Python, C#, C++, JS, Bash  
In short, I'm at 2.5 years of professional salaried experience, and arguably 5 years of Python experience.   


  
I want to move to Los Angeles, but I won't move without a decent job in place. I want to hold out for a minimum salary of 100k. I have an accurate idea of the COL out there, and that's the min. number I want to accept.  
Not only does LA have much higher salaries, even factoring COL, but there's just way more opportunity out there. I could attend in person meetups for any area of my field (after covid), I could network much easier, and there's way more bigger companies with room to advance.  


  
My strengths: python skills, creative problem solving, hard worker, pleasant to work with, generally interview well if I can get an interview, respond well to criticisim. These are all things I've been told by my bosses over time.  
My weaknesses: lack of college degree, lack of impressive Github portfolio/personal projects. 

&amp;#x200B;

  
Do you guys think I'm qualified for a 100k salaried dev job with my background and experience? If not, how far am I and what would be the most efficient next step?"
s85iie,2,2022-01-19,Getting an (ML) Research Scientist Role with a Tangentially-Related PhD?,Silent_Seraph,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/s85iie/getting_an_ml_research_scientist_role_with_a/,"Hi all, I'm hoping the more experienced folks here can offer some advice!

For context, I'm a final year PhD student in the UK and in the final year of my PhD, so my future career is a big question at the moment. My research straddles computer science/architectures and device physics, so CS concepts like complexity, as well as a broad understanding of ML methods are pretty central to my work, but I haven't taken any formal courses in these, nor do I directly research them.

As much as I enjoy what I do, for various reasons, I don't want to go into academia. Some companies do have relevant jobs to my expertise, but they all seem to be based in the middle of nowhere in various countries, which doesn't appeal to me at all. Research scientist roles (e.g., DeepMind, FAIR) look ideal, as they seem like they have the best of both: big city locations (and salaries), whilst still publishing research, which brings me to my question. 

I did an SWE internship during my undergrad, and have a decent bit of programming experience, so would taking a SWE role at a company and spending time building my ML skills or taking training courses over a year or two, plus my PhD  be enough to transition to an ML Research Scientist role or similar, or would they only be interested in people who have a PhD in the field? 

Edit: took out unnecessary information."

I was dealing with it/my emotions better than I think most people would- or so I’ve been told. Now I think the shock, anger, and sadness have worn off and my body is just tired of the emotional roller coaster; I can’t feel anything but sad and maybe a little bit of happiness once or twice a day. 

However, I have a lot to be happy about and thankful for. I have an amazing internship, I’m sort of close to finishing my undergrad, and shortly before I lost my dad I met the most loving and caring girl who has been nothing but emotionally supportive of me through this whole situation. 

I’m just so tired of feeling depressed. I just reached out to a therapist who seems like a wonderful fit, but I don’t know how much longer I can take the feeling of emptiness when there is so much to be enjoyed right now. No, I’m not suicidal. It’s just hard when the one person you wanted to make proud isn’t physically here and I’m just tired of feeling empty inside and having to force myself to smile when it’s so hard to even hold a conversation with someone, especially at my firm and with my girlfriend, who is so loving and caring and laughs 24/7. 

Does anybody have any recommendations for exercises I could do to deal with my emotions better and be happier? I don’t care if it’s something as simple as writing stuff down with pen and paper. Anything will help, just to get me by until my consultation. Just something other than time to help me be the happy, smiley, outgoing, confident, caring, selfless person I used to be.

Thank you"
s87cg0,6,2022-01-19,Anger And Advice,RocketElbow,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/s87cg0/anger_and_advice/,"Good evening everyone,

This all just happened just as I left work today. Emotions are high, and I apologize for any spell errors, or moments of just not making sense. This is going to be long, and rambly. I'm sorry for using this place to vent. There's a lot of exposition, but I promise, I'm going somewhere with this. Also, trigger warning, I'm probably going to mentions some disturbing content.

I'm not an angry person, I don't lash out, I'm good at containing those outwardly negative emotions until I have the time and place to work them out. I have to be like this for my job. I'm a clinician (LCSW) at a community health center, specializing in substance use and mental health. Specifically, my people are almost all dual diagnosis, meaning they have comorbid substance use disorders, and mental health disorders. Heroin and PTSD, Alcohol and Bipolar I, Schizophrenia and Cocaine/Crack, and every combination you could imagine.  These are individuals who are too severely impaired or too much a risk to themselves/others to go to that sterotypical one-on-one therapist, and instead, need 3 to 4 hours of intense group therapy 5 days a week (PHP/IOP level of care) to stabilize before moving on to our weekly, and eventually monthly, maintenance(OP) groups. The work is challenging, a caseload of \~100 of the state's most ill and in-need people referred to us, with the expectation we will get them all on their feet. I wish it was that easy. The Clients are, again, are almost all on state insurance. It covers just about everything, but the expectations on us as care providers are intense, as they do want to see returns in their investments.

I've never lost anyone, not to suicide, or overdose, or even CoVid, but there have been a LOT of late nights talking people back from the edge. That's not even talking about the paperwork, an hour of therapy is 30 minutes of documentation for records and billing. There have been weeks I've done by 40 hours by noon Thursday, and as a salaried worker, I do not get overtime.

I started there as an intern, and got hired straight out of grad school. I'm Mexican/Chicano, and their Latino program needed staff. They had burned out one clinician after 5 months, another after 4 months, and they had to use a temp as a per diem to fill in until a permanent staff member came along. That temp, out of the goodness of her heart, worked for 2 years, without benefits.  I was good at what I did, I was bilingual/bicultural, and I was happy to join.  They were never going to let me walk out. And honestly? I wanted to stay. I made so many friends with the staff, I run the unofficial agency DnD game, I'm in multiple group chats with staff, we go out for dinner and drinks, it was great working with friends you connected with so instantly. We took a 4 hour road trip just to go to the vegan Mexican place one of my friends liked for her birthday. My supervisor was great, the learning was great, I thought I couldn't do any better. I just got my LMSW right after graduating, and I thought this could be a great place to get my required 3000 hours of work and 100 hours of supervision to qualify for my LCSW exam. If I passed that, I was promised benefits, a significant raise in pay, and faster PTO accrual. I felt like a king. I onboarded in May of 2019.

Then the world ended.

CoVid hit less than a year into my career. It was chaos, nobody knew what to do. How do we have group therapy when we can't be in groups? How do we document and bill when the state insurance our people have doesn't cover remote services? There were a few months when I had to call my entire caseload, one by one, to do individual therapy, because that was covered. State told us to figure it out, even if it reduced quality and quantity of care, as long as it didn't cost more. Individual Zoom therapy? I sleep. Group Zoom therapy? I WAKE. There were days I got in at 8am and didn't finish my paperwork until 8pm. This went on for 2.5 months until insurance decided to cover Zoom groups.

My coworkers are still supportive, but  administration became dismissive. We were hemorrhaging money because our Clients stopped coming in. My direct supervisor works from home 3 days of the week, gets a day of PTO every 7 work days, and can approve her own time. She's validating of our struggles, but the bottom line is ""get it done."" Her validations are what she offers when she can't offer solutions. I can't tell you how many times I've been volun-told to do more work, take an extra intake assessment, revisit treatment plans, do state evals that do NOT help my people, but it's data that state likes to see. I had a Client miscarry for the second time, call me in a full blown mental breakdown, and when I was not able to immediately respond to my supervisor, she asked me to tell my Client ""make an appointment for later and transfer to crisis, you need to do an intake.""

My people are genuinely good people in bad situations, doing what they can to get better and heal. The issues they have are systemic and personal. Refugees, sexual assault survivors, veterans, people struggling with substance abuse or self-harm. I sincerely believe the cure for depression and addiction is connection. Humans are social creatures, we live to be heard and to listen. The human connection, my ability to empathize and resonant with my people is the single strongest tool in my kit. Now I had to segment people in hardline 15-minute spots, over the phone, without visuals. If someone tells me the used that morning and feel sick, I can call a medical code and they can assess and call 911 if needed, every doctor or nurse in the building shows up. If they're feeling suicidal, I can call our crisis department and get a mobile intervention for an assessment. I don't have any of those tools over the phone. I had a suicidal client ""in a park"", refusing to give me more details, and when I called 911 to report, they told me there was ""not a lot that we can do"" without a concrete address, other than an alert to their patrols. I had the fewest, weakest tools, right as my Clients, my people, needed me the most. Then we lost 3 of our 5 Spanish speaking clinicians as they burned out, and their Clients became my Clients. It's been two years. Not a single applicant for a Spanish position. The one we had for English rescinded his application after he was told what a typical caseload was. The remaining team is crumbling and looking to get out.

I went from monthly sessions with my own therapist, to biweekly, to weekly. I'm testing positive on PTSD screeners. I'm snapping at my girlfriend, I'm isolating and drinking, I'm crying or yelling before I even realize, I'm loosing compassion for my Clients. I've been spit on by my clients, threatened physically and sexually, yelled at for minutes on end by them. I get it, they're ill, I get it. But that explains, it doesn't excuse it, it doesn't make me hurt any less. I wake up some nights in a cold sweat, panicking I forgot something or failed something, and I lost someone because of that. The pressure of worrying if someone has died because of me is breaking me. It's been 2 years of this.

Financially things have been tough. About 50% of my budget goes to rent, the rest to bills, and I have maybe $150 a month for spending on little things, taking my girlfriend out, sending a little to help my immigrant mother after she broke herself and destroyed her credit to give me that shot at ""The American Dream.""  If I had to pay my student loans on top of that, I'd be unable to cover my bills. I'm able to pay my bills at the moment, but I can't do anything else. I've never had more that $2000 in savings, despite 8 years of schooling, $130,000 in student debt, and earning at the upper level for someone with my incomplete license, the LMSW, not the LCSW. When my credit cards got bad and I had to increase my monthly paymenys, I had a whole $9 to play with in October, and $17 in November. What kept me going was the hope of all those promise things would get better after passing my exam, getting a raise, and being able to live, not survive. My girlfriend passed her LCSW in October, and got a job making $70.5k. I'm so proud of her, we cried together when she got her offer letter.

I passed my exam 2 weeks ago, I got my full liscensure. And an offer for $60k.  A 7% raise. For context, I was verbally told $70k,  ""at least 20%"" which is the same the rest of the LCSWs on the team get. Our most recent clinician to leave got $68k as an LMSW at her new job, an incomplete license, and holidays off and faster PTO accrual. As an LMSW. That's all even before mentioning the cost-of-living adjustment last year, where I got a whole 6 cents more per hour.

I'm not writing all this to fellate myself, I recognize I'm extremely privileged and I need to check that, but because this place has destroyed my own mental health, strangled my love for people that got me into this field to begin with, and then had the audacity to turn around and give me an offer my coworkers called ""insulting, because you're the one keeping an entire program running.""

I'm going to decline the offer, and keep working there until I find something better. I've flirted with the idea of leaving for months, but after today, and finally passing my exam, I have the means and the motivation to do it. It's extremely hard to find a good job in this field with only an LMSW.  I've had 6 hits since updating my Indeed profile yesterday. I know what I'm worth, my girlfriend, my coworkers, area agencies, they all know what I'm worth, all except my current employer. I'm the last Spanish speaking clinician for our Latino IOP. If I go, that program goes with me, the other Spanish speaking clinician is on record refusing to take on any more work on. I do 17 groups per week, including my Latino IOP, plus a small army of individual Clients. That's just clinician time, there are also 4 meetings, paperwork, billing, miscellaneous, like getting my people approved for medical cabs, making appointments for my people to get their medications,  and intake, etc. At my prime, I was making the agency $72,000 a month in IOP billing alone, before my other OP groups. I'm going to refer my people out or gently transfer them to any other clinicians willing to take them on.

I hate myself for choosing to leave, I feel like I'm abandoning my people, but I keep looking at the train tracks down the road from me like they're appealing, and if I stay, I'll forever burn out. Or worse. I'm sorry, but I hate my workplace more than I love what I do, and that is not ok.

Getting back to the title of this post, does anyone have advice on what to do next? Am I making a mistake by declining that offer? Is it dumb to keep working there like nothing happened? It feels like a good plan, but I'm so full of emotions, I can't tell what's the right call. What should I do? What did I do wrong? How do I fix it? How do I become better?

Thank you for your time. Be well, and be safe.

The math classes I have taken/am taking are Algebra 1, Geometry and Algebra 2. The classes I will be taking are Pre-Calculus, AP Calculus AB and AP Statistics or AP Calculus BC.

Is this a good spread of courses?

Moving on to ECs, how many different extra-curriculars do you usually need to get into a good college?

No technical assessment, talks too much about their own company during interviews and wants to rotate me between different functions (software, operations, marketing). They said they currently don't have a mentor when I brought up my programming skills (C++). But the money is awesome for a remote location and for 3 months.

My question is: Can I walk away anytime if I want to cut my losses? Will it hurt my resume if I intern at a company that I think will fail? I believe that all risky startups have a chance to succeed though. Last but not least, is there anything else that I should be aware of?"

Close to starting, I also saw an interesting company B abroad. I decided to stick with company A because I was thinking it was offering more opportunities for a future contract. The thing is that after starting with company A I found out that there is no data science team over there. The 2 ""mentors"" working with me are trying to help but they are physicists and not know that much. Company B instead apparently has an amazing data science team on paper. Then I also found out that actually company A has no intention to extend me after the internship is done (even though the project is big and promising).

I’m struggling understanding what to do now. Should I take contact with company B and try to go over there instead? Both internships are unpaid (I’m funded by university) but I’m trying to understand where I can learn the most. I am almost done with my PhD (applied math) and the scope of this internship is to gain more experience in data science for the job market (I know it's not enough but better than nothing).

What would you choose? Company A or company B?"
s8gw5q,102,2022-01-20,I'm a junior DevOps and I'm suffering from anxiety and not in a good place right now...,wildgoose78,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/s8gw5q/im_a_junior_devops_and_im_suffering_from_anxiety/,"As part of my college degree I started to intern in a company in March of 2021, I was going to do what I've not had the opportunity to do in my entire degree: DevOps. Initially I designed pipelines in GitLab and started working with Docker, I was improving the development process in the company. Everything went great, I managed to finish my internship with a really good grade, I was enjoying myself and what I was doing.  


Then I started working in the same company and I started to get more responsibilities such as managing production environments, deployment processes for big projects, setting up new environments, monitoring them and doing almost everything a DevOps and a SysOps guy does.  


Everything started to pile up, I found myself getting contacted by every single developer in the company because I was the only one managing everything, they would ask me for accesses, how to deploy, how to create new branches for features and obviously I had to help them because if they destroyed a production environment the fault was on me. I tried to document and explain everything as best as I could, even go talk to them and teach them Docker and stuff so they could develop easier.  


Then there was this idea to migrate to Kubernetes. Our current applications are monoliths, they do not cope well with Kubernetes and I did not know a thing about Kubernetes at the time, I knew what it was and what it was used for but not how to set it up and use it properly. I started learning while doing everything else.  


We have deadlines to put production environments on the cloud and I was creating a custom solution for AWS with Kubernetes, not EKS but something extremelly customized, I was never sure that was the best way but I recognized that EKS had costs that not many clients could afford. The deadlines came and my solution was not ready, I never felt like it was, I am sailing alone in the big sea of K8s and AWS, and now I am feeling the pressure.  


It is getting to me really hard, my superiors (boss) are getting angry because I can't compromise for a go-live, I do not have a proper solution ready with proper error management of the cluster and I am starting to feel the anxiety pilling up. I am also taking a master's degree during the night, or at least trying.  


I literally dream of stuff I can do to finish what I am doing, I wake up at night because I can't sleep because I keep thinking on everything I need to manage at the same time, I know every single project going on because I need to know them all since I am in charge of their environments and I need to be since we work on multiple projects at the same time.  


I don't have many friends, I haven't talked with anyone in a long time to be honest, I don't have much time since I also work on weekends. and long hours after work trying to manage everything. I'm not asking anyone to be pitty for me, I'm not, I'm just recognizing to myself and to anyone that reads this that I'm close to a breaking point and I don't know if I can do anything.  


I fell in love with DevOps and I have many ideas but I got stuck for so long trying to create something, trying to manage everything I was thrown that I don't know what I am doing anymore and this does not feel right.  


Thank you all, stay safe guys and good work to everybody!"

To do so, I'm making a table in excel which first column is the drugs names. Following columns have aditional info like ""half-life"" or ""comercialised names"". But the most important columns are ""indications"", ""adverse effects"", ""medical conditions that make them not recomended""... and so on. In those cells I need to write several words/situations like ""high blood pressure"", ""pain"", ""anemia""... so I can filter and sort diferent drugs based on that.

So far, I have made a list of about 80ish companies and I'll look for more once that's exhausted. 

My battle plan was to find HR Managers (1) and ML people (2-3) in each company and reach out to them. Initially, I thought I would only cold email and I did, at the start of this week. This was my short mailer:

&amp;#x200B;

Hi Mr. xyz,

My name is xyz and I’m a third-year CSE student at xyz. I am writing to inquire about potential internship opportunities available for Data Science at xyz, where a student such as myself might be able to join for a duration of 6 months with the view to winning a full-time Data position.

I would make a good fit for your company because I have experience in working with fast-changing teams and leading them, built multiple projects in NLP and Recommendations, and I have a knowledge of Python and Java.

I have attached my resume and would love to hear back from you.

Best, xyz

&amp;#x200B;

However, I had almost zero responses the first couple of days and it was getting difficult to get valid company emails for the people too. So I thought I'd give LinkedIn a try; I mean I have nothing to lose right. So I did send a couple of connection requests to both HRs and ML peeps. This was the short message I sent:

&amp;#x200B;

Hi Sir, I'm interested in the work that xyz does and was wondering if you could spare a few minutes to chat about your experiences working there. If you’re swamped with work or feel someone else is better suited, I would greatly appreciate it if you could point me in the right direction. 

&amp;#x200B;

To my surprise, a couple of people did accept my requests and I tried to strike a short convo about how it is there and all, trying to make the ""ask"" in the end. One person said they were just done with the intern hiring but he did take in my resume and told me he'd let me know if anything comes up. I have a call set up with another person this weekend, though I don't have much of an idea what I should do there (any tips?). 

&amp;#x200B;

What I want to know is your thoughts on this approach and whether something should be added or removed. I think for each company, I'll email the HR and a tech guy while also sending requests to a couple of tech peeps on LinkedIn too. Do you think this is enough and is there anything I should keep in mind while reaching out or talking to them? I should also mention, this is the first time that I'm doing this actively and I had no idea it'd be this exhausting, though the alternative is much worse, getting lost in a pile of resumes on LinkedIn.

I have some work experience in tech from some internships I had to do as part of my curriculum. 

I graduated right around the time the pandemic started in 2020, and because I live in PA, there weren't a whole lot of game programming jobs, if there were, they were mobile game studios, which don't really interest me. In hindsight, I probably should've applied to get some form of experience, but what's done is done.  I've been currently working at a small accounting office for almost a year, and I desperately want to leave and find a new job within my field.

Recently I found some jobs as a remote QA tester that caught my interest because I want to do something in the video game industry, whether it's as a developer or QA Tester, or whatever.

However when I researched how much QA testers make (around $11 - $15 an hour), it wasn't all that different from how much I currently make now, while not unexpected, was still a little surprising.

On the other hand, I have thought about contacting my old bosses at my internships to see if they have any positions available that I could apply for.  For reference, my last internship payed $20 an hour, and I liked working there. I'm conflicted between a job that could be my stepping stone to the video game industry, and a job that pays better, which can help me financially in the long run.

It was a lot of fun. There were only five of us plus two owner/managers. We were all in one huge room in an old converted diner with a juke box, and at random times during the day, we'd stop working and play a multiplayer first-person-shooter, yelling at each other across the room. The work was fun too. Overall a great experience.

The partners running the company didn't get along. One of them was a professor, in charge of science and technology, but he had very poor business sense so he didn't get involved in that part. The other was was the business person and money guy. He also had very poor business sense. They had completely opposite ideas of how to run the company. The tech guy wanted to build solid technology, taking as long as needed to create something good, and worry about how to sell it later. The business guy wanted to sell something as quickly as possible, even if the technology was far from ready. Any trick in the book was fair game.

Over time, there was less and less oversight over us lowly workers, and when there was oversight, it was inept. For a while, a nineteen-year-old intern who the business guy liked (who also happened to be the most arrogant person I've ever met, but that's another story) kind of took charge without anyone telling him to, and made a mess of things, wasting huge amounts of everyone's time and setting our technology back months. The tech guy didn't understand our day-to-day work unless it had a mathematical formula behind it, so he just assumed the arrogant intern knew what he was doing, and any complaints brought to the business guy fell on deaf ears, because he liked the kid. Despite all this, we actually made a lot of progress in creating some good technology over the year.

Over time, the business guy fired the mathematicians and scientists one by one, and hired more expensive people he thought could build something sellable on our nowhere-near-ready technology. This, of course, made us go even slower, which meant we had an even smaller chance of selling anything.

After nearly a year of this, the tech guy got us together to brainstorm and write up an ultimatum, demanding that the business guy change the way the company was run, putting technology first. We were all young and stupid, so we went along with it. Shockingly, this didn't go over well. Maybe it was because we had no leverage at all, since we all wanted to keep our jobs. An ultimatum without consequences isn't worth much.

One of the business guy's jobs was to raise money. He hired someone to do that, but that person couldn't deal with him, so he quit. None of us were told about this.

A week or so after the ultimatum, three days before our biweekly payday, we were informed that the company was going out of business. We were also informed that, for months, the business guy had been paying us out of his own pocket, and that he was withdrawing all money from the company's account, so we would not be paid for our last two weeks.

Okay. It happens. Pretty sketchy from a legal standpoint, but what could I do? So I let it go.

Two years later, I got a letter in the mail from the company. The bankruptcy proceedings were over (I never knew they'd started), and the company's assets had been sold. According to the law, after the lawyers are paid, along with a couple other first-tier things, any money left had to go towards delinquent paychecks. All I had to do to get my money was sign a document that would permanently waive my rights to ever sue the company for any reason.

There was one problem: My paycheck was included with the letter. So I cashed the check and threw away the waiver. They wanted me to waive my legal rights for nothing.

A little aftermath story: Another year or so later, I got a call from the tech guy's favorite employee. The two of them were starting a new company and I just had to join! It was a great opportunity! All I had to do was move to the middle of nowhere (the nearest airport or city was an hour drive away), accept a huge pay cut, work long hours and take on a ton of extra responsibility, to build a new technology that would certainly fail because no one qualified to build it lived within fifty miles."
s8o9gm,50,2022-01-20,I’m being let go from my position which I had for almost a year,gfcf14,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/s8o9gm/im_being_let_go_from_my_position_which_i_had_for/,"I’m not really sure why I write this, as I feel that I am likely at fault over my situation but I wanted to get the opinion from anyone who reads this and wishes to share it. Before this job I was working as a Wordpress dev in which little dev work was involved (jQuery, CSS) since the development and maintenance of the sites I had were done through page builders (like Elementor). It was an 8-4 job and I could pretty much forget about it once I was out the door.



 But the politics in the company was what made it hard to bear. I was first a contractor with them,  working for $30/h full time on-site, along with a team within the marketing department and another contractor who had been hired a couple months before me. Out of the blue one Monday this contractor gets fired, and I am offered a salaried position, but for 55K which was lower than my current pay. And yet, because of the pandemic I feared not being able to find a better opportunity so I decided to take that job. This was around the middle of that year (2020) and things were quiet until that December when they laid off people right before Christmas. I didn’t feel safe anymore and since I got an offer to return to work to a previous company for which I interned I decided to take it.



I was mostly considering the perks of a 100% remote job, but not knowing any better and fearing to not get hired after being asked what my compensation range was, I replied between 60K and 65K, so I got hired as a Software Developer for 62.5K (my current job). This time it wouldn’t be Wordpress but rather the full stack, React, Angular, SCSS and scrum/agile methodologies with git as version control.



My work started going on smoothly as I remembered my time as an intern and although some of the tasks assigned to me were very challenging I was able to complete them successfully. I was aware, given my low experience (I had pretty much no real work experience before I interned with the company) that some tasks would take me longer to complete and some were easier. Over the months I was rotated to projects from this company’s clients where demand varied, and in some I was told that I needed to deliver faster (by the company owners as the company is not that big, never by the project managers) but I was also clear to them that I was doing all I could to complete what was assigned to me. 



Finally I was assigned to a project in which the team PM complained I was producing about 30% of what other devs (one whom I know has 10+ years experience in another company he previously worked for) would produce, so the bosses decided to give me a few weeks to find a better position. When asked about this I clarified that I would understand if this had happened in the first projects I was assigned to, but now I made sure to complete all my assigned work (and then I would get assigned more by either tickets from backlog or taking from other devs) within a couple of days before sprints end, but it didn’t make a difference.



I remember feeling sad the day my internship with them ended, because that day I was laid off due to the company having to restructure and cut a third of their staff, but this time I feel more relieved. The first two months or so that I was hired I felt happy to work, but eventually that changed to a point where I’d feel stressed every time I woke up, even on weekends. Throughout the projects I’ve worked at the bosses have always advertised me and my work to their potential clients as someone with more experience, and I’ve always had to work with people who were seniors, hardly ever with any junior. The company policy explicitly shows one should work a minimum of 40 hours per week.



I understand that my work may need improvement (at least maybe speed-wise), but could it be said I was set up for failure? My peers at the company are more experienced and understandably produce more than me, but if my failure to perform had been that big an issue before, should I have been let go sooner? Is it possible that I was kept around because I presented little burden salary-wise to the company?

That being said, I enjoy web dev and do not wish to stop in this career (and hope to find a better job soon). But are other places as demanding as this? How challenging is it for any of you to work remotely or from home?"

Anybody have advice for trying to find a good IT job? I've been applying to jobs over the past month and a half (nearly 150-200 applications submitted) and to be honest it's been a pretty demoralizing experience thus far. 

I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Information Science. I started as a comp Sci major but swapped my junior year after I struggled with the upper-division math classes, so a majority of my credits are comp sci related. I have 4 summers of IT-related internship experience: 2 for a school district and 2 in application support (project work) for a nuclear power company.

For some reason, the only interviews I can secure are for the jobs that I'm not entirely qualified for; therefore, they don't go over as well as I'd hope. I haven't heard back from a single position that I am actually confident I meet the requirements for. My resume is solid, as I got help from my dad who has worked in technology for 20+ years as a Senior VP for a large tech company where he has conducted hundreds, if not thousands of interviews. 

I feel like my interview skills are also solid, I just don't have the experience that the companies are looking for. I graduated from school late due to a break before switching my major so feel like I am already behind, and need to try and get my career started asap. 

I would appreciate any advice that ya'll have to offer.

Edit: At the moment my goal is to get into IT project management. My experience during my Nuke plant internships was primarily working on projects within the IT department. I created project schedules and SharePoint pages, worked on project tasks, and worked a command center for an application deployment and really enjoyed all of it."

I (EU national), an Android developer with 3.5 yoe (3 in two mid-sized (200+ people) companies and 6 months internship in another, small company), am looking to move to **The Netherlands** and looking for your input on my salary expectations.

I am in the early stages of interviewing with an Uber competitor (they have a hub in Amsterdam and are in the ride hailing industry for a while).

Based on the article about [the trimodal nature of salaries](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-salaries-in-the-netherlands-and-europe/) they belong to the 3rd tier and I should be asking for a salary between 70K-75K €/year.

However, I think I am probably wrong and I would be shooting myself in the foot with such a proposal.

s8tldy,46,2022-01-20,Advice on how to manage time as a CS student IMO,McQueeeeef,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/s8tldy/advice_on_how_to_manage_time_as_a_cs_student_imo/,"I've seen a couple of posts about how to manage your time between classes, side-projects, internships, leetcoding, extra circulars, etc. So I thought I'd share what I have learned as a 5th year.

First off, managing your time in college is kind of overrated. Creating a schedule that plans your day down to the hour is unbearable. Same with creating a To-Do list with a bunch of major tasks - it just never works the way you think it will, so why make yourself anxious with these impossible standards? We are human beings at the end of the day and can only give our best energy to a few things. 

With that being said, let me breakdown the 3 important areas on your resume that you need to be considered a good candidate. I'll also mention that you only need 2 of these 3 areas to be strong, and can lack in the other. 

1.) Classes / GPA

\- If you enjoy classes and are a good student, then by all means put in the effort to get a high GPA. It does stand out contrary to the belief that it does not matter anymore. Sure, above a 3.0 is fine to get by, but having a 3.9 can carry you if you are lacking in other areas. If you are just starting out in college, I recommend buckling down to get a high GPA, it'll help with getting that internship. 

2.) Side Projects

\- If you don't have work experience yet or a high GPA, then you need to show off your ability to code. Get a Github (USE GIT) and try to put together 2-3 DIVERSE projects. Each project should try to be different in terms of language, domain, and interest. 3 CRUD applications in Javascript isn't going to raise any eyebrows. Also, use commonly known API's like Reddit, Twitter, Spotify, and use commonly known technologies like Docker, MongoDB (any database), and cloud computing services. Base your projects off of them. Companies like that. 

I should note that a good side project takes time to build. Don't burn yourself out by trying to build 3 projects in a semester. Just focus on 1 at a time and just hash it out. Lastly, when you feel like you have these projects done, make sure to include your Github link on your resume. 

3.) Work Experience

\- Once you get some work experience, you can probably afford to lack in one of the other categories. Usually it is GPA. As long as you're above a 3.0, have some unique side projects, and an internship to show off, I am hoping it'll be smooth sailing from here on out. 

So wherever you are in your journey, try to pick 2 of these things to focus on. Doesn't need to be an everyday task, but make them your top priorities and set some realistic goals to chase while you are doing them.

For leetcoding, try to start practicing about a month out from applying. Do 2-3 problems a day. Start out with Easy problems and learn the solutions. Build a foundation. Try to think of leetcoding as a small habit like reading a book before bed. This way, you won't get stressed out about making it a huge part of your day, and if you forget to do it, you'll have tomorrow. 

As for exercise, social life, and extra circulars, please make time for them. Your life will suck if you only focus on school and work. But, remember your priorities and try to not to get sucked into these activities too much. If you are going out 3 nights a week, every week, you probably should know you're going to be lacking in CS areas. If you are trying to go all out in bulkSZN and bench 350lbs for 12 reps, you're probably going to be lacking in CS areas.

All things considered, everyone is wired differently and it is up to you to prioritize your time. Have faith in the course you are on and try to enjoy what you do, and if you can do that, you'll be fine.

**TLDR**: Don't spread yourself too thin. Figure out what you need to prioritize based off your situation. Make time for the good times and your health. Trust yourself in making the right decisions."

I also didn't take as many classes as a normal graduate probably has; I was able to take some math classes instead of CS classes. Also, we weren't required to take a databases class so I didn't (CS department was a mess). The ""weed out"" class at my school was called software engineering and I got a b in that.

I'm someone who has a solid understanding in algorithms, memory management, and definitely object oriented programming but there are times where I feel lost when trying to code, and sometimes I may forget some basic syntax when I try to code from scratch.

I'm pretty familiar and comfortable to a degree with C++, C, Python, and Java, but I don't know any front-end languages, any frameworks, I don't even have a Github. I feel a bit ""naked"" in terms of skills and I don't know what tools I need to succeed.

I'm someone who is not a fully-fledged software engineer yet but I am willing to do anything it takes to be one. I think I have found my groove and it just requires a lot of grinding for me, as I don't have any previous experience in coding from my younger years. I'm wondering how can one see if they're actually a good programmer? I'm still in uni, to give you further context.

I've done a few school projects in university, and I have taken a myriad of CS courses which I've done about average on. I've also TA'ed for an introductory Python course (which I aced when I took it) as well which is beneficial in terms of experience. I haven't done too many leetcode questions and have had ZERO internships so far.

My university career has been a very tumultuous one, with me having a really horrible time in first year. My mental health and grades took a huge hit (it's a long story). I still haven't declared a major yet (you're allowed to do this), but it looks like I may have to end up being a BA Math major instead of a BA CS major due to my previous years being an anchor to my GPA and the CS major being very competitive. However I'm still trying to get into the CS major and will not give up on this. 

How can I get my skin in the game in terms of internships? From where can I start improving myself? What should I start learning in terms of tools/frameworks? Is it really possible to become a good software engineer with a Math major (and probably a CS minor)? I am taking Math courses and I've done below average on them, but I've only done this to keep the option of being a Math major open. I suck at Math and I dread it, but I think it's potentially a sacrifice that I would have to make in terms of GPA.

At the end of the day, my path looks to be an unusual one, not ones that I would say 85% of this subreddit takes or is lucky to take.

Not knowing where to start or not knowing where my problems really lie, makes me feel even more confused at myself and there are times where I don't have the will to do anything, because I'm in that feeling of ***I don't know what I don't know***.

How do people grow in this field? I'm someone who's extremely willing to learn and I am someone who will ask a lot of questions because I realize that me stepping up to ask a question after being stuck on a problem for a long time is important for my own growth as a coder, and helps the company I'd be working for in the long run. In short, I love to continue pushing my limits, but the issue is, I don't know where to even start.

I'm ready to hear anything from anybody."

I didn't know a single thing about git or even how to use a command line when I graduated college, because I went to a shitty university and I was lazy back then and didn't learn on my own. I see people my age creating facial recognition software or some shit while I learn about basic things like object oriented design. I perform at the level of a college student despite having 1.5 years of industry experience. 


Somehow, I have gotten hired at major tech companies. I interned at a fortune 500 company and got assigned to a team that literally did nothing my entire internship. I wrote 5 lines of code the whole summer. Then I got another internship at another fortune 500 company and this was right at the start of the pandemic so they had nothing for me to really do. I spent the whole summer just watching Youtube at home and doing random Jira tickets every week.  


Now I work at FA*NG. I work on internal dashboards. My entire job is just doing tiny, tiny bug fixes. I work on a very low priority service on a tiny team. I work maybe 10-12 hours a week. I ""help"" out sister teams at times because I feel guilty of how little I do, only to fuck up and get a bunch of help from the team members on that team. 


I've literally never had a difficult job and I KNOW it's coming sooner rather than later. And I KNOW i'm a terrible dev and that when it does happen, everything will come crashing down. I'll get exposed for what I am. Someone who has just skirted by on pure luck. The anxiety is killing me."

I already have a passport (It will probably expire by my graduation, but at least I have one) I speak English, had four years of Spanish in highschool (It was either Spanish or French) and I am about a little less than halfway through the Duolingo Italian course.

But I want to wait until the end of February to see what internship options do I have and make the best choice for myself.

**Q : What should I do now?**

1. Accept the offer now, then they generate the offer letter, but I might deny the offer letter if there is a better option by the end of February. (It might cause trouble to the company and I don't want that)
2. Deny the offer now and wait for a reply from other companies. (possibly end up with no offer)

Ever since then, I have really struggled to figure out what I want to do for the foreseeable future. I did a couple of internships and had one on capitol hill (virtually) from sep-dec. That internship helped me figure out that I am definitely interested in working in a congressional office, even just for a few years. When the internship ended, I had to figure out my next steps. The program actually offered all interns to come back in person in either the spring (now) or fall (August). I chose to come back in August. Of course, who knows what will happen pandemic-wise in the next 8 months or so, but if things go well I'd have an internship and housing in DC come August. In the meantime, I thought that it would be a great opportunity to travel (I am vaxxed + boosted and would follow all precautions). I think that doing something like workaway (international volunteer gigs) for about 6 months or so would be a really cool experience that I wouldn't get to do once i am trying to climb up the career ladder. However, I've just been offered an AmeriCorps VISTA position that seems pretty cool. If I accept this position, I can neither travel nor do the DC internship since VISTA is a year long. The VISTA position deals with digital equity which is definitely one of my interests. However, VISTA is known for ""modest"" stipends and is not a full-time career. But, it is something. So, I feel dumb for turning it down. Imo, VISTA is pretty non-competitive so it's not like i can't get a similar opportunity in the future (i just don't know if it'll be the same one).

This is a throwaway account to keep it anonymous but I wanted to post a summary (so far) of my 1st year recruiting experience.

I worked for 6 years as an engineer (no promotions, brand name companies etc) before business school.  I went to UG at a school ranked in the T50-T100ish range, nothing special there.  My school is good, but definitely not ""amazing.  

I've seen a lot of ""AMAs"" on here as recruiting wraps up, and even though I'm still interviewing, I'm mostly done, so I wanted to post my summary (with numbers so far).

Alright, let's get to it, I came in pursuing consulting with LDPs as a back-up plan for internship recruiting.

Number summaries for consulting:

\- Applied 17 places, both on &amp; off campus.  Got 4 first round interviews, 2 second round interviews &amp; 1 offer.  Offer was for about $8,900/month with a boutique in a Midwest office.  Likely rejecting this due to low pay, and low post-MBA compensation.

For corporate roles (Finance, product management &amp; general management)

 \- Applied to 16 corporate roles or so received 8 first round interview invites, 3 final round interview invites with 3 offers so far, and 1 pending results of final interview.

Offer 1:  Product management @ Generic F500 company for $6,000/month.  I rejected this for being too low

Offer 2:  PMO role at a midwest tech company.  Pay was absurdly low, so I rejected it.  Some companies love to lowball students.  I learned that the hard way.

Offer 3:  Finance LDP at Financial services firm for $9,000/month &amp; $6000 sign-on.

Hope this helps provide some insights into what its actually like for recruiting.  I have a couple more interviews lined up, but I'm likely done in a few weeks."

I work for Amazon. So my college is paid for. Courses are going well. I’m taking python. I also found out the college pays/reimburses for any of the major certs $500 or less and gives you the corresponding credits for the course. 

I’m aiming to apply for an internship near the end of my AA.

I feel like I have the groundwork laid out for a healthy and happy life, but I feel completely depressed, aimless and unfulfilled. I feel like I need something more, a sort of life goal if you will. Some one thing that I can truly surround myself with and pour time into. 

I've got such an urge to invest my time into one niche but I can't figure out what I want it to be, so I've ended up switching hobbies extremely frequently throughout pretty much my entire life. For a week I wanted to be a pro speed cuber, then chess player, then ping pong player, then break dancer, then physicist, etc. I just cannot make up my mind. I've become a jack of many trades because of this, but I still feel fucking horrible, I feel like I've wasted 19 years of my life, and that I'm falling behind in whatever this thing is that I haven't found yet. 

Around 4 or so months ago I decided that I'm sick of this shit and just wanted to make up my mind on a random hobby I had in the past. I spun a randomness wheel online and ended up landing on league of legends so I've been playing that for the past 4 months, constantly striving for improvement. In the end I only feel depressed as fuck and I think I regret my decision. The truth of the matter is that I'll never be as good as Faker or whoever child prodigy like GeneralSniper because I started too late on a genre and game that has existed too long. 

After evaluating the current E-sports market I feel like Riot's upcoming fighting game Project L might be a good choice because I already have some decent experience with fighting games, but even then I still feel doubt. I don't know if gaming is the category I for this interest I want to pursue. For example, although it's less enjoyable, machine learning I do find quite interesting and I feel like pursuing that would be a good way of having a healthy life with stable income, but if I'm doing that then who's to say that I won't still retain this feeling I currently have of feeling like I have the groundwork but am missing the passion project/interest. Also another goal I've had since I was 15 or so was inventing mind uploading, but that's extremely unrealistic and lofty, although I do feel like it's the goal I MYSELF intrinsically most want to achieve. 

I'm just lost as fuck, it's 2 am, I don't know what goal I should chase, will this keep happening forever or do you think I'll just grow out of it and cease to exist. Idk but if someone could give helpful advice , that would actually change my life, because this problem has been plaguing my mind for so long and it don't feel like it's going away soon.

Also, my current job is in ETL domain and I have no experience in Software Development. But I have done a few minor projects which I'm sure will not add any weightage to my resume. Should I take up any major projects to boost my profile?"

&amp;#x200B;

I am an intern in one of the biggest company in the world. I work with digital team who takes care of online sales ( key orders in  ERP system, ship them and so on). 

There is a tool created from the previous worker that is used daily to create some files. 

This tool is getting broken from time to time if there is some deviation in the data ( extra column or the status of the order is not equal to something specific).  Im not an IT guy but when they hired me I told them that I was interested in coding and was learning myself. But to be honest I knew nothing when I started (2 month ago). So yesterday, colleague approached me  asking to fix the tool. The guy who created it I can say he was quite good in coding as he automated some manual works. So they expected me to do same thing. 

I tried yesterday whole night beside the fact that I have exam tomorrow and i should not work after working hours. 

I detected the mistake ( print(df) was empty dataframe) but had no idea how to fix it because the data in the file was not matching to the data extracted from the system. I asked my colleague to help on that how to get the correct data from system to fix the code.

she politely replied that I was an useless piece of shit(manager in CC), and she would work on the problem when she would get free (she knows nothing about python, VBA, Java. Probably she thinks that Java is  a coffee company). In one moment all of my happiness after I detected the problem with my limited knowledge and google help was gone. my motivation to continue working was gone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Somehow I found the power to continue after that and fixed the code myself, got the right data from the system, made the report and now the tool can work in two different situation. 

Thanks to this a\*\*\*\*le that I know more than I knew yesterday. 

&amp;#x200B;

Im just sharing this because here are so many new coders and to give them some motivation. Work hard, and at the end of the day you will find the solution to every problem.

2. Get an internship. Internships nowadays pay $20-$30 an hour and seem like a good option, wondering what you guys think of this? Feels strange to work as an intern after graduating…

3. Bullshit my way into a job and do horribly until they can me.

Even if it’s a dream job with higher pay, I just don’t think it’s worth it. 

The next step of the interview process is an hour long interview with the head of the company where, based on reviews, he will be asking a lot of more personal and less technical questions to see if my personality is a good fit for their company, which also seems a bit weird. 

Then the next step would be a more technical interview with a manager and a few of my potential team members. I’m wondering what I should look out for as red flags to see if these Glassdoor reviews were right, or if they’re just spiteful revenge reviews for being let go?"

Is it possible to be 'too good' at help desk?

I came to this company about 3yrs ago and have been a rock star. I'm usually pretty humble about things but I've heard from soo many people how good I'm doing, even my bosses. I almost begged him to come up with something for me to improve on in my review. (maybe I'm letting it get to my head) I've taken on sysadmin roles to free up our sysadmin for higher level stuff. I've taken over the networking and configs on our Aruba switches but its nothing special, just a flat layer2 network. I'm hungry for more.

They hired another support technician about a year ago and moved me to ""support analyst""... but the new hire hasn't been very good (yet). Everyone still calls me directly for everything and now I'm getting higher level projects (which is good) but I'm trying to juggle a lot. We have a spring intern and I'm trying to train them both to take some load off, but I think our company just needs more good people working the help desk.

Anyway my company knows I want to move up. I was going to apply for an internal cybersecurity position (A+, net+, sec+, server+, linux+ certified... soon Aruba and CheckPoint) but the head IT boss heard and called me into this office. He said it wouldn't be a good fit for me and that I would NOT be hurting my career by not applying... so obviously I didn't apply because he decides. The next review I just got a normal raise (I was expecting a new job title or something).

I'm getting great practical experience but on paper it looks like ""tech support"" so finding another job will be tough. They have me in a catch 22.

I like my company and my coworkers are really great.. not sure I could find anywhere with as good of people.... but I'm passively applying for jobs when I see something interesting... I'm just not sure how long I should give it (3yrs in, straight out of college). Anyone have any suggestions? I'm thinking maybe ask for a new job title in my next review... but it'd be pretty obvious why"

I graduated with a bachelor's in computer science around 2017 feeling lost. I had no interest in the subject but had decent grades and I only kept pursuing it because my parents wanted me to get a degree I would have a future with. The school I went to wasn't good. I had to take at least 19 credits per semester with community service and had to deal with teachers who knew very little and had no interest about CS or teaching itself. Due to financial reasons, I stayed and graduated there. I didn't secure any internships because I was incompetent, unconfident and it also didn't help that I was a foreigner in need of sponsorship. Once I graduated, I had to wait at least half a year after graduation to undergo adjustment of status through family. I applied to several places and got nothing but rejection from every place, even ones like Revature.

Someone mentioned trying a witch company so i did that. Eventually in 2018 I landed a job as a QA and worked until the end of 2019. My team was amazing. My manager was great and she gave me good feedback. Around the time the contract was over, my manager offered to help apply for a position with the company. It didn't guarantee me the job. I would have to go through the interview phase again. I should've taken it. My self doubts and the way I entered the workforce demotivated me from doing that.

It was around this time that news of the pandemic started circulating around. It was also around this time that I decided to confront my fears about coding and started coding every day for a year. I was curious about Data Analysis and practiced sql/python with its data specific packages(numpy, pandas, matplotlib) and also got exposure to BI tools like Tableau. I volunteered for a Non profit as a Data Analyst for a month long project to apply my skills and use it in the real world. During this time I realized that I didn't hate the subject or learning. It was the environment I was in that influenced the way I felt about it. I could now say that I am passionate about the subject. I was having a lot of fun with it. I thought I was ready for a job so I started applying and heard crickets.  I used my true resume with the experience I had and the projects I had worked on. 

Eventually I heard back from a training and placement program advertised for asipiring Data Analysis. But when I inquired more they said they only had BigData and Machine Learning positions. I looked at the BigData curriculum and thought it was cool so I went with it and they turned out to be another witch company and they stated their methods during the orientation. In my desperation of not having had a job for a year and hearing back from other places led me to sign a contract with them. The training was abysmal and I made up for the lack of trainer's competence with Udemy courses and online resources. I tried not to make the same mistake I made back in school, tried not to get depressed and put in extra effort to grasp BigData tools. I have built small pipelines with AWS, practiced processing data in Pyspark and I'm learning the various capabilities in Snowflake(time travel, Snowpipe etc). Also got exposure to Hadoop  I am fascinated with what the capabilities technology has to offer but I'm ashamed of the way I got here. I recently got offered a role and I've technically started. 

However they require me to fill a security clearance form.  My employer wants me to fill the information that aligns with the fake resume they helped create for me. I find that idea deeply unsettling and don't want to go through with it. I am trying to find an employment lawyer to help me on this matter. I am going to forgo the opportunity if I cant be truthful.

I am a dumbass. I have made a lot of mistakes. I don't know how to make a good resume and I can't sell myself. My true journey began much later than my peers. I am lost. I still suck. I got better and I am getting better everyday but I still have a long way to go. I'm doing now what I could've done a long time ago which is to come here for help and advice. I am trying to turn things around for me but as you can see I have a bad sense of direction. I needed someone else to point out the obvious that I'm missing.

If you read all this. Thank you. Wholeheartedly. I really appreciate you taking the time. It means a lot that you thought of me.

tl:dr   
wasn't passionate about the field at first. sucked at cs. no internships no projects. worked as QA through a witch company.  switched to data analytics after qa role was over. faced my fears. started coding. loved the data field. applied jobs again. no success. joined a second witch company for BigData. started a new role. they are asking me to misrepresent the information for security clearance. i'm not going through with it."

I should start off by saying I am a Freshman in my second semester at a reputable State University. 

The only coding course I took last semester was an “Introduction to Python” course, which I did well in. I am taking two more CS courses this semester, and if all goes well I am planning to take a DSA course(which I hear is important for getting internships) and a Computer Architecture class the Fall semester. With all the credit I came into college with, I can even graduate at the end of my third year. 

I am a bit stressed out right now because a family friend (who is very supportive of my major + her father works in the field) is telling me I should have been looking for a summer internship already, and that I should still be looking for one right now. 

I felt I would be better equipped with some programming skills to start applying for internships during my second year of college. I tried explaining myself to her but she said I should just go to my campus’ career center and they can figure out how to make me marketable with limited skills. She also said I shouldn’t just sit around during the summer, so I should try to work on research if all else fails.

I really have nothing computer science-wise on my resume. I have no personal projects(was planning to work on one during the summer), and I would not even consider myself to have basic fluency in one coding language yet.  

I am just very worried and I feel a little ashamed. I am angry at myself that I didn’t try to get internships in the fall and I feel like I have already messed up. If I really should get an internship for the summer, what places would even accept me? How should I go about the rest of my time in college? Is it possible for me to graduate early with an internship.  I genuinely am looking for advice, and it may seem silly to go listen to strangers online, but I just need an unbiased perspective on things. 

TL;DR - a family friend is telling me to apply for summer internships for the summer after my freshman year. I have only taken one introductory coding class in completion so far, what should I do?

I will admit I have bombed some OA's but I have also had some where I nearly aced them.  Even from the follow-up interviews I have had, I always sense that the interviewer thinks there's something missing, and end up eventually getting a rejection email.

I have a project from an AI/ML class that is published on GitHub but it was a group project and I don't ever get any questions about it. Should I remove the sections that say it was a group project for a class? Even in this case, I have other priorities including a full schedule, many interviews/OA's, as well as practicing LeetCode, so how could I really buff up my GitHub presence before the end of the semester? What's some paths you have taken to stand out and seem extra qualified by using GitHub that won't kill my personal life?"

I plan on graduating in Winter 2022 but could delay it to Spring 2023. I accepted an internship offer for the summer but I don't want to work there after graduation. The intern pay($38/hr) is good and there is housing, but the new grad offer I see on Levels is the same pay as intern but without the housing and I wouldn't want to work here after graduation. 

I was really hoping to land a tech company this past recruitment season but I failed all of the interviews(Microsoft final round, Capital One final round, Amazon OA, Google OA). As of now I am just going to do the internship I have accepted but should I do a full time masters, so I have another chance at internship interviews? My thought process is if I can't pass internship interviews, how am I going to pass new grad interviews?"

What makes me really confused is that it is difficult to find an intern in a big tech that can offer H1B in the future without having any internship experience. But small start-ups usually can't let me in to just gain experience because they are actually aiming at a future full-time worker and most of them can't offer us international students h1b to work full time in the future. So they won't consider us in the first place. That seems a dilemma for us.

Could someone please offer me some advice for international students to find their first internship? Thank you in advance!"
s9kubh,27,2022-01-21,How I found validation from within instead of seeking it from others,NDKim,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/s9kubh/how_i_found_validation_from_within_instead_of/," Background: I am a 23-year-old college graduate who has always been an accessive attention seeker.

I was doing some journaling trying to figure out why I was such an attention seeker. The answer was finding validation from within. This was something that I always heard in the past but it didn't make much sense to me. ""How? How do I find validation from within?"" The answers were never straightforward. In this post, I will try my best to articulate my findings where there are straightforward answers.

It boils down to four points.

1. **Getting Healthy**
2. **Finding a wardrobe that suits you**
3. **Getting a hairstyle that suits you**
4. **Having a job/hobby**

Before you say anything, I know this all sounds very cliche and superficial even, but please hear me out.

* **Getting healthy**

I'll be the first to say I always hated the way I looked. In pictures, shirtless, etc. I was constantly down on myself for being chubby and feeling shitty about it. I decided that change was needed. Getting healthy is difficult. It is hard work and requires a lot of patience. However, hitting the gym and eating right has changed my life and the way I view myself forever. It was hard at first, not seeing instant gratification after a difficult workout. But as time went on my face started getting a little slimmer and the shirts that used to be tight on me started getting a little looser. Before I knew it I found myself not only liking but LOVING the way I looked in pictures and in the mirror.

You don't need a gym membership to get fit. If you never worked out in your life you can start at home by looking up a few workout routines on YouTube and following them. Over the course of time, you gradually do more intense workouts and possibly find yourself at the gym. Not going to lie to you this is the easy part

The hard part is eating right. I won't lie and say that I was always consistent and eating the right foods. There were times when I took myself out to Wendy's and got a 4 for 4 at 3:00 am.

If this is the case for you, don't be down on yourself. Just do better the next day and eat something healthier.

""But I don't want to eat just chicken and rice every day!!!"" Neither do I! Good thing for both of us, there are healthy alternatives to fast food that taste the same for the most part. I recommend TikTok for healthy recipes of foods that you enjoy so that eating is a little easier for you. Also cooking instead of eating out every day saves so much money (maybe that money can go towards a gym membership?).

Becoming leaner was a long process for me, but I stuck with it and I am glad I did because now I am not afraid to show my body in public.

* **Finding a wardrobe that suits you**

Find clothes that fit your body type! Unluckily, I wasn't able to grow to a 6'3 model of a man, instead, I maxed out at 5'6 :) . There are certain clothes that fit certain body types, for example, oversized clothing wouldn't look as good on me compared to someone who was taller. So I started wearing clothes that fit. Sounds easy enough right? Turns out it's actually a lot of experimenting.

Find a color or style that suits you or that you like. I personally prefer neutral colors when it comes to clothes, but you might like something flashier, that's fine. As long as it fits.

Clothes cost money and depending on what you want, they can cost a lot of money. What I did in order to rebuild my wardrobe was to thrift. Thrifting has become immensely popular and I am sure you've done it at some point as well. If you don't like thrifting Uniqlo and H&amp;M have plenty of foundational clothes that you may like on a budget. Foundational clothes such as jeans, a white/black T-shirt, bomber jacket.

Start off simple because the outfits that you like today might not be your favorite come a few months.

There are plenty of trusted male YouTubers that have channels dedicated to helping you find essentials as well as how to wear certain clothes. (Some of my favorites: Johnny Thai, TeachingMensFashion)

My closet used to be horrendous. I mean just bullshit everywhere. Have you heard of the phrase ""look good, feel good?"" Truer words cannot be uttered. If you have a decent sense of fashion, everything matches bottom to top, and you feel comfortable, you're unbeatable.

* **Getting a hairstyle that suits you**

Fuck me this was hard.

In the past six months, I had:

* blonde long hair
* blonde buzz cut
* side fridge with a fade
* a mullet
* back to a side fringe with a fade

and now I am back to a mullet, try to grow my hair out like EERRREEHHH YEAAAGEERRRR.

I'll tell you right now, beyond everything, I think depending on the hairstyle you have, it will make or break you. (not to be dramatic)

Finding a hairstyle that suits your face is what it comes down to. If you have a nice sharp jawline and a normal-sized forehead you're lucky! Anything you do will work! Good thing I don't have either of those or else you wouldn't be getting this fantastic advice!

As someone who has a more rounded face shape with chubby cheeks and a big forehead I realized that after many attempts, long hair suited me best. I have sort of a kpop middle part going on which sides my forehead a little and makes my face look more even.

Like fashion, there are thousands of male YouTubers that give out hair advice. Alex Acosta is a personal favorite.

Or look up ""hairstyles for \_\_\_\_\_ face shape.""

* **Having a job/hobby**

This is truly the hardest part.

After graduating from school I was out of a job for a couple of months. I do sports photography/videography which is a competitive field, to begin with, so I had self-doubts when I was getting denied after every interview that I thought went well.

To be honest, this point is where I have the hardest time giving advice. Getting a job isn't as easy as thrifting clothes or finding out that long hair suits better than a buzzcut. I also realize that people come from different circumstances.

However, I think the best way to go about this point is to take advantage of the resources you have.

For a couple of months I was unemployed I went out to high school football take pictures and create highlight reels that I later used for my portfolio. After doing these shoots for free and sometimes even paying for them I got better at my craft and I had more material for my portfolio. Visually being able to see that I was improving in my field was rewarding and the self doubts that I had slowly faded away.

Eventually, I got a job. I won't lie and say that it was all me, my previous boss from a previous internship hired me at this new location. But I made an effort to make connections when I was doing my internship to hopefully land a job in the future.

I was going to talk about just getting a job but having a hobby that you're good at can be equally as rewarding.

Say you have a hobby of knitting and you get better with every piece that you make, you're going to feel like you have self-worth. You acknowledge that you can make something beautiful.

**My point is:**

Everything that I mentioned above **takes a lot of time and effort,** years even, which is what I feel inhibits people the most (it did for me). There are going to be off days where you don't feel like doing anything and I think that's okay as long as you eventually get back on track. Hopefully sooner rather than later.

Getting fit, finding the right hairstyle, finding the right clothes, and getting a job took me 23 years to get a decent grasp of. There are still things that I can improve on, but we keep moving right?

I mentioned earlier, if you look good, you feel good.

For the first time in my life, I can proudly say that I am confident with who I am and have found validation from within. I think a lot of that is attributed to the first three points. I no longer seek attention from others because I ***know*** that I look good.

I hope you find some of the things I mentioned above useful. If you need any more advice or to talk deeper into things I'd love to chat.

I am still growing up, I'm only 23 years old. The things I mentioned above may sound superficial but they are things that truly helped me gain confidence. With that being said if you have any advice for me I'd love to hear it.

You can do it."
s9kugm,12,2022-01-21,"Bachelor degrees, General vs. Honours",BigCookieCutter,cscareerquestionsCAD,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsCAD/comments/s9kugm/bachelor_degrees_general_vs_honours/,"I am currently enrolled in a accelerated program at the University of Windsor that will end with me obtaining a Honours BSc in Computer Science by May of 2023. However, the option exists where I can graduate early and have a BSC in Computer Science (General) byt the end of this summer semester. I'm trying to decided whether all that time and money is worth the distinction between the 2 degrees. 

I currently have very high marks and find all my class work very easy, but I don't feel my time is valued. A lot of what is being taught is available in a much more in depth, up to date,  and practical way on the internet. I'm supplementing my education with independant learning with this in mind, but don't feel I will be missing out on too much other than a credential if I choose to graduate early. 

My main question is **Just how valuable is the difference between the 2 degrees to employers?** 

Some other factors that are influening my decision are:

-I do not want to work in Canada for more than a few years. Whether that means working for a CAN company remotely elsewhere(I'm aware this is very difficult), or working locally in another country. 

-Total comp while important, is not nearly as important as the first point. I would trade a massive portion of my salary for good weather and QOL

-Due to the fast track nature of my program, I have very little I could show in the way of projects at this point and will not have an chance to do any internships or coop(due to sequencing)

-I am in a position financially where I would be able use the time I would save by graduating early to work on learning more practical knowlege and creating projects for 4-12 months. I would not be able to do this after graduating from the full length program due to tuition costs and time crunches.  

TD,DR How important is the difference between a 3 year BSc in Comp Sci and a 4 year BSc with Honours?"
s9lfdb,3,2022-01-21,Psychiatrist making me try therapy before letting me back on medication,anon672156,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/s9lfdb/psychiatrist_making_me_try_therapy_before_letting/,"I was on Vyvanse for almost 3 years and it worked really well for me. A few months into the pandemic (probably sometime in the summer) I started feeling a lot more anxious than usual (because duh) so I decided to stop taking Vyvanse for a while since it seemed to exacerbate my anxiety. At the time, I also didn't need it as much because my classes were online and my work shut down. Between then and now she had me try two different anti-anxiety medications but neither really worked out. Currently I’m not taking anything, but I’ve been struggling with symptoms of ADHD and anxiety. 

Now, I'm in grad school and my classes are mostly going to be in-person and I also have an internship so I'm going to be really busy. I scheduled an appointment with my psychiatrist to ask if I could try going back on Vyvanse again, and she said no because I had already ""failed"" Vyvanse and therefore the pharmacy wouldn't fulfill her request if she tried. She said that if I wanted to try it again, I'd have to prove that the circumstances are different than last time I was on Vyvanse and that I'm learning other coping strategies for my ADHD by attending therapy for a few months. She admitted that her other patients have been having to wait several months to make a therapy appointment.

Has this happened to anyone before? I am honestly just worried about my performance in school this semester with such a busy schedule and without medication. I am very open to doing therapy but I won’t even be able to start that for a while. I don’t know what to do so any advice is welcome!"
s9lusw,0,2022-01-21,Advice for HS student,thundercatfanclubxo,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/s9lusw/advice_for_hs_student/,"Currently, I am a junior in HS. I have a huge interest in chemistry, especially analytical chemistry that deals with organic matter. In college, I want to be able to participate in research and work in labs with professors as an intern or mentee as soon as possible; hopefully, by sophomore year I look forward to getting some sort of job like that. And I don't just want to be dead weight for whoever I'm working with; I want to contribute. So my question is what would be some good skills for me to have so that I could be prepared? I know, for example, that coding is important to scientific analysis so I started teaching myself Python. What other skills or knowledge should I self-study to give myself the best shot?"
s9mmen,2,2022-01-21,I need an advice,Danyderossi,AskNetsec,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/s9mmen/i_need_an_advice/," 

Hi, I can choose among 3 internships as a computer science student. I really want to land a job in cybersecurity but right now I need to build up my CV and finish my degree.

The 3 internships are:

Automation Software Engineer (you have to validate portions of software implementations for Communication Service Providers based on established engineering principles and in accordance with provided specifications and requirements, help evolving our telecommunication focused product, build demonstrations of product use cases help to prepare collaterals to explain technical product capabilities, software architectures and features, build automated test scripts to analyse test data to verify requirements compliance)

Internship Program for Information Science or Telco Engineer (you have to participate to a project delivery for assigned tasks, that may include performing analysis and design of a IT or Telco Solution, SW Development, systems configurations, troubleshooting systems errors/problems, monitoring and/or testing systems performance, and contribute to the design of technical solutions for customer environments, work under supervision of technical lead and with customer nominated representatives to accomplish assigned tasks)

Automated Assurance Artificial Intelligence &amp; Machine Learning Engineer (validate portions of software implementations for Communication Service Providers based on established engineering principles and in accordance with provided specifications and requirements,  
develop and extend the coverage of current test automation, build automated test scripts to analyse test data to verify requirements compliance, work on small independent software and system integration projects to augment internal work).

As you can see they are intertwined, but I would guess the 2nd one could be more cybersec-oriented (for the telco part). What do you think? Any advice is appreciated."

However, I do not feel like I am qualified enough to get a CS work. The thing is I've never had any industry experience. I got my master's right after my bachelor's. I did not get any internships throughout my study.   I cannot bring myself to build anything out on my own. I feel like I should know all the workings and nuances of any language that I choose to use. My Linux skills are sub par. Sometimes I get distraught that I cannot find solutions to the errors that I get during coding. I am intimidated by error messages that points to nothing in the source code. For example I cannot understand an error trace in a react application due to it pointing to something else other than the source code. I also have a hard time reading and understanding documentation and using them in my projects.

The thing is that I can learn to do the basic stuff like trying to develop a calculator, basic CRUD application but cannot seem to push myself a little bit further. Even if manage to get a job, I think I will fail as I am lacking in my knowledge or I will not keep up with the pace."

I'm currently a junior and I've received internship offers from MIT Lincoln Laboratory, MathWorks, and Amazon. Having a very difficult time making a choice. I really enjoy math and theory, and I'm currently working on proof-based mathematical research at my school. My love for math makes me think that the MIT LL or MathWorks would be very interesting places to work, moreso than Amazon. They each told me that they could give me a math-heavy project.

I would like to pursue a career where I can combine math and programming. However, I don't think I want to go to graduate school (maybe a Masters but PHD is too much time with no money). I would also rather work in the tech industry than academia and make a lot of money, hopefully at Facebook, Google, or a unicorn. I think Amazon may boost my resume with these companies more than the other two options.

So, I'm not sure which to choose. Could experience at MIT LL or MathWorks allow me to specialize into a career in math+programming even without a graduate degree?  Is Amazon the most prestigious in industry? What do you guys think?"

I have currently been working in a UPS warehouse for the past year and I am planning on enrolling in a university program for computer science next year.

If I apply for tech jobs in the future, should I hide the employment gap from my resume by omitting my high school education? Could I just list my current university education, a project section, and my warehouse job on my resume?

I am worried that If I did this and got a job offer and they run a background check they would see my employment gap. Would the long employment gap that comes up in an employment history background check cause an employer to rescind their offer if I did not list it in my resume? Should I be upfront and tell the hiring manager that I have a large employment gap after I get a job offer?

Right now I'm really anxious and don't know If I should even go to university since my work history may prevent me from getting an internship. Maybe I should work for another 3 years to fix my work history before going back to university to study something since I heard that getting a Computer Science degree without internships lock me out of a software career.

Thanks for reading my post."

Teachers and TAs try to be funny and engaging yet no one even acknowledges their efforts. 

Then there is just the stress of GPA. I try to maintain above a 3.5 for internships and for the possibility of grad school. I hate to care about grades but I have no choice. I feel like I will continue to go into each semester with fear that I will fail. Like I legit failed my ECE final before and it dropped me from an A to a B. 

When all else fails I just run until I can’t. It clears my head everyday. But now I can’t barley even walk. I kept running everyday on an injury everyday so now I can barley walk. I can’t do the thing that makes me happiest now. 

I’m sorry. It just feels really depressing for me and I had to vent."

While it's true that experience teaches you a lot too but that experience is still incomplete if you approach it without the basic grounding and knowledge required in order to have that experience.

Almost every other professional discipline takes technical expertise in their field very seriously. The CA community is well known to set such tough exams (Foundation and Inter) that hardly 1-2% of people are able to pass it! Even the Doctor community is known to mandate a rigorous six months internship to even attain a MBBS degree.

Why then do the politicians (as community) don't have any filters set on those entering their profession? Without having a proven and certified knowledge of their profession (Civics, Constitution, State Craft, etc.), how can we expect them to even do their jobs properly?"

I'm a 4th year CSE Engineering student from a 3rd tier college.

And I've got multiple job offers(mostly from WITCH companies)

These are the companies I got placed into TCS, Wipro, Cognizant, Persistent Systems(Product based). Initially, I got LOI from all these companies I accepted all of them except TCS(TPO allowed only 2 offers and Persistent was off-campus). Now the rest 3 companies have sent me Offer letters with Internship Opportunities. I'll most probably be turning down Wipro(less pay compared to others). Now I want to know if I can accept offer letters from both the companies as of now and decide later. Because I'll be trying for much better companies as I have 5-6 months more. But I also want to secure the ones I have.

I mostly spent my first year improving my ( C/C#, Java, Python, JS and frameworks, DSA, and other programming languages ), and tried few foreign languages &amp; I felt that I preferred research&amp; development based projects over Problem Solving. 

However, my knowledge domain is still narrow and due to lack of Contacts, I know only few Seniors(who only meet during Clubs are interested in FAANG race ) , it will be quite difficult to get in touch with such researchers.,and honestly, I don't even know the names of many . 

The domains I like are in lead in China/US(AI, Network, Web Engines) , I can't go abroad for MS without earnings enough for the cost of living there .

I took 8 classes (33 credits) in the fall and will be taking another 8 in the spring. I took some classes during the spring semester of senior year and the summer in high school and cc. I am a bioengineering major. Most of my remaining spring semester courses are just strongly recommended courses with 2 required ones. Haven't completed IGETC or most of my GE's. 52 Credits completed (not including AP credit).

GPA: 3.92 - 12 As, 1 B, 1 excused withdrawal, and 1 W. B was in organic chemistry which is a pretty important major course :(. The 1 B was received while I was taking 8 classes in the fall. EW I gave a valid reason and W was because I wanted to retake the course but with honors credit the following semester.

ECS:

1. Engineering &amp; DIY projects with a portfolio wrote extensively about this passion in my essays.
2. Computational biology projects. Made some programs to learn more about this side of bioE. For example, I used a program that used machine learning to detect diseases based on patient profiles. Just random projects that I did as a hobby honestly.
3. Blog about Scientific Research -  not that popular.
4. Data Science ICC rep - I basically just talk about how the club is progressing
5. Physics Club Publicity officer
6. Created an website with courses to help students in specific classes at CC - kinda like khan academy
7. Private tutoring
8. Working part-time
9. Summer research program - did biology-related research but it wasn't like a proper internship. One of those paid-for programs.
10. Online education - Coursera courses mostly

Transfer students are allowed to give an ""Academic update"" where they can mention grades for fall classes and have a space to mention whatever they want in an additional comments section. I was going to mention how I am starting an engineering club at my school &amp; have been shadowing a doctor for the past 2 months. Not sure if it even matters this late.

A lot of my ECs are wishy-washy and I'm not that confident that they're professional enough to be treated seriously. It's kinda hard getting internships and proper STEM experience as a CC student :(. If anyone has any tips or could detail their experiences getting such opportunities, it would be massively appreciated.

Colleges applied: UCB + UCLA (either would be a dream come true), UCI, and UCSD.

Thanks for any replies."

I have had tendencies to lock into myself and get depressed for some period of time since teens. Nevertheless, I have everytime managed to overcome these mental states.

Covid really did bad for me, instead of visiting China as a part of my uni internship and then leaving for a year to study in Finland I was forced to stay at home for over a year and from that point it all went downhill for me and I burned out. I have managed to get myself together for past 6 months, got a job, moved away from my parent's house, got a new job in sales where I am slowly building my own business and at the same time I am finishing my master's degree in teaching and even started working out 3 Times a week.

The thing is, I currently have everything I have wanted and worked towards since I have accepted that covid has changed everything for everyone but I just can't get the feeling of happiness out of anything, always telling myself that I don't do enough and that I could be doing more. I used to be pretty social, extroverted, fun to go out with and liked by everyone but now I have problems with even talking to my friends and even more to new people because I have such a negative and depressed vibe and I get so tired by them. I am now stuck in the just work hard and it will hopefully go away cycle where I am able to perform and work but then spending a whole saturday / weekend in bed, staring at the ceiling and being closed to everyone, thinking about how I should be doing something productive which is impacting my social life and relationship building a lot. 

I have never contacted a therapist because I have built this anti therapist mindset because of my close family relative being one.

I just needed to share this with someone and maybe hear some of your stories or points of view/advices/suggestions on how to cope with these things and what works for you.

I know that I will figure it out, it's just hard for me now.

Some Background

Microsoft: I don’t have a specific interest in AI, but it sounds fun. Is it a field that requires a master’s degree? If so, I’m not really interested in getting one. Also, as a freshman, does it even matter that this internship is in a specific field I am not necessarily looking to pursue?

Google: Obviously a great choice due to their reputation. However, I don’t know the location or project yet (kinda a big deal). I could end up in my dream location (NYC) or somewhere not as favorable (LA), same deal with the project I work on.

I know Google looks better on a resume and opens a lot of opportunities, but how many more compared to Microsoft? I am struggling to compare the two as there are so many unknowns (could be good or bad) with STEP.

Money is not a factor and any advice would be appreciated :)

None of the classes I have taken so far have taught me anything useful and I feel like i’m running out of time. I feel like my school is more focused on meeting graduation requirements then actually teaching students anything and even though the school is highly accredited, the cs program is terrible and there are only 2 good professors. I have many cs major friends and even they’re struggling to find internships.

My dream job is a web developer or something in AI, but right now I’m good with anything in tech. I’m taking a Java class, but I want to start teaching myself other languages like C and SQL. Does anyone have any suggestions on what websites I should look at to learn these languages? I would love to hear some suggestions from people who overcame this adversity. Should I look into becoming certified? 

Did anyone graduate with a degree in something related to AI and how did that work out for you? Not going to lie this sub makes me extremely worried and anxious for the future so I would love to see some optimistic takes but I understand if i’m set up for failure. Thank you."

Recently I'm getting anxious that things I work on are actually easy, and usually I am experiencing FOMO on C and C++, mostly the latter, because of how many critical pieces of infrastructure (DBMS for example) are being developed in it. So maybe I should switch entirely to C/C++/Rust and do systems programming?

I am particularly interested in doing more  work with AI, and I have been offered a position in a biomedical AI Lab  to complete a Master's degree in Computer and Electrical Engineering  (MASc).

I spoke with my manager,  and he is looking to keep me and is pushing upper management for better  compensation and has talked to me about taking on some more AI work  within the team; however there is a time crunch as I need to make a  decision before any compensation changes will get the sign off. The  current compensation is fairly low compared to my peers (on avg \~15-20k  difference) and I have 2+ years startup experience, and 12 months of  internships all with this company (different teams).

For  the Master's degree the primary benefit would be increased opportunity  to work on more complex problems and the line of research coincides with  a startup I have been working with.

Curious  what have people's experiences been with masters degrees (particularly  in Canada)? Do they open up much in terms of opportunity, or would I be  better off continuing with my team?"

Cloud Engineer,
Infrastructure Engineer,
Network Enginner,
Business/Systems Analyst,
Information Protection Specialist,
Data Analyst/Engineer


I've always been interested in Data Analytics with the hope of becoming a Data Enginner one day and through my curriculum I've learned Python/Pandas, SQL, NoSQL/MongoDB, and Tableau so I feel like I'm pretty well equipped to handle this area. 

I'm interested in the Cloud too however and I'll be taking a Cloud architecture/AWS class next year for my major. Plus I've heard that the Cloud is hot right now.

I've worked in clinical trials as a project manager for 4.5 years now. Every time I attempt to delve further into the science side of things, my hand gets slapped and I get told ""that's for the MDs &amp; PhDs"". I only have a BSc in biochemistry. I'm frustrated with my company's response - but know I will face this wall regardless of where I'm at. I'm intrinsically excited about the work we're doing and think I'd do great in a graduate program. Here's the catch:

* My undergrad GPA was a 2.4.

Reasons:

* I was first gen so wasn't expecting to want more school after my BSc. ""C's get degrees"" as my peers &amp; parents would say.
* I was struggling to keep my head above the water financially from my sophomore year onward.
* I'm mentally ill, did not know it, and only had access to good treatment after getting a job with good health insurance.
* I'd just left a religious, oppressive household. I'm gay *(well, bi-curious for women; hence the username)*, and the freedom to be myself led to a lot of alcohol, partying, and in all ways rebounding from my family home.
* I was in an abusive relationship for my last 2 years of the program.

Let's just say undergrad was intense in the best and worst of ways. To qualify this, I:

* Volunteered as a research assistant (6 mons), had a manufacturing internship at a nutraceutical company (8 months),  was paid to be a lab manager (1 year)
* Ran an LGBTQ-STEM student organization for 2 years while there
* Taught an official course during my senior year (general liberal arts class that introduced undeclared majors to the variety of subjects they could learn about)
* Worked as the director of advocacy for one of the multicultural coalitions

Since then, I've:

* Gotten 4.5 years of experience running clinical trials. I've single-handedly managed 2 phase I trials and was second in command on 3 phase II trials, including one in COVID &amp; another that's informing an FDA EUA approval. A year and a half of experience was in drug safety/pharmacovigilance at a top 10 pharma company, analyzing adverse affects of investigational *and* FDA-approved drugs.
* Gotten clinical research professional certified (from national organization **and** certificate from UC Berkeley)
* Gotten PMP (Project Management Professional) certified
* Gotten out of the abusive relationship
* Stabilized my mental health *(mostly)*

I'm studying for the GRE for the next 6 months and hope to knock it out of the park. I'm a great test taker and am confident that if I apply myself, I will get a score in the 90th percentile. I've bought books about writing admissions essays and will workshop my essay for a few months, showing it to anyone who will look at it. I'm also looking through programs for potential mentors to establish a connection with.

Thing is, as I do this, the admissions requirements are weathering my resolve. I'm afraid I'm putting all this work in only to be rejected over a(n understandably important) metric from 5 years ago.

I don't need to go straight into a PhD. I'd be happy to do a year-long post-bacc, a year of retaking courses, or a masters whose credits would transfer into the PhD - any of these to show that when I *actually* apply myself, I can do very well academically. However, I cannot re-do my bachelors degree. I have a stable partner and I want to start a family in the next 6-7 years. I need to be done with school and back in the workforce before that happens.

TL;DR: Please read just the bullet points. Would you admit me? What can I do to increase my odds, short of re-doing my bachelors degree? Is impactful work experience weighed heavy enough to counteract my sh\*t GPA?

Can't tell you how much I appreciate your feedback, good or bad."

sap819,0,2022-01-23,"I was mistreated at a corporate job, should I resign because of it?",Efficient_Piccolo247,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/sap819/i_was_mistreated_at_a_corporate_job_should_i/,"I have been working in this corporate job for a little bit over a year now. A little back story, I worked with a senior that makes me feel so stressful all the time because he never takes full lunch break. I was pressurized when he took only 20mins to finish his meals then continue working. Everything and decisions under him was never clear cut. I had to revise this and that all the time. This new assignment with him, he asked team to have a meeting at 10pm night time. I know its peak season but I am just pressurized by those texts. Then last week at the client, I got yelled at by my client saying the email I sent for her to print out was not directly from me. It was to her boss then her boss forwarded that email to her hence, she refused to print out the work until I send her another email.

I went straight back to my seat and told my senior about it. He was not okay with me sending a new email to the client so he said, ""I will go talk to her boss"". So I went to the client's boss with my senior. There, the boss called the client I was dealing with into the room and asked her what was the problem. Of course she acted innocent saying she did not know which file would be the finalized one therefore she needed me to verify with a new email. As it was not the case that had happened when I was dealing with her just earlier, I explained the situation again telling my side of the story to everyone and the boss. The boss just told the client to do the job, so me and my senior went back to our working room. As soon as I sat down, my senior went straight to teach me a lesson in front of everyone in the room including interns, saying the way I justified the situation earlier was not professional. I asked him what was not professional about telling the truth, he said I was too obvious that I was mad at the client. Mind you I did not once raise my voice nor shout nor use any tone that was not appropriate. I proceeded to ask what did I say. Then the intern was too daring to have a say, telling me (the worker with more experience) that I might not be aware of my own tone while I was mad and told me to not show it when I'm mad at the client. Right after that my senior said the way I dealt with it was personal rather than professional. I was so speechless and dissappointed. I was shaking out of unfairness I felt inside, I tried my hardest to hold back my tears and just went speechless and continued my work. No one was on mysids, I can handle rude client but at least I need my own team to sympathize with me and be by my side not gang up on me and embarrassed me like this.

Was he professional to call me out in front of everyone including interns? If ever, he thinks any of my actions or words were not professional or I was not doing anything right, he should have handled it better/professionally by speaking to me privately. Why did he had to do it in front of everyone and let the intern went on after him? I was so embarrassed, I cried so hard that night and when I woke up the next morning I cried hard again. I just feel like it was unfair. By being professional, I should let everyone else be unreasonable? By being professional, I should let client shout at me even when they were the ones at fault? Just me telling the truth or justifying what had happened is considered unprofessional?? I still don't get it. I don't want to carry on."

I have taken CMOS VLSI design, analog IC design, Solid-State Physics elective courses. We only have license for Cadence Virtuoso in our university and I have a good experience with it. Also I have done 3 internships. 2 of them were with my professor as research intern and research assistant ( CMOS design for a RSFQ system and temperature sensor design for RSFQ systems ). Last one was in Arms industry. They did not have any IC design related jobs, so I worked as VHDL IP designer. I have also taken radar signal processing, image processing, digital communications, networking and superconducting electronics courses too but they are not really related to my field, so I didn't mention them in the beginning. My problem is that we don't have any semiconductor companies in our country, so I have to work abroad. Applied for few places, even though I knew they wouldn't select me, like Intel, Nvidia and so on. I have also seen their junior or recent graduate hirings. All semiconductor companies that had recent grad hirings had inconvenient requirements. Like having experience in all Cadence tools, knowing a HDL langauge and C/C++/Python very very well and architecture ones. I mean our school doesnt have the rest of the Cadence tools, Though I took a CAD VLSI course online, so I at least know their algorithms but I didn't use C or Python that extensively to be at a level they want, I just took the mandatory courses for them and used when needed. The architecture course was conflicting with the analog IC, so I couldn't take it but I am taking online Architecture courses online instead. But their requirements still seems too over the top, I can only have so much experience, and the semiconductor business doesn't allow for startup or small scale companies that much, so I don't know where should I initally work to gain experience until I can apply for the big ones. What advice would you give me? What should I do untill I graduate and after I graduate? Thanks in advance."

Meanwhile for those with declining/unstable mental state just finds it destructive. *I* find it unemphatic, because I believe that we can't control what triggers the depression, the burn out, it just happens.

I just thought it was worth the shot to see how far it can take me. Of course, like everyone else, I did agree to participate in the competition because we were all so ambitious and had the same vision; to win, or not, who cares, but the product and satisfaction in doing it does. It isn't like that anymore because nobody knows what's gonna happen in the future, and apparently some shitty things happened.

We had asked our professor to aid as our supervisor since it's part of the requirement. It all started with the 3 of us, 2 girls and 1 guy. Then this other girl ghosted us after just 3 meeting discussions, without notice and we had to wait for a whole month to finally conclude that she isn't coming back, so we had to recruit another guy to replace her. Another month passed by, and I can admit that we're progressing and developing more concrete ideas. And as said, I can't control what's gonna happen and to not experience things that triggers my depression, I was already burning out 2 years ago and was just dragging myself everywhere, trying new things that does work out and doesn't work out when I think that I can't risk my mental health. I was already unstable then, and I'm way slummed now. 

The other guy who stayed with me when the other girl ghosted is also experiencing some lack of motivation, and all 3 of us discussed whether or not we should continue, because to be honest, my mental health aside, I've got so many on my hands right now (family and financial issues, internship, university, scholarship, grades, etc.) I can't give my best effort.

Our professor kinda lectured us on our idea of bailing, and said ""basically, the principal is to finish what you started"" like any other stable adults. Now we're in a dilemma.

Should we continue? Or not? Should I just toss my care for my mental health away in order for me to achieve things in life?"

The idea is that I work part time as an entry level dev with the potential to go fulltime if there is some mutual benefit. Generally small/medium companies and I'm aiming for backend dev.

I passed the initial phone screen interview for one company into an upcoming proper interview and I want to prepare my pay expectation in case they ask.

What's a reasonable rate? I could imagine it being anywhere between $25/h to $40/h (somewhere between the internship pay to average entry level job pay). It has a technical team of about 6 people (most have been working for over 5-10 years) and it emphasises secure coding practice from what I can tell.

Even if I don't get this particular job; I still want to gain an expectation for what to ask for that ""type"" of company."

-Spent 8 months doing research for my academic thesis on a trending subject in the area of probability.

-One internship in a foreign country as quantitative analyst for 2 months 

- GRE : 161Q 152V W?? ,IELTS : 7

- One strong recommendation letter

I just landed my first security position with an emphasis on email and network security. I still do not believe it. All health care is paid for, substantial training budget, fully remote, generous PTO, coworkers sound great, boss is strict on work life balance, plenty of opportunity for advancement. During my time as a system Administrator I took over most security elements such as Firewall management, Endpoint Protection, Web security, email security and mail flow.

* Start a homelab  

 * AD, O365 for email, File Server, backups, segmented networks for breaking stuff (got to keep SO happy.), automation with Ansible/PowerShell/Python and whatever tickles your fancy.  

* Learn Linux  

 * It's my daily driver and most of my homelab contains Red Hat or Debian servers.  

* Learn to program  

 * I started with PowerShell, then learned some c# and now doing Python.  

 * Everything seems to be moving to API's.  

* Develop soft skills further.  

 * Took additional electives in this area.

saznjd,11,2022-01-23,What should I look for in my first job after graduation?,dnp407,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/saznjd/what_should_i_look_for_in_my_first_job_after/,"Hey everyone, I am a 4th year BCS student and I plan to graduate by the end of upcoming summer. 

After finishing my 3rd year at uni, I did a PEP ( Professional Experience Program), which is like a co-op but in a single stretch. I worked for 16 months as a researcher and software developer before starting my 4th year. 

I am now confused as to what should I be looking for as a full time job after my graduation.

I know it is ‘ideal’ to run after money or jobs  at big N and it sounds like a dream to be able to get a job like that. But is there something I should be really careful about if I go this way?

My goal is to work for about a year or two and pay off my student debt (It is not too much) and then pursue a thesis/project masters.

Also, I am working part time right now at the company I did my PEP (internship) with and it will also be great to continue full time with them if possible. If I go down this way, I can see my masters project crossing over with this company as there is a lot in common here, the topic, supervisor etc and it all works out perfectly.

But I am also afraid that I will miss out on what else is out there if I continue with the same company.

Overall just confused which path I wanna go with. 

I have 8 months till graduation, when should I start applying to other companies.

Should try and go after the highest paying job I can get? 

Also, please share any advice related to this, could be what you have learned through your experience, any mistakes you made while in a situation like me etc..

Thanks everybody"

All points north lodge is a treatment centre for dual diagnosis, I specfially went for the DBT program and TMS treatment for PTSD. I was diagnosed with PTSD, depression and anxiety when I was 15 due to traumatic childhood abuse. On november 18 2021 I flew into Denver Colorado to be picked up by an AllPoints North Lodge member. I paid $55,000 to stay, eat, learn and have therapy in a safe environment in Edwards Colorado All Points North Lodge.
 
I first arrived at the lodge in the early evening after a 4hr drive and was greeted by associates. Everything was going smoothly and I was put into a individual area for COVID precautions overnight. I had stated that I was pescatarian yet they served me pork for dinner was should have been the first sign to leave. The following day I was transferred to the general population and showed to my room which was beautiful.
I got acquainted with my therapy team which was consisted of psychiatrists, therapist and a APN representative to talk about the schedule.
 
Throughout the 2 weeks I was attending every class and every scheduled meeting with my therapist. There were a few problems regarding phones and food issue as I am a pescatarian and also have dietary health issues - IBS, Colitis and pylori. I have a history of having to be tube fed via a tube being inserted through my stomach and one fed through my nose to give me nutrients in a liquid form so I am very cautious with food. I had very traumatic experiences in hospital from the age of 1-5 due to this and is the root cause of my PTSD.
During the first week of attending APN I did put up a front as a hard Scottish woman who would not let men near her as in other ptsd centre I had been sexually harassed by another patient and I was not wanting it to happen here. One man did tell a associate that I did make a threat of shoving my boot up his ass, this was the first day I was here and in a room filled with NFL players and me being the only female. I did do this and I apologise to the man explaining that I feel very threatened by men, he understood and we are still good friends to this day. During this time I was being flirted with by a few nfl players and I would tell them where to go. I made many friends of different nationalities, age and gender. I was very much a liked person in APN with the staff and other clients.
 
Therapy with Katie had happened twice and it was mainly about the facts of my PTSD depression and anxiety. The nurses, doctors and my parents were very neglectful when I was a child and has created a sense of fear with people of that profession and anything that resembled a hospital. This is exactly the reason I chosen APN. Nothing like a hospital. We spoke of the sexual, mental abuse I endured throughout my years caused by other children in my school. My father was extremely abusive to me and would regularly tell me that the marriage fell apart due to myself, in fact my father was a homosexual and was abusive to my mother. At the age of 14 I started to hate people, especially homosexuals which lead me to a far right group online and then I joined them for 3 weeks in London UK. I was in a group of people who liked me which was the first time ever but as soon as I saw the true extent of their hatred towards coloured people it quickly changed. A switch went off in my head and I left the group as soon as I could and returned home, my parents had barely noticed I had left the home. I am now a proud member of fuck the nazis, BLM and anti-fa, this is my way of giving back to what I had fed in my younger teen years.


From the ages of 11-18 I had self harmed and attempted suicide several times with only one time ending me in hospital for a few hours. I had not self harmed since the age of 18. No thoughts of suicide or self harm.

In the morning process group we would go around the group of woman and state our emotions and goals for today. That morning we had gone over the rules – no sharing outside of the group- no sharing others stories or facts- no judging- respect others.
Katie had a word with me the day before stating that she had heard the comment of me kicking someone in the ass and I immediately said yes and would accept full responsibility, she replied that I would be put on a behavioural contract which I never given.
With this in mind, believing that anything shared within this small group of woman I felt comfortable enough to share my past. We would also get homework from Katie and we would present it during the group and this is where the main issue and subsequently my discharge.


I was given homework that consisted of creating 2 masks. One mask would mirror to what I show to the world and the other of what was truly myself. I made these masks, consisting both of how I am a truthful, Scottish, strong willed woman and how traumatic my past was including the hate group shaped me into the woman I am today. Nearly all the woman in the group cried, said how grateful they are for me being here and how strong I am to share details of my life.Katie was also moved and thanked me for being so open. The process group then ended and we walked to our other therapy groups.
 
Within 2hrs I had 3 people come up to me and ask if I hated black people. I was in complete shock and would reply of course not. I am part of BLM, anti-fa and I am married to a Hispanic man along with me myself being an immigrant. I tied to find Katie to tell her that someone had been sharing distorted things about myself and had put myself in danger but I could not find her. I was in one group with a woman named Isabella, she was a young woman who was in my process group, we bonded over having European mothers as her mother is polish and father is African American.  Isabella stated at the start of the group how the process group in the morning was awful, racist, felt offended and didn’t understand why the therapist didn’t say anything. The teacher at the time Erin stated that if anything was offensive then the therapist would have stepped in. Isabella did not like this reaction. After Isabella I shared how I opened up in process group and spoke of my traumatic experiences, I looked over at Isabella and saw her writing in her journal and showing a man named Devin what was written, he looked directly at me and I heard Isabella saying under her breathe far right. This made me realise that Isabella had been telling others that I was currently in a far right group. Group went on and I was immediately scared and realised I was not safe.
 
At lunch I spoke to a woman named Krista who had also been in the womans group and told her what Isabella was doing. Krista explained to me that my safety is at risk. We walked into the dining area and saw Isabella with a group of black men and woman all talking to her, they immediately turned and looked at me like I was death itself. Among the group there were big NFL players who were atleast 250lbs staring at me with anger. Krista smiled at me and said it’s ok and stayed next to my side, sweat was dripping down my back and I knew if I had said anything wrong I would have been punished with fists.
 
I walked into the group of people and asked what had they heard, all just stared at me with Isabella sniggering in the corner. I stood there with everyone’s eyes on me. I asked again and one woman named April stated “ you hate black people and you are in a far right group.” My eyes filled with tears and I began to shake. I told them the real story, how my homosexual father abused me to the point that I blamed his sexuality for his abusive behaviour and that drove me into a hate group as a young teen and then ultimately left after realising how stupid it was. Everyone’s faces changed, they apologised and inquired more about my past and I truthfully told them everything. At this point Isabella had tried making small remarks in which April stated that Isabella had said these untrue statements. April hugged me and said how thankful she is that I share my story with others. I kept crying and with Krista we explained to Isabella that you can not share out of the group due to trust issues and that this place is a treatment centre not a high school. I shared how these lies have put my safety in jeopardy and that she shouldn’t do it again as it’s against the rules. I began crying harder and Isabella kept saying she never shared anything yet the other people around her said otherwise. Isabella then left and went towards a residential associate and I cried into april arms saying I’m not racist. April hugged me tightly and said it’s ok I did nothing wrong and we all left to go get afternoon medicine.  

We all sat in the waiting room talking of the rules of process group and how I did nothing wrong. 

Leo the head residential associate came towards me and said he needed to come with him and I left the room saying bye to Krista and april. I fully believed that I was about to be told that Isabella would be leaving the facility. He took me to a room where I saw Katie and another woman in the room, I sat down and felt the unease. Katie looked at me and said that I had made a serious threat and will be discharging All Points North Lodge that evening. I fell to my knees and started to hyperventilate, I cried so hard that I could not get my words together. After a few minutes of trying to calm down I stated what had happened and I never made a threat. Katie stated that a residential associate heard me say the threat and I was astonished. I begged them to let me stay as this was my last chance to get help as I did not have anymore money for another treatment centre. Katie stared at me and stated I needed to book a flight tonight unless there are none then I’d be allowed to stay in the individual area until morning where I’d be dropped off in Denver. Katie said I needed to pack my case and was not allowed to say goodbye to anyone. This truly devastate me to my core. I had proven how truthful I was to everyone and yet Katie is forcing me to leave. After crying and shaking for 20min Katie and the nurse walked me to my room and began packing my cases, I could did not stop begging them to let me stay. Nothing would sway them. I began to hyperventilate again and sat on the bed to try and calm myself down. Once the packing had finished we left the room where I saw april and another woman, they ran to me and asked what was wrong. I told them I was leaving since Isabella said I had threatened her, april screamed Emily did not threaten Isabella. Sadly this would do nothing to help. The nurse made me leave the woman’s wing and took me to the individual area. I was in a room by myself while the nurses asked if I wanted anything to eat or drink, I could not reply due to the crying. I got my phone and iPad back to which I immediately began looking at flights as I have no friends in Denver and have no transportation to the airport from Denver. I phoned my husband to let him know what had happened and he explained that Katie said I had been discharged because I threatened someone.
 
That night only 2 nurses came in to check on me, the last one was at 9pm to give me my sleep medication.
 
I was in complete distress. Non stop crying and begging the nurses to let me stay.
My trust had been completely broken and I was completely alone. The therapists had left the lodge for the night and no nurse was near the individual area. In a moment of pure rage at myself for talking about my past I rummaged through my suitcase and found a shaving razor. Shaking, alone and filled with so much frustration I cut into my face and the top of my arms to calm myself down. I did not cut deep or anywhere near a vein. All were superficial. I felt calmness come over me and I walked back to the bed where I had been crying holding my bear for the last 4hrs and fell asleep.
 
I woke up around 7am by a nurse, she saw the cuts and checked on all of them and wiped them clean. Katie soon came over to my room and asked what had happened, I explained I was so angry that I shared and have no control with what happening to me discharging. Katie asked me a few questions containing of how depressed I felt and how angry I had felt. Katie expressed how concerned she was over the cuts and kept asking if I was suicidal, I said no and I began to cry uncontrollably. 
Katie left the room and within 30min came back and told me she would be taking me to a hospital since she believed I was suicidal. I began to shake, tremor and go into shock. I asked if she spoke to my therapist or my husband and she said yes, which was a lie. She read me my rights as I sat there crying. All I wanted to do at this point was go home to Connecticut to be with my husband.
 
An hour later a sheriff, emt and security entered my room, I was terrified. They asked if I could walk with them and I replied yes as I clung to my teddy bear in pure fear. When we got outside I was made to lay on the bed and be strapped in tightly. I could not stop crying. I asked if I could just sit inside of the ambulance but they refused. My cases where placed in the ambulance while I laid there in shock, still crying.
 
I was driven to vail hospital where they made me undress infront of staff, check my entire body and made me sit in a room by myself, at this point a case worker from the hospital called my husband to his surprise as he had no knowledge of my m1 hold on me now. Christopher had calmed me down and said I should be released soon enough because I was not suicidal. In the hospital reports it states that my cuts were superficial and did not need stitches or any other treatment as it was so small. The hospital staff told me that they would be finding a mental health facility as the hospital did not have one. I asked if I could please go home and they said they could not do anything because of the hold. Being in hospital for me is similar to being in a dark room knowing there is someone in there trying to hurt you and you can’t escape. It terrified me.
 
The hospital said they had found a place named Denver springs. This is where the true hell began. I’d be there for remaining 72hr hold and I could leave earlier if the psychiatrist saw that the cuts were superficial and I was not suicidal, this gave me hope as maybe I’d be leaving earlier after this major mistake.
The ambulance took me to Denver springs and soon enough I was forced to sign paperwork and wanted to leave the facility ASAP. At this point I was tired, hungry as I had not eaten all day and just kept my head held high as I knew I should not be here. A female doctor and intern walked me into a room and watched me undress and spoke about my medical issues. I weighed 193lbs and could carry myself well. On the paperwork that I had signed that the discharge date was the following Wednesday, I asked the nurse and she said it’s just a predicted date and when my insurance ends. I began to panic in my head but kept my cool as I believed I’d be out soon.
 
The following day after sleeping on a rock hard mattress, being watched by a nurse who sat outside leaving the door wide open. I was given a bacon sandwich and disgusting oatmeal which a dog would not eat. I ate the piece of bread and drank some water while a woman with mania was screaming at nurses. The nurses would not allow me to call my husband nor would they let me get any other food that I could eat. This seemed to be a common occurrence among patients, having no food or stimulation. We were allowed to be on the phone for 30min per day and the phones were usually sticky and smelly.
I pleaded my case to the therapist who went over my case for an hour, she would simply nod and say she would talk to my therapist in Connecticut and my husband. The 7 nights I was there not once did they contact my therapist. I eventually got to speak to the main doctor Dr John Miller the second day I was there , others had warned me that I would not be leaving soon and I hoped that this was just a rumour. Dr John sat me in his room and read over my file and said if I was suicidal , I said no and have not been suicidal in years. I could see him grinning from under his mask, my woman intuition made me want to get away from him as his energy was just creepy. He asked me to explain my situation from point A to Z. This was at 9.45am. He makes me stop half way and asked if I would stay here until my insurance ended and I said hell no I am not suicidal and the hospital is THE worst place for me, all of my support system in back home in Connecticut. He smiled and said he would talk to my therapist and husband to see when I should leave. He never did. At 10am he had already signed the short term hold stating I was a danger to myself and others. I left the the room without knowing he was signing my short term hold, at this point I had ate some boiled rice, wet vegetables and was given meat multiple times.
Everyday I attended classes and spoke to every patient to pass time. I could feel the hunger getting worse and worse. At most I was able to find 2 pieces of buttered bread and a apple. I would tell every nurse that I am hungry and I need food, all was ignored. My husband even ordered ihop and had it delivered to the facility. Instead the staff ate it and refused to give me anything. I called the patient advocate and that did absolutely nothing. The 4th day i began to slowly lose hope, I had barely eaten and slept. At dinner they actually made a vegetarian pasta dish which I scooped up, within 30min I was vomiting and diarrhoea. I was so sick but I was terrified to tell staff incase they kept me here longer. The other patients heard me vomit as all doors had to remain open, even when changing clothes, males would have rooms next to females and we still had to keep our doors open

The nurses refused to let me see a doctor 

The staff truly did not care 
All they cared about was my insurance money 

Within a few days I was no longer a strong woman 
I was a shell 

It broke me
It broke my soul 


Im a scared woman frightened of the outside world. I don’t speak to anyone and I don’t socialize anymore in fear of being put back in a hell hole with no human rights. I want the therapist to write a legal later stating it was wrongful that a  M1 was on me so I can get it off my records. 

I lost 15lbs in 8 days. My husband had to fly to Denver to collect me because the doctor stated “ you could do anything from here to the airport “ 

I told them I’d hire someone to drive e there and to walk me to the plane but they still refused. They kept reminding me my insurance is good….. both my marriage and individual therapists stated what had happened is unacceptable and i need to be home

denver springs only handed me paperwork as I left the building. I couldn’t lift my 30lb suitcase and I barely was able to walk more than 20 steps without feeling nauseous.

sb1ypy,12,2022-01-23,"I recently started a non coding role, despite being a software graduate. Any advice for what I can do to still have further coding experience in case I move on later?",NandoFlynn,DevelEire,https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/sb1ypy/i_recently_started_a_non_coding_role_despite/,"Wording of the question isn't great but basically I'm after starting a hardware based role in the new year just cause I struggled finding a grad job since I finished in 2020 &amp; with the help of a connection I have I managed to get my current role. And I do really like it. I'm still working with Computers, pay, benefits etc are all class. Almost everything about it is perfect. 

But I'm not coding. 

Granted I knew the first job outta college wouldn't likely be something I'd do my whole career, even if it was a coding role. But I'm also aware that if something were to happen &amp; I was looking again further down the line, I'd have a few years more experience than my software internship. However that internship might be more relevant since it was software based &amp; this ATM is hardware based. 

So just wanna see if yi had any ideas for stuff I could look into as kinda a side hustle. Have plenty of projects for my GitHub from undergrad &amp; others to showcase my skills with UI, API's, Data etc. Just trying to think of something more than that I could throw on a CV that'll stand out like a few years experience in my new place, but with more relevance potentially to a software role. Could also transfer internally, and it seems like that would be a possibility but I'm still fresh here so I'll cross that bridge when I get to it. 

But aside from that, is there anything you'd reckon would be a good shout to do away from work to add some coding experience on top of what I'll get from my current work? I'm not in any panic over it cause TBH for the next while I just wanna take the opportunities I have from work &amp; restrictions opening to just live life properly for the 1st time in 2 years. But I'm also wanna be somewhat copped onto my future career &amp; that too. 

Any help at all would be greatly appreciated, cheers for reading."
sb2fwv,11,2022-01-23,Ex hate group (age 14F at the time) went to luxury treatment center for PTSD. Discharged then had emergency hold placed on myself due to talking about my past as a hateful person ( now proud anti-fa) The psych ward I was held at starved me for 8 days,Late_Fondant_8892,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/sb2fwv/ex_hate_group_age_14f_at_the_time_went_to_luxury/,"All points north lodge is a treatment centre for dual diagnosis, I specfially went for the DBT program and TMS treatment for PTSD. I was diagnosed with PTSD, depression and anxiety when I was 15 due to traumatic childhood abuse. On november 18 2021 I flew into Denver Colorado to be picked up by an AllPoints North Lodge member. I paid $55,000 to stay, eat, learn and have therapy in a safe environment in Edwards Colorado All Points North Lodge.
 
I first arrived at the lodge in the early evening after a 4hr drive and was greeted by associates. Everything was going smoothly and I was put into a individual area for COVID precautions overnight. I had stated that I was pescatarian yet they served me pork for dinner was should have been the first sign to leave. The following day I was transferred to the general population and showed to my room which was beautiful.
I got acquainted with my therapy team which was consisted of psychiatrists, therapist and a APN representative to talk about the schedule.
 
Throughout the 2 weeks I was attending every class and every scheduled meeting with my therapist. There were a few problems regarding phones and food issue as I am a pescatarian and also have dietary health issues - IBS, Colitis and pylori. I have a history of having to be tube fed via a tube being inserted through my stomach and one fed through my nose to give me nutrients in a liquid form so I am very cautious with food. I had very traumatic experiences in hospital from the age of 1-5 due to this and is the root cause of my PTSD.
During the first week of attending APN I did put up a front as a hard Scottish woman who would not let men near her as in other ptsd centre I had been sexually harassed by another patient and I was not wanting it to happen here. One man did tell a associate that I did make a threat of shoving my boot up his ass, this was the first day I was here and in a room filled with NFL players and me being the only female. I did do this and I apologise to the man explaining that I feel very threatened by men, he understood and we are still good friends to this day. During this time I was being flirted with by a few nfl players and I would tell them where to go. I made many friends of different nationalities, age and gender. I was very much a liked person in APN with the staff and other clients.
 
Therapy with Katie had happened twice and it was mainly about the facts of my PTSD depression and anxiety. The nurses, doctors and my parents were very neglectful when I was a child and has created a sense of fear with people of that profession and anything that resembled a hospital. This is exactly the reason I chosen APN. Nothing like a hospital. We spoke of the sexual, mental abuse I endured throughout my years caused by other children in my school. My father was extremely abusive to me and would regularly tell me that the marriage fell apart due to myself, in fact my father was a homosexual and was abusive to my mother. At the age of 14 I started to hate people, especially homosexuals which lead me to a far right group online and then I joined them for 3 weeks in London UK. I was in a group of people who liked me which was the first time ever but as soon as I saw the true extent of their hatred towards coloured people it quickly changed. A switch went off in my head and I left the group as soon as I could and returned home, my parents had barely noticed I had left the home. I am now a proud member of fuck the nazis, BLM and anti-fa, this is my way of giving back to what I had fed in my younger teen years.
From the ages of 11-18 I had self harmed and attempted suicide several times with only one time ending me in hospital for a few hours. I had not self harmed since the age of 18. No thoughts of suicide or self harm.
In the morning process group we would go around the group of woman and state our emotions and goals for today. That morning we had gone over the rules – no sharing outside of the group- no sharing others stories or facts- no judging- respect others.
Katie had a word with me the day before stating that she had heard the comment of me kicking someone in the ass and I immediately said yes and would accept full responsibility, she replied that I would be put on a behavioural contract which I never given.
With this in mind, believing that anything shared within this small group of woman I felt comfortable enough to share my past. We would also get homework from Katie and we would present it during the group and this is where the main issue and subsequently my discharge.
I was given homework that consisted of creating 2 masks. One mask would mirror to what I show to the world and the other of what was truly myself. I made these masks, consisting both of how I am a truthful, Scottish, strong willed woman and how traumatic my past was including the hate group shaped me into the woman I am today. Nearly all the woman in the group cried, said how grateful they are for me being here and how strong I am to share details of my life.Katie was also moved and thanked me for being so open. The process group then ended and we walked to our other therapy groups.
 
Within 2hrs I had 3 people come up to me and ask if I hated black people. I was in complete shock and would reply of course not. I am part of BLM, anti-fa and I am married to a Hispanic man along with me myself being an immigrant. I tied to find Katie to tell her that someone had been sharing distorted things about myself and had put myself in danger but I could not find her. I was in one group with a woman named Isabella, she was a young woman who was in my process group, we bonded over having European mothers as her mother is polish and father is African American.  Isabella stated at the start of the group how the process group in the morning was awful, racist, felt offended and didn’t understand why the therapist didn’t say anything. The teacher at the time Erin stated that if anything was offensive then the therapist would have stepped in. Isabella did not like this reaction. After Isabella I shared how I opened up in process group and spoke of my traumatic experiences, I looked over at Isabella and saw her writing in her journal and showing a man named Devin what was written, he looked directly at me and I heard Isabella saying under her breathe far right. This made me realise that Isabella had been telling others that I was currently in a far right group. Group went on and I was immediately scared and realised I was not safe.
 
At lunch I spoke to a woman named Krista who had also been in the womans group and told her what Isabella was doing. Krista explained to me that my safety is at risk. We walked into the dining area and saw Isabella with a group of black men and woman all talking to her, they immediately turned and looked at me like I was death itself. Among the group there were big NFL players who were atleast 250lbs staring at me with anger. Krista smiled at me and said it’s ok and stayed next to my side, sweat was dripping down my back and I knew if I had said anything wrong I would have been punished with fists.
 
I walked into the group of people and asked what had they heard, all just stared at me with Isabella sniggering in the corner. I stood there with everyone’s eyes on me. I asked again and one woman named April stated “ you hate black people and you are in a far right group.” My eyes filled with tears and I began to shake. I told them the real story, how my homosexual father abused me to the point that I blamed his sexuality for his abusive behaviour and that drove me into a hate group as a young teen and then ultimately left after realising how stupid it was. Everyone’s faces changed, they apologised and inquired more about my past and I truthfully told them everything. At this point Isabella had tried making small remarks in which April stated that Isabella had said these untrue statements. April hugged me and said how thankful she is that I share my story with others. I kept crying and with Krista we explained to Isabella that you can not share out of the group due to trust issues and that this place is a treatment centre not a high school. I shared how these lies have put my safety in jeopardy and that she shouldn’t do it again as it’s against the rules. I began crying harder and Isabella kept saying she never shared anything yet the other people around her said otherwise. Isabella then left and went towards a residential associate and I cried into april arms saying I’m not racist. April hugged me tightly and said it’s ok I did nothing wrong and we all left to go get afternoon medicine.  
We all sat in the waiting room talking of the rules of process group and how I did nothing wrong. Leo the head residential associate came towards me and said he needed to come with him and I left the room saying bye to Krista and april. I fully believed that I was about to be told that Isabella would be leaving the facility. He took me to a room where I saw Katie and another woman in the room, I sat down and felt the unease. Katie looked at me and said that I had made a serious threat and will be discharging All Points North Lodge that evening. I fell to my knees and started to hyperventilate, I cried so hard that I could not get my words together. After a few minutes of trying to calm down I stated what had happened and I never made a threat. Katie stated that a residential associate heard me say the threat and I was astonished. I begged them to let me stay as this was my last chance to get help as I did not have anymore money for another treatment centre. Katie stared at me and stated I needed to book a flight tonight unless there are none then I’d be allowed to stay in the individual area until morning where I’d be dropped off in Denver. Katie said I needed to pack my case and was not allowed to say goodbye to anyone. This truly devastate me to my core. I had proven how truthful I was to everyone and yet Katie is forcing me to leave. After crying and shaking for 20min Katie and the nurse walked me to my room and began packing my cases, I could did not stop begging them to let me stay. Nothing would sway them. I began to hyperventilate again and sat on the bed to try and calm myself down. Once the packing had finished we left the room where I saw april and another woman, they ran to me and asked what was wrong. I told them I was leaving since Isabella said I had threatened her, april screamed Emily did not threaten Isabella. Sadly this would do nothing to help. The nurse made me leave the woman’s wing and took me to the individual area. I was in a room by myself while the nurses asked if I wanted anything to eat or drink, I could not reply due to the crying. I got my phone and iPad back to which I immediately began looking at flights as I have no friends in Denver and have no transportation to the airport from Denver. I phoned my husband to let him know what had happened and he explained that Katie said I had been discharged because I threatened someone.
 
That night only 2 nurses came in to check on me, the last one was at 9pm to give me my sleep medication.
 
I was in complete distress. Non stop crying and begging the nurses to let me stay.
My trust had been completely broken and I was completely alone. The therapists had left the lodge for the night and no nurse was near the individual area. In a moment of pure rage at myself for talking about my past I rummaged through my suitcase and found a razor. Shaking, alone and filled with so much frustration I cut into my face and the top of my arms to calm myself down. I did not cut deep or anywhere near a vein. All were superficial. I felt calmness come over me and I walked back to the bed where I had been crying holding my bear for the last 4hrs and fell asleep.
 
I woke up around 7am by a nurse, she saw the cuts and checked on all of them and wiped them clean. Katie soon came over to my room and asked what had happened, I explained I was so angry that I shared and have no control with what happening to me discharging. Katie asked me a few questions containing of how depressed I felt and how angry I had felt. Katie expressed how concerned she was over the cuts and kept asking if I was suicidal, I said no and I began to cry uncontrollably. At thI point Katie left the room and within 30min came back and told me she would be taking me to a hospital since she believed I was suicidal. I began to shake, tremor and go into shock. I asked if she spoke to my therapist or my husband and she said yes, which was a lie. She read me my rights as I sat there crying. All I wanted to do at this point was go home to Connecticut to be with my husband.
 
An hour later a sheriff, emt and security entered my room, I was terrified. They asked if I could walk with them and I replied yes as I clung to my teddy bear in pure fear. When we got outside I was made to lay on the bed and be strapped in tightly. I could not stop crying. I asked if I could just sit inside of the ambulance but they refused. My cases where placed in the ambulance while I laid there in shock, still crying.
 
I was driven to vail hospital where they made me undress infront of staff, check my entire body and made me sit in a room by myself, at this point a case worker from the hospital called my husband to his surprise as he had no knowledge of my m1 hold on me now. Christopher had calmed me down and said I should be released soon enough because I was not suicidal. In the hospital reports it states that my cuts were superficial and did not need stitches or any other treatment as it was so small. The hospital staff told me that they would be finding a mental health facility as the hospital did not have one. I asked if I could please go home and they said they could not do anything because of the hold. Being in hospital for me is similar to being in a dark room knowing there is someone in there trying to hurt you and you can’t escape. It terrified me.
 
The hospital said they had found a place named Denver springs. This is where the true hell began. I’d be there for remaining 72hr hold and I could leave earlier if the psychiatrist saw that the cuts were superficial and I was not suicidal, this gave me hope as maybe I’d be leaving earlier after this major mistake.

The other patients heard me vomit as all doors had to remain open, even when changing clothes, males would have rooms next to females and we still had to keep our doors open.
 

the nurses refused to treat me and would not allow me to see a doctor , a male nurse said food poisoning is not contagious…

I was kept against my will. I lost 15lbs in 8 days. My husband had to fly to Denver to collect me because both my marriage and individual therapists stated what had happened is unacceptable and i need to be home

denver springs only handed me paperwork as I left the building. I couldn’t lift my 30lb suitcase and I barely was able to walk more than 20 steps without feeling nauseous.

sb397o,20,2022-01-23,My job won't let me quit,beachylawgirl22,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sb397o/my_job_wont_let_me_quit/,"So I (23F) was working at a retail job as a cashier for 1.5 years. Over the summer (as a result of unrelated past conflicts with a couple of head cashier's that I worked with), I decided to transfer stores to be closer to my college for two reasons: 1) hopefully to avoid more conflict with head cashiers and 2) so I could work while I was at school to continue making money. So, after the transfer went through, I went through a whole saga trying to get put on the schedule (which is a story in and of itself). Ultimately, because I couldn't commit to that many hours (due to my internship and my extra curriculars taking up a good amount of my time, aside from classes), they weren't being accommodating to the limited availability I did have. As a result of this plus not being happy in the job anymore, I attempted to resign. I went to the HR Supervisor with my resignation letter in my hand, and I guess he thought I was playing hardball because he told me ""no, you don't have to quit. We can just put you on a student leave of absence, and we'll transfer you back to the store you came from"". I was sick of fighting with them, so I begrudgingly accepted it and continued on with my semester. When fall semester ended, I graduated and I went back home to start looking for jobs in my field. I then decided that since I wanted to prioritize my career that I would attempt to resign again. I went into my store that I had been at, resignation letter in hand, and spoke to the HR Supervisor there. We had a whole conversation in which he congratulated me on graduating, asked me how my semester went, and what my next steps were now that I'm done with school. After this conversation, I told him that I wanted to resign and my rationale. He was very understanding, but he said ""I'm glad you notified me, but I can't do anything for you since you are technically under the purview of the other store, so you'd have to call them and let them know"". So clearly, they never ended up transferring me back. I think my next step is in fact to call so I don't have to drive an hour back to my college town just to quit, but I'm immensely frustrated that it's taking this much of a hassle just to quit. Has anyone else been in this situation?"
sb3tia,1,2022-01-23,17M&gt; How do I deal with the boredom of sitting around for hours at work and having nothing to do?,PolinaPetrovaa,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/sb3tia/17m_how_do_i_deal_with_the_boredom_of_sitting/," 

TLDR: Me 17M is complaining that my work is sooo boring because we sit down for hours on end.

I am a 17M nursing student, intern and I work at a nursing home (home for special needs people). Usually a work day for me is between 7-9 hours.

So this is how a day normally looks like.

My shift starts at 7 in the morning, and we and the employees literally just watch tv and be on our phones till like 10-11. There are some stuff we do with the patients during this time, but it is VERY minor stuff. Stuff like just waking them up as a reminder that they have work/school today. Also we give some of them medicine/insulin shots which is quite easy. (IMO)

So around 12 in midday, we make food for some of them and maybe clean around the floor whatever, and then the rest of the day we literally just sit down, watch tv and sometimes just have conversations with the ""patients"" there.

Aside from special occasions and some minor activities, we sit and do ""nothing"" for like 5-6 hours out of the 8-9 hour work day (on average)

What I'm asking is what can I do to help the INFURIATING boredom of doing nothing?

Also is it ""bad"" that I am complaining planing about doing nothing at work? Do some people envy having a job like this? The thing is I like this job for the most part, but I just can't see myself having this job in the future and it being soooo boring because we do nothing, and in result time moves VERY slowly.

LITTERALY almost half of the work day is us employees just sitting watching tv putting our legs in the sofa/watching our phones Lol.

Appreciate any advice."

I have been able to get a couple interviews with companies like Intuit and Amazon for internships, but not get accepted.

I have an associates from a community college, and am in my second semester at university to get a bachelors in CS. I only have job experience in retail, but I have *tons* of personal projects.

On my resume, I have listed my associates and 3.6 GPA as well as deans list and other awards. I also listed that I am working on my bachelors and my expected graduation date as well as a 3.5 GPA.

I also listed a HS video game design class where we worked in a group to make a video game over the year. Then, I listed a 3D game engine I made freshman year of HS, a project I worked on last year that is running on a cloud server which is actively generating revenue, and a program I made last year that involves embedded systems.

I listed that I am knowledgeable in Java, C/C++, Python, Bash, UNIX, JavaScript

I don’t really bother listing job experience because I don’t think it is particularly relevant.


As for interviewing, I used to focus on solving the problems and not really documenting, but recently I’ve been worrying more about commenting clearly. When I get to one on one interviewing, I have difficulty keeping concentration when I have to explain what I am doing, so I tend to not get the problem solved. I also figure that the one on one interview is supposed to evaluate how well you work in a team, so I try to talk with the interviewer and let them know what I am doing, but ask for their opinion. I also try to comment my code.

I’ve been applying everywhere I can, and I’ve had 4 or 5 interviews, 2 of which went to one on one, but none have gotten me a position. Any advice?"

Tried everything so, fuck it?

When I was 15-18, I was very active, I studied a lot, I did sports. I attended school 8 hours a day, I was doing things to make my college application good, I interviewed and prepared for interviews etc etc etc. I was very busy all the time and was working all day and I loved it, I had a goal and I would do anything to achieve it. I achieved my goal and got into a top 5 University in the world.

When I was 18, I started to have no tolerance to stress or any resilience, I still had goals but I just couldn't apply myself - all I had to do was get out of bed and watch lectures for 4-5 hours a day - that's it.

Initially, I thought I was depressed , talked to family etc and that didn't really do much, hey maybe I didn't like my specialisation , I tried another degree specialisation - same thing happened . 3 Years in, I thought to myself and said hey maybe the academic world isnt for me and so I tried working and got an internship and then again same shit.

At this point I wanted to ""reset"" so I took some time off. I had a lot of time to think about things and how I could change and what I did wrong. I am now 22. I went back to finish University this September and I see myself doing the same thing over and over again and slowly I will be back at square 1 where I was when I as 18. I wake up everyday to a mini heart attack of all the work I need to do that I plan on doing but never actually do after which I spend the day being a loser piece of shit until I can no longer keep my eyes open or cry myself to sleep. I have this new super power where sometimes I am so sad, my body just sort of gives up and I wake up in the morning the next day without actually spending any time forcing myself trying to go to sleep.

I have come to the conclusion that I am just a lazy piece of shit? I have been given so many opportunities and I keep fucking up."
sb5ved,1,2022-01-23,I am incredibly privileged and also got lucky and even then life is still pretty hard.,burner4myburner,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/sb5ved/i_am_incredibly_privileged_and_also_got_lucky_and/,"Long post incoming, but want to give context. I’m a 25m and grew up pretty well off. Not trust fund rich, but rich enough that we took nice family vacations, had a SAHM, and got college paid for and even got my credit card paid of in college by my dad “so I could have a normal college experience and not worry about money”. I know this alone gives me a leg up on like 95% of people. 

On top of that I got extremely lucky in life not related to who my family is. I guess some of it isn’t 100% luck, but as the saying goes success is when skill meets opportunity. If I didn’t get lucky wouldn’t have mattered how skilled I was.
 1.) I got in to a really good college. I was able to network and get internships a lot easier compared to high school classmates that went to lesser ranked schools either because of grades or cost. 
2.) My first internship allowed me to save very significantly. At 20 I worked in a sales/marketing type role where I was evaluated on quantifiable metrics. I worked really hard at this job and was really good at it. Eventually I found a innovative system that allowed me to get the same numbers and work a lot less hard to get them. Long story but I basically invented a method that increased the production per hour 10X. I didn’t tell anyone this and simply stopped working as hard while keeping the same numbers. Because of my numbers, the company said they didn’t want to lose me, and offered to allow me to work from home, allowing me to work as much or as little as I wanted and even get overtime. I reported my own hours and was able to log 50-60 hours most weeks while only actually working 5ish hours a week and no one blinked a eye. I did this for about 2 years and was able to graduate with about 60k in the bank, almost none of if coming from the typical privilege of rich parents. I simply got lucky af and was able to “earn” the money without doing much of anything. 
3.) I’m getting married this spring and my fiancé is honestly amazing. Not only is she the love of my life and i truly love doing life with her, in terms of stress and money it makes life a lot easier. We live together and are duel income, thus being able to split bills and responsibilities. This allows us to live a nicer life than either of would have been able to if we were single, and saves us both time and stress by sharing responsibility like laundry or cooking which I honestly wouldn’t have the energy to do most of the time if I had to do all of it. On top of all that she has her doctorate (not MD fyi) and makes really good money. Most of my friends are single and forced to love with roommates and I have the girl of my dreams and a nice apartment because of it. 
4.) my last semester of college I was about to graduate and my career options were bleak. I maintained good grades and got good internships, but I decided I wanted a career slightly different than what I interned in and I just kept getting turned down. Doesn’t help that I’m naturally nervous in interviews. I thought I was gonna graduate and be forced to work a low level job that would have never justified the cost of my degree. Then out of nowhere, my capstone class happened to be taught by a lecturer that worked in a career and at a firm that was on the top of my career wish list. I’d applied before and at the time hadn't even been selected for a interview. I networked like my life depended on it and was a top student in his class. After talking to him during office hours he ended up referring me and I got the job I never would have got without him. If that luck wasn’t crazy enough, I got the job through a college program that they eliminated a year after I started. They now only hire experienced professionals and even if I was a in the same class a year later their would have been no job for me and the professor wouldn’t have been able to help.

Sorry if bringing this all up upsets you, I’m not trying to brag and am simply trying to say how privileged and also lucky I am before the next part. Even with all of that, life is still pretty hard. I got in to a seemingly elite job because of the connection and still only make 50k. To be fair it’s the type of job that is  invest in yourself stepping stone type of thing and I have a career projection of making a lot lot more money as I gain more experience, but still I got in a job that I was told they hire about 1% of applicants all of which are college grads and I still only make 50k so far. 

My fiancé makes about 120k, but to get her doctorate she took on 250k of debt and we almost entirely live off my salary as most of hers goes to paying off her debt. We want kids one day so it seems likely we’ll always have to cover most of our fixed expenses (not counting the kids in fixed until we have them cause we could always not) with my salary alone cause kids are so damn expensive right now that even when she pays off the debt her income will mostly just go to the cost of kids. Switch out one expense with another. 

So we live off 50kish. 50kish is still a lot more than a lot of people make but with inflation it doesn’t go very far anymore. After we pay our fixed costs of rent, utilities, insurance, car, cell phone, health care, costs for the dog we own, and basic non fancy food there is very very little left over for disposable income type things, and I often have to dip in to those savings I made working my BS college job just to afford the basics. We never buy non essential things for ourself and severely limited fun entertainment things like bars, movies, skiing, sporting events, concerts etc. We don’t even blow our money on avocado toast or anything, If we go our for food it’s rare and it’s usually fast food or at least a place with good happy hours deals on food. I haven’t bought a full price entree at a sit down restaurant in like a year. Have never been on a vacation my family hasn’t paid for. We’re getting married and not doing a banquet hall reception like generations of the past did even though we really wanted one, absolutely no room in the budget for that because we want a house and if we did a wedding we could throw away the house possibility for at least a decade. And speaking of a house, despite all the privilege, luck, and making 170k combined that still feels like it’s gonna be tough. We can maybe afford a 350k house due to my savings if we slow down her loan payments. Again I know this is a much better situation than most, but 350k is basically the cheaper end of housing purchases where I live and even that will be a stretch. We’re not looking for luxury, just a safe neighborhood 2 bed 2 bath and if the housing market goes up much more we’ll be priced out of even that. If all of that wasn’t bad enough, we intentionally moved to a lower cost of living area so we could have a nicer life. I’m from NJ near NYC and she’s from the Chicago suburbs. We would much rather be in a big city like that and be closer to our family but instead we moved to a smaller mid west city with medium COL cause we never could have afforded to live even our simple lifestyle closer to home. 

Overall I’m extremely extremely privileged  and lucky. At my age I’m probably in a better situation than 95% of people and it still feels like shit. It will def get better when my career progresses and we pay of fiancé’s debt, but that’s a lot of waiting and what if’s for people that have done everything right so far. And I wouldn’t have even been here if not for privilege AND luck. All of that and I’m still living paycheck to paycheck in a city I don’t want to be in in a rented apartment and still can’t afford to get a burger at a restaurant except on rare occasion. Our generation is so much more screwed than even the understanding boomers realize.

Edit: these comments are very disheartening. I posted this to provide context to show that even as someone super privileged and lucky that the system still isn’t good for even me. Capitalism now benefits no one except an extremely small 1% minority. In previous generations you could drive a bus and own a home. Now In a dual income household with my fiancé who has a doctorate in a healthcare field and we can’t afford the same things the lower classes of the past could. How is complaining about that not anti-work? I just want a simple middle class lifestyle of generations past with home ownership and small niceties and most of you are acting like I’m the problem and not the actual ruling class that has never wanted for anything. I am a worker, meaning if I don’t work I can’t survive. We should be working to support the rights of all workers ranging from the poor to the middle class. We’re all getting screwed over by capitalism. I’m not on the enemy. Sad that some of you seem to think that."
sb6d4t,1,2022-01-23,PhD Electrical engineering admit chances?,cody_d_baker,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/sb6d4t/phd_electrical_engineering_admit_chances/,"Hello all! I am currently an electrical engineering major at a large state school in the US (domestic if that makes a difference). I wanted to post this just to find out what people think my chances are for a PhD admit in a reasonably good school (i.e. top 25-30 in ECE). I’m targeting a PhD in computational or applied EM (micro or mmWave technologies or antennas, or RFICs) to give a general idea. 

I will be graduating in December from my undergraduate program with honors. I have a year and a half of prior research experience in biochemistry, but that was when I was originally pursuing medical school and doesn’t feel relevant to my current goals (but I guess it’s at least better than no research experience?). I was supposed to work on a research project in applied EM this year, but ended up having to work too many hours at other jobs and on coursework to be able to.  Just for reference my GPA is 3.9+ and GRE 166 / 163 / 5.5 Q/V/A. I will spend this semester and next working for a guy doing auditory signal processing, mostly writing code. I’m hoping to land a relevant internship this summer but they’re hard to find and mostly for MS or PhD students. 

RF/electromagnetics is kind of a niche area within EE, and I’m not really targeting top schools like MIT/Stanford/Berkeley. Probably the highest ranked school I’m interested in is University of Michigan, along with several others such as Ohio state, Oregon state, University of Texas, Arizona state, SDSU, and NC State (along with my alma mater, although it doesn’t have a big EM scene and I don’t really want to stay in the area). 

I think my profile is pretty good but I’m worried an overall lack of research experience will hold me back. What do you guys think? Am I screwed? Or does my profile look pretty competitive? I also think I could stand to raise my GRE Quant score. I could stay at my alma mater for an MS to get more relevant research experience, but would prefer a direct PhD program.  

Thanks to anyone who takes the time to read and respond :)"

I wish I had taken everything seriously earlier and realized the importance of internships. Over the last week, I’ve introduced myself to HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Python (Obviously have a very basic understanding of them). I don’t really have any projects to put on a resume, and I have no clue how to actually even make a project, because from what I’ve seen you need to have knowledge of certain technologies like React or Node, which I don’t know. 

I’m already late on internship application season, but I feel like I can’t submit a resume without any projects. 

Should I continue learning about technologies required for projects and then making one or two for my resume? Or just put a few school assignments I did on it and start applying?"

If you're wondering how much I paid for the applications, I paid a total of $0 because of all the fee waivers I have received.

**Demographics**

* Gender: Male
* Race/Ethnicity: Asian (specifically Chinese)
* Residence: NY
* Income Bracket: less than 30k (as low-income as you can get)
* Type of School: Public School (It's a title-1 school, so the worse of the worse in terms of high schools)
* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): First-Gen, Low-Income, First-Gen Asian American, and my older sister is attending Columbia Grad School, so sort of legacy for Columbia.

**Intended Major(s)**: Computer Science or Mathematics. I applied to schools with joint math and computer science programs; if they didn't have that I just put computer science.

**Academics**

* GPA (UW/W): 96.73 (My school doesn't do weighted GPAs)
* Rank (or percentile): I am ranked 6th out of about 180 students (in my year alone).
* \# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: I took 5 AP courses throughout my four years of high school (they only had six, so I consider it an accomplishment to take 5)
* Senior Year Course Load:  AP Lit., AP Environmental Science, and AP Calc. AB

**Standardized Testing**

*List the highest scores earned and all scores that were reported.*

* SAT I: 1430 (650 RW, 780 M) (Superscore, so my top scores were from two different SAT Tests)
* AP/IB: I got a 3 on AP USH and the only one that I reported.

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

*List all extracurricular involvements, including leadership roles, time commitments, major achievements, etc.*

1. Founder of my school's programming/tech/coding club. (11th - 12th grade)
2. Web Developer at an organization (11th grade)
3. IOS Product Designer at an organization (11th grade)
4. Columbia Immersion Program (10th, 11th, 12th grade)
5. Web Content Editor for a college (11th grade)

10. Mentee at a non-profit (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th)

**Awards/Honors**

*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*

NONE! My school doesn't do anything like that, but the ones that listed were that I was consistently on my school's honor roll and that I was a finalist for a scholarship/college program called Posse.

**Letters of Recommendation**

**AP USH (9th and 11th-grade Teacher): (9/10)** What made this one really good was that I go to a small school, so she knew me for all four years of high school. So, she has watched me grow throughout my four years and helped me along the way in many different ways.

**Geometry Teacher (10th grade): (7/10)** Only had him one year, but I helped tutor some of his students in 9th grade and now 12th, which is fun. I really like the guy, whenever we talk we always have the same mindset: money and math. Which is fun. Honestly, he was the only math teacher I didn't get to know better, but he was the one who made me want to become a mathematician.

**Counselor (9/10):** She was a sub-teacher in my school, during my 9th-grade year, then in 10th and 11th grade she became my guidance counselor and has already written me several letters for various programs and internships. This part of my application may be stronger than most people's guidance recommendation letters because she has physically seen me grow up over the four years of high school.

**Interviews**

**MIT (9/10):** We talked for an hour plus. His kids were distracting him, but it was fine. He told me that he would try his best to get me into the school, so that was nice. Also, after I wrote him a thank you email, he seemed to genuinely like me.

**Princeton (7/10):** The interview went well. We talked about the stock market and various aspects of Princeton that I didn't know about. Also, we kind of bonded over the fact that we both liked puzzles. However, it felt really rushed. He said he had another interview at 4:30, so at exactly 4:29, he said: ""I have to run, so bye now!"".

**Essays:**

**Common App Essay (9/10):** Wrote about how I was considered the stupid brother and bullied in middle school, but a teacher inspired me to do better, so now I am doing better and found my passions in math and science. People have read this essay many times and everyone has commented how they loved my essay and how it has inspired them.

**Supplemental Essays (7.5/10):** On average, all my supplemental essays were really good because all my teachers, friends, and family members proofread them before I sent them, and many of them really liked them. Of course, some were better than others, but in general, they were all at least a 6 or 7. Additionally, both the MIT and UC applications helped me with the supplemental essays because they helped me find and discover certain themes that I wanted to highlight.

**Additional Information:**

I know these are a lot of colleges and way past the sat score that I have presented, however, my GPA is extremely high and I have already been accepted to great safties, so now my family wanted me to go all out and try my hand at some of the ivy league schools. Additionally, the scores that I reported for my SAT and AP tests, were some of the highest in the school's history, so I eventually just decided to send them in. Anyways, you guys can feel free to call me stupid or overachieving, but I think I really don't care anymore."

Am I a failing as a student and a professional engineer? Can anyone relate to this experience or had a hard time finding an internship when they were in college?
Yes, there are other factors in my life; I have an autoimmune disease that keeps me in and out of the hospital, have a job to pay for my education and several others—but that’s also everyone else right?

sb8o6p,2,2022-01-23,Best friend of 8 years chose her boyfriend over me.,sunshineofurlife_,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/sb8o6p/best_friend_of_8_years_chose_her_boyfriend_over_me/,"Hello, im (21f) and just would like to start by this incident happened 5 months ago and im still very sad and hurt this happened, and would like some advice on how to heal from this coz i cant go to therapy yet lmao. 

so heres the background, my friend (21F) and boyfriend (22M) have been together for a year and so and are in LDR. Both have their own mental health issues and had multiple arguments that she would always tell us in our weekly discord chats, but would make up the next day so i thought nothing of it. But, he has a habit of asking me how she is, if shes eating well and all etc.. which isnt a bad thing ofc, but it particularly happens after they fight and i always felt like the middle person of their relationship for a long time. this happened at least once/twice a month and it was taking a toll on me.

there were also times that he told me his personal issues. he was suicidal due to a failing kidney and asked me one night if he should end the relationship because he didnt want to be a burden or hold herself back. i was going through my own stuff too but i was angered. why is he putting the fate of his relationship in my hands? why would he think my best friend is that kind of person to abandon him just because hes sick? i told him as his friend too id disagree with him, but as her best friend, id agree with him because i dont want my best friend to be with someone who is doubtful of her. 

another incident was when he told me she harmed herself. i was scared shitless and didnt know what to do because she never told me she was suicidal or anything. it was her privacy and yet he told me like it was nothing and asked me for solutions. i wanted to help her directly instead of talking to him but i was scared i would ruin their relationship if i did.

that night i finally told our friend group (except her) about what he has been doing behind her back for the past year or so. i cried and cried because it felt like such a heavy burden being unloaded. there were too many instances this happened and  i never told anyone because i didnt want to break their trust in me.

i finally mustered the courage and confronted her. i did this two times. the first is when they broke up. they had been on discord and he was playing a game and starting cursing. she thought he was cursing at her and got triggered and they broke up. my friends were up until the morning comforting her until she could sleep. unfortunately, it didnt take 12 hours and they already got back together. apparently she was ""unsatisfied"" witb how they broke up and asked him for comfort instead of her friends who stayed up until 4am to make sure she was okay.  i was unavailable because i was sick. i gained the courage and told her everything he did to me and to consider breaking up for good or at least take a break. it was unhealthy to see them like this. 

at first, the confrontation was doing okay. i showed her the receipts so she can interpret them for herself. gave her reassurance just in case she ever felt like im hating on her but im not. i just wanted her to be happy and with someone who respected her privacy. she even said ""I cant believe he did this to my (my name)"" while crying. when i was done , me and my other (L) friend comforted her.

but of course, they were still together. she pretended like nothing happened in the next weekly discord. there was a bit of tension because only the 3 people during the confrontation was there but i tried to brush it off. i was taken aback when she said it was my fault for everything her boyfriend did and i shouldve set boundaries with him instead of listening to him. i replied ""how could i say no? you told me yourself that he has mental health problems, has no friends to tell his problems and even family problems. i know how it feels to be alone and i dont want anyone else to feel like i did."" it was brushed off again until the next time.

this time it was more shocking when we were playing a discord game (again the three of us). i brought up the topic again and she denied it. she denied saying it was my fault.

i didnt think much of it until a week later and  L said she gaslighted me and i was too shocked to realize. i then started planning the 2nd confrontation. it was getting too much. i was gentle the first time and it ended up with me being gaslighted so i knew i had to be stern.

the 2nd time, i called out her past actions. how when shes with men she becomes another person. i wont go into detail but this isnt the first but time she acts differently with guys vs with her friends. i gave her the ultimatum. if she still wants to be with him, ill leave because how can i be okay being friends with someone who KNOWS their s/o hurted them?

she then avoided all of us for a month, then suddenly dropped a 30 minute video in the friend group (theres 5 of us). youtuber apology style of course, whispering till i cant hear anything and crying. but basically saying i was at fault, she didnt gaslight me she just 'changed her mind' and we all isolated her and saying she was the real victim in all of this. when in reality, we all have been reaching out for her both individually and in the gc. she also included her counsellor told her her relationship wasnt toxic at all and they didnt to break up 🤨. i digress so i then privately messaged her telling her i loved her but ill be leaving. and i wished the story ended here but alas..

at 4am, her boyfriend harassed me. cursing me out inlc my bf who i always tell my problems to. my bf always listened to me when i was talking about THE bf but he always made me see the bigger picture and always defended him due to his disease. i was beyond hurt and going mad. he even called me out on MY mental health issues and telling me to go see a therapist like the golden couple did. like its so goddamned easily accessible to everyone. unfortunately i was busy with my internship and had to put my mental health issues aside. 

i sent it to my friends and in turn they sent it to the gc which i left. what hurt the most wasnt even her still staying with him even after what i said. it was her defending him harassing me even after sending the screenshots of the shit he said to me. those world haunt me till now.

""i am not responsible for his actions""
""this is his personal issue with her, i have no authority over that and will not be the middle person in that""

the clownery of it all. the funniest part of course was when ended his harassment rage with ""if u wanna talk i have all day"" AND she even sent a text from him in the gc (hence being the middle person) which ofc ended with ""if u have an issue, talk to me (his number here)"" boi really wanted a reaction.

another friend then left after seeing how she responded. she came back a month later to the remaining two friends. but ended spewing the same shit again and they ended up leaving her too. its funny how she went around talking to everyone except me. the one person she actually had a problem with. my last text to her was asking her to stop harassing the friend group anymore.

but it hurts, it hurts worse than a breakup and how easily she left me like that over some mediocre dude. i knew of course one day she would leave me but not because of some boy... so i guess im just asking how do i effectively get over this?

FYI, i only loved her platonically and have also known her irl ever since we were 12 lmao."

I graduated with a average GPA of 2.7, and the internship I was going to part-take in 2020 was cancelled due to COVID-19 so I ended up graduating with no internship experience. I have been looking for a Job in my field since graduation to no luck. I went to 4 interviews after 30+ applications with one of the employers who interviewed me wanting a 2nd Interview that never came to be as I was Ghosted by the employer even after I sent a follow-up email. Starting in November of last year I began the process to get Lean Six Sigma Certified and I am on track to get Green Belt before the end of the month if all goes well. I also began learning to Code in Python on the side recently with the intent on becoming proficient in it. Does anyone have any tips on increasing the chances of getting more interviews or tips on how to improve my chances of landing a Job? Thanks!"

sba7a7,669,2022-01-23,TIFU by taking a dump at my boss' bathroom while staying at his house for a week,dier1003,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/sba7a7/tifu_by_taking_a_dump_at_my_boss_bathroom_while/,"It happened last week, but only today am I finally willing to digest this. Well, here it goes (and it's a long one):


I'm a 4th year medical student with a huge interest in Neurology. I'm part of a great Neurology League at my state (which is somewhat of a ""study/research group"") and through the network I built there I managed to get a really nice internship in this specialty at a big center in another state during vacations.

My family doesn't really have lots of money (and med school drains a lot of it already), so I asked the Program Director (which is basically the boss around there) if it was okay to probably get to the hospital a bit late everyday given how far the cheap home I found to stay at was. He said that it wouldn't be a good idea because punctuality is really important, and if I wanted to match there someday (for residency) I needed to take this opportunity of being there to make a really good impression on everyone. So he kindly offered me to stay at his house, which is walking minutes away from the hospital. After carefully considering it (I'm a 21yo female and he lives alone), I accepted it. 

As soon as I got to his place, we really clicked - he was super nice and respectful. He started showing me around the house and when we got to the bathroom he told me that he was having problems with the water/sewer system there. There were 2 important rules: 1) I couldn't use the shower for longer than 20 minutes and the water couldn't be on ""max potency"" (for lack of a better expression), or else the bathroom would flood; and 2) The toilet's flush would be kinda ""weak"" for a while after someone used the shower.

Well, the thing is I can't take a dump with people around, I just can't, and this was the first time in my life I'd spend this much time (a week) at a stranger's house. On top of that, he wasn't any stranger, nah. That was the freaking Program Director of my dream hospital, the one I want to match into really soon. So I guess there's no need to say that I freaked out internally when he told me about the problems he was facing regarding his bathroom.

Well, as the days passed, I simply could NOT get myself to, you know, ""fulfill nature's call"" there. First, there were those water/sewer problems. Second, that was the only bathroom in the house and it had shared walls with his bedroom and the living room - I didn't know how soundproof they were. I couldn't even do it at the hospital because there was always someone around, and BELIEVE me I tried. 


That was until the golden opportunity finally came up 4 days into the ""experience"". Or so I thought.


I had just come back  from a long ass tiring shift, but the Program Director (let's call him John) wasn't home yet. I rejoiced and rushed to the toilet, taking THE biggest dump (actually, dumpS) of my life. I was so tired and fed up that I didn't even remember that the bathroom had so many problems, I just felt this freeing sensation of finally being able to do it in peace. As soon as I got up and I looked down at my masterpiece, my heart fell to the fucking ground. I was amazed at myself, really, and horrified. 

Looking back, I doubt I'd be able to flush that down in ANY toilet lol, but I wasn't thinking straight anymore so I just pressed the flush button as hard as I could. You can guess what happened: the water level quickly rose up. That's when I decided to stop trying to flush and instead fish those things out of the toilet. As I told you before, I had rushed to the bathroom to take advantage of what seemed to be a great opportunity, so I didn't have many tools available. As I was covering myself up with a towel to quickly leave the bathroom and look for something, I heard John out there coming back from wherever he was. 

Then, the panic really kicked in. Looking around the bathroom, I saw my hoop earrings inside my bag, so I crafted a really poor looking hook out of them. Worst thing is, as I was beginning the deed, John tried to get inside the bathroom and I told him to wait. So there I was for at least 20 minutes, fishing my art out of the Program Director's toilet with a fucking hoop earring and throwing it into his shower cap (yes, I used his shower cap as a deposit bacause the trash can was a bit taller than the toilet). All that while he was waiting outside. 

As soon as I was finished with the deed (I don't need to tell you the details), I threw the shower cap and my hoop earrings into the trash can and tried the flush once more. Upside is, it worked - downside is, John probably thought that I was in there for all that time to take a dump. After that, I showered really quick and as I was leaving the bathroom, I took the trash out because I couldn't risk him finding out what happened. So I met John with a really weird and somewhat impatient look waiting for me outside, which turned into a confusion look when he saw me carrying the trash bag. Thankfully (I guess), he just passed by me without saying a word and went straight to the bathroom.

I'm glad to say we didn't have much contact after that because of our different shifts, except for him telling me what to do and where to go through messages. Nonetheless, he was friendly the night before I left the state, so I really hope it means that there was no harm done. Talk about taking advantage of this internship opportunity to make a good impression......... 







TL;DR: I took some giant dumps at my boss's toilet that had some flushing problems, which led me to fish them out with my hoop earrings while he was waiting outside."
sba9j5,22,2022-01-23,First job offer: great role but lots of red flags,depressivekoala,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/sba9j5/first_job_offer_great_role_but_lots_of_red_flags/,"I'm (22F) going to work part-time on my last year (hopefully) of Computer Engineering. 

A start-up offered me an internship as a Data Scientist. Which is great cause I'm passionate about AI, my thesis uses AI, and I wanna do a PhD in Data Science. 

The thing is my gut is telling me not accept the job... 
I need to know if the things I consider red flags are actually red flags or i'm being paranoid, I don't have any experience in this cause it's my first job. 

🚩1. the interview process took way too long. I applied on Dec 20th, had my first interview on Jan 4th, they ghosted me for two weeks so I asked if there were any news and a couple of days later they scheduled a second interview where they offered me the job. 

🚩2. The second interview was supposed to be a technical interview, but they just made me an offer instead of asking me questions. 

🚩3. They offered me a salary for less than I was expecting, I told them that and they offered me just a bit more (still less than other companies offered me but for a Full-Stack dev position) after telling me ""they don't have much money"". And they did not offer me anything else... 

🚩4. I asked them if they give their employees a notebook with the necessary specs (my notebook can't run neural networks and it's pretty common for companies to give their employees what they need to do the job, especially being a 100%remote job)... they said no but that it can be negotiated after a few months if I renew my contract. 

🚩5. They told me numerous times to prioritize learning over money. Like... dude, i'm still learning in college, I need money. 

I don't know what to do. I really LOVE the role. 

Thanks kind stranger

sba9wh,26,2022-01-23,SOMETHING DISTURBING HAS INFECTED MY TOWN,KMDarcy,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/sba9wh/something_disturbing_has_infected_my_town/,"I grew up in a coastal town in Maine. I don’t want to disclose the exact location beyond that out of fear of what may happen if this falls into the wrong hands.

Something strange has been happening. For me it started on my computer. I was scrolling through the community pages looking for a way to help give back during the summer. Well that and to stay up to date on the gossip of the town. I’d taken a year off to work and give myself a break before going to college, but since the only work I was finding was helping my dad at his garage, it was leaving me with limited options. 

I was in the middle of reading Sandra Anderson’s post about how the Happy Tails Dog Salon had ripped her off and now her precious Chester was starting to go bald, when a moth flew onto my monitor. I tried swatting it away but it just dodged my finger and kept pecking at the glass. I guess it thought if it found the right pixel it could get in and feast off the light. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t find it cute but it wasn’t what I signed up for. I grabbed a piece of paper from my desk so I could lift it off without pinching it’s wings, but by the time I looked back up it was gone. Which was strange because it was nowhere to be seen. 

I got up from my chair to look behind my computer to see if it had crawled back there. A loose moth in my room wouldn’t normally bother me but if I’m being honest, I’d been having a boring couple weeks and I was ready to take any thrill I could get. I didn’t see the moth but I did notice something dripping. A liquid substance that appeared inky and iridescent. It was just a couple droplets but it was coming from the plate where the power cord plugged into my monitor. Grossed out and not knowing enough about computers to identify it, I grabbed some tissues and began cleaning the muck. I was about to google what it was when I got an email. 

The notification popped up, the sender had an official looking name. I wasn’t familiar with but it looked like an acceptance letter. I instinctively opened it. It was for the park surveyor internship! I was thrilled and immediately called the number they provided to set up an interview. Looking back, I wish I hadn’t. 

The interview was for the next day, I would have taken my car but the interview close enough and really nice out. So I opted to waking up early and taking my bike for a ride. As I was making my way down Main Street I saw the used book store had changed their promotion sign to some short story collection from a local author. What stood out about it was the cover of the book which was taking up the majority of the sign. It was a moth on a wooded backdrop. I must have been distracted by it because my bike tire hit a ledge and sent me sailing over the handles. I went tumbling landing with my head up facing the sky. There was an audible gasp from an onlooker and as I turned to see them I nearly shat myself to see a car tire inches from my face. I’d say my life flashed before my eyes but it didn’t, I was just left dumbfounded. After a second or two I realized I wasn’t about to die and that the car was parked. 

As I began to sit up right still trembling from the crash I saw a woman jogging to my aid. Only she didn’t look right, there was a black inky substance dripping from her mouth and eyes. I rubbed my eyes and opened them again to see a perfectly normal looking woman standing over me. 

“Are you alright deer?” She asked me as she helped me up. 

“Thank you, thank you I’m okay, just got distracted while I was riding.” 

“Your arm.” She pointed at my elbow which had started bleeding. I hadn’t even noticed until she pointed it out. 

“Oh it’s nothing, just a scrape. I’ve had worse.” I chuckled brushing off the incident but the woman simply frowned. Reaching into her purse she pulled out a package of hand wipes and bandaid handing them to me. I thanked her and cleaned my cut and placed the bandage on it.

—————

When I got to the campground office I was a little surprised at how much it was well like an office. I was expecting it to be more like a cabin, with hard wood floors and earthy crunchy decor. Instead I was met with a very plain, fluorescent work space. There were plants and maps of the local parks lining the walls so it wasn’t totally bland. The weird bit was the place seemed empty. I don’t think I can be blamed for expecting someone to be sitting behind the reception desk when I came in, but nobody was there. I was about to call out when a woman who couldn’t have been too much older than poked out. She had short amber hair and wore bright blue business attire, but what really stuck out was her necklace. It was a pendant with a moth engraved into it.

“Heyy!!” I swear I could hear the second ‘y’. In that instance I knew the kind of person she was, an animated bubbly ray of sunshine type. 

“Hi! I’m here for the interview!” I tried to match her energy and maybe fell flat on my face. 

“Interview?” Her eyebrows literally furled. Like two hairy caterpillars raising their heads to go “huh?” to each other. 

“Uh ha yeah? Am I early? It was for 11..” I started looking in my pockets for my phone so I could pull up the email. 

“Ohh! Right right! Madeline right?” She snapped back to her bubbly enthusiastic self in an instance. It was so minor but jarred me at the same time. 

“Uh Bridgette actually.” I smiled a little embarrassed not even sure why. 

“Oh my god, I’m dumb. We have a lot of people vying for the position, it’s hard to keep track of everyone. Here, I’ll show you to the conference room.” She began to turn.

“Oh I never got your name?” I motioned as I began to follow behind her. She swung her arms as she walked, it was ridiculous. I basically had to duck as she turned to respond to my comment. Then I flinched when she stuck her arm out for me to shake her hand. 

“Madeline!” She giggled. “Now you won’t forget.” We shook hands and she winked at me. What I can say, my town is full of weirdos. She led me into a room with giant windows over looking picnic tables and a fire pit. There were two scraggly looking men sitting there wearing park ranger uniforms chatting and eating sandwiches. I took a seat down at a large circular table doing my best to not let myself get caught staring at the two men. I started imagining what they were talking about, what their relationship was like. Before I could get to far into the day dream I heard the door open. A gigantic man, like NBA tall walked into the conference room. He wore a white button down with a flannel tie. 

“H-Hello” The man stuttered which caught me off guard at first. “M-my name i-is Michael. I-I’ll be i-interviewing y-you today. W-why do y-you want this j-job?” 

“I love the outdoors!” I quickly responded mimicking the enthusiasm of Madeline. “I’ve spent a lot of my summers exploring the trails around here and think I’d be a great fit.” 

“T-that’s gr-great to hear!” The tall man beamed before looking up concerned. “W-wha-“ there was a slam at the window. It cracked the glass startling us both to jump out of our seats. Looking out I watched as one of the park rangers began brutally attacking the other. He was pushing him against the glass, grappling to maintain his control before he finally got his arm free. 

“Stop!” I shouted from the other side of the window sure the man would hear me, but even if he did he didn’t listen. He began pummeling the other man wit his fists. The tall man interviewing me came over to put his hand on my shoulder and lead me out of the room while he dialed 911 one his cell phone. I normally would have fled without a second thought but something caused me to hesitate. The berserk man had a black liquid streaming out of his eyes. 

—-

My mom came to pick me up soon after. Peter the tall man interviewing me suggested it, saying it was probably safer than biking home. I wanted to ask him if he saw the same thing I did, but I didn’t have the nerve. I figured if he didn’t bring it up there was no point in coming off as crazy. 

I couldn’t sleep that night, I just kept tossing and turning. Eventually I got up to get water but when I did I saw my computer ding with a notification. It was from an unknown sender, probably spam but I had nothing better to do. So I opened it. 

My computer began to shake. I jumped back just as the cooling fan sputtered out the side. It sent sparks and bits of plastic flying. The screen lit up showing a tunnel leading to a small patch of trees. The tunnel descended as the computer rapidly zoomed in, all the while my vision transfixed. 

When I looked away I was no longer in my room, but in the forest that my screen had pulled up. I was plucked, cut and pasted into a place far from my home. Surrounded by moss covered stumps and boulders, thick oaks and the eery sounds of nocturnal animals scurry. I spun around in disbelief to see nothing of familiarity, while I felt my slippers sink into the mud. 

“Oh god, I’m losing it.” I had to get out of woods and figure out what the hell was going on. I took one step and felt something under my foot. It was dark but there was enough moon light for my eyes to adjust and see the body. I dropped to my knees in disbelief.

“M… Madeline.” I reached my hand out to her cheek before pulling it away. The oily black substance was drooling onto her chin. I scanned her body to see she was covered in the stuff. I let out a small gasp, I’d never seen it like this before. Iridescent and writhing. Slowly moving up her body, swallowing her like a snake would a mouse. I was going to run but something inside of me told me not to. That it would only gather the substances attention. I needed to leave, and slowly. 

Still crouching I shuffled my feet backwards keeping my eyes glued on Madeline. My slippers flopped so I gently kicked them off. It was when the substance reached her neck that it changed its behavior. Like oil on a flame it resented and rose like tentacles upwards. It didn’t make a sound but there was something about Madeline’s neck. The substance, whatever it was, was in pain. It began twitching, more strands jutting out like strings caught in an explosion. I was done, time to run. As I stood my knees cracked, and in my fear of being noticed by the disgusting mass of slithering ink, something worse happened. 

“Bridgette?” She whispered from a half conscious state. Far away in a place of dreaming, unsure if she was even sure. Her head turned for the slightest of moments before dropping down to the dirt. Oh lord please help me. I leapt, grabbing the hand I had stepped on only a moment before and tugged with all my might. Maybe, I thought, just maybe I could pull her out of the death grips of that monstrosity. I felt my shoulders give against the resistance, yanking at pure dead weight. 

“COME ON!” I screamed hoping that maybe Madeline would feel me ripping her arm off and wake up. But it was no good, I wasn’t strong enough. The substance began to shift, each dancing strand preoccupied by their meal but slowly realizing I was there. I don’t know how it knew, if it was my movement or smell or body heat. One of the strands landed on my arm as I tugged. It didn’t feel like I was expecting. It wasn’t slippery or sluggish, cold or wet. It was like cloth, almost unnoticeable. I was panicking now screaming louder;

“MADELINE! PLEASE!” Tears began rushing down my eyes as I felt fire run up my arms and through my joints from the struggle. It was helpless, a second and third strand retracted and like those sticky hand toys they flung and grabbed me. I couldn’t keep fighting like this. I let go. “I’m sorry!” 

I turned to run when I felt my face smack into something. It wasn’t hard like a tree though. It was the tall man from the interview.

“Peter?” My head was spinning as I looked up into his foggy glasses. He just stood there like a statue his head fixed upwards staring at the moon. “PETER! Please the muck has Madeline! I couldn’t get her out by myself but.. b-“ 

“Don’t. You. Just. Love. This. Fresh. Air.” I could hear the robotic monotone words but Peter’s mouth wasn’t moving. He just stood there staring into the sky like a puppet left sitting on a stand. I was done, it was all just too weird. I wiped my face and began sprinting, like full blown suicide sprinting away. Screw getting out of the woods and back home, I just needed to get away from whatever the hell that was. 

There was something moving in the distance. Larger than a freight train. I thought it could have been my eyes playing tricks on me, just a hill that the moonlight was retracting on. At least that’s what I wanted to think after everything that had happened. I didn’t know how much more of the insanity I could take. Whatever it was it lurched uprooting full grown trees in its wake. I sprinted away and kept running until day break.

“Where the hell have you been?” My dad was brewing coffee and washing his breakfast plate when I finally got back home. “And where are your shoes!?” 

“I-“ 

“You were out with that Bree girl again weren’t you? Look I know you’re technically an adult now but you can’t be sneaking off like that.” 

“I’m sorry dad.” I was zombified, to exhausted to even try to explain myself or any of what happened. Not that I really could have if I wanted anyways. I started stumbling towards my bedroom when my dad placed his hand on my shoulder.

“Look, I was your age too. I remember how stressful and terrifying it was. I let it get the best of me, and if not for your Mother I would have kept letting it.” His crystal blue eyes sparkled as he looked at me. His voice becoming dreamy as nostalgia took him. 

“You’re more like her than me, but still.” He stepped back clearing his throat while he adjusted his overalls. “As much as you might not want to believe it, we’re all rooting for you. You don’t have to keep secrets or sneak out. Just tell me where you are is all, okay?” 

“I believe you dad. And okay, I won’t let it happen again.” Oh my god I’m dying here just let me sleep. 

“Promise me.” He had this faint worry in his eye. It almost hurt to look at. It was never his anger that scared me, always this. 

“I promise dad.” My legs almost gave out as we hugged. As active as I was normally, bike riding and yoga doesn’t really match spending all night running for your life. I tried to give my dad a wave as he left but my arms were jello. He went for the door and I went to collapse in my mattress. My bedroom door was left open and my alarm was off. Guess if I did sneak out I’d have felt betrayed by my own alarm, but I think reality betraying me was a bigger concern. I looked over to my computer to see it sitting in its place as if nothing had happened to it or by it. Sitting down on my bed I began removing my clothes to get comfortable when I noticed three scars on my forearm. They looked like shooting stars rounded at the edge where the strain had clung to me. I brushed my fingers atop of the skin and didn’t feel any raising or pain. I fell back and closed my eyes. 

In my dreams I saw the moon. And as I kept looking I noticed something about it. It was buzzing and shifting like a picture made of pixels. And as the light grew brighter, it became clearer that it was no moon but a swarm. 

 When I woke up it was already the afternoon. I got up and dressed and took off for my bike. I needed to make some kind of sense of all this and I only had one place to start. I began pedaling down main street, when I noticed a lot of people wearing this goofy Grateful Dead like shirts. They were tie dyed and covered with flowers. It wouldn’t catch my eye normally if not for how many there were. I was half tempted to stop and ask someone if there was a fundraiser I hadn’t heard about but I felt I had more pressing matters. It didn’t take me long to make it to the campgrounds. 

I stood outside of the office door mustering the courage to step inside. But instead of courage all I could feel was anxiety and a deep desire to just turn around and pretend everything was peachy keen. It was then the door opened and I saw Peter step outside. He looked surprised to see me but smiled and gave a wave as he stepped over. 

“B-Bridgette, I w-wasn’t expecting y-you b-back until next w-week.” He reached into his pocket and pulled out a packet of cigarettes before taking one out. I must have left my mouth open because Peter reacted to my expression. 

“Oh, y-yeah th-they’re a f-filthy h-habit. I’ve b-been working on q-quitting them b-but s-sometimes.. ah, d-do y-you mind?” 

“Peter, I, uh no, you can smoke. I don’t care.” He smiled and nodded his head at me before lighting his cigarette. “Peter do… what were you doing last night?” 

He seemed bewildered by my question. It caught him off guard and left a small air of suspicion. I could tell he didn’t take kindly to being interrogated but he relaxed just as quickly as he tensed.

“U-Uh, w-well B-Bridgette I wa-was at home h-having dinner.” He paused for a moment before raising his eyebrow at me. “W-With my wife.” He emphasizes that part, and chuckled slightly. 

“So you..” I then noticed something under his beige collared shirt for the first time. “Sorry, I guess the fight still has me shaken up. I should be going.” I turned and made a somewhat hurried jog to my bicycle. 

“B-Bridgette?” He called over to me seemingly as confused as I was. I could feel his eyes on me as I began pedaling off. Waving back at him to ease the weirdness I watched him slowly raise his head as he began typing on his phone in between puffs. I don’t know if he knew that I saw, or if it even mattered to him, but I do know beyond a shadow of a doubt that that was Madeline’s necklace. 

I was hurrying home to try and figure out what I could do next when I spotted my dad walking down Main Street wearing tie dye flower shirt. He was entering a crowd of similarly dressed hippy types, only my dad hates hippies. I braked by kicking my foot onto the curb and turned pedaling towards the crowd. My dad turned to see me, his expression glazed over as if I’m a daze. I was feet away now about to stop my bike when I felt heavy hands grab me from off my seat. Two large men in tie dye shirts held me in mid air as my bike went skidding out from under me. My dad walked over to me like a robot. 

“We. Are. All. Rooting. For. You. Sweet. Heart.” I didn’t want to believe it was him speaking. It wasn’t! It was some kind of sickness, but before I could say anything my vision went black. Something was placed over my head, a sack or bag I’m not sure. I felt the burly men begin tying me with some kind of nylon rope. The same itchy kind we had laying around the gymnasium in my school. I felt on of them hoist me up with one arm, causing me to let out a gasp as my stomach hit his shoulder. The crowd began marching in silence. There footsteps landing in sink with one another like a military parade. They marched for what felt like hours until finally they stopped all at once. I listened to their feet opening and moving in some kind of splitter single file. The last person to walk was the man holding me, who went in between the river of feet. I was placed down onto some kind of flat wooden structure before having the sack covering my face removed. The first thing I saw was the full moon. It was blinding, large and unreal. It was like seeing it on the horizon, when it appears impossibly big, only it was centered in the night sky. It was watching. 

The crowd of people began to make a chirping sound, starting in a wave telephoning from one person to the next until they were all chirping. I turned my head to see their still lips and gap mouths as the all beamed up at the moon. I began looking for my dad in the crowd but there were so many people. People I knew. School teachers and pharmacy workers, the bankers and even Bree one of my closest friends. It was her that I was transfixed on when I noticed the shadows shifting. Where the moonlight could not reach, the strains of loathsome tendrils began to squirm and writhe. Like the outmost tips of a flame, ever changing and searing. My arm began to sting, the markings from my encounter with the vile substance burning like a fresh tattoo. I would have shrieked or called for help but there was no one, no options, no sanity left in the world for me to turn to.

 Then it emerged. It’s giant fleshy head marked leathered patches oblong it’s ridge. Numerous beady black eyes the size of light posts with syringe like needles protruding from within them. Whiskers like electrical wires jutting out all along it’s body. It had numerous spider like fangs, which two of it’s it’s fungus ridden claws at the end of it’s multiple arms, flicked at. It’s dry crackling pale skin folded and rolled by it’s own body. I was inside of a microscope, I was facing the same horror I had seen my entire life and never blinked at. Fear isn’t a word capable of justifying what I felt. I could feel it crawling all over me. Under my skin and in my hair. The horror twitching it’s antennas above me. I would have give anything to die before having to see it. I looked to the crowd for help, for a single shred of the humanity that had been stripped of them in place for this horrible inescapable presence. There was nothing. They just kept chirping. Ignoring me, ignoring everything in front of them so that they could stand there with their mouths open chirping at the goddamn moon! 

I screamed, and starting shaking. Wiggling my body to get off the podium they had forced me on. I’d crawl, I didn’t care anymore, I was done with all of this. With figuring it out, with trying to make sense of it. I rolled off the table and landed with a thud in the dirt, never once stopping my screaming to breathe. And In the distance something heard my cries. But so did too the horror that blotted out the moon above me. It began to raise its head up words, folding it’s boneless body to do so. I had all but forgotten what fear really was up until that moment, when reality came back to me. When I realized I wasn’t alone anymore. My brain began remembering how to fear when a bulldog came running up to us. It’s broken leash dangling behind it as it barked fearlessly at the horror. I was scraping the ground in search for a rock, broken piece of glass, anything I could cut my rope with. I needed to get free, to convince the dog away from this. He kept on his onslaught of heavy slobbering barks as the thing retracted. 

What was this? I rolled over to see the mound of pale flesh shrinking into itself. It’s arms began fiddling and spinning to weave. All of a sudden like flipping a switch the chirping stopped and the townsfolk dropped their heads to the ground, sleeping in place. The repulsive slug was pulling the black substance from the night itself. 

“Chester!” I called hoping he might be friendly. Whether friendly or not he seemed preoccupied so I began crawling towards him in hopes he might be able to bite me free from the nylon rope. It was a long shot and it didn’t end up coming to that. By the time I looked back again the creature was encased completely in the inky substance, and no sooner was it completed that my eyes adjusted to simply seeing shadow where it once stood. The towns folk turned in a mystified state and dispersed towards their homes. My dad was doing the same until some kind of light must have gone off inside of him. He rubbed his eyes and came half jogging towards me. 

“B-Bridgette? Do you have any idea what time it is?” He said as he reached into his pocket to take out a Leatherman multi tool. His body and mind were split into two different realms as he began cutting me free.

“Dad?” I couldn’t even.

“Come on. It’s okay, I’m glad you called. Let’s get you home.” He helped me to a stand as Chester watched on for a moment. He sniffed and then went running off with his tail waging. My dad placed his hand on my back before I jumped on him, hugging him as tightly as I physically could. 

—-

We’d packed up the car with my things. It was going to be a five hour drive out of state but I was looking forward to it. I had been for months now. My mom cried and my dad tried not to. After that night everything went back to normal, my arm healed and even though I never got the answers I was looking for, it didn’t matter anymore. The only thing that didn’t go back to normal were the memories. Sometimes they’d keep me up at night, and other times they’d plague my dreams. But I try and keep my mind off it, and focus on the bright side.

sbabat,125,2022-01-23,First job offer: great role but lots of red flags,depressivekoala,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/sbabat/first_job_offer_great_role_but_lots_of_red_flags/,"I'm (22F) going to work part-time on my last year (hopefully) of Computer Engineering. 

A start-up offered me an internship as a Data Scientist. Which is great cause I'm passionate about AI, my thesis uses AI, and I wanna do a PhD in Data Science

The thing is my gut is telling me not to accept the job... 
I need to know if the things I consider red flags are actually red flags or i'm being paranoid, I don't have any experience in this cause it's my first job. 

🚩1. the interview process took way too long. I applied on Dec 20th, had my first interview on Jan 4th, they ghosted me for two weeks so I asked if there were any news and a couple of days later they scheduled a second interview where they offered me the job. 
[EDIT] let's just blame the holidays and start-ups lack of organization. 

🚩2. The second interview was supposed to be a technical interview, but they just made me an offer instead of asking me questions. 

🚩3. They offered me a salary for less than I was expecting, I told them that and they offered me just a bit more (still less than other companies offered me but for a Full-Stack dev position) after telling me ""they don't have much money"". And they did not offer me anything else... 

🚩4. I asked them if they give their employees a notebook with the necessary specs (my notebook can't run neural networks and it's pretty common for companies to give their employees what they need to do the job, especially being a 100%remote job)... they said no but that it can be negotiated after a few months if I renew my contract. 

🚩5. They told me numerous times to prioritize learning over money. Like... dude, i'm still learning in college, I need money. 

I don't know what to do. I really LOVE the role. 

Thanks kind stranger

[EDIT] 

•numbered flags so you can reference ! 

•I've got another offer: more money, Full-Stack dev position, not a big company but it doesn't seem like a high risk, BUT not DS related

•CTO interviewed me always, giving me douchebag vibes, he'll be on my team.

•Need money to pay for my education this year.

•College already stresses me out way too much, don't want to add more stress and I really need to focus cause I need to graduate this year

sbcdko,0,2022-01-23,Best way to get back into software engineering 20 years after earning a computer engineering degree?,hound979,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/sbcdko/best_way_to_get_back_into_software_engineering_20/,"Hey all, I have kind of a unique situation that I would love your input on. It's been 20 years since I graduated in 2002 with a computer engineering degree from a reputable engineering university (think a school like UIUC). Then I pursued a non-tech career as a lawyer for the last 20 years or so.

&amp;#x200B;

During the pandemic I really had a re-think about what I wanted to do with my career and I would really like to get back into software engineering. I make really good money now so I wouldn't be switching careers just for the money. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, I was wondering what would be the best way to refresh and update my knowledge and skills in software engineering and to prepare myself for the software engineering job market. While I was in college, I programmed in C, C++, and Java in internships. While I have forgotten quite a bit of language syntax, I think I've retained most of the basic programming principles, so I don't think I will have to start from scratch. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to get your opinions on the best path forward to update my software engineering skills and to make myself marketable for a new hire software engineer position. I am not 100% certain of the specific areas of SWE that I would like to work in, but I think being a backend engineer sounds very interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

1) I guess one option is to take a bootcamp. I think that a decent bootcamp would probably teach me the latest SW stacks and have a defined process for teaching me what I would need to know to market myself as a SWE, but this is a pricy option and there seems to be so many bootcamps out there with poor track records.

&amp;#x200B;

2) The other option would just be self-directed study. Brush up on C++, Java, learn JavaScript and modern frameworks like Node.js, and work a lot on data structures and algorithms. The problem with this approach is I wouldn't know how to make myself marketable as a SWE, as I fear recruiters will just see somebody with a 20-year-old tech degree and no recent experience.

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to hear your thoughts. Has anyone gone through a similar journey as this?"

So far I only know python well as a language, and a little bit of Golang as I did that for an internship as well. I also had an internship right when I was new to programming that was a java job at a company that built an event streaming platform and did a lot of distributed systems work. Because I was new to programming and had no java experience b4 starting that job and that job was exclusively java, I was not able to be productive during my internship at all, a lot of java concepts were very foreign and hard to understand for me at the time; and I didn’t really get any intro tasks or time to learn java but instead got tasks to work on a large and complicated code base in java and needless to say, I was pretty lost.

I had a hard time understanding some of the code even and could not be productive at all due to my lack of experience. That internship left a bad impression of java and OOP languages in general for me, so I decided to learn a language properly and chose python. I got some internships where I had to work in python and was able to be productive and one where I had to work in Golang and was able to do fine as well, both languages that didn’t require strong OOP concepts to succeed in.

Because of this I am fine with working in python / Golang since I have experience with those 2 and being productive in them but I realized java / OOP heavy languages are used at so many places, I will have to eventually work in it, however due to the bad experience I had with it, I have developed a fear of java and I extrapolated to strong OOP languages.

I got job offers at google and Facebook, and now I am kind of worried that if I get on a team that uses something like cpp or java I won’t be able to perform at all. I know Facebook has python teams and I could just join those but I feel like that’s not the best route to go because I would be pigeonholing myself to only knowing a small subset of skills and I would go longer without developing the skills that I have a fear of and my fear of them would increase as well. And chances are if I have to work in java for example at another company I would be an engineer with more YOE so there would be more expectations for me to perform in it as well, especially since java is a language a lot of people start off with and are really proficient in, they would expect someone with more YOE to be performing really well in it where as I feel I might not be able to.

I am a bit confused and wanted some input on

&amp;#x200B;

1. Does my fear seem irrational, meaning java and similar languages aren’t hard to work in in big companies (fb/google) and I just had a bad experience, and I should try to learn those skills and take a team that uses java for example?
2. Should I just stick to finding a team that just uses python for example and just grind there and try to get promoted there and keep working there? The issue here is that I feel like I would have to encounter the languages that I have a fear of eventually, so even though I want to do this I am worried I will be pigeonholing myself and screwing myself in the future?

For some context: I am in college doing my last semester, and I do enjoy coding but I would love to take the managerial route eventually as well because I like dealing with people as well"

I'm a junior in college and just switched into cs last spring. I'm working on getting an internship but if not I'm considering doing a large complex project doing summer research with my computer vision Professor. I already have a few machine learning projects as well as a decently complex ecommerce project in django so I figured this summer I should do something super complex. I'm planning on adding twitter clone in django and a few ios apps through codepath.

  The plan for the potential summer research is to implement an object detection algorithm within a web application using a lightweight framework like flask. Does this sound like a decent enough project to try to make up for not having a proper internship?

I am the one who runs the shift when the supervisor takes off work. I love this company and it frustrates me to no end when people don’t do their job. In the past when running the shift my supervisor told me that I should let him write people up for doing thing they aren’t supposed too, because people on the shift got upset over it. (Even though my production manager his boss thought I did a good job) So I backed way off out of respect and I’ve let the things they do slide over and over. This has led to a lack of respect from shift operators towards my supervisor, which intern transfers over to me when he takes off.

I have talked to my production manager somewhat about some things not everything because I don’t want my supervisor to get mad at me.  But he has pretty much said to keep holding people accountable.

Fast forward to tonight I’m the one running the shift. One coworker has hardly done anything all night. Two tanks were ready to start at the beginning of shift and now we are 7 hrs in with 5 remaining and they have still not been started. He only has technically one other tank he can run right now and it’s been sampling or cooling all night.

I told my wife how I am feeling and how I wanted to send him home. she said to let it go it’s not worth the drama. To tell him he needs to work on the tanks, and if it lacks then it’s on him and the production manager will see. I’m literally so frustrated I don’t know what to do! Please advise."

sbkbd6,3,2022-01-24,[Uni] How to choose University/Major as poly Y3 EE student,himyusernameisthis,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/sbkbd6/uni_how_to_choose_universitymajor_as_poly_y3_ee/," Hi,

I'm currently a year 3 polytechnic EE student, as I'm graduating soon I have a couple of questions which I could use some advice/opinions on

My first concern is my choice of major, I'm currently an EE student so it seems natural to continue down this path. For context, I really enjoyed some of the contents, for the theoretical side, digital logic, for the practical stuff, designing PCBs/ 3D printing/ Arduino projects. I'm a pretty hands-on guy so EE suits me quite well, some of the more advanced stuff such as RF is black magic and blows my mind (Still pretty damned fun/interesting)

I did some Python during my polytechnic internship and also really enjoyed it, I've recently been looking at NUS' CS1010E lab tests/ assignments for further Python practice. I know that CS is super hot now and my GPA is quite borderline but I also wouldn't mind doing CS, my concern would be that what I'm currently doing is more of bootcamp/ SWE stuff instead of hardcore maths in ""computer science"", I've been using python to automate stuff, the standard matplotlib, opencv stuff and use it with raspberry pi projects. I've also been doing some Android App development (albeit with Kotlin) to do some IoT projects with the Rpi

I could really use some advice on EE vs CS, ideally I would be able to do both but I don't think that's possible with DDPs or EE with a CS minor ( NUS doesn't allow EE to take CS minors for some reason)

There's also CE which seems pretty interesting, seems to be a mix of both, with primary focus on hardware?

Considering job prospects, I think my goal from the ""university experience"" would be just become the ""best engineer/d00d"" technically to be good at my jawb in the future.

Would it be worth just applying for CS/CE/EE at NUS/NTU and applying for SUTD and deciding later? I'll still have to make a choice depending on what I get but I'll just sort of start thinking now lol?

I also have the question of how do I choose my university (Hopefully it's not the other way around haha):

Default Choice -&gt; NUS EE/ CS

Highest IGP/ GES statistics, another question would be what does IGP dictate? Does IGP just indicate how ""hyped up"" the course is like CS right now? Does GES indicate more the state of the industry (\*cough cough\* tech) or does it correlate with the course quality compared to say SUTD/ SMU/ NTU? I go to SP so the travel wouldn't be too bad, but 1-1.5hr still isn't fun.

SUTD -&gt; 4 year

Coming from poly, SUTD seems quite attractive due to their emphasis on design and projects? I think there's the additional 1 year for me to gain some exposure, my concerns would be the smaller faculty/ ""prestige"" which I don't really care about but employers will (feelsbadman, doesnt seem like ""best job"" gets the ""best person""). Plus point is that it's the closest university to me.

NTU -&gt; NTU EE/ CS

I live in the East so this will be quite the journey, my current polytechnic journey is already quite a stretch, I'm not sure how sustainable this will be in the long run, I might need to stay at the hostel which is $ and not guaranteed for the 4 years which will be a problem

Other options: Overseas?

As a poly student, it seems quite hard to apply overseas compared to A level students. I'm a dude so I'll have some time to study for the tests such as SAT/ apply during NS? I'm a peasant/pleb in terms of SES so I'll need a scholarship which probably will be bonded to look overseas.

I think that some other concerns of mine would be how to evaluate teaching quality to see how much ""value addition"" there is to me in terms of knowledge or facilities/resources compared to me just using my google-fu and taking online courses. It seems quite hard to peer past the PR/ Marketing shenanigans that all the Universities do, maybe I should just join some university telegram/ discords and chat to people?

I would really appreciate any opinions or advice to help this lost soul out, thanks!"
sbl2vs,18,2022-01-24,"After my mother’s passing, I have no motivation and fantasize about quitting. What’s the right move here?",DokiAngel,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/sbl2vs/after_my_mothers_passing_i_have_no_motivation_and/,"Apologies for the length. I just have a lot on my mind. 

For context, I am a young teacher who has been teaching at a Title I school this past semester. It is January, and while I feel I can somewhat survive the rest of the year, everyday it gets harder. I cry in the car a lot of mornings. 

The kids here call me horrible names, blatantly disrespect me beyond belief, and it seems no matter how firm I am, nothing matters because the consequences of the school aren’t taken seriously by the kids, and any suspensions given, the kids treat it like vacation. There’s literally no incentive for them to behave. No consequence I feel I give will ever incentivize them, whether it be through positive reinforcement, or strict protocol. Also the commute for me is an hour. That alone has just made everything a little more difficult. 

I have doubted my teaching this whole year. I want so badly to be there for these kids. But I feel I CAN’T. I feel like my hands are tied many days. I feel scared I’m ruining these kids education, despite all the obstacles I know are put in place and the very unique circumstances our state of education is in. I came out of an internship that had me in such a horrible mental state that I was originally going to take a year gap before applying to teach. But I decided to go right into it anyways, and now I see the results of that. On one hand I’m glad I’m getting the experience. On the other…it’s cost me a lot mentally. And physically. 

Alongside all of this, there was the looming fact that my mother was in a bad state with her cancer. And this past December, she passed. 

While I took a week off, plus winter break, my mother passing made me take a real hard look at where I was in life, and where my priorities lie. 

I came out of an internship that left me questioning my abilities. I’m teaching at a school where I feel I am left to fend for myself, where kids are brutal, misbehave beyond comprehension, where everyday I struggle to survive. And all the while, having to cope with the fact that my mother had fatal cancer, and now she has passed and I miss her more than I can imagine. 

I feel despite the long break I gave myself, I haven’t had time to process, to truly grieve. I feel overworked, under-appreciated, and fatigued. I fear everyday going to school. 

And I’m already mentally checking out some days and just searching for jobs outside of teaching. I fantasize about working a very simple retail/food service job temporarily, where I have no ‘work homework’ and can just…feel free. To think. With no expectations set on me other than to show up and take orders. 

I really want to love teaching. I so badly want to love this profession. But I want to quit.

And I CAN quit now. Honestly….I really just want to be with and focus on loved ones right now. 

But is that the right move? If I quit now only in January, will it be harder to get a teaching job later on? 

I think I can survive the rest of the school year. But will I actually be okay in the end? Is teaching right for me?

So much to think about. But, thank you for listening. It means a lot. I haven’t yet had a positive experience teaching with both the internship and first-year job combined. So I really want to believe one day, I’ll enjoy it. 


TL;DR: given everything going on, would it be a bad idea to quit now temporarily?"

What do I do?,throwawayplatonic,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/sblxxg/i_feel_out_of_my_depth_what_do_i_do/,"I’ve been working in the industry for 2 years in total—one year in an internship and one year in a graduate role, both at the same company. In these two years I was a fullstack dev, but I mostly worked on the frontend and sometimes worked on the backend as well. 

I moved to a new company this month and was told it was going to be a backend role, which I was fine with since I was still considered junior and people on my team were there to help me. I introduced myself as having a fullstack background, and I don’t know whether they misheard me or just assumed I was going to be a fullstack dev again, but now I’ve been given that role on my team. 

This would be fine too if there were other people that worked on the frontend, but there isn’t. Their code is very difficult to understand and I don’t even know who to ask to begin to understand it, as how they organise the files is completely different to how it was organised in my last job. It’s also using Typescript instead of React, but that’s not a huge issue. None of the people on my team do frontend and as far as I know they’ve always been backend developers. The documentation for frontend stuff (eg components) is not great and the stuff currently in the code doesn’t even reflect what’s in the documentation. 

It’s really not helping me settle in. I’m in a new company in a new country on my own, and because of COVID I haven’t even met these people in person. I want to make a good first impression since it’s my first ticket here, but _man_ am I out of my depth. I’ve asked for help and the guy who’s been designated my mentor is nice, but he doesn’t know much about frontend stuff at all. What can I do?"

There’s a common conception going around that you don’t need a degree to get a developer job. While that maybe be true, getting a degree is the opposite of a waste of time. 
I got a Information Systems degree and got two offers from the first two jobs I interviewed with; only one of them being through an application (the other was through a recruiter).
So many people say “I can’t get a degree” and I assume they mean money. I paid my own way through school while working full time and getting loans. It’s completely do-able. 
Just curious why so many people are going the self taught route. Seems unnecessarily difficult. College gives you internships to apply for, networking, etc. honestly, more important things than 1 extra project on your resume. Just a thought."

At this point in my story I'm 23 years old and $40,000 in debt. I'd decided to just say fuck it, $900 rent is too much for me to afford, so $40,000 might as well be a made up number only those I'd like to eat can achieve. All 'cause I had a baby. My ex decides to go to college, I was jealous, and livid that he had the money and time to go to college. I had a degree in theatre arts (a love, but not a career, and I'm sad I feel like I wasted my youth getting a degree in something I love instead of getting a degree in something that pays the bills). So in my rage, and with all my new found hate for capitalism, I asked myself what I even wanted to do. I'd spent the last two years focusing on not letting my kid die due to medical bills that I hadn't even thought slightly about the fact that I too had a future to look forward too, or bare minimum think about. Politics, I wanted to get into politics, and I wanted to work for the ACLU. I was convicted and motivated and now all I needed was to go to the community college and get every form of financial assistance I could. Anything they'd give, I'd take. And to my surprise and one of my few lucky moments in life, there were tons of opportunities for single moms with little, to no income. We ended up even getting our own apartment (shitty one bedroom apartment that I loved more than most things in life). I worked my ass off, I was a 4.0 student, who got awards for English classes and even made a debate team for the school. Life was good. And I met my current and forever partner during my second semester at the community college. We fell in love fast and hard, and he was a single dad, who'd been fucked by capitalism too. Our values and motivations all aligned and I feel so grateful to have him and our (his) son as part of my family. At the end of my second semester I applied to law school. I was accepted with a full ride scholarship, and I was so proud of myself, and what this was going to mean for our family. My kiddos were gonna' have a lawyer for a mom and a lawyer who actually worked for what she believed in. My partner, our kiddos and I all moved down to the big city. My partner was born with hereditary pancreatitis, he used to go to the hospital about once a year but as he gets older it's closer to 3-4 times per year. At this point in our relationship he was $87,000 in debt. We applied to literally 14 apartments before one was finally willing to accept our bad credit family inside of it's walls. My first semester at law school was a blur, riddled with high rent, no time, and two kids on top of it all. My partner and I both worked hard while I went to school but he'd lose his job any time his pancreas flared and he medically necessitated more than three days off work (yay Arizona). I somehow managed to muster another semester of a 4.0 and I was offered an internship at a firm that worked with the ACLU of Arizona. I was elated but also worn completely thin, I couldn't imagine adding anything else to my life. I was already taking care of two kids, working 40 hours, taking care of my partner when he was sick, and somehow being a kick ass law student. Two months deep into semester two and my apartment wants to jack our rent up over $300 and we just couldn't do it. I couldn't do it. I couldn't imagine finding the way to pay for it, or applying for 20 fucking apartments again. So I didn't. I didn't imagine it. I let it go. I let go of everything, of my whole entire dreams, and goals and plans because of 300 fucking dollars. I sold everything. My car, my partners car, our dishes, our kids toys, and I bought an ambulance. I spent the money from all our shit I made beds and a make shift kitchen. And we fucking left. We went to the fucking beach. We illegally camped in the most gorgeous places I've ever seen in my life. And we were happy, so, so violently happy in the begining. But that choice turned out to be the worst choice I've ever made for our family in this capitalist country.

Part three in the next few days."
sbql9g,1,2022-01-24,Confronting Parents about Going Back to School,Ejferrer117,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/sbql9g/confronting_parents_about_going_back_to_school/,"Hello! This is my first time writing a post on Reddit and am in need of some advice. I figured this is best place to do it and I apologize in advanced for not meeting any regulations. 

I am 21M years old. I live in Ontario, Canada and live with my parents. This whole pandemic has got me thinking about going back to school but I don't know how to tell my parents about it.

Let me start from the beginning. Early on in 2020 I was doing an internship for my Culinary program at Humber College and then the pandemic hit. It did a number on the hospitality industry as you may know that customers are a huge part into contributing income to many establishments. Luckily for me, I finished all my classes before I started my internship. I needed 40 hours to complete it and get my degree which I did. My employer hired me afterwards, seeing how I was a valuable asset and has been very accomodating. He was relieved to have me in the beginning of the pandemic as he had to lay off a majority of his paid staff and I am doing an unpaid internship. We were only open for takeout and from what he told me he wasnt making much of a profit. It turned out great for me because I had time to learn the ropes in his restaurant. 

Admist of the pandemic, there has been a lot of divide between vaccine supporters and nonsupporters some of which were my parents (antivax). I'll admit I was skeptical of it too and they kind of influenced my perspective on it. I did a lot of research about the vaccine and made up my mind about it. I decided to take it around October amd November 2021 (2 doses). During the year I had been thinking about getting the vaccine as most workplaces and schools require them. What made me change my mind was to protect people from the virus as it had affected many and the fact that the culinary industry was heavily reliant on having customers. Days like lockdowns reduced hours and really tasks for me to do in the restaurant. I cant prepare too much food as there isnt enough foresight as to how many customers we'll receive. I came to the conclusion that I wanted to change my career path but at the same time I didnt know what I would do. I see all of my coworkers are in school and thought i should do the same.

Its now 2022 and my parents are still antivax. Well its mostly my dad who is and kind of tries to force his POV on his family. Whenever he drives me home from work he would always lecture me about conspiracy theories on the vax and how most of the ads on the radio about corona are all just propaganda. What I didnt likr the most from my dad was his stubborness, willing to be right all the time and the fact that he needs to make sure everybody in his life to be in the same page as him. Hed gotten into a lot of arguments with loved ones and people back home in the Philippines. All of this is a factor to how Im afraid of telling him that I am vaccinated.

I recently got accepted at Seneca for Acc and Finance and I know that they require students to be fully vaccinated on the premises. 

Now I am in over my head about how to go about talking to them. Ive been thinking about moving out too since my parents and I dont see eye to eye with religious beliefs and ideologies. I am very tired of humoring them and making them think i am on the same boat as they are. I am truly exhausted of living this double life. Growing up I realize that theyre very conservative. Not to mention I am bisexual and my parents are homophibic which is a topic for a different subreddit but it contributes to the fear and anxiety that Ive had all my life. I feel like my support system has diminished and only rely my sister but even then I dont think she truly understands what im going through. She moved out for the same reasons and didnt left on good terms with my parents. I dont want to do that to them either because I genuinely love my parents but am afraid that my love for them mightve diminished admist all of this. Also, i have a 8 year old sister whom I love so much that I cant bare thinking bout leaving her with them.

Side note: I have a g1 and my dad wont let me practice driving to and from work because hes afraid that he'll lose his insurance if we ever get into an accident. I highly doubt it because Ive been taking lessons. My g2 test is this March.

I would greatly appreciate your advice. As you can probably tell (probably from all of the run-on sentences here) that I am all over the place, which may tell you that I am desperate for some hard truths. Dont hesitate on asking me any further questions or tell me things that Im not seeing for what they are. I know at some level that I may be at fault here which is why i turn to you reddit. your my only support system left here."

I was born and raised in  Puerto Rico so I speak Spanish and English natively. Because I’m from PR, I would also only need to spend 2 years working and living in Spain in order to qualify for citizenship (plus about an additional year for the actual application and issuing process). 

The reason I want to move there is almost purely for the EU citizenship. Eventually I want to freelance or work remotely and be able to move around to other countries in the EU.

I have about 3 years of internship experience in DevOps but since I haven’t graduated yet I haven’t had a full-time position anywhere. I’m not very interested in moving there to study since that would add additional years to the process and I wouldn’t be earning any income. 

Now, I know the economy in Spain is screwed up and I know I would make more money staying in the US. This doesn’t concern me right now because I don’t have huge responsibilities (like a family, home, etc) and I would like to have the citizenship before those things. Basically, I will worry about money later (as long as I still make enough to live on) and at this point any work experience in the field will be good for me. 
I have been applying to jobs on LinkedIn but I’m not sure that’s the best way to go about it because I don’t think most companies want to deal with the visa sponsorship. Any suggestions on what I can do to try to find a job over there?

I am a mechanical engineering graduate looking to shift to Computer Science. Although I did mechanical during my undergrad, most of my projects and internships are computational and I also have \`1 year of professional experience in Data Science. I couldn't take any CS course other than a basic ""Programming and Data Structures"" during my undergrad, so I am missing many prerequisites. Currently, I am working at a university as a research fellow and am taking the algorithms course, but many others (OS, Hardware, Discrete Math) are remaining. Do you think I have a shot at a regular MS CS program in the US? (I was thinking of UT Austin, UTDallas, ASU, UC Davis, UC Irvine, UMass etc.). My Converted us GPA is around 3.6+

&amp;#x200B;

I am also attending the NYU Bridge to Tandon 24 Week program for 1850 USD. The syllabus covered here is mostly familiar to me, but my motto is only the Fall 22 MSCS after the bridge. Maybe I can wait for another year to try my luck on other non-expensive uni's in Fall '23, but I am not sure If I can make it with Work Experience of 1.5 Years and prereqs - Data structures and Algorithms course. What should I do?"

Here is the 108th installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

\--Nick

I’m a PT student at a T20 and have a summer internship and conditional Ft offer for a LDP at a large biotech that I really want to work for. I only recruited for two companies and am still waiting for a decision on the other, but this is my first choice. I’m currently in the industry with 7 years experience and am trying to decide what to do. 

The internship is 10-12 weeks, after which I would return to school until next summer…jobless. I would then relocate to begin the 3 year LDP. The reason I did PT initially was because I’m nervous about leaving what is currently a good company  with great benefits. 

Current company: 160 base, with incentives I averaged 185-235K the last three years. Great insurance which is Important as I’m in some biologics that out of pocket would be 2K+ a month without insurance. Also have a company car, unlimited gas, and they reimburse my tuition 100%. When I consider tuition, retirement, insurance, and wages, the opportunity cost is about $240K. 


Im considering this offer because I want to shift functions. My current organization is based in another state and I’m a remote worker, thus my ability to change functions is limited. I’ve interviewed internally twice and was a finalist both times, but they ultimately chose other candidates. The hiring directors let me know they would have loved to have me, but want people who can be in the office a few days a week at least( I’m a 5 hour flight away). I like my company but am really burnt out in my role and honestly just don’t have any motivation anymore. I roll out of bed uninspired and have been thinking about leaving if I can’t land another role soon. 

So it seems my options are: (1) take the offer and roll the dice. Big financial hit but exciting future and immediate experience in the function I desire. Also, time time off between the internship and LDP honestly sounds refreshing. (2) stay here and remain financially secure. I have no debt and a good personal life and family where I live. This would also mean continuing to hate my job and slowly slipping into greater depression (3) wait until next year and recruit for a FT position in the LDP. The company did tell me that they sometimes hire from outside of their internship. I think I would have an excellent shot because of my background but obviously there’s no guarantee. 

I’m really torn and would greatly appreciate any feedback"

I was wondering if there were some of you guys who transferred from software engineering to Computer Science and if you could share your experience. I am currently in my 4th semester (so about 50% done) and I do plan on completing the semester first before I transfer. I was wondering if the university would recognize all the credits (or at least most) I did on my Soen for the CompSci Bs.

Also, how do you guys feel about your switch? (I know that it is a question that was asked before, but they seem several years old).

I am thinking of switching because it seems employers don't care about the degree (its always something like ""computer science/software or related fields""), I learnt more about QA/testing/process in 1 internship than I probably would in the SOEN classes (from what I saw from classes and the outlines) and it looks less troublesome.

Any input is appreciated.

Thank you"

I basically worked my way up from company 1 as an intern/support analyst. My promotion was delayed because of covid.

A month after starting my internship I handled everything from basic break fix to building servers and maintaining them.

I don't have in depth knowledge of things because I only have time to learn what is needed and I deeply regret it. I want to move in to a cloud, devops, vmware admin position or something else in system admin, just not at my current company.

&amp;#x200B;

What else should I include or take out from my resume?

I use WSUS manager, Active Directory, PDQ Deploy, Vmware on a daily basis.

I know some bash, python, and linux from a mixture of supporting raspberry pi, self study/research, and school. I can find my way around it pretty well.

I basically do everything a sole system admin would do, except I can't implement anything big because company won't give me the chance since I don't have enough tenure."

sbzrft,2,2022-01-24,Clinical Psychology - Masters or PsyD?,scook5280,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/sbzrft/clinical_psychology_masters_or_psyd/,"**I know that I want to go to graduate school for clinical psychology, but deciding which degree I should choose to pursue is really challenging.** I am truly passionate about clinical work, training and being ""in the field"". I feel that a psyd could give me more career options and higher pay, but I know there are also ways to advance as a therapist and supervisor over time with only a masters degree. I consider myself very competitive and an excellent student. I’ve maintained a 4.0 gpa for 5 years of undergraduate studies, and I’m involved in a lot of social justice work that I want to continue through grad school and in my career.  

I have applied to and been selected for the interview process for one Clinical Psych PsyD program here in the US, which would qualify me to become a licensed psychologist. I could've applied to more, but frankly, it was my top choice and with a 5-year commitment attached to it, I only wanted to apply to one that I really believed I would thrive in. I know that PhD programs are usually either cheaper or fully funded, but I chose a PsyD because I'm not interested enough in research to pursue that for 5-7 years. I am absolutely thrilled that they've selected me for the interview process, as I do have some imposter syndrome around being the first one to go to graduate school in my family, so it’s nice to know that I’m being considered as a candidate after all of my hard work. I would love the opportunity to train, supervise or manage others in the future, which is another reason I believe it might be worth it to go for the PsyD. 

However, I am now also considering 5-10 Masters programs for clinical mental health counseling, which would qualify me to become a licensed therapist. This was my original plan, but a lot of my professors in undergrad have encouraged me to apply for doctoral programs given my success as a student and my passion for creating change and serving others.  

**With all of that base information, I am wondering if those currently in graduate school or working as a therapist or psychologist could provide some feedback or advice regarding the decision I have to make: Masters or PsyD?** 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the pros and cons of each option: 

***Masters (the programs I would be choosing from vary in each category):*** 

Pros: 

* $35,000-$75,000 total cost 
* Finish in 2-3 years 
* I can complete these online, so we can move as needed for my partner’s career and/or for lower cost of living during the program 
* These programs that would qualify me for licensure as a therapist in the states I’m interested in 
* No thesis, just comprehensive exam 

Cons: 

* A master’s is more limiting than a PsyD in the scope of work and supervision qualifications 
* With this option, I would be doing the program online (I’ve always been an online student so I’m used to it, but I’m unsure if this could be a downside in regard to clinical training) 
* Lower salary than a psychologist 
* 700+ hours of practica/internship is required, which I would have to find myself and are unpaid 

***PsyD:*** 

Pros: 

* I would be living in a state that I would enjoy better than where I am now 
* I would attend the program in-person and receive more clinical training 
* The year-long internship during the last (5th) year of the program is usually a paid opportunity  
* I would receive the highest level of education in this field, and therefore more flexibility, opportunities, and potential power to create change and help more people 
* The program would qualify me to apply for licensure as a psychologist in all states I’m interested in living in 
* I would earn a master's in the second year 

Cons: 

* The area I’d be living in would be just as expensive as where I am now ($1500-2000 for an apartment) and I would be stuck there for 5 years no matter what 
* My partner would have to find work in that state, or we could potentially be separated 
* The year-long APA internship selection process during the last (5th) year of the program Is very competitive (among all psyd students in the US, and could be anywhere in the US, so I’d have to cover the cost of living somewhere else for that year 
* \~$180,000 total tuition cost, not including fees, books, supplies or cost of living – I'm not even sure how people usually manage to do this... aside from very scary student loan debt 
* I don’t know if the $20,000 more per year in average starting salary would even cover the student loan payments I would have to make? 
* Dissertation development and defense 

Other factors at play: 

I am 31, married, and will not be having children. I am free to choose whatever direction I want for my career. If I choose the master’s option, I could start it this summer or fall, and potentially finish as early as Fall 2024 at the age of 34. I would finish the PsyD in either Fall 2027 or Fall 2028 (If I delay admission for a year), which puts me finishing the program around age 37-38. Part of the debate is, will spending more time in school and delaying “starting” my career be worth the extra time and massive debt? On the other hand, if I just get a master’s, will regret not going further? Especially with how competitive I am and how I want to learn as much as possible. 

If you made it this far, thank you so much for any advice or input you’re willing to share with me. I appreciate it!"
sbzuzj,14,2022-01-24,Advice needed for a final year PhD (non-bioinformatics degree): extend my program to keep searching for bioinformatics internships or go for a postdoc?,AlexD2508,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/sbzuzj/advice_needed_for_a_final_year_phd/,"Hi folks, I am close to the end of my PhD and now I face a difficult decision and I hope you can help out. I’ll try to keep my story short:

My background: I’m in my last year of my PhD in cancer biology at a Canadian university. I switched to bioinformatics approximately a year ago (did wet lab work before that) and now I'm preparing a manuscript of my first-authored paper on machine learning analysis of gene patterns in cancers. I am familiar with python, R, pytorch, single cell seq. I also took a mysql course but never used it in an actual project. My goal is to become a bioinformatician in industry.

My difficulties: I applied to 4 internship positions in health/biotech/pharma, but I seem to have no luck. Not even interviews. I don’t know exactly why, maybe I’m indeed inexperienced, maybe they prefer students with computer science or bioinformatics degrees, or maybe because I’m only looking for remote positions which can be very competitive. I also applied to a full-time position, still no luck.

Decision I have to make now: I'm debating whether to extend my program for six months or to go for a postdoc. My original plan was to finish my program by summer. But if I’m no longer a student, the chance of getting an internship position may be even more slim. If I extend my program for six months, I can keep searching for internships as a student. But my advisor has been encouraging me to go for a postdoc in bioinformatics. I’m not opposed to a postdoc but I’m not sure how much I’ll benefit from it (discussed in some previous posts in this subreddit). I already have an informal offer from a collaborator who does 50/50 wet/dry lab research but the contract will be two years. And in this case it will embarrass my PI if I quit in the middle because he knows that collaborator quite well.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

With the internships, I realized that **finance is a really competitive field**, like you have to bust your ass off and make some connections, start networking, and as an introvert I'm not really good with talking to people. 

I**I really just want to work behind the scenes**. **I really just want to work in an office and not really interact with people too much. Something stable you know**. I want to have more freedom and flexibility in case I need to jump ship from a company I don't like. And really just want to increase my chances of finding a job once I graduate. 

Right now, I have an ECON class that focuses on programming with R and I'm sorta into coding and it just seems a little more to my speed.

Also when it comes to stocks, I legit DON'T KNOW squat about how they work. Like finance honeslty to me isn't all the interesting. I like Economics a little more because it gives me knowledge about how the world works. I really like just the social aspect of it, Finance has so much jargon I am not too familiar with.

Also ITS has a business analytics concentration which sounds interesting and appealing to me.

So far, I've completed all of my general core classes and I am almost finished with my JSOM core classes and I've done a few of ECON-major classes.

I haven't taken ITSS 3311 nor ITSS 3312 thou but that's the only thing holding me back from doing the ITSS major classes.

Just lemme know what do you guys think?"

I spent 3 years working heavily on C++ for robotics and mastered much of the language, but the last two years I've just been doing python and C. I knew regaining the muscle memory was going to be tough, so I spent a good month doing just c++ on leetcode. But under pressure, I found myself making several rookie syntax mistakes (using non-hashable keys in a map, doing std::insert instead of vector.insert, vector.append instead of push\_back) as well as higher level mistakes like using more copies than references (given I was in more of a python than C++ mindset). I had a working algorithm that was well optimized by the end of both interviews, but required much more help from the interviewer than I would have liked. I honestly did not much better than a candidate with no experience in C++ who cram-studied the week before. I'm sure I would have aced a take-home assessment under less pressure, but I just froze up since the language was no longer muscle memory. In such situations, should I admit to not using the language in a while? Any advice on being better prepared for such situations?

Should I start doing company tagged questions on LC even though idk exactly which companies I’ll interview at in ~9 months? Double down and re-do these problems? Something else? Any suggestions would be helpful. 

For context I was BAD at lc style problems this past recruiting season so I didn’t get any offers at companies with moderately hard technical interviews (didn’t get past resume screen for any faang+) Redid my resume so I’m hopeful to get past resume screen for high tc new grad jobs with 3 internships (start up, government agency, f100 bank), top 3 in hackathon, couple projects, big state school  (no name for CS) with ~3.5 gpa &amp; full stack bootcamp done by December. I’ve lived in poverty my whole life and just trying to grind my way out of the hole so thanks for the help."

Guys I'm gonna be completedly honest, I only added Finance because I thought it would land me a job once I graduate. With the internships, I realized that **finance is a really competitive field**, like you have to bust your ass off and make some connections, start networking, and as an introvert I'm not really good with talking to people. 

I**I really just want to work behind the scenes**. **I really just want to work in an office and not really interact with people too much. Something stable you know**. I want to have more freedom and flexibility in case I need to jump ship from a company I don't like. And really just want to increase my chances of finding a job once I graduate. 

Right now, I have an ECON class that focuses on programming with R and I'm sorta into coding and it just seems a little more to my speed.

Also when it comes to stocks, I legit DON'T KNOW squat about how they work. Like finance honeslty to me isn't all the interesting. I like Economics a little more because it gives me knowledge about how the world works. I really like just the social aspect of it, Finance has so much jargon I am not too familiar with.

Also ITS has a business analytics concentration which sounds interesting and appealing to me.

Just lemme know what do you guys think?"

I'm posting this off a burner, since I don't want to use my actual Reddit account, but still want feedback from both my peers and members of the industry on my question.

So due to a lot of reasons, which I will detail later, I'm considering becoming a part time college student, instead of full time. Would this be looked at negatively if I apply for an internship or job later on in life?

&amp;#x200B;

If you want more detail about my background and what reasons I have to consider switching, continue reading below.

I'm a 19 yr old, 2nd semester sophomore at a shitty college (random around the #150 mark in the US). I've already finished my university graduation requirements, so I only have my major graduation requirements left (CS/Math classes)

I also run my own bootstrapped startup. This isn't just a  side business/hustle for me and my team. We've been working 7 days a week, anywhere from 10-14 hours a day on this business for the last 2 years or so. And luckily it has been paying off. Our product is finally production ready and has already attracted several potential clients, one of which is already willing to pay us anywhere from $30-$50k a month for our services. So essentially the business will be generating \~$500k a year net profit, from this one client alone.

Unfortunately, working 70-100 hours a week, combined with a full time college workload is incredibly mentally taxing, at least it is for me. In December of 2021, I essentially suffered what I would call a mental breakdown. I basically went absolutely mental, punched through my wall, beat the shit out of my monitor, and destroyed a lot of stuff in my room. I also tried to cause self harm, but was unsuccessful. Looking back at it, it seems that it was because I was stressed out, mentally exhausted and felt incredibly pressured to perform, both from my family, the people around me and most of all, myself. 

Despite that event, I still continue working at the same pace, if not more. Ever since our product attracted major attention from clients and serious money started appearing, I'm unable to stop working. I also don't want to keep suffering from built up anger/stress/depressive thoughts, which is why I'm thinking of becoming a part time student and continue working.

Unfortunately I come from a typical Asian immigrant family, and while my parents do understand mental health is important, they also wish for me to stay as a full time student (and work less on my business), as they think it will look bad on my transcript if I become part time. They've said that it is up to me, but keep asking or trying to find ways to keep me as a full time student. I'm unsure what to do here, as I think I'm letting my parents down and am not meeting their expectations if I don't do what they want me to do.

Thank you for any feedback you give :)"

I took a gap year before my 2nd year and took that time to try out all sorts of fields in tech.

I'm not really learning anything in school and I'm 100% sure I'd learn more in a work environment and given actual practical training and work. I've built all sorts of projects with different technologies over the years admittedly rather poorly though as I tend to jump from different focuses. I've tried the basics of all sorts of stuff - Web Dev (HTML, CSS, JS, MERN, Flask, Django); Mobile (Flutter); I *tried* machine learning but gave up lmao; played with web scraping and automation using python and built dumb discord and twitter bots; and now I'm planning on tinkering with microprocessors :D I'm just waiting for my arduino kit to arrive lmao.

The point of writing this is probably to show that I *actually* enjoy and have a passion for programming and tech in general. I'm eager to learn and hungry for experience and I feel like I'm just wasting my time in school. I will of course still finish my degree (parents won't let me just drop out) but maybe I could take fewer classes If I DO find a job.

I also tried looking for internships here but the internship scene in the PH is very different from that of the west. Most of the internship programs here are unpaid are \[more often than not\] for juniors and seniors looking to finish their OJT as an academic requirement.

With that said, I would like to hear your advice on what I should do now lmao. Should I keep building projects and tinkering with all sorts of technology? Should I try to take a step into the professional scene now?

Also is it possible for me to get a remote developer internship abroad? If yes, can you point me to the right direction? Thank you!

TL;DR: I feel like I'm wasting my time in university. What should I do as a student in the Philippines? Should I apply for jobs?"

My family is pretty conservative and they've never let me work a single day in my life. So I have no job experiences. 
I recently came across an advertisement for a speech rehab centre looking for a non clinical intern. The job is basically creating posters and stuff.

This is what I need help with: 

1) Should I take a non clinical job when my field of work is completely clinical?
2) If I decide to apply, how do I write an impressive resume?
3) What are the things I should ask the employer before taking up the job? 
4) And should I ask those questions before or after applying ? 
5) I am planning to do my masters after this internship. So, at that time I should be looking for clinical jobs to increase my experience. So is it worth taking up this job ? 

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance."

I work at an amazing company with the most amazing people ever. Its a fairly new company and my 3 bosses are really nice, kind and sweet. I was earning $2000 per month at my last job but i was miserable there so i left it and i joined my current company through a reference and they clearly told me that right now its just an internship and the compensation was $600 per month and I said okay because at that time i was desperately looking for a career change and this was a field that i have always wanted to work in. Everyone called me stupid for leaving a $2000 job for a $600 but I didn’t care. Because i knew that o was going to love working here. 

Like I mentioned i am a working student. I have to pay my own fees and i have to help around the house with expenses as well. So i talked to them and they said that yeah we will increase it soon. So i said ok. Now they gave me my salary for the month of march on April 20 and I thought its fine they have a lot of expenses themselves. Then i found out that the owner of the company have 12-15 other businesses of her own and can in fact pay me on my but they didn’t. So I thought I’ll just talk to them about it but i hate confrontation so i never talked to them. Now they haven’t given me my salary of two months and every time i ask them they said yeah it will be done and good and all that. Its literally so demotivating and disheartening and I literally dont know what to because I only have 2 sides a good one or a bad one. There is no in between. I have asked them politely so many time and they still haven’t done anything. I am afraid if i ask them again i am gonna loose my mind and say something that I shouldn’t say. 

Also i am getting so many good offers to work in different companies with good salary packages and benefits but i feel like i will be betraying the current company that i am working at. Over the 4 months that i have been here i have made a very special connection with everyone here and i dont know how to tell them that i need my salary increased or i am gonna have to take another job. Because I really really need the money and as much as i like working here i am not getting any money at all and that is just annoying. 

If i leave the company right now then i will have to start all over again at another company but i will be getting paid on time and good. If i dont leave the company right now i am 70% sure i will get promoted but i dont know when and i dont know if i have the time to waste because what if the 30% comes true and i dont get promoted. I am in such a pickle and idk what to do please help me out."

I will graduate this summer, and I recently received an offer from one of the large companies in the semiconductor industry to work as a hardware engineer in Germany. I did a 6-month internship at this company already and really enjoyed my time. 

They offer a salary of around 45k (before taxes) per year. Having lived in Europe, considering my expenses and the average salary scale, this offer seems reasonable to me. Taking into account that I will be a fresh graduate only with internship experience.

The problem is, my father was almost going to call me stupid when I said I was satisfied with the offer. He claims that I can find a job in the US for double the current offer, and have a much better life.

I would like to know what engineers think about it, and what would they do? Is my father right about what he thinks? I know that I can earn slightly more in the US, but I feel my expenses will also be higher, so it will balance out. 

Thank you in advance!"

scfem9,119,2022-01-25,Will it hurt me if I become a part time student?,randomburnerstudent,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/scfem9/will_it_hurt_me_if_i_become_a_part_time_student/,"Hello everyone,

I'm posting this off a burner, since I don't want to use my actual Reddit account, but still want feedback from both my peers and members of the industry on my question. I originally posted this in r/cscareerquestions but didn't get much of a response, so I thought I'll try again here.

So due to a lot of reasons, which I will detail later, I'm considering becoming a part time college student, instead of full time. Would this be looked at negatively if I apply for an internship or job later on in life?

If you want more detail about my background and what reasons I have to consider switching, continue reading below.

TLDR Background: I work full time at my own startup, often working 80-90 hours a week. Startup is going good, lots of potential clients. But I'm often stressed out and don't have a lot of time for school work without my mental health suffering even more. 

&amp;#x200B;

Full background:

I'm a 19 yr old, 2nd semester sophomore at a shitty college (random around the #150 mark in the US). I've already finished my university graduation requirements, so I only have my major graduation requirements left (CS/Math classes)

I also run my own bootstrapped startup. This isn't just a side business/hustle for me and my team. We've been working 7 days a week, anywhere from 10-14 hours a day on this business for the last 2 years or so. And luckily it has been paying off. Our product is finally production ready and has already attracted several potential clients, one of which is already willing to pay us anywhere from $30-$50k a month for our services. So essentially the business will be generating \~$500k a year net profit, from this one client alone.

Unfortunately, working 70-100 hours a week, combined with a full time college workload is incredibly mentally taxing, at least it is for me. In December of 2021, I essentially suffered what I would call a mental breakdown. I basically went absolutely mental, punched through my wall, beat the shit out of my monitor, and destroyed a lot of stuff in my room. I also tried to cause self harm, but was unsuccessful. Looking back at it, it seems that it was because I was stressed out, mentally exhausted and felt incredibly pressured to perform, both from my family, the people around me and most of all, myself.

Despite that event, I still continue working at the same pace, if not more. Ever since our product attracted major attention from clients and serious money started appearing, I'm unable to stop working. I also don't want to keep suffering from built up anger/stress/depressive thoughts, which is why I'm thinking of becoming a part time student and continue working.

Unfortunately I come from a typical Asian immigrant family, and while my parents do understand mental health is important, they also wish for me to stay as a full time student (and work less on my business), as they think it will look bad on my transcript if I become part time. They've said that it is up to me, but keep asking or trying to find ways to keep me as a full time student. I'm unsure what to do here, as I think I'm letting my parents down and am not meeting their expectations if I don't do what they want me to do.

Thank you for any feedback you give :)"
scfsxl,44,2022-01-25,"I’ve had numerous jobs that pulled some shady stuff and when I stood up for myself, they weren’t happy.",Shellie7297,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/scfsxl/ive_had_numerous_jobs_that_pulled_some_shady/,"At 21 y/o I worked for Voltek in Michigan, USA. After 5 years of service I was diagnosed with degenerative disc disease. Voltek informed me I had to lift my restrictions (50# lifting) or they’d fire me. I instead hired a lawyer and filed 2 lawsuits to keep my job; I kept my job but they froze my wages for 2 years and made my life miserable. I found a new job and left. 

At 27 y/o, as a certified massage therapist (a year plus internship) my boss (can’t even remember who down in Indiana) wanted me to train my unschooled, uncertified co-workers. I refused. I said I’d need to be compensated for that. She refused and insisted I owed it to her because of her hiring me. I quit on the spot.  

Over the years I worked at places that intimidated, verbally berated and did all they could to force more work out of me and fellow employees. I even had a mental break down after working in a factory (yeah you, Toka Rika/TRMI Battle Creek, MI) from working nights and being denied day shift. I even reported a bullying situation and their answer to that was to move me to a harder, faster line and tell me to “mind my own business”, even though I was the one being bullied. I developed panic attacks and anxiety. Hence mental break after all the crap and 6 months off work; I needed to survive and this job was it. Until it wasn’t. 

At 46 y/o I worked for a family run propane company (Nottawa Gas) and was expected to know the office manager’s job but wouldn’t get paid his hourly pay when I did it. Ummm, nope. When I informed them I needed back surgery to correct the spinal stenosis that was pinching my spinal cord causing me to fall over, I listened to her rant about my incompetent work performance. 2 hours later she informs me I was being let go for performance issues, despite not having a single write up in the 2 years I worked there. She gave me the choice of quitting right then (as she advised me to do) or staying until I was replaced (which she “preferred I don’t do”. I chose to stay. Called my orthopedic doctor to schedule surgery immediately then called my lawyer friend. Next day I told her my surgical date and handed her a letter drafted by my lawyer friend informing her of ADA laws and how they applied to me. I didn’t even bother to listen to her get mad at me; screw you, Kristin. I had surgery in a week, took the maximum time off to recover with my surgeon’s blessing, returned to work then found a new job. 

I’ve not made over $30,000 a year. Ever. I just want to be comfortable in life, pay my bills, be able to save some money and not believe I’ll have to work until I’m dead. (Yeah. I’ll either die or have to go on disability to retire)
Currently I have a job I love ($27,000 a year) but it offers no health benefits whatsoever. Due to my age and losing the genetic lottery, I have screening procedures that need done and other medical issues addressed. And I can’t afford them out of pocket due to it being thousands of dollars to be done and heaven forbid the tests find something that needs taken care of. 

Today I’m interviewing for a job that’s $1 less than what I’m making now but has full benefits. If I accept, I can still work part-time at my old job. I don’t know how long I’ll be able to do 7 days a week. And I don’t know how much more I can remove from my life to make bills easier. 


How the fuck do people Not see the need for a better living wage? It a universal wage? No one should have to work 7 days a week to survive."

I know the basics of HTML CSS JS bootstrap git GitHub but very little about the backend. should I learn all the technologies and then start with the projects or just get my hands dirty and will learn that way.

Another Doubt was what projects should I build?  like can anyone share some lists or something that would be awesome.

I wanted your opinion on this topic. So a little background about myself. 

my_qualifications:

I'm a final year ECE student at one of the top 3 NITs. I have a 9+ GPA (cumulative) and I've done two internships so far: one at a good semiconductor company (ASIC Design Verification) and another at Shakti, IITM. I got a PPO in the former company. I have plans of going for masters abroad after a couple of years (I'm graduating this summer). I'm interested in the areas of Computer Architecture and Digital Design. One thing which bothers me is the lack of publications; I don't have any :( 

I had these doubts:

1. How will the lack of publications limit me in the application process?
2. With this profile, what would be a good range of colleges I can try for?
3. For folks working in the semiconductor industry, how is a master's degree valued? I have plans of eventually coming back to India after working in the US for some time. After I come back, will I be placed in a better position than a person with just a bachelor's degree who has joined this year and received promotions?"

I just accepted a position at Vanguard as a Retirement Plan Service Representative. I see it as a good opportunity because they are going to pay for several of my licenses that I will need to work with their clients. However, I'm curious to see if anyone knows of advancement opportunities once I have spent some time in this role. It sounds like I will be working with current and prospective clients to educate them on various retirement funs and execute buying orders and transfers. I'm getting the impression that this is comparable to the Client Relationship Associate position which is almost like customer service. Does anyone have any input on this or know if this is a good starting point for me to eventually move into a higher level position? I initially hoped to find an entry level analyst position somewhere, but I graduated with a GPA of 2.94 and have limited internship experience."

scjcrj,2,2022-01-25,Data Science Internship,circlecarrot,PennStateUniversity,https://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/scjcrj/data_science_internship/,"Hi I am a sophomore majoring in computational data science, and I wanted to ask other CS/DS/IST majors out there about how and when they got their first internships and whether they have any tips. 

I’m an international student and have to many companies but most seem to not be interested even though I have a major GPA&gt; 3.7 and I’ve been on the deans list 2/3 semesters. Also I have listed a project and I think my resume is overall well rounded. 
Also do you guys have any companies that you recommend me applying to? 
Thank you"

I cannot find anything like this in the EU, though. I have looked through Google's, Facebook's and a few other companies (I do not necessarily plan to work for FAANG, but they usually do set the standards for other big tech) and Google hasn't had an opening for a few weeks now, although in America everyone is interviewing for summer right now.

Is there anything like this on the old continent? 

Thanks for any info!"
sck1a4,9,2022-01-25,Which/How many programming languages should a non-software engineer know?,nick__2440,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/sck1a4/whichhow_many_programming_languages_should_a/,"Context: currently in my second year. Although I really enjoy programming, I don't think I want to go into software engineering - I'll most likely choose bio/chemical engineering, something a bit closer to the sciences. So far I've got a decent amount of experience in Python and C++ (tensorflow, openCV, the common dataviz and scicomp libraries, plus some projects involving hardware), and bits of SQL and VBA for excel i learned at an internship.

My question is should I be

* trying to learn some new programming languages (maybe like R, MatLab, Julia)?
* going deeper into the applications of python/C++ in the areas i'm interested in?
* prioritise something better unrelated to programming like internships/lab experience?

(i've flaired this 'career advice' but my objective isn't necessarily to tick boxes on a job application here - more like just trying to get the most out of learning new things and maybe putting them to use in a project or internship.)

All advice welcome :)"

If so,

1. When did you apply?
2. How long did the process take?
3. How long after the coding assessment did you hear back for an interview?
4. Was the interview technical, behavioral, or both?

I got an email on January 5th from IBM saying that my application is moving forward now that I passed the coding assessment stage but since then I have not heard back and I am wondering how likely is it that they ghosted me?"

I am a recent graduate looking looking to make some extra cash before starting fulltime by proving some helpful advice to young students wanting to become software engineers.

I am a student from the University of Toronto graduating with multiple internships (mix of bign, faang, unicorns) and about to start at a top unicorn. 

I have mentored a couple students in the past and have helped friends land internships at places like linkedin and twitch.

If youre interested, DM :) Thank you"

scokv2,9,2022-01-25,Sage Corps Internship Experience,vibechange,uofm,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/scokv2/sage_corps_internship_experience/,"Hey guys, I've gotten a lot of emails from Sage Corps concerning a study abroad internship experience. I wanted to know if anyone had any firsthand experience with this program, and whether it is legit or not. I'm a Sophomore studying CS for reference. I'm slightly hesitant because it seems like you have to pay in order to be placed in the internship abroad - which is not really my ideal internship, as I would want to be the one being paid :)

If anyone has any experience with Sage Corps please let me know, any insight is helpful. Doesn't have to be specifically a CS internship"

I've applied to alot of jobs but have only heard back from about 2% of my applications. There's a lot of jobs that I really want (and I think I qualify for), but I can't tell if I should skip on the job I'm being offered and risk the position, or just take this one and get the experience (not exactly what I wanted to do as a position, but still relevant enough for an internship)"
scq6mb,1,2022-01-25,Rescinding an offer from one company because you got a better offer later from another for an internship? help,InsertFunnyUsrnm,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/scq6mb/rescinding_an_offer_from_one_company_because_you/," I am a Junior CS student at a tech oriented college. I have no internship experience in the past, few projects to my name, but do fairly well in school(above a 3.9 gpa)(note: idk if this is considered good here but yeah).

I got an offer from a FinTech company during the fall semester and I immediately accepted because I honestly thought I had to take anything I could get. I've gone through the full background check etc. with this company so all that's left would be actually starting the internship this summer.

Fast forward to the end of December I got an email saying that my application process with a  big name/more potential company has finally been started which made no sense since I applied in the beginning of the semester. I went through the interview process mostly to get interview practice because I direly need it. Today I got an offer which is something I never expected but I don't know if I should be happy or not about it.

Would accepting the offer and rescinding my FinTech offer black list me from a lot of companies?

Are other companies in the future able to see that I backed out after accepting an offer and would that look poorly on my record?

Is there a true advantage to going to a tech company over a FinTech company/ would it look drastically better when applying for jobs after graduation?

General advice on how I should approach the situation would be helpful. I've scheduled a meeting with my advisor but other than that I'm not sure what to do.

I feel like just after getting the FinTech company offer I suffered with imposter syndrome and still do because I don't have much experience and feel like I'll be a small fish in a small pond, if I go to tech I feel like it'll be even worse because I would now be in a ""big pond"".

Also sorry if this came off as douchey. I know people have a hard time to get offers and I'm not at all trying to gloat. I've seen a lot of good advice from this subreddit in the past so I thought this could help or that others may have had a similar experience.

Thanks ahead of time."

I am wondering if some of y'all could help me out. I am deciding to go to school. Though i am having a dilemma. This is a bit of long post but i definitely would appreciate any help. 

I am 28 and have a bachelor's degree in agriculture with lots of experience working with machines. Now the school offers a technician program and it seems to lead more towards trucks. I am wanting to get into heavy machinery myself. Though they also have another program thru CAT. The deal being get your tools paid for, and tuition reimbursed after working for them for 3 years. Which i found out you get paid like every 6 months. So if i wanted to leave, it just wouldn't pay for the whole thing. Also found this is usually for more younger students. 

Now here is the dilemma it is geared towards heavy machinery. But it starts in the fall and i have to be accepted into it (with my experience should be fine). Though every other semester you gotta do a paid internship. The regular tech program starts in April. I don't have the money to pay out of pocket. I have student loans (50k) and i can't get a lot of scholarships or any grants because of my bachelors degree.

 Is it worth waiting and going through the CAT program and learn that way to get free tools and school paid for only after i graduate and work for them for 3 yrs. Or just start the program deal with the debt for right now, choose my own tools, get a broader range of learning and go with the regular program. 

I just want to start as I'm excited to get into this field. I have like 3k to my name and i want to do this right. I'm looking for jobs currently to help anyway. 

So I am asking from the experience of y'all who have worked in the field, gone through school or gone through CAT program. Thank you for reading and any recommendations will help me!"

scrom5,1,2022-01-25,"Am I too old to start hacking? What is the best job(high paying) as someone who is interested in programming, business, AI/ML, stocks/stock market, technology, and management?",Jra_codes,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/scrom5/am_i_too_old_to_start_hacking_what_is_the_best/,"I'm 13 and I have been interested in computer science and programming for 2 years now. Unfortunately, I have only now decided to learn how to program and code trying to learn languages like Python, Html, Java, JavaScript, C, C++, and Swift(I'm sad because I think it's really late and I should have started earlier especially since I want to be a software developer/software architect right now). My passion is making money I like technology, stocks/stock market/cryptocurrency, business, and computer science/AI(artificial intelligence)/ML(machine learning). Also since I was interested in business and technology I was thinking that after I had enough money from working as a software developer(if I got a job) and investing in stocks(since I don't have much money right now) I would start my own company but of course, I would never stop investing in the stock market.  The thing is my plan was to get an internship or job as a quant(quantitative trader) or some sort of high paying job with programming/hacking at a high paying company(like Google, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft...etc)before I go to university(when I hit 18) and then when I had enough money I could start my own company and ask people to join because I wanted to have my own company by the time I turned 21-25. Unfortunately, the successful CEOs and entrepreneurs in tech have started coding and hacking when they were just 7 years old. So I'm wondering if I'm too late? If not how can I become successful with my dream and where do I start? How do I hack? I'm also wondering if it's worth it to take business or CS in university when I go because some of the most successful CEOs and entrepreneurs in tech(Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg) didn't take business so I was wondering if it mattered and if I needed a degree in one of those to get a high paying programming/hacking/quant/product manager job?"
scrtl5,6,2022-01-25,"2 years since graduation, no job, no internship, unsure what to do",throwaway_5623424,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/scrtl5/2_years_since_graduation_no_job_no_internship/,"I graduated 2 years ago (May 2020) with a bachelor's in computer science from a pretty decent university (around top 50 in the US for Com Sci), and I haven't been able to land a full-time job at all since then. I was never able to get an internship during college either, so I'm at a total of 0 experience. I did some projects as part of college classes, but about half of them were in games, which doesn't really impress anyone in interviews for CS positions, and I don't have the experience they want for games positions either. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't apply for ""new grad"" positions because they always specify that they want people who graduated last year at the earliest, but entry level positions always expect more than I have in the interview. Startups seem to expect people with a few years of experience under their belt, so I've never been able to find openings that fit me on Angellist. People have told me to work on projects, but they won't be specific about what I should do for that, so I don't really have any ideas on what to work on. I also don't really feel like I have the skills or design sense necessary to make a website. My family has told me I should get a master's so that I can get an internship, but people who have a master's have told me that getting a master's just to get an internship doesn't make any sense at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I'm not really sure what I can do to get a job at this point, and I'm hoping for advice. I'm open to literally any job that uses my degree, literally anywhere at all, as long as it's not a scam."
scs8we,1,2022-01-25,Is it ‘easier’ to get into a Trading Firm as a New Grad than transferring after a couple of years in FAANG? (SWE Role),tryingtolearn111,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/scs8we/is_it_easier_to_get_into_a_trading_firm_as_a_new/,"Just a question that has been on my mind as I consider taking a gap semester (and thus being able to have one more summer internship before full time).  I’d assume experience in a full time role is more valuable than any summer internship, but maybe the new grad role is just inherently easier to get into/age is a factor?"
scsc34,5,2022-01-25,Site Reliability Engineer offer,vvony,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/scsc34/site_reliability_engineer_offer/,"Hey guys,

I'm final year Computer Science student, and recently got interviewed for Mcsft SWE Internship, did well on interviews, but unfortunately there was not enough open positions for internship. 20 days later I got a call for SRE full-time offer also from Mcsft (Junior DevOps Engineer) and need to respond to it's offer as soon as it's possible. I have either that option or to tell HR to put me on list for Summer Internship for Microsoft (do not need to retake interviews again, means that I already passed all interviews, but I'm not guaranteed that I will recieve offer for internship) and now I'm not sure what to do. I'm not sure about SRE position, as I didn't hear about it before and was always hoping for SWE role.

I feel that this role is kinda underappreciated, and I'm kinda scared to start full-time job before ending college and that I won't be able later to transfer from this role to SWE.

Can anyone experienced give me some advice? Thank you so much! :D"
sct2db,2,2022-01-25,Advice for returning to programming?,WNW69420666,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/sct2db/advice_for_returning_to_programming/,"I went to school for Computer Science for 3 years and had two internships during that time, one doing web dev work and the other doing automated QA.  I was on good terms with both internships, however I left the second one when I had to move out of my home state for personal reasons.  After moving I made dramatic career trajectory shifts due to some severe mental health issues.  After dealing with a lot of these issues and finding a medication that works for me I find myself ready to go back into software development.  During those two years of depression however I didn't gain any new experience and let my skills lie dormant.

I've been finding that I am having an easy time hopping back into programming with myself running a few exercises and thinking about things.  I failed pretty hard at a recent interview where they dropped a technical interview on me without warning, and basically made me do a homework assignment from a data structures and algorithms class.  I think I did pretty okay for someone who was completely unprepared but it still made me feel insecure.

I keep feeling like I have to do something to ""prove myself"" but I have no clue how to do that.  The area I live in is so sparse for software developer jobs too that the pressure feels huge.  I'm ready to learn and still feel my thought process and skills are sharp.  


I feel like I'm just being anxious but of course a second opinion always helps.  


EDIT: Forgot to add, how do you build a portfolio on your own? Would I really need to in my case?   


I dropped out of college this year due to not being able to afford it anymore, and the school I was attending wouldn't let me transfer to a CS program without another 3 years of classes, which I would never be able to afford. "

my physical description so anyone can see that some job outlook is not possible for me:

now i am 26F this year, BMI 23, 5'1, olive skin

grooming habit : for occasion, i wear tied/bun hair/wavy hair, shower and brush teeth 2 times daily, put lotion and sunscreen, shave every 2 weeks or month, put on perfume, wear clothes with neutral or soft colors. 

physical flaws : mole (i removed it with ACV so no more), front teeth not straight enough, protruding ears, lazy eyes when i gaze off, some people advised me to get jaw surgery. (i would really love to have surgery to fix all of these but it is very expensive even after i save some money, not to mention the after care treatment and side effects, also my acquaintance told me that braces did nothin on her/ waste of money for years)

child period : I wished to study medicine and be a doctor when I grew up

teenager period : got bullied, gaslighted and left out, depressed, brain became numb and stunted, gave up on my childhood dream because I got convinced I am too stupid, I would like to be flight attendant but my parent forbade me, managed to pass high school

college year: failed to enter good university, decided to study tourism in local polytechnic / similar to community college and sort for 3 years. i did not enjoy the college but i was too afraid because my parent already spent money on me. i graduated with a dead end 3 years diploma, which means i can not continue to bachelor or even master (since you need bachelor degree). Try to do multiple online business like clothing shop and ricebox shop but failed and got lowballed. 

early 20s :  failed to get a hospitality job in my city, paid agent so i could get hotel internship chance in neighboring country, used the certificate to apply for hospitality job in middle east, got the offer and worked there for 1 year, i did not enjoy the job and the office politic, i got bullied so much i ended up resign from it, after that i only did multiple side jobs including prostitution (it was depressing, not glamorous or stable at all) , even trying to find a man to marry me for citizenship or as sugar daddy but got ghosted/ the relationship headed nowhere. 

pandemic / mid 20s : there were lockdowns in the country, the only side gig i can do was prostitution (even less) and sold off my furniture, with some spare money, everyone hyped about ""become dev with no degree"" BootCamp so i did a course to get certificate and even applied anywhere even internship, hope to secure ""so called high salaried"" WFH,  but got no reply, i researched on the subreddit that i need IT/CS degree so employer would see my resume.

so i decided to return to my country and studied again to get CS degree in some local university in my city, with many fresh out of school teenagers. At first, the lesson was okay, but the curriculum was outdated, the students were uncooperative and unwelcoming (i tried to befriend and even discussed with them about the college projects but got ignored yet when other kids repeat my point, they actually listen to each other), bought some recommended CS book, eventually after learning and learning i got overwhelmed, lost and the passion jut evaporated.I decided to do something else 

2021: I quit the uni, i applied for social work in many institutes in Germany, in hope that after finishing the social work i could find an apprenticeship place there, so i can set my foot in the industry i would like to work in (for example medical, management, culinary, engineering and so on). I got the offer months after, i need to find online appointments to visit embassy, got one in june, got cancelled by embassy, got another in September, got cancelled again by embassy, tried to reach out to them and asked for alternative dates but no reply, so i finally got my visa appointment for December.

i flew to embassy and handed all my documents, making sure everything is complete. they told me that my insurance coverage is not enough (my social institution in Germany was the one who registered the insurance) so they rejected my visa. I had a chance to appeal to them in a month, so i communicated this matter ASAP to my social institution there and they told me to send the forwarded new document to embassy, past forward a month and more later, i checked up on embassy about the status but they claimed that it is still in the process and i should stop asking more. Meanwhile i was expected to be arrive there on 13 feb at least. 

Honestly if this opportunity might lost, i did not know what else to do, let see what usually people might suggest :

scholarship ? for bachelor i am too old, for master, i need to have bachelor first which means i need to study again for another 4 years at least

opening business ? i failed and got lowballed many times, some people even tried to scam me, it is not as easy as people claimed, only some people are successful and can make a living out of it. 

IT BootCamp ? i did that it was not easy and even after getting certificate i never got any callback, probably because there are already million of people doing the same thing during pandemic

studying abroad again / investing stocks : need to have a lot of money, like a lot, since need to provide proof of finance in destination country for studying. Beside investment are very difficult since i need to partake the living cost with my parent (i now move back to my parent house), i might need money to draw for emergency purpose as well, left me with nothing for stocks or any type of investment, even bitcoins are dipping so badly now and probably will actually lose the hype unlike 2017. 

getting married ? i did not feel comfortable marrying stranger or someone out of love, beside i am financially vulnerable, i probably might get trapped in abusive relationship with no chance to run away. 

Making only fans ? this is getting old and oversaturated, beside privacy concern, i did not want to submit my passport data and showing my face there. Same goes with being any type of social media star, most relying on algorithm or actually excellent video editing and expertise to be successful. 

Become a model : i am considered too old, too fat, too short, beside there is no market for person like me in my country unlike US.

When i look back and think how dumb and such failure i am, i consider how to end my life many times, wish i was never born, wish i was more talented, prettier, smarter, from privileged family and so on, wish i could have time machine.  

but i know i am still so clueless with what else careerpath possible out there, unfortunately i do not live in America or first world country where there are like hundred thousand careerpaths that not even recognized in my poor country."
scyr1b,3,2022-01-26,Is disclosing my ADHD on job application a good idea?,throwawayadhd___,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/scyr1b/is_disclosing_my_adhd_on_job_application_a_good/,"So the title is the question I have.

I am making this post because I am afraid of being discriminated against during the candidate selection process. I am scared because I am graduating university soon and I am aware of the stigma around it. In my situation, not many people know about my condition, including some of my closest friends. I have excelled in several 4-month long internships in the banking industry (in Canada ranging from research to predicative modelling) and I have never disclosed this information to any my employers. I am currently applying for summer internships that I hope can result in a full-time position, and this is where I struggle in considering whether or not I should disclose this information. Personally for me, I would like to pursue a career in sales and trading. This is because my parents have always told me to pursue the career I have a passion for. When I trade on my personal account (whether it be stocks or crypto) I find that I get lost in time because I have so much fun. But given the industry is so competitive, I do not want to be looked down upon. Also, you read a lot of job postings that mention how they support candidates that have ADHD, but how real is this? 

If it's a competitive field, would you get removed under consideration because you are not ""deemed"" fit for a role? 

Any advice or personal experience on this topic would be appreciated! Thanks!"
scyx4o,1,2022-01-26,"Is it weird to ""cold-call"" to ask someone you met a long time ago out?",Investing_Walrus,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/scyx4o/is_it_weird_to_coldcall_to_ask_someone_you_met_a/,"**Sorry for the grammar. I can't find my contacts, and I'm effectively blind.**

Around a year ago, I traveled to a university in another state for an internship program required for my college major. While there, I made pretty close friends with several others in the program, many of whom I continue to talk with regularly, and a couple of which I travel to visit in a neighboring state every once in a while.

While there, we were housed with two or three other students or visitors to the university. Toward the end of the internship, I had the opportunity to meet one friend's roommate, call him ""A"". It turned out that A and I had a lot of common interests, and we ended up talking for a couple hours. We got along well, and A suggested hanging out with our group the next day.

We spent the next day together, returned and everyone but A and I left. We talked over beers for a couple of hours, and suddenly A starts acting a bit awkward and vaguely suggesting that I was gay (which I would only come to realize later). Eventually he very vaguely suggested me he liked me.

I'm an *extremely* closeted gay man, from an extremely homophobic, conservative Mormon family in the deep south. I've never told anyone, I've never been in a relationship or on a date. Although I was by then well separated from my family, I still struggle with immense guilt and self hate for being gay.

I didn't know how to respond and, although I had no reason to be, I was suddenly in fear knowing that I appear as gay-- something I actively avoid. So, I froze. He apologized profusely, we both awkwardly left, and I only seen him again briefly once, where he avoided me. I never said anything.

I've regretted it ever since. I really, *really* liked him. He was both very physically attractive and a lot of fun to be around and talk to. He's *so* sweet, and not only do I feel like I missed an opportunity, I feel awful for turning him down. I would love to have had the opportunity to spend more time with him.

I was recently talking with my friend, A's roommate, and he told me he noticed that I seemed to be into A. Although my friend and A never talked much and haven't talked since, he has A's phone number. He suggested that I text A and ask him if he'd like to hang out sometime.

I would love to, however A is an 8 hour train ride away, and I'm worried it would come off weird to cold-call someone I met once or twice living in another state using a phone number given to me by someone else.

Should I text him? If so, what should I say? I don't want to make him uncomfortable, but I'd love another chance, or to at least apologize to him. I regret making that mistake. I really liked him :(."

I have about 2 and a half years experience (including an internship) and a bachelors degree in Computer Science. I went this path for a range of reasons (see my last post for more info, I’ll kind of be discussing what I talked about then here too) but I did genuinely feel ok with coding for the rest of my life when I started to do it 8 years ago (which sounds insane to say lol). 

Flash forward to now, I’m not enjoying it nearly as much. I dread getting out of bed some days because I just feel like it’s not the job for me. I’m not 100% sure it’s not mental health related but I’m on a waiting list to fix that so I’m doing what I can for now in that regard. I feel bored and unmotivated and cynical about the whole industry, not to mention I don’t think I even like to program anymore. I’ve even recently started a new job in a new country to see if that would help, but I feel a similar way to my last job. 

Is there an alternative route that will let me live comfortably? I live in Stockholm now and I love the city, but I’m not enjoying the job.

Sunt student, anul II. Vreau sa aplic pentru internship la vara imediat cum se deschid pozitiile, in februarie - martie.

Am un profil de GitHub, insa nu am repo-uri publice. Ma gandeam sa pun temele din anul I (C), iar indata ce se incheie semestrul acesta, sa le incarc si pe cele de acum (Java).

Ideea este ca eu mai am cateva proiecte micute in C si Python (CLI si GUI), de prin clasa a XII-a. Imi e ca le voi pierde la un moment dat, nefiind pe GitHub. Nu le pastrez pentru ca sunt capodopere de arta, ci mai mult pentru ca imi amintesc de liceu.

Nu ma pot decide daca sa le am ca repo-uri publice sau private. Daca le-as avea publice, ar putea arata un progres, din liceu si pana in prezent. Nu sunt tocmai mandru de codul din ele, motiv pentru care le-as tine ca repo-uri private. N-am idee daca ar prinde bine sau nu, avand in vedere ca vreau sa aplic in curand pentru un internship.

Greu, domne'. Prea mult overthinking.

Multumesc!

**LATE EDIT:** Iau in considerare si ideea de a publica pe GitHub strict proiecte cu adevarat ""personale"" si nu temele de la facultate (care sunt tip proiect, totusi), diverse tutoriale sau orice altceva ce este foarte posibil sa apara pe profilurile de GitHub ale celorlalti candidati pentru internship - de acelasi an."

sd86rv,9,2022-01-26,Advice for a lost (fairly) recent grad with a genuine interest in finance,[deleted],FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/sd86rv/advice_for_a_lost_fairly_recent_grad_with_a/,"Some needed context: I graduated a few years ago with a 2:1 from Imperial in Science, since then I worked first in accountancy for some months, but then moved to tech where I've worked for \~2.5y, initially in my own startup as part of an incubator program (we got 250k funding but I left because it was a terrible deal) and now at a tech consultancy for coming up to 1y.

At uni I really had no idea what I wanted to do, I was interested in a lot of things and kept changing what I was going for, I tried applying for just about everything, including banking and finance roles, but got nowhere primarily due to a lack of focus and commitment to one thing. I found the recruitment process daunting, opaque, and pretty ridiculous, and that kinda put me off applying for as many roles as I hear you need to to get in, after applying for several internships and putting a lot of effort in, being rejected without interview without even a word as to why, despite my nearly perfect academic record, put me in a state of despair and I basically gave up (although at the time I knew a lot less about finance).

I recently had a (very curable) cancer diagnosis, I'm not trying to play a sympathy card here - will 98% likely be cured and probably already am, it's not a huge deal, but it has made me rethink my life.

Tech isn't what I thought it was going to be, development work is in reality not challenging or interesting to me, most tasks are menial, and although I used to enjoy solving coding puzzles, I no longer do very much, I have been more honest with myself about this recently.

What I always seem to return to in my interest is finance, over the past years I've read books like The Intelligent Investor and relevant sections of Security Analysis (eg skipped treasury bonds section), both by Benjamin Graham, I enjoyed Ray Dalio's big debt crises book, I obsessively watch clipped questions from Warren Buffett's Annual meetings, Peter Lynch talks/interviews etc, and my friends are always asking me why I don't work in finance when I'm always explaining stuff about it to them. Some I want to read are Irrational Exuberance by Shiller, and Phil Fisher's books.

I would say I have pretty exceptional knowledge on finance and investing for someone who's never worked in it, I'm able to easily talk the lingo with uni mates who are now in banking, but then again I don't have a lot of points of reference here.

**TL;DR of above:** science and tech background, have a genuine interest and good knowledge of finance but never worked in it, have been kinda lost since and during uni on what I should do with my life

**So what am I asking for advice on exactly here?**

1 - Given where my interest lies (ie the books I found interesting), what area of finance should I focus on? Equity research? Asset management? Wealth? ECM or even DCM? I honestly have no idea, and have actually applied for all 5 of these and more in the past (lol).

2 - How the hell do you even get in when you aren't eligible for summer internships (post uni grad) and have no experience?

3 - Where should I apply? I know there are far more finance jobs than in big banks?

4 - Just because I like reading (more accurately knowing about) about finance and boring my mates with it, does that mean I will actually enjoy the work in the sector? Will I find the reality of the work just as dull as tech turned out to be?

5 - And finally, what should I do from here if I want to career change into finance from a tech background?

I appreciate any help you guys can offer me, I kinda feel lost in my life atm, like I've tried every door and thought endlessly about what to do, and nothing seems to have felt right yet.

Note about salary: yes I do want a nice salary and earn decent money at the moment (30-40k), but I'm not a materialist, I value intrinsically enjoying my job more than a huge paycheck, although I would feel dissatisfied and like I had failed myself if I was earning shit money (that's why I abandoned working in science)."

Long post warning I guess, sorry!

I (23f) am planning on leaving my job currently. For backstory, I work at a local nonprofit serving a vulnerable population. I started here as an intern three years ago and have worked extremely hard. I am currently the director of one of our programs and have been told that I will be promoted to Associate Director this July. The agency was quite literally in the brink of closing when I began my internship. There was a brand new executive director that started when I did and she completely turned this place around and took me under her wing and has essentially been training me to continue increasing responsibility since day one. All of that is great to me. I’ve learned so much, I’m financially pretty well off, but I am so burnt out right now. 

I’m a full time student in a graduate level program, which is my own choice and I’ve managed the workload well for the past year. I love my clients and the work that we do for our community. I love the flexibility that my employer gives me so that I can complete my education and internships as needed. 

But, there are problems. 
1. We’re a nonprofit near a few colleges and mainly end up being staffed by college students that need trained from the ground up and leave very quickly after graduating. I make it work though. I’m constantly training and hiring and trying to implement policies that make it worthwhile for people to stay. I advocate for my staff to get raises and try to make our on-call/holiday rotations as easy as possible. 
2. I work A LOT. Like, 50+ hours a week on a good week. I’m basically always on call since I supervise all direct service staff. This was all fine for the past few years. The overtime really helped me financially. Then the board decided to switch me to salary a few months ago because the overtime was expensive. I do not feel like I’m being adequately compensated for the work I do. I literally don’t have a schedule. I work days, evening, overnights, weekends, and whatever else is needed to keep this place afloat. And if I’m not in the building then my phone is typically ringing. It also turns into a big deal if I take my time off. It’s crisis work so there’s always emergencies happening. I just typically have to resolve them. So when I’m off it falls on our other staff who treat me like the devil for “leaving them” once I get back. 
3. I have so much responsibility but no authority. I am supposed to supervise our staff, but our director is a bit of a push over. If the staff doesn’t like a policy I implement or feel like I’m being too hard on them with my expectations they go straight over my head. Then whatever I implemented gets reversed and the director tells me that she knows she shouldn’t have but it is easier to just keep the peace. 
4. I’m in this field because I want to promote social change through ethical means and Jesus christ every employee we get seems to be cynical and angry that they’re doing their job and no amount of training seems to make a difference because the board and director promote the negative environment by “keeping the peace” and not stopping toxic behaviors. 

There’s a lot more, but what does it matter in the long run? I plan on leaving at the end of April and will give my director a two month notice to begin replacing me soon. I don’t know how I’ll make it work financially quite yet. I’m worried for the well-being of the clients we serve because they deserve a staff that cares. I just really can’t let it all fall on my shoulder’s anymore. I’ve brought these issues up and they always improve for a couple weeks and then quickly come back. I’m feeling so guilty right now because this place really has made me stronger and supported me through some hard times. I just can’t keep working around the clock for no compensation and still get walked all over. 

I really don’t feel like I’m wrong for planning to leave, but every time I even try to talk about it with someone it feels like my tongue swells up and I have to hold back tears. I feel absolutely ridiculous right now."

Last year I took 2 courses (HTML/CSS/Javascript and Java for mobile app dev) that I was really engaged in. Since then I have: tried to practice more Web and Mobile dev, started a personal website project , and completed a 50-hour internship with my university's Systems and Network Admin.

Over this past winter break, I took some time to submit my resume to several companies. One had asked for a coding interview with content that was way beyond my skill set.

I do not believe that the projects I worked on in both courses nor the one I've made shows any reasonable skill level needed to be hired for an entry position, but I am still passionate for the general field of IT.

I am completing my undergraduate degree in May with great academic scores, with no job lined up.

There are a few cyber internships going but they're very few and very competitive so I can't really get my hopes up too much.

On the other hand I've been offered to do a internship at a small software company. They are offering both placements for the Sysadmin side of things, and Software Engineering, and would be happy for me to do whichever I am more interested in.

If I were to pick between these, which would be best given my career goals? On one hand Sysadmin is more relevant to cyber security from what I know, but I also know that it's more on the IT side of things while I'm studying CS - so would a software engineering role be more valuable experience/aligned with my degree?

I am still definitely interested in software engineering even if I want to go into cyber in the future, and I haven't done a single internship or work placement before now so I want to gain the best experience I can while I have the opportunity.

Here's where I'm at so far:

1) My long-term career goal is to become a high-level leader in digital health, ideally a mental health tech startup/unicorn (think Spring Health, Brightline, MindMed, Cerebral, etc). This is a hypothesis though, which is why I am using consulting to test it while building a generalist toolkit and possibly stumbling upon other areas I might want to pursue too. 

2) So far from what I understand, McKinsey seems to be the favorite among large traditional healthcare players, and generally puts out more research on healthcare in the US and globally. However, Bain SF also has strong general US healthcare presence, and a rapidly expanding growth equity practice that invests often in health-tech unicorns. I'm unsure if I stand to benefit more from McKinsey's breadth of opportunity/resources (especially if I end up liking something else better than mental health tech/digital health), or from Bain's direct access to my interests.

3) I am attracted to Bain's people, culture, and focus on work-life balance - I worry that at McKinsey SF I'm unlikely to have strong social life with my coworkers, or might get run ragged by travel/hours. 

4) That said, I'm impressed by McKinsey's stronger global influence and prestige advantage but slightly intimidated by their people and culture - I think with McKinsey I would be ""rising to the challenge"" whereas at Bain I'd likely feel more comfortable and authentic.

Really hoping some of you can share words of wisdom - thank you!"

I applied to several trading firm positions within the last month (e.g. a junior quant trader, a junior quant strategist, and a junior quant trading intern).  


For the junior quant trader position, I received an email to take an assessment (first stage of interview). I took it before the said deadline, but was emailed nearly a week later that it had expired. I then emailed recruitment (using the same email that was sent to me over the expired assessment) and said I completed it but have not heard anything back. I also contacted someone from recruitment on LinkedIn (about a week prior) and did not hear back.  


Analogously, for the strategist role, I emailed recruitment when I got an email saying the coding assessment expired (when I received the email it said there was a due date for the assessment, but was never shown on this assessment, so I emailed recruitment and never heard back. This is a lesson for me to take any assessment asap if there is no deadline).  


Finally, I was emailed about not being able to do the trader internship because I am a recent graduate. This was received prior to the two assessments that were ""expired"" (one I took, and the other I did not)  


I have been in contact with a junior trader at the firm, recently asked him for his input, and am awaiting to hear back from him. I also sent an email and a message on LinkedIn to two recruiters (one being the same one that told me I could not do the trader internship), but have not heard back since a week ago for one of them and recently asked another.  


Am I doing too much work or being a nuisance? I have communicated as much as I can, but feel like I am out of luck. All assessments can be extended from miscommunication or some issue going on on my end, but when I reach out I do not hear from anybody back. Any advice/guidance would be kindly appreciated!  


  
TLDR: I applied to several Quant positions at a trading firm and have communicated how two positions I applied to had expired exams (for the first round of interviews) even though I took one (before its deadline) and then asked when the deadline was for the other assessment within the same 24-hour window of receiving it. After contacting two recruiters via email and LinkedIn, I have not heard anything back."

I have a bachelor of science in Biology from a state college that I graduated from in 2017

I work 32 hours/week at a healthcare job that's unrelated to computer science

my goal is to establish a career as a software engineer or full stack web developer

**Reasons why I'm considering OMSCS:**

Pros:

* cost-effective, with my tuition reimbursement I'll essentially be able to attend for free
* I already have a bachelors degree in a science field
* I love academia and I'll be very motivated to buckle down and put in the time
* If I complete this degree, I'll definitely get interviews
* If my resume states that I'm in the program, maybe it will help land me an internship?

Cons:

* I probably have less coding experience than the average OMSCS student

**Reasons why I'm considering Oregon State's Online Computer Science Postbac Degree:**

Pros:

* It will strengthen my coding foundations
* the program is geared toward students looking for a career change

Cons: 

* the program is $527 per credit and I will need to complete 45 credits (assuming I can transfer 15 CS credits over from my associates degree)
* I will have to take out a private loan to afford this, and I already owe $60,000 in student loans from my previous undergrad

**Other options:**

part-time bootcamp (some you don't have to pay back until you establish a career in the field)

Apply for internships after I finish my associates of CS degree (I feel like it will be hard to get accepted with my current resume) while working on personal projects

The project I'm on has been started already and I have a bunch of C-like C++ code I have to read through and understand.  I'm working my way through it, but the problem is that I keep ending up down rabbit holes -- I Google a keyword or whatever that I'm unfamiliar with, then the explanations use other terms/concepts I'm unfamiliar with, so I start looking them up, and so on until I barely remember what I was trying to understand at the beginning.  

I've asked several colleagues for advice about this, one of whom said not to worry about going down rabbit holes and the other two encouraged me to focus more on the function names and not worry so much about the details of the code.  The problem is that I don't _like_ going down so many rabbit holes because I feel like I'm just wasting time.  I've tried to take the other advice and focus more on the big picture of what the code is supposed to do overall, but a. I have a hard time ignoring details that explain how the code actually works and b. I sometimes can't understand even the big picture without a lot of Googling.  

To be clear, I know there's nothing wrong with Googling stuff I'm unfamiliar with to help me understand and that it's actually encouraged.  My issue is that I don't know when to _stop_ Googling stuff, when to decide that I'm getting too much into the weeds, because I don't know what knowledge will end up being useful later on, and because it just bugs me to not reach the level of understanding I wanted to make the concept feel intuitive.

My day to day functions are leading designs in CAD, meeting with municipality stakeholders, cost estimation, mentoring junior engineers/interns and performing technical writing for specifications. Its not a bad job at all, my issue is that I'm absolutely bored of my mind and the fact there's pretty much nothing that I need to really learn to continue climbing the ladder is pretty terrifying because I love learning new skills to apply to my work and feel my brain atrophying without the constant mental stimulation.


I’ve been thinking a lot about what I want and I realized I did enjoy programming  from my studies and I was even an undergrad TA for our programming course. So I’ve been working a bit on self studying python and am currently finishing coursework in data structures, analysis of algorithms and computer architecture at a community college this semester. I have already completed intro to programming and discrete math. I do enjoy structured learning to nail down the fundamentals and the formal coursework will be a boost on applications for a masters program (looking at OMSCS, ASU online MCS and UIUC online MCS). I would also like to have ability to intern.

When it comes to school choice, I can pretty much be positive I’ll get into ASU, the advantages are that it’ll be one of the quicker ones to complete and the cost is right in the center at 15k, but without the name recognition of UIUC/GaTech. I’m about 90% sure I’ll get into OMSCS, they have the most class options, are the most affordable and have great name recognition, only downside it’s the longest to complete. UIUC is the most competitive to get into of these online options, probably has the best name recognition and is the most expensive at 22k. It’ll take probably the same amount of time to complete as ASU but also has the least varied options for software engineering classes. 

Overall from what I know about myself now, my career goal is to get into backend software engineering. I’d love to try to land an internship and plan on spending this summer grinding leetcode/building a project to make that a possibility. Ideally I’d like to get a full time while in graduate school if that’s a possibility as well, which could change the calculus of this decision.

sdef8q,6,2022-01-26,How would you create a board game backend?,lilplop,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/sdef8q/how_would_you_create_a_board_game_backend/,"Hello,

I'm currently working on a side project which is building a board game online that you can play with friends. In my head, I thought about representing the board game's state in a backend system, and my frontend would display the board game, the users would interact with the board game in their browser (which manipulates the state), and at the end of the turn, the frontend would pass the interactions back to the backend.

To give some context, I've worked at a few jobs and internships where I've mainly been on the backend side of things -- passing data around and exposing data through REST APIs using Sprint Boot. For this project, I'm currently using a library called p5.js (a simple graphics library in plain JS) to render the board game graphics. I have modeled the board game in Java, and I was planning on exposing the state of the board game through a backend with some endpoints that my front end could call.

However, now that I think about this model, it doesn't seem to make sense why I would have a backend for the board game's state in the first place. In this loop, it doesn't seem like my backend is doing anything at all -- because if my frontend had the model of the game, I could just ""play"" the game on the client side. That way, I would avoid a bunch of network calls to my backend.

I'm finding it counterintuitive to keep a backend to represent the state when it could all be done client-side.

In this case, how would you design a backend for this type of problem? Would you even have one to represent the board game's state, or would you have it all be frontend? Perhaps there is some fundamental misunderstanding I'm having with separating out frontend and backend.

Thanks!"

 But the thing is, i one day hope to leave mother Africa and find a decent paying job outside of here. Anyways after some thorough researching i have found that becoming a Full-Stack Engineer might be the best option for me, as it seems to me right now to be a good entry point and later on if i want i can pivot into more specific areas like just focus on the databases and become a database administrator. Conveniently i also do enjoy both working the front and back-end and enjoy watching the ""big picture"" come into reality.

So my questions are:

1. Is this area over saturated abroad? Im looking into going to the US/Canada or Europe. Since i do have double nationality from a EU country, it would actually make the most sense there since i wont have Visa issues, i think.
2. If you are a Full-Stack Engineer(or someone that hires them) how would you go about honing your skills? For reference my skills in terms of front-end include:HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery React and Bootstrap. As for back-end: Java, SQL, PHP, worked with MySQL and OracleSQL for DB's and im pretty native to working with Linux. If you also think there is something in this list that i need to double down my learning on, feel free to mention.
3. If by some chance there is someone who has done what im trying to do( get a decent paying job abroad, especially from Africa, but anywhere is welcomed of course), how did you do it, and what would you recommend to someone trying to do the same, what are some of the roadblocks that i should be aware of?

Right now i still need to finish my thesis and internship, maybe i need to get a job here first to get some experience before i become somewhat appealing. So even tough im still far away from my goal, im a planner and i believe that the sooner you start the better.

Currently sitting with a Cybersecurity degree, Security+ cert and 2 years work experience in a network security role. 

No job at the moment and will likely not get one before I leave. All of my work experience has been through internships with various roles so I haven't found a specific role I want to focus on. (but I know it will be in the network security realm)

My current plan is to learn Python and review Security+ topics. I have no idea what the Internet situation will be like but I am assuming it will be nonexistent or very limited. I will have my personal laptop so what do you think I should load on it now assuming whatever I put on it now will be what I have for a year?"
sdgqd5,5,2022-01-26,PEY Experience/Advice at IBM (or other companies) for an incoming intern,crazyr303,UofT,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/sdgqd5/pey_experienceadvice_at_ibm_or_other_companies/,"I've gotten an offer for Front End Developer Intern at IBM and AR Developer Intern at a company called ModiFace, and have to decide which to accept by tomorrow. Both are very similar salaries, IBM is for 16 months in Markham, ModiFace 12 months in Toronto. ModiFace will be a more convenient commute for me if they return to in-person work but is a smaller company with less room to grow. The people who interviewed me at ModiFace were very nice, and it seemed like I would be doing important and interesting work.

IBM has a bigger name, which comes with pros and cons. It will definitely look better on a resume, but the corporate experience there might be harsher, and my primary worry is that as an intern I will be delegated with mundane tasks like fixing code defects, QA (running tests), administrative work, etc. because they won't trust me with the ""real"" work (i.e. feature development). If that happens for a 16-month period I will get very burnt out. But if the internship goes well, the additional 4 months would be good for more pay and experience. At this point, I'm leaning towards IBM because I'm hoping since the title is ""Front End Developer"" they will give me front-end work, but it wasn't completely clear during the interview. Or maybe this will be an issue with both companies, so it won't really matter, and since IBM is a larger company and it's a longer internship, I will be able to move up in my role or switch teams if I get stuck with boring work in the beginning. 

Do any of you have any advice or experience you would like to share at your PEY (it would be especially helpful if you had it with either company)? As I said, I'm leaning towards IBM at the moment, but I've flipped between them quite a bit for the last two days. I've read reviews on Glassdoor on both companies, and both seem to have their own flaws, ModiFace with poor management, and IBM with sporadic experiences between different teams and interns being tasked with mundane work."

I joined Google's quantum computing division this year as an intern because I heard from a college friend of mine that It would provide cool shit to put on my transcript, so of course I joined. Got literally nothing out of it, and just taught all of their engineers and computer scientists the science required to scale production of quantum computers.

That was the catalyst to me falling down the extracurricular rabbit hole come late October last year, the catalyst to my great realization this year.

Every year in highschool I feel has taught me a great lesson. Freshman year taught me to work harder, sophomore year taught me that life wasn't fair, Junior year taught me how to love someone, and Senior year taught me that well, I’m a background character, and that’s ok.

Why is that? Because I didn't cure cancer like all the degenerates on chanceme? Because I don't have anything published? Is it because I’m not legacy? Is it because I didnt stumble across these subs when I was in fucking middleschool and then prompty planned out meticulously the next six years of my life? No, it’s because of a greater overarching essence of who I am, covid proved that to me.

Over the quarantine, I was in my own little bubble. Older sibling in prison, both parents stuck in Guantanamo, and I was literally starving on the streets while attempting to attend my online classes. No knowledge on colleges asides for “have good grades”.

And what did I do with all that extra time? Nothing but the things that brought me pleasure. Like making 3d model commissions and discovering fossils of entirely new species of dinosaurs, published two books (that received millions in sales), and proved P=NP, just my basic interests/hobbies. I never inspired change, except for when I did, I never started anything. In my own little bubble, disconnected from the rat race that is collegeapps, I showed off who I really am deep down inside. I am a below-average student.

So as much as I could go back in my memories and think “man, i should've started a club of 5 people, I should’ve started a nonprofit that I could abandon after high school, blah blah blah”. I know that I wouldn’t have genuinely enjoyed doing so. Because this moment of clarity has taught me that all these things stem back to the same problem. **I’m simply a follower, not a leader**, and I never will be. And the sooner I can accept that, the sooner I can get back to living life normally.

As I glance to my side I see the Pulitzer Prize I won in middle school, I’m constantly reminded of the kid I used to be. I was a kid with dreams of being an artist. I was a kid who found pride in my own work, rather than the pathetic wannabe overachiever I’ve become, chasing these silly things like Nobel Prizes that I know I’m just not cut out for.

So fucking what I got my 1650 SAT, and my 5.4 GPA, I only ever studied my ass off because my friends inspired me to do so. These stupid fucking numbers took away my dreams man. I wasted my time trying to become someone that I’m not, and that’s not going to change as I inevitably take computer science at my safety college, MIT. Sure I could always change my major and pursue my true passions of art and natural sciences, maybe become that zoologist/paleoartist I’ve always dreamed to be but I know I fucking won't. I know that CS pays bills and that I’ve done the bare minimum of having good grades to get a decently paying job that I’m not passionate about and fade into the background.

I know I won't pursue my true passions because I’m not the kind of person to take risks, to make a name for myself out there. Because at the end of the day, I’m a follower, not a leader."

My main concern is how often I see that internships are essentially a must if you want to be successful. I currently have my own place and work a full-time day job (Access Rep at a local hospital, so nothing that would assist me with landing a job in the tech field) and bartend on Saturdays and I am financially stable doing what I’m doing. I could go to school in the evenings but I fear I would have to quit my day job in order to do an internship which I unfortunately could not afford to do, not only because of pay but also because of my benefits. With this being the case, is it practical for me to pursue a degree in either of these fields? Does anyone know of any routes that would help me land a position without an internship?

In particular, while I am aware of Two Sigma's interesting problems and modern tech stack (relative to other firms like it), I am concerned that Two Sigma is not as well known in recruiter circles, and that Meta likely has a much larger pool of connections.

A year ago I was absolutely destroyed, I applied to hundreds of companies, did tens of OAs, had a few interviews and I failed all of them. Of the hundreds of companies only a few got back to me and I bombed absolutely all of them, from big to small (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Ebay, Paypal and hundreds of other companies). 

I was absolutely destroyed, I had dedicated so much time to Leetcode, to watching hundreds of tutorials online, I had read even more articles. Nothing worked, I felt inadecuate, I felt like I was just not good enough, I had even thought of changing majors. I failed so many OA that I can't even keep track, and each failed interview was more soul crushing that the last, I wasn't even accepted into GSOC, which was my last alternative, and I spent my summer in a melancolic state.

Still I decided not to give up, I got an internship at a very small startup near me, I worked on some other projects and left Leetcode for a while to reignite my passion for coding.

When this recruiting season arrived, I decided to once again try my best. I couldn't even get into the Final Round the last two seasons but I didn't want to give up. I grinded Leetcode (in a much MUCH smarter way), and used all of the lessons from my previous failures in order to give a better performance this go around.

Yesterday I finally got the internship offers from two very big companies (one being Microsoft). This might not mean much to those people who get 10 offers but to me it meant the world.

In short, I just wanted to tell everyone that is reading this to never give up, I know how hard it feels, and I know how sometimes you just wish to give up, but take a step back, relax and try your best next time and I'm sure you can do it.

Grad applications will open in the next couple of months.

I'm just contemplating if it's worth doing an additional ""honours year"" which has more advanced subjects and a long thesis project. In Australia and some parts of EU degrees are generally 3 years long but you have the option to gradate with a honours degree that takes another year.

My impression is that it will be easiest to break into these tiers of companies as a graduate, and that it will be harder to break into a good company if I've only worked at average companies.

I've also noticeably grew into a better developer over this past year so expect that I will be able to grow significantly more by doing another year.

A bit about me:

I have a few projects that are are thousands of lines of code but nothing in the  10,000+ range. I've done decently in a few hackathons  and an average of 79%. I've also done an internship at a start-up.

If I take another year then I will have the opportunity to help develop a huge software project with accouple other students. Also being able to do some more advanced computing subjects, have the opportunity to explore research and maybe land a TA job.

sdu9ek,3,2022-01-27,Are paid traineeships worth it?,TrickyDistribution2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/sdu9ek/are_paid_traineeships_worth_it/,"Hey everyone, first a little bit of history for context. I'm 26 right now, and 2 years ago I finished a game development degree. in the first two years of the degree, we messed around with different languages like action Script, web devstack(HTML, js, CSS, JSON ), python, etc etc. exploring programming concepts within them. eventually, somewhere in the second year, I decided to stick with unity and c# as my preferred choice, because it was the most comfortable to use for me and also because it was the most supported set of tools supported by the teachers in case I had questions

what I mean to say is that I think I know most of the basics of coding and some advanced concepts, but still have many holes in my knowledge about coding as the result of some concepts not being very prominent in game development (at least not on the scale I experienced). the concepts in question are networking, databases, LINQ, automated tests and security, among other things which I can't name from the top of my head.   


now the thing is, game dev jobs aren't paid as well as software development jobs here, it makes about a 1k a month difference. if not, much more depending on the company.  


now I've been thinking about following a bachelor (cs / .net degree) to expand upon my skillset and catch up on the things I've missed that'd make my skills more suitable for 'normal / business' software development. but as I've been looking around for jobs I've also come across paid traineeships that take in total 2 years with an admittedly fairly meagre (relatively) salary of 2.5k, whereas I see job listings for unity/c# work (creating VR/AR/mobile apps, not games) for around 3-3.5k. but I feel like if do that I'd be kind of skewing my skill set more and more in the direction I'm already in, that said many companies provide free training for new skills, so I could try and convince staff that getting .NET training would be useful and learn it on the job I imagine.  


that said, getting a unity based job would require me to do a bunch of prep work, which could take me at least a few months. and I definitely won't immediately be picking up .NET on the job from the get-go, first comes integrating into the team, etc, etc. and although I potentially could, I doubt I'll be wanting to spend a lot of my free time learning .NET. I've got other hobbies too like making music, and or playing video and board games with friends. the entry point for this route is also quite a bit higher. and I'm not sure the tradeoff is worth it if I can do a paid traineeship 'right away' with a salary that I'd be completely happy with for the two-year duration, after which, I imagine I can either negotiate for more pay or start applying elsewhere. but I'm a bit worried about the practicality of these traineeships, for example, are there any red flags I need to look out for? or are there any scummy practices I should know off? it seems a bit 'too good to be true' when I hear of the unpaid internships happenings that are going around.  


and then there's always the option to pay for a bachelor's degree which would at least take about 3 years to finish. this is admittedly the most unappealing option to me, but if there's any good reason for picking this route, I'll consider it.  


Thank you!"

Any help is incredibly welcome.

&amp;#x200B;

At the moment, I'm 22 and still finishing my final year of University. At the same time, I work as a Junior UI Artist in one of the largest game development studios out there. I was incredibly lucky to get in, and after 3 months of low-pay internship, I was taken in as a Junior UI Artist. 

I've been in this position for 6 months, and have my name on some pretty huge projects, as well as developing several small indie games of my own, where I worked as a team leader with dozens of people.

The work environment is genuinely wonderful, despite what you might hear, maybe because it's an Eastern-European branch of the studio, and I LOVE working here, but the pay is godawful, like 1000$ a month in a city where rent is 4-500$ (bills NOT included, which are another 100$).

That being said, I think just having the studio on my CV makes me stand out a considerable amount, and the experience I've gained is insane.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to the topic at hand, I recently got a job offer from a much smaller London-based studio (50-200 employees according to glassdoor), for a SENIOR UI Artist position which is very well paid, to my standards at least.

I would have to relocate and move across Europe to London, and work in a Senior position with a limited amount of professional experience (though quite a bit of personal experience, and a 4-year education directly connected to the role).

I have no idea what to do... I feel like leaving the studio I'm currently working at after only 6 months would be a bad career decision (even if it's a good financial one), but the studio I'd be moving to isn't too small either.  
One thing I'm considering is that, if I'm getting these kinds of offers now, I'll be getting them in a year as well, so there's no need to rush, I should stay where I am for 1-2 years at least; but on the other hand, could this just be a stroke of luck? an opportunity I shouldn't miss? 

Anyway, any kind of advice is much appreciated, cheers!"

But I landed my dream job with really good pay and I could drop out of my masters and just work there instead, but then I will have to give up my Europe Visa and go back to India(which I love but want to stay out for a few years), so please evaluate the idea of dropping out from the current program, going for the job, and then apply to USA or Canada courses in next intake, where the opportunities for later are compatible with current pay.

&amp;#x200B;

Dear fellow sufferers, please help a poor soul out, it's too overwhelming of a decision for me to take without any guidance! 

Today I gave the last exam of the 1st year of my Master in Artificial Intelligence(2 year course). I am certain that I will fail a few(I don't know, I simply cannot study for an exam, not made for it, I love research though!) and will have to take a whole year more(so 3 years total) to complete those credits. Additionally, the next semester, had I completed the credits would be an internship and later defending a thesis. Now the thing is each year's tuition fee is 17K Euros, and living expenses will make it double at 34K Euros! And as I am from India, the currency conversion makes this tuition fee quite ridiculous.

Now the twist here is that I recently received a full-time offer from an early stage SF startup for my dream Applied and Research work. The pay is quite nice: USD 140-150K base for remote work which I can start very soon. Further, I am sure I will never receive this kind of money in Europe until 3 or 4 later(with my 1 YOE, pay cap would be 80K Euro base here), so no point in living in high-cost Europe :/

Please bear with me, because here is the conflict - I could drop out of my current Master's program, and reapply to Canada or USA, mainly for two reasons - I dearly want to specialize in something more niched in AI, i.e. Computational Linguistics because of my fascination for languages. And that will also give me high-paying clients and I won't have to wait 3-4 years in Europe to wait for that max cap of \~85K Euros to be removed. But again I have previously been rejected by Canadian universities, so there is an uncertainty there.

sebdzl,0,2022-01-27,Masters A.I. - Stay an extra year to complete or pursue a dream high-paying offer? Please help!,lilhandpump,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/sebdzl/masters_ai_stay_an_extra_year_to_complete_or/,"TLDR: I will have to take an extra year in my master's with a high tuition fee and expenses(in Europe) because I fucked up my exams - making it a total of 3 years(currently one year in). But I landed my dream job with really good pay and I could drop out of my masters and just work there instead, but then I will have to give up my Europe Visa and go back to India(which I love but want to stay out for a few years), so please evaluate the idea of dropping out from the current program, going for the job, and then apply to USA or Canada courses in next intake, where the opportunities for later are compatible with current pay.

&amp;#x200B;

Dear fellow sufferers, please help a poor soul out, it's too overwhelming of a decision for me to take without any guidance! 

Today I gave the last exam of the 1st year of my Master in Artificial Intelligence(2 year course). I am certain that I will fail a few(I don't know, I simply cannot study for an exam, not made for it, I love research though!) and will have to take a whole year more(so 3 years total) to complete those credits. Additionally, the next semester, had I completed the credits would be an internship and later defending a thesis. Now the thing is each year's tuition fee is 17K Euros, and living expenses will make it double at 34K Euros! And as I am from India, the currency conversion makes this tuition fee quite ridiculous.

Now the twist here is that I recently received a full-time offer from an early stage SF startup for my dream Applied and Research work. The pay is quite nice: USD 140-150K base for remote work which I can start very soon. Further, I am sure I will never receive this kind of money in Europe until 3 or 4 later(with my 1 YOE, pay cap would be 80K Euro base here), so no point in living in high-cost Europe :/

Please bear with me, because here is the conflict - I could drop out of my current Master's program, and reapply to Canada or USA, mainly for two reasons - I dearly want to specialize in something more niched in AI, i.e. Computational Linguistics because of my fascination for languages. And that will also give me high-paying clients and I won't have to wait 3-4 years in Europe to wait for that max cap of \~85K Euros to be removed. But again I have previously been rejected by Canadian universities, so there is an uncertainty there.

So my options are - 

1. Quit the current program -&gt; Go back home and save some money -&gt; Apply for another more interesting program in higher-paying locations(might or might not be selected).

2. Continue program -&gt; Won't be able to take the job for full time -&gt; High tuition fee -&gt; Max pay cap limited -&gt; Go back home( I love home, but would like to live outside for a few years).

I just recently got offered a position within a F500 tech company. I was ecstatic to hear this news; I dropped out of Highschool and haven't started attending college yet, so I was very enthusiastic to accept as working with technology has been my dream.  


However, the position that I applied for deals as a Technical Sales Rep for backend servers and services. I'm not going to lie, I slightly misunderstood the position I'd be applying for and it seems to be more on the sales side and less on the technical side.  


 I'm planning on starting college this year for CS. My end goal would be some sort of programming dev or something similar.

Being new to the workforce, I'm curious as to what experience is deemed as positive when searching for jobs in CS. How long should I stick with this job (which has a very good base pay/benefits) and when should I look into an internship?   


To add some context, my company supports lateral movement throughout; my stress comes from if I'd be in a better position for my career dropping this as soon as I can find an applicable internship or not. Thanks for any advice!"
sedr7r,1,2022-01-27,How can I convince my boyfriend avoiding sleep is not the answer to cope with his nightmares?,sesnirp,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/sedr7r/how_can_i_convince_my_boyfriend_avoiding_sleep_is/,"So my (f/25) boyfriend (m/33) has had an increase in nightmares due to childhood trauma regarding his parents.He is starting therapy to deal with it but he has been waiting for it to take off for quite some time. In the meantime these nightmares are seriously interrupting his sleep including mine and now he has gotten to the point where often he doesn't even want to sleep when he is completely sleepdeprived. Sometimes the reason is that he doesn't want to drag me along in sleeping problems, but mostly it's about avoiding his nightmares. 

He hasn't slept at all last night and only 2 hours during the day and I asked him earlier this night to please come sleep with me. It would be the first time in days and the perfect moment to at least fix his sleeping time a bit since he has gone completely nocturnal. I'm convinced this only messes with how well he is able to sleep even more. Though he claimed he was not tired (more like exhausted)I was really hoping for a little improvement and even bought supplements like melatonin and 5 htp for serotonin in hopes for more relaxation and sleepiness during the night.He told me he has been like this before at a time were his nightmares were also this bad and I know shortly after that he was left completely burned out. I fear his lack of sleep may have caused that and for now it's not looking great.

Tonight I got ready to sleep at 00:30 because I catched up on some work for my internship and I really wanted to finish and don't have to get up early. He then said he was hungry and not tired anymore since an hour ago and told me he was waiting for me and that I should have just gone to bed at a normal time. I would feel aweful if that's the reason he is going to stay awake for hours or even the whole night again with that little sleep. I'm at loss with how to convince him that he needs to sleep despite the nightmares because sleeping badly is at least better then not sleeping at all. If tonight would have been an improvement only because I would have invited him to go to bed with me sooner it would have been the first chance in weeks that I missed! Have any of you dealt with ptsd related nightmares, or loved ones who suffered from trauma in this way? What helps in this situation besides therapy?"

I recently accepted an offer to work full-time at a tech company starting end of March. Previously, I accepted a full-time offer at a bank as well to start mid-February, however I prefer to work for the tech company. My options are as follows:

1. Renege the bank and start the tech company in two months. This is a bit late of a start date for me because I graduated last month so I'm free for a couple months. I wanted to push the start date forward, but the tech company said no. However, I have the following concerns:

* I am worried it would look bad in terms of company relationships because I am reneging so close to the start date, and if I would get blacklisted. Although I am not sure if I would work for the bank in the future.
* I am a little bit broke and moving to my work location in about a month, so I would be paying rent/paying the prices of that location for a month. My parents can loan me money, but I feel bad.
* I would lose out on software development/career experience for about a month. Not sure how valuable this would be though.
* On a lesser note: my friend who referred me would also lose their referral bonus.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Start at the bank for a couple months, and push back the tech company start date. However, I have the following concerns here as well:

* I feel I would be essentially wasting my time in terms of career growth, because I don't think I can work at the bank for a couple months and then put it on my resume. Although I'd get some amount of software development/career experience, as well as money?
   * On a secondary note, the tech company has a notorious firing culture that I am worried about. If I were to switch companies again it might seem as if I keep changing jobs every couple months?
* I feel I would be wasting the company's time, because I would be working at the bank for a couple months, take up their training time, and then leave.
* Not sure how awkward it would be to tell my manager: ""hey, nice working with you briefly, I'm leaving."" But this might look better in terms of company relationships than reneging?

I am in the interview process for this spring internship that if I were to get, I would definitely take that and push back the tech company's start date. However that is TBD. Thoughts on what I should do?"

sehdz1,7,2022-01-27,"Need Advice/Suggestions: First Year forced resignation, offered to stay if I take on more responsibilities",sleepyecho,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/sehdz1/need_advicesuggestions_first_year_forced/,"Buckle in, friends, because we’re about to go on a truly wild ride.
Disclaimers upfront: I’m in Texas where if we strike we lose our certification, so I don’t have access to a union.

In January 2021, I was hired on an intern certificate, with the expectation that I would complete my certification training within a year, to teach 9th grade English. 

Well, my first semester of teaching was a truly unmitigated disaster: we were hybrid, all of the students who ended up being mine had been on at least one other teacher’s roster, in April there was a gun threat and our campus was on lockdown for 8+ hours, I was poorly managing untreated depression and anxiety [and undiagnosed ADHD, but more on that later], I had no idea how to lesson plan, no idea how to read the district curriculum, I had to drag myself to work every morning, when I came home I immediately napped, I couldn’t participate in household chores [the household is just me and my fiancé and a cat]: I was exhausted and drowning. Needless to say, I didn’t get around to working on completing my remaining certification requirements.

I spent the summer getting back into therapy and resuming medication for my depression and anxiety. I hung out with friends, went to baseball games, traveled a bit, and used the time to generally get my head back on before the next school year.

The new school year started off well. I was happy to have students for an entire year and see their growth, I agreed to sponsor anime club where students just come to my classroom after school two days a week and watch movies, I made the concerted effort to reach out to my English I team and department, and just seek out ways I could be more present with my students and coworkers. Then the stresses of still not knowing how to read curriculum, still not knowing how to lesson plan, still not knowing how to ask for the help I needed. My relationship really suffered and I was withdrawing from my fiancé, I stopped eating dinner with him, I stopped talking with him, and was upset because he didn’t see an issue with our dead bedroom [yes, I lurk in the sub]. I started drinking more, although I never really drank in the first place. By the time we got around to the week before winter break, I was burnt out. I effectively stopped teaching and had “intervention” days where I let students complete make-up and late work while I was trying to run out the clock. The last two days before winter break, which were half days, I had panic attacks in my classroom after everyone left. 

In December, my therapist asked if I had ADHD. I told her no, I’m just super disorganized and can’t focus on long tasks for too long, or complete chores in a timely manner, and I can’t manage my time, and I frequently forget things, and have difficulty completing assignments and tasks in a timely manner… She asked me to get tested next time I saw my psychiatrist. So, this meant that I got through my first year of teaching, and grad school in my content area all with undiagnosed inattentive ADHD. I started taking medication to help me with my newly named ADHD. I also created a block calendar with all of my appointments and responsibilities so that I could see where I had free time to start getting… anything done. 

My therapist also asked me what my plan was to not burn out again. I told her that I was going to start asking for specific help, start integrating technology into my lessons, making a conscious effort to stay organized and caught-up with my responsibilities, and be gentle with myself because teaching is notorious for eating its young.

I had a good winter break with my fiancé and got to hang out with my brother, who came home from a few years abraod, goofed off with friends, read some books. I was looking forward to starting the spring semester.

The semester started off really well. I expressed to my team lead my need for organization to cope with my ADHD and how I wanted to be more part of the team rather than on the sidelines. She responded by having our PLC much more collaborative and structured, I felt like I was contributing to the team, and actually a part of the 9th grade English team. I was feeling great and like I was finally getting a hold on things. 

Then all of my unfinished cert stuff came back to pull the rug out from under me.

Last Wednesday I was forced to resign because I was in violation of my contract since I didn’t get my necessary projects done in time. I was told that I needed to have all of my stuff removed from my classroom by Thursday morning. My mom and the AP teacher next door helped me completely empty my room and take all of my stuff home in under four hour. All of this triggered a severe depression spiral where I had to put measures in place to keep me safe [I’m okay now]. I made an appointment with a mental health facility to get information about extensive out-patient group therapy for Thursday afternoon. Before I left for my appointment, I got a call from my district’s HR asking if I would like to stay on at my school but in a different level. I said yes, I would like to but I needed at least the rest of the week off to calm down. 

I immediately started feeling better because it meant that I still had income, and health insurance, my coworkers, and my movie club. At my appointment, the facility actually processed me as in-patient, without ever notifying me at end point, and refused to let me leave despite me being a danger to no one. I was forced to stay the weekend at the facility, where I caught COVID [didn’t test positive until yesterday], and had to convince a judge and attorney general over zoom that I was in fact stable and seeking treatment for my condition [I will be filing a complaint against the hospital and staff. I can give more details in the comments if anyone wants it].

I left the facility on Monday afternoon and set up a meeting on Tuesday morning with my Principal (who has never spoken to me once), and my Assistant Principal/direct supervisor who made me resign the previous week. At the meeting, I explained all of the above to my Principal [AP already knew everything because she and I actually have a good relationship and I trust her]. She expressed concerns that I was clearly not motivated the past year [which is true] and then presented me with others’ mostly negative assessment of my professional practices. I told the Principal that those others never said anything like that to me and that I had been working with them to get a better hold on how to actually do my job. 

The Principal then said that all they had to offer me was 12th grade English because Thursday they put a new hire in my old classroom with my old classes. Just as I had verbally agreed to teach seniors, the Principal said that the position would also have to teach the two sections total of the journalism and yearbook classes. Without thinking and wanting to save any remnant of my job, I verbally agreed to the journalism and yearbook sections.

My therapist put me on a 14-day minimum FMLA to process all the work chaos and all the garbage that happened with the hospital. During this time, she and I agreed that I would take one week to finish my cert stuff and one week to rest. I’m about halfway done with my cert stuff now and my FMLA started yesterday, so I’m no longer worried about getting those things done. That mess is being dealt with.

Here’s where I need help. 

I went from having one prep in a level I sort-of taught the previous year, with six section, one conference period, and one PLC period to having two preps neither of which I have ever taught before, and I’m not even journalism certified. I will still have a conference, but the 12th grade English common conference is 8th period and my new conference period is 6th.

I’m concerned that because I’m still trying to learn the ins and outs of teaching my own content area, I will be unable to get what needs to be done for journalism and yearbook. I also will no longer have a designated time each day with my new 12th grade team, a thing that directly tied to me finally feeling like I had a hold on things.

With yearbook taking up so much of my time, I may even have to step down as sponsor of anime club. This crushes me more than anything else because the club was a place for the weird kids to be weird together and my only real responsibilities was to make sure we had accurate attendance to keep track of the kids.

I requested a phone conference with my AP tomorrow to make sure I understand everything that’s expected of me and to express my very real and valid worry about burning out again. I want to be a team player and I want to show that I am learning and I am motivated to do and be better. It seems, however, that this new role will burn me for good."

My questions are:

What is the minimum number/quality of projects to land a remote job/internship interview?

What projects should I add/remove to increase my chances without wasting much time?

I plan to do an r/place clone in order to learn web development, should I replace one of the above projects with this one or not? Maybe add it to them?

What kind of companies will most likely accept me? 

Can I land a FAANG interview or maybe shouldn't get my hopes up?

I was a student in MIT Global Teaching Lab last year, should i put this in my resume?

I like solving algorithmic questions and I can solve LC hards with an average of 30 min/question (except Computational geometry ones which take a bit longer), should I participate in more programming competitions to improve my chances or would it be a waste of time?

I am finishing my last year of engineering study (mechanical engineering) and I am doing my second internship as a Lean engineering. My goal is to be one day Plant Manager in the automotive sector in Eastern Europe (and maybe get an even higher position afterwards). I am thinking about doing a master’s in management to get a grasp of the financial side of businesses and to learn more about human resources, logistics and management in general. I have seen one where I can do a dual degree with UC Berkeley’s Industrial Engineering and Operations Research Department with a major in supply chain to be able to supervise the logistic department in the future. After the two degrees my plan is to become production manager in a plant.  Most of the people in the industry have told me that Plant managers are either production manager or logistic manager before becoming Plant manager. During my years as a production manager, I will be able to help the plant manager with my background in business school. It will help me develop my skills so that I can be the perfect candidate to handle a plant one day.

My questions are the following:

\- First, do you think it’s a great strategy? What would you do different?

\- I’m not from the US so my question is: Can I still follow financial and management courses if I take Supply chain systems as my major.

\- What kind of financial courses or economics courses are the most important for my goal?

\- Is it better to do a dual degree with an industrial engineering aspect or should I go for an international business specialization (or other specialization) because I am already an engineer? 

Thank you."

seo8de,2,2022-01-28,Should I stay in Europe or go home?,stayorgonowadvice,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/seo8de/should_i_stay_in_europe_or_go_home/,"Hello,

I am from South America and have been living and studying in an european country for a few years. I'm an orchestral musician and have been looking for employment for a few years already. I have already done internships and had a temporary contract with an orchestra, but getting something permanent is very hard. Not impossible, I think I have a decent chance of finding something somwehere in Europe in the next few years, but it's not a guarantee.

A few months ago I did an audition for an orchestra in my hometown, and just got offered a position. I would need to start in a month, or lose the spot. This is not negotiable because it's a public job, a lot of bureocracy involved.

I did the audition in the hope that I would be offered something in 2-3 years, because I don't feel ready to leave Europe just yet. I still want to improve in my instrument, and really try to get a job here, before deciding if I'd be happier here or there in the long term.

Pros of going:
- very stable job
- great working hours, unlike most european orchestras
- this means a lot of free time, which is one of the most tempting aspects of this
- i would be close to my family
- i could finally ""start my life"", like get a dog, an apartment... i'm already 29 and tired of moving from place to place pretty much every year
- the constant pressure of needing to be practicing at all times because i need to get a job, the uncertainty, it would all be just gone
- being home in the sense of not being an outsider so often, only really belonging with other foreigners. being able to use my native language for everything

Pros of staying:
- if i do get an orchestra job here, they are also very stable
- and they pay in euros, which means a lot more money
- safety. i got way too used to walking around at night with my phone in my hand and not a care in the world, i would really miss this.
- a less ""rational"" pro is that i would miss my friends so so much. they're my family here and leaving so suddenly would break my heart. but they will also not stay forever in the city where we study or in europe, probably in the next couple of years. this happy little family won't be forever.


I know the question is really whether i would be happy here or there in the long term, but I don't have an answer to this yet. I wish i could wait a couple of years to make a decision, but I can't.

I could always just go back later, but there won't be another audition in that orchestra for at least 4 years. Could be 5, could be 15, I don't know. I don't think I would want to go back if it wasn't specifically to my hometown.

Any thoughts on how I should think about this decision? Thank you in advance!"

serzh7,1,2022-01-28,Free bootcamp or Postbacc in CS?,oddrabbithole,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/serzh7/free_bootcamp_or_postbacc_in_cs/,"Hello, I am looking at a couple of options to begin learning how to code: 

1. Free bootcamp

* This is a program called Per Scholas which offers an entirely free and remote bootcamp in software engineering that can be completed in 15 weeks.

2. Postbacc in CS

* This would be done through OSU's program, and would cost me about $30k in loans and take me about 1.5 years to complete.

Some cons to the postbacc is that I would be taking out more loans in addition to my undergraduate loans and that it will take me much longer to complete. On the other hand, I would have the paper. Since the market is so competitive, I wanted to know which might be the best option for me to get my foot in the door in order to receive internships or full time job offers. Should I try out the bootcamp first and see if that gets me anywhere, or plan to get a postbacc regardless? Thank you in advance!"

As the title says, should I quit my Finance Analyst internship? I really don't seem to care about what anyone talks about. I can't really focus on any of the projects. the job itself isn't very difficult. I just really can't stand cleaning data and I couldn't care less about analyzing it. idk the job is remote, chill and in a very good company but I feel like jumping out the window and throwing myself under the first bus I see. I'm majoring in computer science so I thought it wouldn't be a bad move form working in a call center. Now I'm even doubting programming. I kinda just wanna become a gardener and be outside.


or maybe I just need therapy. I've been working remote for 3 yrs. 3rd option is that I could reduce my hours to only 3 days a week and try to get a CS internship. ¯\\__(ツ)_\_/¯

Any advice or criticisms much appreciated!

These guys want to hire 9 out of 14 hires by May, and 3 of the 14 are still juniors in college so that’s pretty good odds. 

However, I already accepted a full time offer for a big 4 starting in summer (and of course the office is right across the street). I haven’t told anyone at my internship (co-workers or supervisors) about this opportunity, and the only reason why I’d like to stick to big 4 is because of visa sponsorship so I got good reason. 

Anyways, my question is when should I tell my supervisor about this and how to make it sound nice? The reason for my decision is visa sponsorship so I’m sure they’ll understand. However, I’m scared to tell them now (I think this is me just being paranoid) because what if they decide to fire me for already having a job lined up with another firm after I finish the internship with them. I can’t lose the internship because that’s how I’m paying for my last semester of school. Thank you so much!"

I was also working with a graduate student whom he had worked with before and she is my sort of direct supervisor, and I work with her the most. 

This specific professor also oversees a really cool residential summer internship at a national park and has told me I would be a great fit for this internship and I want it very bad. It would be the best opportunity. I have been good about following up with him and we recently had a great conversation about the current project we are doing, presenting our other project at NCUR as well as preparing for me to apply to this summer internship. We were both planning on me getting one of my letters of recommendation from that graduate student as I worked with her a lot and he felt it would be more impactful if the letter was from her and not him. 

I was nervous about asking her as I wasn’t sure how she felt about me due to some scheduling difficulties the past couple months. I know excuses are kind of BS but I live on my own and have to work a full time job to pay my bills and for school since I don’t qualify for any assistance.

So fast forward to yesterday after after a great conversation with my professor about the internship and him expressing that he felt confident in my ability to get it. I started my application and texted this girl to ask if she would be willing to write me a letter. She replied saying she doesn’t write letters for people she doesn’t know that well or hasn’t worked with much. The issue is we have been working together for about 6 months now, and previously she had even invited me to her house to look over my CV and meet her friend who had done that internship before, so I feel like she switched up on me. 

I feel finished in academia now. I’m scared to admit to my professor that she won’t write it because he’s going to question why she won’t, and she would have been the best letter as our work related most to the internship. I feel like I’ve screwed everything up and I just don’t even know what to do at this point. Any advice?"

In terms of salary, AWS pays more but not by a substantial amount.

setfgf,11,2022-01-28,Applying to Business School Gunning For One Particular Role (Samsung GSG) - Am I Crazy?,Blazer2800,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/setfgf/applying_to_business_school_gunning_for_one/,"Currently a few years out of undergrad and deciding whether to apply to business school, and would appreciate a sanity check.

From what I can tell, I should be a realistic candidate at T15 or even M7 (3.4 in applied math at one of HYPSM, 760 GMAT, experience in analytics and data science at an adtech startup with a couple of promotions). I’m really excited by the learning and social prospects of business school, and I’m pretty sure I would personally get a lot of value from the experience.

However, the issue is that when it comes to post-MBA roles, my interests are hyper-specific. I have little interest in finance and consulting - concerned about the hyper-competitive culture and poor WLB. The one particular opportunity that interests me is Samsung Global Strategy Group. I feel I’m a uniquely good fit for the opportunity (am non-Korean (white) but speak fluent Korean and have Korean internship experience), and have heard positive things about it overall (~$200k TC which ends up being one of the most lucrative packages anywhere post-MBA given they provide free housing and low ~20% tax rate for expats, opportunities to take on projects in different regions around the world, strong global brand, wide range of potential exits inside and outside the company 2-4 years post-MBA, reasonable WLB). If Samsung GSG didn’t exist, my next most preferred option would be something in tech; I’ve been reached out to often by recruiters for data analytics/engineering roles at FAANG (pretty sure I could crack one of these within the next year if I went all-in with interview prep), and going for PM out of business school also seems possible given my data science background.

With all that said, I have two main questions I’d appreciate input on:

1. If Samsung GSG is the only post-MBA opportunity I am interested in, is it intolerably risky for me to go to business school? I do think I am as strong a fit as anyone out there given my background, but I do recognize the inherent risk of banking on one particular role at one particular company. I fear getting rejected by Samsung and being left with both a high debt burden and a job less desirable and lucrative than the FAANG data analytics/engineering roles I’m getting recruited for now.

2. Does anyone have any knowledge of Samsung GSG (compensation, WLB, work experience, recruiting process, etc.) they can add? Does the description above sound accurate? I couldn’t find too much info about the opportunity online compared to more popular opportunities like MBB, tech PM, etc. - hope this thread becomes helpful for anyone considering Samsung GSG.

Thanks!"

Let me say so far the application process has worked. I've done a few screening interviews and coding assessments and I've been applying for all of a few weeks. Being a student also allows me apply for internships, which is about where I feel my level is. My original goal was to land a position that would give me tuition support after a few semesters so I could finish the masters on the cheap. When I was done I would have a year of experience and a MS under my belt.

I hate my program. They really don't seem to care. I emailed my advisor 3 times trying to discuss my class options for the Spring, and finally got him to schedule a 30 minute meeting after I called him. He was 15 minutes late. They are technically incapable for a tech field. Like they won't limit the options for the quizzes. Rather than 3-4 options for each questions they had every possible answer for every possible questions. Sometimes they are extremely similar too like 'sometimes' versus 'inconsistently'. The professor said he updated the quiz, but won't reset my grade so I can take the easier version. It was on information I'd covered in three other settings yet somehow I got a B- (the minimum grade to move on the program). I've also been trying to call the billing department to ask why my bill reflects classes I've dropped (I was waitlisted in a section and then saw an open section so I moved to it). It's my second time calling this week. The first time I gave up after 40 minutes of no answer, and today its been calling in the background the whole time I've been writing this post. Clearly no one will answer this and it's asking for like 5k additional dollars. 

I'm at a total loss of what to do. I don't think the quality of instruction is high and the main focus appears to be writing 11-15 discussion posts each week. It has gotten me some bites in terms of getting a job/internship but man I am really frustrated with it. Has anyone had experience with these online masters? Can I just slow role my masters (exactly 1 class each semester) and quit the second I get a stable position? Is this just what CS/data science is like? Are there better programs I just missed?

The professor said he updated the quiz, but won't reset my grade so I can take the easier version. It was on information I'd covered in three other settings yet somehow I got a B- (the minimum grade to move on the program). I've also been trying to call the billing department to ask why my bill reflects classes I've dropped (I was waitlisted in a section and then saw an open section so I moved to it). It's my second time calling this week. The first time I gave up after 40 minutes of no answer, and today its been calling in the background the whole time I've been writing this post. Clearly no one will answer this and it's asking for like 5k additional dollars.

I'm at a total loss of what to do. I don't think the quality of instruction is high and the main focus appears to be writing 11-15 discussion posts each week. It has gotten me some bites in terms of getting a job/internship but man I am really frustrated with it. Has anyone had experience with these online masters? Can I just slow role my masters (exactly 1 class each semester) and quit the second I get a stable position? Is this just what CS/data science is like? Are there better programs I just missed? Should I have just done a bootcamp like everyone else?"

sezi12,0,2022-01-28,Eligibility for Software Jobs by Employment Ordinance after Robotics/Embedded Masters,RevolutionaryCatch5,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/sezi12/eligibility_for_software_jobs_by_employment/,"Hello.
I am a Computer Engineering student in my penultimate year (in an Anabin recognized university) with plans on doing my Masters in Germany. I have been looking at degree programs I am interested in but keep finding I fall short of the admission requirements. My programme is more EE than CS based so I lack theoretical computer science requirements and some practical computer science requirements. 

Now, since I don't want to bet my chances on those degree programs (i will still apply to them but I'm not holding out any hope for them), I have been looking into degree programs I can enter that are as close to software engineering as possible (like Robotics and Embedded Systems).

From my understanding of the content in this link (https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/aufenthg_2004/__19c.html), it says for getting a residence permit (which is what I'll need to stay after the given 18 months from my graduation), I basically need to be allowed by the Employment Ordinance to take up a software engineering job and this varies based on my degree.

 So my question is, how do I know if my degree is safe enough to be allowed to pursue software jobs after graduation? Is it based on the number of software related modules? I have some internship experience and know MERN, Typescript and Python and I'm learning Java (if it matters at all)  and plan on working for a year in software preferably before coming here.  So how would this all factor into the decision by the employment ordinance? 

Also, I would appreciate if anyone could give me any solutions concerning my issue on the first paragraph."

I just accepted an internship offer (my first) for this summer in a Cloud/DevOps based role. I am ecstatic! Looking forward to learning more about Cloud Operations than I have so far. My question is - would I be correct in assuming that Cloud Operations and Software Engineering/Development are similar enough to make a transition later - If I choose? What is the job market like for the operation side as opposed to development? Is there room to grow and move laterally if needed?  


Just looking for some general insight on how the two sectors compare and relate. If you have any experience in either of these areas, I would love to hear your perspective!"

Short Background info: Graduated in 2021 with Electronics and Electrical Engineering Degree, looking to pivot to a career in software.  Have been practicing coding and applying to jobs since last july.  I am a veteran, and recently qualified for a program which will sponsor me to do a Bootcamp.

My situation: I have been looking for a job since last may, and finally was offered a position in new york city as a junior c++ engineer.  I live in California so this move would be pretty difficult, but ultimately I am really looking to get started with my first job ASAP, as i have no internships or real experience, so depending on the compensation package, I am considering moving. 

I just found out about this veterans benefit opportunity to do a bootcamp, and the allowable bootcamps are pretty much Hack Reactor, Sabio, and Learn Academy - software engineering intensives. 

I also have two interviews with Amazon in the pipeline for a junior position, and a phone call with niantic and nintendo waiting to be scheduled.  My ultimate goal is to be a gameplay programmer (thats why I'm leaning toward this C++ job).  

&amp;#x200B;

So with that information, I am looking for career advice or just some things to consider when making a decision with the opportunities in front of me.  I think the Bootcamp would be a nice thing to fall back on, but also, part of me wants to turn down the C++ job so I can remain in california, and get paid to learn the stuff which I will need to learn anyway (since I'm a self taught programmer).  

On the other hand, if I'm really looking to a career in the games industry as a programmer, is the bootcamp route going to be more or less...irrelevant when it comes to experience to get a job as a gameplay or graphics programmer?

Also, my penultimate interview with Amazon is on monday, and I have been preparing and feel good about it.  I've seen nothing but horror stories on what its like being a junior engineer at Amazon.  Can anyone weigh in on what that experience was like for them?  

Considering my experience, I am in the mindset of ""take what you can get.""  The only offer I've received so far just happens to be such a large move, I'm reconsidering it.  

Any advice is much appreciated.  thank you all for your time!"
sf28ry,3,2022-01-28,Data Science or Credit Risk Management Career? Go with passion or perspective?,Ko_3,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/sf28ry/data_science_or_credit_risk_management_career_go/,"I was hoping that someone could share her/his opinion with me since I am really unsure what to do. Currently, I am an Economics MSc. student with a heavy focus on statistics. I did an internship in the field of Credit Risk Management in a bank, and I am writing my master thesis in cooperation with that bank, in which I am developing an XAI to detect risk nests using Python. You should know that I love Python and ML. It makes soo much fun.

Now, I have two offers, one from a bank as 'Credit Risk Manager', one from a law firm as a 'Data Scientist'. In general, I would say both offers are equally attractive to me. The bank has a better perspective and is international more active, while the law firm gives you much more freedom (you just have to make their business more efficient, and it's up to you how you achieve that). 

The problem with the bank is that they use R instead of Python and did not establish ML systems yet (as expected since risk management is subject to regularizations), which is why I cannot turn my passion into a profession. Nevertheless, I would enhance my R skills, which is also quite cool.

The problem with the law firm is that it is very young and, I mean, it's a law firm, and somehow I associate that negatively.. However, they use Python, and I would be part of the central ML developer team. Besides, strong growth would be really beneficial for me. 

Don't get me wrong - I am not complaining. Instead, I am so grateful for these opportunities. Both jobs excite me a lot! Still, as it will be my first job, I want to be sure. A hybrid form would be perfect (ML + Python + Credit Risk Management), but not feasible yet. Any experience/feedback/opinion on that would be much appreciated!!!"

sf2fzu,1,2022-01-28,Advice + Direction,NinjaBatHat,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/sf2fzu/advice_direction/," \*Note - I posted this on CSCareerQuestions but didn't get much feedback

Hello! I hope whoever is reading this is doing well. I am a current second year CS student who needs a bit of advice and direction going forward. A bit of background, I been trying to get an internship but I keep falling short (applied to over 60) and I either don't get anything back or get those generic emails saying, ""Thank you for your interest, BUT..."" I already talked to my school's career center and did what they told me to do, update my resume, update linkedin, etc... but still nothing. I think my next course of action is to just give up on applying to internships but focus on strengthening my resume and my own skills but it leads me to this.

How should I go about improving my skills or resume? One of the ideas that I had was maybe focusing on doing a project in my spare time and putting something out there to show that I am capable of something but what type of project should I do? I feel like I should do a project that caters to my interest or something that I would like do as a job in the future and some of those interests are like robotics, electric vehicles, AI/machine learning, web development, and/or mobile development (android) and I want to learn all of this but obviously I can't atm and should probably stick to one thing and develop that one interest but not sure which one to pick.

Another thing is practicing for interviews and Data Structures/Algorithms courses. I heard these are big parts in the CS industry and I would like to hone my skills in these but again how? I heard leetcode is a great place but I'm stuck on doing the easy problems (I know I suck). I would like to somehow connect some Data Structures concepts into a project (idk yet) somehow but I guess without a concrete project/plan, can't really do that.

What type of direction should I take and what type of project should I tackle knowing my interests?"

I have been dedicated with teaching myself python and I plan to start learning Js. I currently have an offer from Apple in a product design role (clearly mech oriented) and an offer from Deloitte for a solutions engineering summer scholar. I am having incredible difficulty finding any specific information regarding what the latter role entails in regards to anything much less programming, however I know it is more closely related to a ""tech"" role. Apple pays more and offers relocation assistance and a longer internship period. Would it be a mistake to decline Deloitte in favor of the better pay (\~ 9,000 more by the end of the summer)? I would go with Deloitte if I had any hope that it would better orient me to enter the tech field after graduation, but I just can't find any information on what exactly I'll be doing.

It's like being locked in a glass cage, seeing everyone around me living their lives and wanting to live just like them, having jobs and relationships and all that, but I can't break out. I've had this feeling my entire life. I never felt like I ""belonged"" to a family, to a friend group, to a school, or to any kind of community. Ever since very early childhood, I've spent all my time absorbed in my own little head, living in my own thoughts. Now, as a young adult, OCD, ADHD, and panic attacks make my life hell, and it's so exhausting having to cope with them all the time. I'm so convinced that I'm a fundamentally flawed, broken, rotten human being, and that I'll never be anything but that.

The worst part of it is that I know of so many people whose lives and mental health issues are so much worse than mine, yet they still have the ability to connect, socialize, have normal jobs and careers, have success in school, etc, despite living their lives in a literal hell. I get so depressed seeing friends posting about their jobs, friends, internships, and relationships, because it all reminds me that I'll never be part of this ""normal"" world no matter how hard I tried. I don't know where this feeling comes from, I just know I've always had it.

I have no idea what I want from this life, and even if I knew, I feel deep down that I'm not good enough to aspire to anything. I'm just a miserable fuck, a sad excuse for a person. I don't think I'm good enough at being anything: I'm terrible at being mentally ill (can't cope), I'm terrible at being female (ugly, unsociable), I'm terrible at being a student (don't think I need to explain this one...). I just feel like I'm a terrible person. It all spirals into misery. My mind will find ANY reason to stop my happiness, even if it has to make shit up. I'm tired of this and I don't want it anymore."

Background:  I’m currently 30, have a bachelors+masters in civil engineering and I have a bit over 4 years of experience working as a traffic engineer in a west coast tech hub. My day to day functions are leading designs in CAD, meeting with municipality stakeholders, cost estimation, mentoring junior engineers/interns and performing technical writing for specifications. Its not a bad job at all, my issue is that I'm absolutely bored of my mind and the fact there's pretty much nothing that I need to really learn to continue climbing the ladder is pretty terrifying because I love learning new skills to apply to my work.


So I decided to go back to school and am currently finishing coursework in data structures, analysis of algorithms and computer architecture at a community college this semester. I have already completed intro to programming and discrete math. I plan on submitting applications to start Fall 22 to earn a masters and am looking at OMSCS, ASU online MCS and UIUC online MCS. 

When it comes to school choice, I can pretty much be positive I’ll get into ASU, the advantages are that it’ll be one of the quicker ones to complete and the cost is right in the center at 15k, but without the name recognition of UIUC/GaTech. 

I’m about 90% sure I’ll get into OMSCS, they have the most class options, are the most affordable and have great name recognition, only downside it’s the longest to complete. 

UIUC is the most competitive to get into of these online options, probably has the best name recognition and is the most expensive at 22k. It’ll take probably the same amount of time to complete as ASU but also has the least varied options for software engineering classes. 

Overall from what I know about myself now, my career goal is to get into backend software engineering. I’d love to try to land an internship after a semester or two and plan on spending this summer grinding leetcode/building a project to make that a possibility. I’ll probably take a shot at landing a full time role while in graduate school if that’s a possibility as well. 

So which do program do you feel makes the most sense in my situation? Any advice would be appreciated!"

I applied for an internship with dropbox designed to give students their first technical internship experience (I am a second year under-graduate math major and cs minor, and have only been programming for a semester and a half, but figured I would give it a shot anyways because why not). They use codeSignal to assess their applicants. I would say I performed roughly average or maybe a little below average on the general coding assessment (654/850) but was asked to take a second assessment that is more specific to the company. Completely bombed it. The task was to design a text editor; I only passed one test case out of 40 for a total score of 25/1000, which was not only extremely discouraging, but also had me contemplating my own existence for a solid 45 minutes afterwards. I really felt the time pressure/test anxiety, and towards the end was sort of just staring at the screen after receiving a seg fault of unknown origin for the 20th compilation/debugging attempt in a row. A few hours after submitting I tried to make the same text editor in VIM where I usually code and was able to put together a decent working program in about 20-30 minutes. The program was far better than what I submitted (working append, move/set cursor and backspace functions etc). All that is to say that I am unsure whether I am just bad at programming or need more time to improve before applying to internships, or if this is just part of the process when it comes to developing skill/experience in this domain. Any advice would be appreciated, thanks."

I am making this post to help my little bro out. He's a freshman in college studying software engineering and he's aspiring to be working in the cybersecurity industry after graduating.

Me being the older brother, who graduated university a year ago(not software eng.), I am naturally worrying about my lil bro missing opportunities while he's a student. So my advice to him was pretty simple:
1. Try to have a decent GPA
2. Focus on extra curricular projects outside of university which will thicken your CV - of course so he could stand out when applying to internships and eventually, entry level jobs

That being said, with his first semester finals being over, he's looking for ideas about projects that will be a perfect match given the fact that he's a freshman and trying to land an internship in the summer. The focus, of course, is cybersecurity.

My suggestion to him was that we should tinker with basic level networking and try to set up a home server as a side project. But as I said, I am in no position to give out this advice because I am not in the IT sector at all. So, I am coming to this subreddit for help.

That being said, I would like to receive advice on the following topics:

1. Side projects related to cybersecurity for someone just getting started with this field - hopefully nothing that's too complicated to take a semesters worth of free time(freshman level i guess)

2. I'd also like to receive criticism on the way we're handling his path to the cybersecurity industry. So far, the plan is: have decent grades, make some side projects, land internships during the summer.

I apologise for the long post and for the bad english and would like to honestly thank anyone that's going to take his time to give advice on this post.

TLDR: Ideas for cybersecurity side projects for freshmen

Again, every input is appreciated :)"

I'm currently at the beginning of the 2nd year of an industrial PhD in the field of hardware acceleration of Neural Networks / Edge AI / Tiny ML. During my program, I am doing an internship with a company that develops embedded systems for AI, and that has funded the PhD.

I really like this topic and the company I am working in, but unfortunately after more than 1 year I don't see my research going anywhere: basically I am just working as a developer for the company (and sometimes as a Teaching Assistant for the university), but I have not managed to find a direction in order to do publishable analyses and experiments that could allow me to publish papers and ultimately to write a thesis. 

If I continue like this, I will either be kicked out by the PhD program at the end of the year (they need at least 1 publication at the end of the 2nd year), or I may end up completing a mediocre PhD with very few publications. The latter is what happened to some former students in this program, who then left the field. 

To be honest I realized that I don't like doing research, but in the future i would like to work as a software engineer in an R&amp;D department. For sure I don't want to stay in academia.   
However, I think that in this field companies may value PhD holders with a good academic curriculum, but I am not so sure that the same applies to a mediocre PhD (with few publications / citations). 

Recently I have received a job offer from a R&amp;D department of a top hardware company to work on the same topics (as a software engineer), and I am undecided on what to do:

1. Decline the offer and try to complete the PhD, even with a mediocre thesis;
2. Quit the PhD and go to work for the ""bigger"" company. However, I would need to relocate to a country in which I don't see myself in the long future, hence I would stay there 2 - 3 years probably.

Do you think that a 2-3 yrs work experience in a top company would be more valuable than a ""mediocre"" PhD? 

Thanks in advance"

Since, earlier you couldn't apply for [M.Tech](https://M.Tech). with just 3 years of education, it was natural to go for [M.Sc](https://M.Sc). I always wanted to get into academia, so I never prepared for jobs and placement. I did not even apply for internships. Appeared for Gate 2021 with no preparation(sounds like an excuse) and did not qualify. I did not have any gap years before, but now my life has been on hold for 1 year. 

I have been staying at my home ever since I completed my post graduation. Lost all my drive and determination to pursue research and feel like PhD from a college of similar calibre would be waste of time.  Ever since I was a child, I wanted to do PhD, but that dream feels so distant now, I have given it up. 

It's not like I already have an offer for a job or an admission letter for [M.Tech](https://M.Tech). I am appearing for GATE 2022 and given my preparation I already know I will barely qualify if at all. Does it make any sense to give it one more try?  

Or should I actually prepare for jobs? Will I even get a job with gap years? 

What other options do I have? I am utterly confused. I don't understand how should I proceed with my life."

So exciting. But then my major self doubt crept in when I was in my very first production meeting. I started to think I was in way over my head and I should just go back to bartending before it's too late. ""They're going to find out I have no idea what I'm doing..."" 

But then, after getting some direction on my second production meeting, I just did what I've been doing for the past couple years: dove in and lost myself in code.

My deliverable was only supposed to be some preliminary research on which language we should write the project in, and I had 2 weeks to do it in. Well, I dove in, did the research, picked a language, mocked up a working version of the tech, and deployed it to netlify. And I did it in 2 days!

I went into Friday's meeting nervous and full of doubt that I'd done the wrong thing. Nope. They were blown away. I even got a DM from one of the great Profs (who I've been fanboying over) telling me how impressed he was with my presentation! (All this is happening on Discord)

AND THEN, in a channel unrelated to my project, the main project manager was talking about my app to other people as a way to help solve some features of their projects.

It was the first time since starting all this that I could even ***fathom*** getting a job in the field and that I'm even slightly capable.

I just wanted to share my mini win and encourage you all to keep at it, especially if you love it. We'll all find our way in eventually.

Happy Weekend!"

I'll soon graduate from ETH Zurich with a masters in computer science. I am a EU citizen and consider to move to Berlin for family reasons (I also speak German). I am unsure about the opportunities and salary in Berlin but I ""know"" the job market in Zurich.

The information on the web is very conflicting and I think that it doesn't reflect the potential that Berlin holds. On the one hand, people say that Berlin is the tech hotspot of Europe. On the other hand, many webpages and posts on reddit claim that the [new grad salary is around 45k€](https://www.get-in-it.de/magazin/gehalt/statistik), maybe up to 55k€ if you're lucky.

I have experience as a part time software engineer, did a 6 month internship in data analysis, and worked in autonomous driving for over a year. I am interested in R&amp;D but can't find any salary information for such roles in Berlin online. Some friends with a similar background than mine recently got offers of &gt;120kCHF in non-FAANG companies for roles that I find interesting. I expect the same salary if I stay in Zurich.

As an example for Berlin, I found an interesting job at [Zalando](https://jobs.zalando.com/en/jobs/3576554?gh_src=22377bdd1us) which claims ""Competitive salary"" . Can I ask for &gt;80k€ ?

Which companies can you suggest and what salary range can I ask for? I don't want to lose an opportunity only because I asked *an unreasonable amount*, but I also don't want to undersell myself."

Sorry for a mess of a post but a conversation with an older friend has sparked some fear in me.  I think it's best to list the main parts of my CV + goals and concerns 

CV outline:
Expected first class BSC maths (lower end Russel group uni) + AAB (maths,physics,econ)
9 months work in entertainment industry + 5 months maths tutoring (ongoing)
Miscellaneous uni participation: sports team, 2 years academic mentoring
Coding experience in R and python 

To be blunt, my main goal is to earn money in my early 20s to be able to invest as soon as possible. Due to this I don't mind longer hours and would prefer a job I could work paid overtime as I'd probably have to find lower paying part time jobs otherwise. I was looking into analytical finance jobs but if people had other ideas I'd really like to hear them.

In terms of applications, I'm very concerned about my lack of relevant work experience. Currently I think my CV will look very lackluster compared to others who will be applying. What do you think I should be doing right now to help the situation? I've considered applying for summer internships for just after graduation and will see if I can find some part time remote work for my final semester.

It might be worth mentioning that I like the idea of going back to education for an MBA at some point. For now though I've just started spamming out applications even to companies that want an internship ( might get lucky). 

If anyone has advice for what I should be doing or alternative careers that I could take a look at it would be much appreciated.

I decided to stay home and raise him because he was sick. I was extremely thankful that my husband was able to support us with a good income. Two years ago, we lost our son due to cancer and it broke us completely, but I was more affected on a daily basis because I was his caretaker. I was not able to find a job because of the mental condition that I was in. I knew I wasn’t ready for a job. 

After 8 months or so, I started going to a junior college (taking a class or two per semester) because I did not want to stay home and wanted something different in my life. I am working toward a 2nd degree (engineering) and will be transferring later this year. I was told that I will need internships starting now, but I am anxious as it has been about 9 years since I last worked. I wonder if the gap will make employers think I’m unfit for work? I’m not sure I am comfortable at this stage to disclose this info on my resume/cover letter or even during interview, yet I am also not sure if employers will even set up an interview with me when they see the gap on my resume. It makes part of me wonder if I am truly unfit for work because honestly it has been hard, and I don’t feel very confident now.

sfozcm,1,2022-01-29,Accounting/finance student,VeryOld_Papaya,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/sfozcm/accountingfinance_student/,"Hi!

I am a Master of Accounting student graduating in September of this year. Previously I worked in a tax software company as a tax analyst intern, and I was privileged to work on the development and coding process directly. This experience sparked my interest in software development, and I took every CS elective I could in my undergrad. I want to work as a software developer post-graduation, but I am unsure what steps I should take to make the pivot. Below are some of the things I am considering:

1. Complete a coding Bootcamp. From what I saw on this sub, I think Bootcamp is the best way for me to learn the necessary material to become a developer. However, I am not sure how well are the bootcamps regarded in the industry, and how viable it is in my situation.
2. Ideally, I want to leverage my expertise in accounting/tax similar to what I did in the tax software company. Aside from a tax/accounting software company, I wonder if there are other career opportunities (e.g. in FinTech) that are suitable for my knowledge and interest.
3. A lot of advice I saw online includes having a portfolio of projects.  I wonder how important is this, and what is the best way to showcase the portfolio? What types of projects do recruiters want to see?
4. I acknowledge that it is hard to land a developer role without a relevant degree. I wonder if it is better to get in a financial software company as an accounting/tax role, and transition internally into a developer role through the display of interest/competency. However, I don't know how rigid are the roles, and I am afraid of being stuck in the accounting position. Perhaps this is a question for the interviewer of the specific company, but I want to get a sense of how viable is this path in general.

Thanks so much in advance!"
sfq7ua,0,2022-01-29,Is my job more System Administrator than it is service desk? Quite a bit confused,americanista915,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/sfq7ua/is_my_job_more_system_administrator_than_it_is/,"I wasn’t too familiar with service desk Analyst before taking it, I assumed it would be help desk. In university I did a few Sys admin internships(took a different career path which is why I’m here now to regain experience)  most if not everything I do is similar to that internship. 


My entire job is done in windows server and Active Directory, we even use Administration systems such. Our actual system Administrators are all working in defense while we administrate passwords, permissions, account creation/migration, licensing things, troubleshooting software and virtual machines, manage permissions, set up security, and a good deal of other task. 



We take calls that creates the ticket to do whatever I listed above. It’s really throwing me off because I see everyone else talking about service desk/help desk being more hardware focused, I have a friend who after we graduated had no ambition and stayed way longer than the legally recommended 6-12 months at help desk who is still there(2 years later) and she never touches what I do at her company, she mainly deals with printers and helping people find files and all that. Another friend whose in service desk somewhere else trouble shoots laptops and physical hardware he doesn’t use server. 



I’m making my jump as fast as humanely possible, already got 2 certifications since December when I decided to leave my former career(mostly review for me because past experience &amp; university not because actually smart, I’m from Texas) so am I basically training for where I want to be already or am I understanding entry level IT all wrong? I’ve never been entry level before just internships so I am beyond confused. 




FAQ:

Why did you go entry level instead of sys admin?


I had an internship one year as a System Admin, I asked if I could be try another part of IT with them when my internship ended, they agreed and boom I was a interning software engineer, I fell in love with it and was with that career path for many years until I realized that wasn’t going to get me to my teenage dream of cyber security. Over the last few years my traditional IT skills became rusty and I wanted to review everything so I was ready when I move to where I want to be therefore I am here."

I wanted to thank this sub for all the information that helped me along the way and share my experiences to hopefully help someone who is in my same shoes now.

To start off, here are my internship search stats for my junior year (the year I got the Uber internship):

* Applications - 200
* Hacker Rank Tests - 8
* Interviews - 2

Before applying, I had job experience from working one summer at a National Lab, and had some math tutoring experience. These were the main things on my resume besides some non-impressive personal projects. ( I did make an [augmented reality chicken game for the hololens](https://youtu.be/xTsI68O_8KY?t=97) at the national lab, I think that was the most impressive thing)

After applying online to so many companies, I received back a bunch of hacker rank tests, which I failed because I did not prepare enough leetcode at all. (Preparation wise, at this point I had only skimmed cracking the coding interview, and done 20 leetcode questions).

As it was quickly approaching the start of summer and my junior year was ending, I got an email from an Uber recruiter asking for an interview.

I started studying more algorithms and data structures problems, luckily I was taking a D&amp;As class at the time in my university so I was still fresh on important concepts.

The interview process was two interviews spaced out by a few days. The first interview I got the luckiest interviewer in the WORLD.

He asked me to implement an LRU Cache, I didn't know what that was so I started to panic, and asked him to explain it to me. I thought for sure I had failed. At the end of the interview, he said ""Don't worry you did a great job, its going to be a yes from me, have a great day.""

I died a little..

The second interview comes around and it was more normal, leetcode medium, explained my thought process and wrote test cases, but unfortunately not all of them passed...

If you want to see the whole story, I made a video explaining the entire process, along with essential tips and tricks that I've learned for technical interviews, that eventually led me to my job at amazon. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTsI68O\_8KY&amp;t=3s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTsI68O_8KY&amp;t=3s)

I wanted to share just in case it would help someone because I got so much useful info from the experiences of others. Thank you everyone."

When I first attempted college, I wanted to go to graduate school, however life had other plans for me at the time. I struggled academically ( due to being a caregiver for my sick parents), and was told I didn't belong in STEM. I really believed them, because of course my grades reflected that, and I got kicked out (1.77 GPA).  I only went back to community college to try and get an associates for a better paying job.

However, at that community college I found mentors and advisors who actually believed in me. I ended up creating a mentoring program myself for other students, to try and cultivate an inclusive environment and increase their self-efficacy in completing STEM degrees, because I knew how make or break that could be as someone who failed out once themselves.

I ended up transferring, received four research internships (1 NSF REU, 1 RISE, 1 in-house fellowship, and 1 internship at Caltech) in experimental and theoretical practices, got nominated as a churchill scholarship candidate by my university.  3 publications, one first author, 2 mid authors,  7 presentations, 1 oral.

All I had was a math tutor job I worked the year prior but I was still getting a lot of coding challenges and interviews. I received call backs from Google, Amazon, Western Digital, Atlassian, Yelp, and a couple other smaller companies and I interviewed at Western Digital after passing their coding challenge.

Cue 2019 and due to personal reasons I got depressed and addicted to substances and I pretty much got barred from enrollment and couldn’t go back to school unless I changed my major.

In 2021, I changed my major from CS:BS to CS:BA and they accepted me back for Fall 2021. In Summer 2021, before I went back to school, I got lucky with landing an Amazon internship and interned there for there summer.

This recruiting season, despite my stronger resume, I’ve received basically no call backs despite applying to 100+ places. At first I only got Tik Tok and BlackRock but both companies send their coding challenge to literally everyone so it doesn’t count. Recently, Yext contacted me for an interview so that’s like ONE single call back despite having a stronger resume.

Guess I just wanna say having a stronger resume doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll get more attention from companies. It certainly helps but in my experience, not by much. So if you have nothing on your resume, don’t sweat it, you still have a fair shot of landing an internship. Just kinda sucks because I thought the prestige of Amazon would help me out but this doesn’t seem to be the case."

The internship's learning goals and tasks were optimizing the software architecture of large-scale design tools, creating intuitive and modern-looking UIs (GUIs and Apps) to assist the Motor Design process and developing and documenting new code in MATLAB.   


They contacted me and before even doing an interview, I was invited to complete a case study, with the exercise involving using MATLAB to complete a set of tasks. I will have 48 hours to complete this.  


They have not provided any more information on this. I will receive the exercise instructions in about 3 days and will have 48 hours after that to complete it.  


Has anyone else been in a similar position? I have no idea what I might be asked to do, since I have not even had an interview with them to discuss what the internship will involve.   


How could I prepare for this exercise beforehand? What MATLAB knowledge and skills should I brush up?  


If you have any idea or any advice, please let me know. I cannot seem to find another person that is doing the same internship, so I can't find anyone else to ask advice from."

White Hispanic female

Upper middle class

Public school in rural under-represented state

LGBTQ

**Intended Major(s)**

Computer science/design (varies between schools)

**Stats &amp; Academics**

4.0 UW GPA

1560 SAT

1/170 but split with \~20 others.

AP exams: Calc AB (5), Spanish Language (5), English Language (5),  US History (4), Biology (self-studied) (4), in the spring I'm taking Physics, Computer Science, Calc BC (self-studied technically, but I took university Calc II), and Literature.

Course rigor: I took all the AP classes offered at my high school except in foreign languages other than Spanish. On top of APs, I had 12 semesters' worth of dual credit classes and several overload classes I did online.

Senior year courses: Calc II, Linear Algebra, AP Physics, AP Computer Science, AP Literature, Government, Color Theory &amp; Printmaking, Honors Senior Project (studied AI and free speech rights)

**Standardized Testing**

1560 SAT

3 5s (Calc, Lang, Spanish), 2 4s (APUSH, self studied Bio)

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

1. Menstrual equity club founder/president: collected several thousand period products for homeless shelter, education events, etc.
2. Web development: codeveloped a mental health tracking site for a summer HTML boot camp
3. Startup competition: won several awards for period tracker app
4. Freelance graphic design
5. Business Professionals of America: some graphic design awards
6. Art Instagram: only like 3k followers, but very high hours. If any AOs actually checked it out, it's almost all fan art, especially Percy Jackson fan art lol
7. Student government: junior VP, senior class president
8. Lab internship: got my name on a poster and worked long hours, but totally irrelevant to programs I was applying to

4. Hispanic recognition scholar
5. National Honors Society lol

**Letters of Recommendation**

Computer Science/Physics teacher 8/10 - he let me read the letter and it was really good, told some stories about me doing out of class computer science and game theory projects for fun.

APUSH/Literature teacher: 8/10??? - he really likes me and he told me my letter was ""very, very, interesting"" and ""includes the words 'punk rock.'"" I think this is good??

**Essays**

I won't rate cause I'm biased, but a quick summary: my personal statement was about being a programmer and an artist and how those two things seem contradictory, but they actually enrich each other. Then I tied that into being Queer in a fundamentalist religion and struggling to reconcile different identities. I was very proud of this one and the English professor who edited for me seemed to really like it.

Fordham supplemental was about becoming politically engaged in my community through my menstrual equity club. Solid.

Georgia Tech supplemental was last minute and very trash lol

For the UChicago quirky question, I used AI text generation to mimic past UChicago prompts and then wrote a little about the process.  For Why UChicago, I wrote about people I'd met at/through UChicago and all their very cool and obscure interests. I think these two were the best supplementals I wrote.

**EA Decisions**

Spoilered so y'all can make your guesses &gt;:)

UT Dallas (computer science): &gt;!Accepted! Almost full ride scholarship!&lt;

Fordham (computer science, new media and digital design): &gt;!Accepted!  Full tuition and honors college!&lt;

Northeastern (computer science and design): &gt;!Accepted!! Big scholarship and honors program!&lt;

Georgia Tech (computer science): &gt;!ACCEPTED!! Plus scholarship offered to 60 students every year!&lt;

UC Hicago (computer science, media arts and design): &gt;!ACCEPTEDDDDD bayBEE!!!!! With three small scholarships!&lt;

sftml9,14,2022-01-29,Community college student here thinking about changing my major.,username2J,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/sftml9/community_college_student_here_thinking_about/,"So some backstory. I went to a high school that allowed me to get college credits while taking regular high school class at the same time. 

Some students were able to get their associates degree the moment they graduated. 

It’s been two years now since graduation and I don’t have mines. 

After high school I chose to major in network admin and I started doing that for the 2nd half or so of 2021. 

I should get the credits I need to get the degree by early 2023 hopefully. But I’m thinking about changing my major to music recording technology. 

In may of 2020 I started messing around on GarageBand as a hobby because my older brother gave me his old 2015 MacBook Air. 

I’d say I made some significant progress since then but I have nothing that actually warrants releasing music. 

Personally I don’t care about severs and coding and shit like that. The only time I found computers interesting was when I was building my pc and I really enjoyed the hardware side of things. 

The reason why I chose this networking major is because for the longest time I felt like if I half ass some computer related shit, a simple yet secure it position will fall right on my lap. 

I’m really only doing it for the money and potential job security. I guess. 

A few weeks ago I had a internship interview through zoom and it was my first interview. I’d say I botched it and I was nervous and I didn’t know jack shit about the topic for this position. 

I thought it would be easy to get some basic shit but I guess not. I told my parents recently about my idea of switching majors and they heavily don’t want me to do it. 

I feel like that botched interview showed me that I can’t just half ass this topic and still get a paying career out of it. It feels so pointless to continue on with this major. 

My parents believe that I could get a job with this major but I really doubt it because I just don’t care about it, and I don’t know if I should force myself to care about it just for money really. 

I really don’t see what’s appealing about servers and coding and shit. I did programming once for a class and hated it.

Edit: nah it ain’t gonna happen. I only have a few more credits to go with this major I’m currently on. Sucks but, real life’s always disappointing. 

Even all the way down to who I am as a person, the outside me always contrasts the me I think of inside. 

I guess that’s why I like being alone so much. Even simple chats with my parents seem like an endeavor, and after that I can finally retreat to my room far away in the basement (yup), and thinking about how much I hate the me that people irl see. 

So awkward so uncomfortable. So much worrying, insecurities, and probably an evident history with porn, probably all showing just through my voice. 

Fucking hate this existence. That’s the only way I can sleep at night, hating it."

I’m currently studying computer science and I’m looking to build up onto my CV. 

Right now I do freelancing as a form of part time work while I study but I don’t think it’ll be too useful on a CV as I technically have no people to use as a reference.

I take part in stuff like the Huawei Seeds for Future programme and Google programmes which I’ll be putting on my CV but like the title says, how useful is something like a part time job at a store on my CV for landing an internship?

I think it sounds like a cool opportunity but I'm interested in your expert opinion. Should I take this role or seek a more traditional SWE internship?

There are a lot more SWE's than PM's, and it seems like sometimes PM roles can be quite coveted? I know that PM can be hard to break into, many firms don't even have PM interns. Also I think my technical knowledge would potentially make me a good PM, I periodically hear about business-major PM's who really don't understand the product they're managing.

Has anyone experienced both roles and can say the benefits and detriments of each? What is the career growth like on PM vs SWE? Which has a better work/life balance?

**Demographics:** White middle-class male from NY.

**School:** Competitive private school ranked top-50 in the nation as an Ivy League feeder.

**Hooks:** Legacy @ Harvard (father, grandfather).

**Intended Major(s):** Physics / Astrophysics

**ACT:** 36 (36/36/35/35); submitted to all schools.

**UW/W GPA:** 3.83/4.15, very difficult curriculum as well as grade deflation. Strong upward progression shown as I've brought my senior year GPA up to a 4.45. (School does not do class ranks.)

**Coursework:**

* **6 majors (maximum allowed) every year of high school, including:**
   * AP Computer Science: (A, 5)
   * AP Chemistry: (A-, 4)
   * AP Calculus AB: (A, 5)
   * AP Physics ""C"": (A, currently)
   * AP Chinese: (A, currently)
   * AP Calculus BC (A, currently)
   * Independent Research in Science every year.

**Awards:**

* AP Scholar with Distinction
* 3rd Place in a state-wide research symposium, with my unfinished research (from a year ago)
* Schoolwide award given for Mind and Attitude

**Extracurriculars:**

* **Research:** Did a research internship with a professor for two and a half years. Secured this position entirely on my own, through cold-emailing. Worked with her team on solutions towards finding exoplanets (planets orbiting other stars), improved a searching algorithm and demonstrated that it was twice as effective as its predecessors. Searched data with this method and found new anomalous signals originally classified as planet candidates but later found to be false positives. Her team actively uses much of my work, and I will most likely be featured as a co-author on a research paper (published in Nature, or other top scientific journals) in the coming years.
* **Music:** I compose original music. I've composed music for my school orchestra, and later played the piece with them at a school concert (as concertmaster/first cello). I've also mastered Logic Pro X, composing and producing my own music and releasing it on major streaming platforms. Proficient at piano, cello, double bass, and learning drums and guitar.
* **Charity:** Head of Public Relations at a nonprofit focused on fixing and then donating computers. So far, gotten 250 full computer systems to those in need. Recognized on local, national, and international news.
* **Varsity Football/Baseball:** Played on each for two years. No leadership positions but a strong starter in each sport.
* **Tutor:** Tutored multiple middle-school kids in my town to earn money. 

**Essays:**

* **Personal Statement (9/10):** Talked about a really tough challenge I faced and the giant shift in perspective it imposed on me. Overall, I thought I wrote well and conveyed what I wanted to convey.
* **Supplementals (7.5/10):** Overall, thought these went well. Some stood out more than others but all solidly answered the prompt and showed my maturity (I hope??) and love for exploration.

**LORs:**

* **Physics Teacher / Independent Research Program Coordinator (9/10):** He knows me really well and (hopefully??) thinks really highly of me. I know this one will be really good.
* **Math Teacher / Soccer Coach (8/10):** Did really well in his class and was a key player on his soccer team. He told me he wrote about my progression over time as he's seen me through all four years of high school.
* **History Teacher (?/10):** Completely unsure on this one. He wrote about my curiosity and about not just wanting to do well in class, but wanting to truly understand the material and get better as a person because of it. I think it'll be good but I'm not sure. Only submitted to certain schools which allowed three recs or required a Humanities rec (MIT, CalTech, etc.)
* **Research Mentor (University Professor) (10/10):** I'm pretty sure this one will be awesome. I've seen previous things she's written in recommendation of me and all of them have been glowing. Hopefully will be able to showcase the true extent of what I've done.

**Interviews (9/10):** All went pretty well, I believe. People tell me I'm personable and down-to-Earth, and hopefully that carried over as well as I think it would have into my interviews.

It sounds nice and all but I'm always wary about these sorts of alternative learning experiences, mostly because if I don't know about it an employer probably doesn't either.

Does anyone have any insights into it? How does it stack up to a traditional degree? The perks sound okay but a lot of it sounds like a bit of tomfoolery. Like they say ""competitive intern salary"" which I sort of translate to slave wages. Then it says tuition coverage but I feel like there may be minifont legal language behind that. 

But most important of all is how well the degree translates to other aspects of CS or IT. 

Any info/insights appreciated."

They said they only want “working knowledge” of front end technologies, so their standards are lower than for back end. Examples that they’ve asked are how does the front end communicate with the back end, what is a web cookie, how to send data to the front end without invoking the backend, and HTTP vs HTTPS. What are some questions of similar difficulty that they might ask? It seems like they want to make sure I have the fundamentals down. I don’t have much experience with this so I’m a bit nervous."

I have an internship next semester which can greatly improve my application. If I do well I should be able to score a solid LOR from my mentor.

9/10

**Essay**

Plan on writing an essay about my experiences related not only to my identity but the school I attend, as higher education is considered an afterthought at best at my HS (lowest ranked for academics in the district and heavily socioeconomically disadvantaged.)

My essays are generally well received, so maybe an 8/10.

**Awards:**

Deans List at Community College

Academic Excellence Awards all throughout HS (Usually on A/B Honor Roll, made my first and only C last semester)

Most Improved Member, with 500$ Scholarship (Youth Group)

**Extracurriculars:**

I spend most of my time writing and drawing a not yet published webcomic, not sure if it'll be complete by the time I apply but it is very important to me, and something I'd find joy in sharing to an AO if asked to elaborate.

I act in Theatre, sparingly.

The Dual Credit program at my school is rather new, so I am a point of contact for students if they have issues regarding scheduling, profs/etc. I also occasionally hold meetings with district coordinators if new issues arise. (Unwritten position, I just enjoy being helpful.)

African American youth group focused on entrepreneurship.

I'm in a district program which seeks to help non-profits take off within the community, we will do organizing and occasionally physical work for them.

In another district program which visits with other non-profits in order to assist them.

Will be completing an internship senior year (district level) in which I meet with a mentor each week to learn about my career path. I may also meet with county legislators and leaders, opportunity provided.

Schools:

This is where I feel the most incompetency, lol. I recently witnessed the bloodbath that was Michigan and other places, and I want to revise my list as a result. Im only going to include a few schools of top importance to me, because I seriously want to add others now, smh.

Cornell (ED) (Far Reach, I know, but I want to at least try.)

UMichigan (ED if not to Cornell, haven't decided)

Carnegie

UPitt

sfyeh0,1,2022-01-29,How do I stop feeling left out with my roommates?,goodredditname2,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/sfyeh0/how_do_i_stop_feeling_left_out_with_my_roommates/,"This year I (21f) moved in with 3 new girls as last year I had different roommates but due to Covid messing up everyone’s college timelines and we also go to a school that requires us to do internships at different points in the year it just didn’t make sense to live together again. So I started again this year with new people who I all really like and I’m fairly certain they like me. We all talk very easily and seem to have enough similar interests and all that and they always invite me to things like coffee or to do things around campus and whatnot and I do the same. But lately I’ve been feeling like the odd man out and I think it’s because they’re all way more extroverted than I am. For example, I personally can’t do my homework when I’m around other people I don’t concentrate well and I don’t do work as efficiently as I always have to do it in my room but they always do their work in the living room which gives a hard time to talk so I don’t feel pretty left out but my academics are really important to me so I don’t really wanna compromise that. Another one is they tend to party a lot more than me. I don’t mind going out once a week or so but they tend to go out 2-3 times a week and I personally don’t find that fun and I also have a condition that limits how much I can drink so sometimes going out makes me anxious anyway. But then when I don’t go out they always come back the next few days talking about things I missed out on or people they met or jokes they made and the more this happens the more left out and start to feel less in the loop and now sometimes I feel like they dont ask me as much. I do try to still do things with them when I can but I feel like my school and work schedule is much busier than there’s (and I care a lot about school due to my career being demanding ) and then I don’t party as much so I just feel left out and don’t really know what to do and I feel like it’s getting worse and worse an it’s making me kinda sad and wanna go home more."
sg0b9b,1,2022-01-29,I have a Nontraditional tech background and I'm unsure on How I choose a career path in Tech?,SlimWorksTech,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/sg0b9b/i_have_a_nontraditional_tech_background_and_im/,"TLDR towards the bottom.

**Some context about me:**

* 26 M
* Transitioned from Chef to Tech a little less than a year after the Pandemic started (2020)
* Joined a 6-month program for young adults &amp; vets that teach the foundations of IT (4 months training 7-week internship).
* Interned and ultimately hired as an Application Manager for a major financial institution (Citigroup)
* I am currently working towards my Bachelor's in Information Systems.

**Statement:**

I understand that I am very new to this industry. Maybe I shouldn't be rushing to figure out the path I want to walk. I spent so long cooking, and now everything is different. I'm happy with the choices I've made within the last two years. But it was so easy for me to figure out what kind of restaurant I wanted. The tech industry is a different beast.

During my time in the IT program, Cloud Computing and Cyber Security were the main career paths I initially keened in on (that program also offers a Cloud and Cybersec program). I know those two career paths are just an umbrella term for a large number of careers that I'm not going to type here. Now that I'm learning Information Systems, a career as a Systems Analyst or Business Analyst seem pretty cool too. I've also started dabbling in some free online Data Science courses. I haven't gotten to my programming course (that's next semester), I feel like when I do, that would be another career path to think about. Not to mention QA, Networking, etc...

**TLDR:** From the umbrella terms of CyberSec and Cloud Computing, Data Science, Software Engineering, QA, BA, other analytical roles, Networking... You get the picture. How does one find and stick to a career path in technology? How have you found your path, and what made you stick to it? I know I shouldn't be rushing it, and I'm trying not to, but I want to understand how I should hone in on a focus before I graduate.

If you made it this far, thank you. I truly appreciate it, and I look forward to reading your replies.

sg0wyf,18,2022-01-29,Some words of encouragement,spookeths,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/sg0wyf/some_words_of_encouragement/,"Here's what I've learned in my job search experience: some companies have horrible HR and horrible interviewers. OAs and interviews are often unfair. The process stacks the odds against the interviewees and it's just draining to keep applying and getting rejected. 

\*\*\* However, job search is as much luck as it is skill. 

I admit I'm not as good at coding as many of my peers. I don't always leetcode from dawn to dusk nor do I have much intern experience. I was also pretty sure I would have to go to grad school to delay getting a job if I couldn't find one. Miraculously, I got a pretty good job. So if a failure like me can do it, so can you. It may feel like the number of applications only grows and the number of responses doesn't. That's probably true, but if you just get one chance grab it and hold on for dear life. Study typical topics like data structures and algorithms, idk look at some advice people post about organizing leetcode problems, and prepare for the behavioral even if you want to just breeze through it (pretty sure I flopped at a company because the behavioral guy didn't like me even though technical went pretty well). 

Sometimes it really just is that one easy interviewer and a series of fortunate events. And even if an interview goes poorly, take it as experience. The more interviews the more used to the bs they put you through you'll be. 

So don't worry too much and take a deep breath. Don't let your self-confidence be dragged down by this dumb process we go through. You got this!! It'll be okay!!!"
sg11xj,18,2022-01-29,has engineering ruined my life?,Low-Connection21,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/sg11xj/has_engineering_ruined_my_life/,"I'll probably delete this in an hour, but because I am feeling particularly pathetic and weak I'm gonna post my sob story to the internet. I am a 21 year old male engineering student. Before I started pursuing this degree I had friends, I felt good about myself, and I was excited for the future. Fast forward three years and I have lost virtually all contact with my old friends, I haven't had a girlfriend or even really spoken to a female in 3 years, and I just feel dead inside every day. I've been taking the max credit amount every semester so I can save myself money, and any free chance I have I am either working an internship or a teaching role. Basically my entire life has become engineering and math. I feel like this process has slowly sucked the life out of me and I regret doing it but I am too far in to stop now. I feel like I am so alone and I have nobody to talk to that will understand how I feel. I am beginning to hate myself and my decision to pursue this degree. I used to be so curious about the world and eager to jump into the work force - but now that I have seen what its like I just wish I could go back in time and scream at myself. Nothing in life is worth more than your relationships and your self confidence. No amount of money can replace those things. One of the hardest things about my situation is that my roommates are not engineering majors, their parents are paying for their education, and they just don't understand me. They think I've been some virgin/nerd/antisocial/loser my entire life. I try to pretend like I'm not completely dead inside when I am around them, but there have been times where they'll stand in my doorway and ask me ""if I'm doing alright."" Like I can tell they know, and have been talking/gossiping about me. They are good people and they mean well, I just don't have a lot in common with them.

Because I am a problem-solver at heart, I have went to extensive lengths to try and regain my old self confidence back, but nothing has worked. I have reached out to old friends, tried going out to parties, but I found myself even more disappointed and depressed when I would get back to house and realize how much of my life I've thrown away chasing this stupid degree. For a dopamine boost I payed 600 dollars to go skydiving - something that I have dreamed of doing since I was a child. When I jumped out of the plane and I was looking down at the ground 10,000 ft below me...I felt nothing. No sense of danger, no sense of excitement or accomplishment once it was over, nothing. 

What the fuck is wrong with me?

I don't really know what to do at this point. Sometimes I tell myself things will be better after I graduate college, but I know logically that doesn't make any sense. College is the easiest place to make friends, and meet a soulmate. If I cant do it here, I probably never will.

TLDR : Engineering school makes me big sad. Searching for an echo chamber of more broken people to support my delusional thoughts."

Reflections: I think obviously don’t let your parents control your essays lol. But if there’s no way out of it just roll with it. But get your essays reviewed by teachers and friends in college, they give great advice. 

In terms of friends going to better schools, don’t let that make you feel bad, but use it as motivation. It may seem hard now but to some extent what you do in college will matter more than where you go. My friend got into MIT CS and he is def smarter than me, but I’m still proud of the fact that I have intern/work experience and have a small network already whereas he doesn’t. In other words be proud of what you’ve done if the other person hasn’t. 

ECs were also a weak point for me. To solidify them do internships(industry or research). Cold email and pull every connection you can. Also show commitment to your ECs unlike me. You can do competitions, they def help, but I was never interested in those due to my interest in cs coming late. 

Social Stigma: Regarding the same friend that got into MIT and those who got into some the schools I got rejected from, my parents got mad at me that why I wasn’t like them and how I’m a waste to the world. They went on to say that I should kms. They have also told all of our family friends that I am stupid. To clarify, I do think they said this out of jealousy and just a spur of anger from getting rejected/deferred from top schools. But I have far better parents than most. And as Asian parents do they compare you to others, younger of older people. My way of dealing with this was watching stand up comedy. Stand up is very insightful, and they def have experienced more life than I have lol. They are a source motivation for me so to say. 

Be better than before: my previous internship was able to network me an interview with a Fortune 100 as an swe intern. It was coding interview and I was able to pass and got the position. It is a paid position. My point is is to keep reaching higher, it will work out in the end. Build a strong resume and network in college to make this even easier.

Thanks for reading, good luck on the rest of your apps all of you."

I'd like to become a good dev, get a good job and make good money. I guess my first goal is to actually get into the industry. Eventually I'd like to work for FANG. 

The paths I can think of right now are: 

1. Going to a top Uni in the UK in 2023, aged 24, graduating 27. (Oxbridge, Imperial, UCL, Kings. I prefer to live in London so it will probably be one of the London ones) and doing the normal stuff of getting my degree, doing internships and grinding leetcode.
2. Theres also a minor chance I could go to a less popular Russell group uni in 2022, graduating at 26.
3. Just sitting down right now and learning independently, maybe doing a bootcamp. Trying to get my first job. 

**What do you think is the better option for me?**

I'm currently leaning towards the top uni route, but the time it takes is a slight concern. So I have some further questions.

Would I generally be a better dev coming out of uni in 2026 with internships, or self teaching, getting employment within the next 2 years, and having 2YOE in 2026?

Am I limiting my career in any way further down the line by not getting a degree? 

I'm also kinda embarrassed about my age. I wish I had sorted my shit out earlier and didn't have to factor the time it takes to do things and my age into my decisions.

I just need the thoughts of some other people, so thanks."

I am in 1st year and coz of everything being online I have so many doubts (maybe due to lack of senior interaction in the college hence no seniors to guide).

So, even though I have NOT yet explored and tried out CP yet, I am quite sure I don't like it. I mean I don't like the idea of solving problems which don't exist/unnecessary hard problems. I think I am inclined towards Development (coz it's practical, why not build real products which adds value). And I like contributing to open source too.

(Although on the other hand I also like problem solving but where's the value in that? Except me who else will be benefitted?)

What will I be missing if I do Development more seriously than CP? I mean I will definitely try CP also but I'll focus on one thing more.

What I currently ""think"" CP will do (pls correct me coz everything I know is ""heard"" from internet):

* If we do CP, then tech interviews/coding rounds will be a cakewalk.
* Big MNCs give direct call (interview) to good CP'ers.
* Looks good on CV obv

&amp;#x200B;

So what should be done? I also feel that if I give my heart to development then I can do really good but I cannot say the same for CP as there are much better problem solver people than me. Also the lack of interest.

So to what extent is CP necessary?

I understand that I will have to grind Leetcode (DSA) for the job which I have absolutely NO problem with. I just don't think I should spend my time and energy to even try unnecessary hard DSA CP problems. (it's just my opinion tho, no harsh feelings for CP people)

\*Priorities: Placement and internships oriented, my college is decent tier 1.5 ish but I am from core branch (although my seniors from Placement Cell say that except *American Express* all companies are open for all branches in my college, Idk how true/false is that)

\*By development I mean Software, Web, Mobile Development --  basically building things."

I felt like I've been bombing the 4 interviews I had thus far and would like to get some advice and help. 

The interviews are somewhat technical in the sense that it's focused on my projects and the interviewer going through in detail the technical requirement of the intern role first. The interviewers were all technical staff.

I had thought of a script in which I will at least go through my introduction, motivations and projects first. However, I remember getting cut off and the interviewer talked a lot about the job scope and work done at the company for one of the interview. They mentioned a lot of technologies, software and terms I didn't know about and I froze up essentially for the entirety of the interview.

Has anyone managed to get an internship when you know absolutely nothing / little about the technologies used in the role? If so, what did you do during / after the internship?

Another situation I face is that the technical portion of the interview is short because I only have projects / details to talk about for let's say 2 / 5 of their skills requirement. Should I try to shift the focus towards non-technical aspects like asking about culture, expectations, challenges etc or talk about my not so relevant projects?

Overall, the feeling I get is a mismatch between my projects and the technical skills required for the internship but I really want a role in SWE, ML, data analytics or database even though I know peanuts.

However now I'm hearing Grokking the coding interview is a really good course as well so should I switch over to it and replace it with CTCI?? Doing both wouldn't be a viable option as I'll have to start applying for internships around May/June.

Thanks in advance much love

Edit: Looks like I'll be switching to Grokking. Good luck to yall :)"

sgdr9i,1,2022-01-30,Road to 6 figures in Cyber Security out of College,Intelligent_Ad_7692,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/sgdr9i/road_to_6_figures_in_cyber_security_out_of_college/," 

I recently graduated college in summer of 2021. At the time I had another vision of what I wanted to do with my future, but had an onslaught of issues arise that put everything on hold. For the next few until October I was forced to take a step back in life and forced to remain in bed and rest because of health issues. After that time I started to go outside again and go on walks to build strength even if it was a little walk. Soon after my father had me work for him(Not in tech) and didn't really give me much of a choice to go out and apply for jobs in the cyber security field. After about 2 months at the end of 2021 I told him I couldn't help him because it didn't pertain to my career path and I wasn't earning enough.

Start of 2022 I put a goal to land a job by Q2 of this year but more oriented around obtaining a job by Q1 of this year. In all of 2021 I applied for jobs but never got a message back from an employer saying they wanted to do an interview or anything about proceeding. By the first week and a half of 2022 I got my first interview in with a small software development company in South Florida. I was pumped! I had my first interview and they put me forward with an IT assessment, which was more than what I could understand. The assessment was in dev ops and I have no prior coding knowledge. But I am happy because I learned a lot and it was a stepping stone forward to learn more. In that time I learned about Reddit and much of a resource it is to answer all questions and learn.

Since then I have received my first job opportunity in the Help Desk Position, but turned it down because how low they offered me($10 to start then went up to $15). I also have companies responding and have had 2 interviews that are still in the process of the pipeline. I've been working on applying to as many jobs as I could especially in companies I feel I could grow with. Now I am in the screening process with Oracle as a Hospitality Hotel Cloud- Customer Service Analyst. I believe this could be the start of a position with growth in a big tech Company like Oracle and would look good on my resume as a first job. I am happy with everything but surprised the salary is close to $45,000-$55,000 for the positions I am looking at.

Since I am having a hard time to get that entry level position in cyber security and hence was going in more of a help desk position just to get my foot in the door and work my way up from there. I want to navigate and be more concentrated in cyber security or any brach on tech that will get my on the route to six figures along with growth opportunity. Even if this is engineering or coding. I wanted to reach on the Reddit community in the cyber security industry and see how I could grow to obtain 6 figures a year close to out of college. I had one internship in college as an IT Troubleshooter. From what I was reading getting experience really helps for your resume, but if I'm having a hard time getting that first job even on the lower end I'm not sure what to do. From what I've gathered certs are a big asset. I was also thinking about going to get my masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a concentration in Cyber Security from University of Miami.

Now I am healthy, ready to grow, learn and obtain my first job. By becoming as knowledgeable as I could in the cyber security and tech field. I am willing to relocate if needed to obtain this goal of being successful and earning six figures. Would it be recommended to get as many certs as possible ASAP? Or should I look into getting my masters? I am located in South Florida, not sure if this is hub for cyber, but curious what everyone thinks. Additionally should I learn any coding that would be an asset? Even any books that could help. I am very eager to get started on this journey forward and willing to grind, at the same time get a salary that compensates for my grind and effort. Any and all resources recommended help!

Any feedback helps, Thank you!"

I graduate in one month (march 1st) and I am unsure what my next step should be. To give some background information, my grades are average but my transcripts aren't, they suck. I had some issues during my sophomore and junior year that made my mental state negative and It was difficult to push myself. The whole covid issue made things worse (of course). That being said I love to learn but what shows on paper, people might think the complete opposite. I’ve known for a while that I want to go to college. I’ve decided on computer science (I'm thinking about changing my major) but this post isn't about what I should change my major to.

 When I started looking for universities back during the summer and fall, I tried looking for ones that allowed me not to submit test scores, ones that had a lower acceptance rate, and ones that had a high graduation rate ( I want to mention these are all colleges near and in the New England region). So when December came around I applied to the ones I felt I had the best chances with. The thing is I had moved early september, so I had to go to a different high school. My transcripts from my first school didn’t go through to a majority of the applications. At this point I became unmotivated and felt like giving up, I just decided not to try and fix the applications. Having felt like that I decided that I would go to a community college and take a 2 year transfer program. Meaning I would either have to live with my mom or rent an apartment that the community college is partnered with. I honestly just settled and I had to be okay with that decision. I have nothing against community college and I would be completely fine with community college but that means I'd have to stay in Iowa for 2 more years and possibly have to stay with my mom (if she doesn’t kick me out). 

Fast forward to the beginning of January, I got an email from Quinnipiac university. I was accepted and I got a dean's scholarship of $18,000 a year which equals $72,000 for all four years. So I made sure that I had my fafsa sent and I got a total of $33,860 which is just the first year. Honestly I didn’t expect to get that much, I didn’t expect to even get in. So it came as a huge surprise to me and It's making me really think about taking it.

 I made a pro and con list for each option.

Quinnipiac 
Pros
Move to Connecticut
No Rent (dorm)
Dean's Scholarship
More Opportunities (Location, connections, Internships)
Cons
DEBT
Commitment to studies 
May be difficult to balance school and work
Cost of living high in area
Job isn’t guaranteed 

Community College
Pros
Cheaper
Flexible schedule
Smaller classes
Can transfer after two years
Cons
Stay w/ mom
May have to pay rent (harder to save)
Smaller classes
Stay in Iowa for 2 years
May be difficult to move later
Job isn’t guaranteed

(There are probably more but this is just what I came up with)


The reason why staying with my mom is a con is because our relationship isn’t the best. She's not neglectful or abusive, nothing like that. She has some mental issues and I'm not sure but I have a feeling it's bpd. I can’t diagnose her and I'm not going to say that's what it is but things in the past have influenced her to be this way. She has mood swings and a lot of times she will start attacking me (verbally) about the most random stuff that isn’t relevant. A lot of these issues with her didn’t start getting bad until around 8th grade but there were always signs of it. I just didn’t see it because I was too young to understand. We get into fights a lot and I will say shit that's bad and she will say shit that's bad and the next day everything is okay and fine. But I don’t want to be angry anymore. Recently I’ve been working on not responding when she gets that way or if I get angry I use one of my outlets so that I don’t have to engage in an argument. She goes on these rants about other people and about her money and I'm at the point where if I hear her going on a rant it makes me so upset and I start freaking out. I am at a loss of what to do because If she doesn’t want help then I can’t help her and I know that now. There is a lot more to this situation but it's just so hard to explain.

She makes me feel so uncomfortable as well. I feel like I have to walk on eggshells. When I said she attacks me, it could be for something as simple as having a sock in my door (actually happened). There's so much I'm afraid to do or say in case she starts to get mad and goes on a rant. I just feel like I can’t talk to her about stuff I need to.

My privacy, I love my privacy. It is so important to me, there are things that I like to just keep to myself but my mom loves to invade my space and go through my stuff. She cleans a lot, she's a huge clean freak and I keep my room clean and she knows that but she still likes to go through it. I feel so embarrassed when she does because I don't want her to find stuff that I have in my room. Because I won’t lie, I have embarrassing stuff in my room. I don't want to feel ashamed anymore and especially not by my mom. If I do move out it would make me grow so much as a person and make me so much more comfortable with myself.

My dad on the other hand. We aren't the closest. I grew up seeing him every two weeks and as I got older I stopped seeing him as much. He started dating this one girl when I was twelve and they got married in 2019 I think. She has a daughter and while a few years ago it hurt seeing that my dad was kinda close with her daughter, now I’m okay with it. I realized that I don't think I even like my dad as a person. It seems harsh but I don’t know how to feel honestly. My dad always had something to say about me (still does) especially when I was younger, which is a very impressionable age. He would say I'm weird and sometimes he would look at me like he wasn’t proud and so I became more closed off as a person, at least towards certain people. Those things really stuck with me and so I started becoming the quiet girl when I knew that I wanted to be the confident girl. He would then start commenting on the fact that I was quiet and wouldn’t talk and part of it was because I just didn’t feel like talking to him or his wife and the other part was that I was scared to be looked at like an idiot. Now being 18, I've started genuinely thinking about our relationship, and how I felt about it. Right now he thinks I'm going to community college. I've decided not to say anything about this qunnipiac offer because usually I’d say something and then it never happens and I look stupid. But even if I did tell him, he would try to make that decision seem stupid or try to get me to stay in Iowa. I am a very inspired person, I love to try things and I have a very open mind whereas my dad is the opposite (my mom is kinda on the same page and me in terms of adventure). I don’t want my dad's opinion because I don’t want to feel like my decisions are dumb. I don’t want to be looked at like I don’t know what I'm talking about. Maybe moving away and learning to do even more things would help me become more confident. What I'm getting at is that he isn't an option for me to stay and he Isn’t going to be able to help me with college payments.

I know that this decision needs to be made by me and me only. I also understand that I will have to face the consequences of my choice, so I want to make sure that I can get as much advice before I make any decisions. I still have a lot of time to think about it (deposit isn’t due until may 1st). If anyone has any advice or more things to think about I would appreciate it so much. I wish so much that I didn’t have to worry about things like debt because that would make this decision so much easier, but I do. That Is probably my biggest fear right now if I were to attend Quinnipiac, but If I will be able to be okay after uni, then I don’t want to make a decision fully on that.

If anyone has any questions that might help in giving advice please feel free to ask."

I've decided not to say anything about this qunnipiac offer because usually I’d say something and then it never happens and I look stupid. But even if I did tell him, he would try to make that decision seem stupid or try to get me to stay in Iowa. I am a very inspired person, I love to try things and I have a very open mind whereas my dad is the opposite (my mom is kinda on the same page and me in terms of adventure). I don’t want my dad's opinion because I don’t want to feel like my decisions are dumb. I don’t want to be looked at like I don’t know what I'm talking about. Maybe moving away and learning to do even more things would help me become more confident. What I'm getting at is that he isn't an option for me to stay and he Isn’t going to be able to help me with college payments.

I know that this decision needs to be made by me and me only. I also understand that I will have to face the consequences of my choice, so I want to make sure that I can get as much advice before I make any decisions. I still have a lot of time to think about it (deposit isn’t due until may 1st). If anyone has any advice or more things to think about I would appreciate it so much. I wish so much that I didn’t have to worry about things like debt because that would make this decision so much easier, but I do. That Is probably my biggest fear right now if I were to attend Quinnipiac, but If I will be able to be okay after uni, then I don’t want to make a decision fully on that.

If anyone has any questions that might help in giving advice please feel free to ask."

So many times I see the ""will you require sponsorship in the future?"" and the company doesn't sponsor Visas and I am like, I don't know what to do. The worst is that I go to a great school, so I can do research and take a few summer classes which would be great for me (as I want to do so many things in college) and I already know that it is a great decision. However, everytime another one of my friends get an internship, a lot worse if it is a international first-year too, I start applying to tons of places for no reason. Why am I so competitive and cannot accept the fact that not getting an internship as a Freshman is okay?"

I know I definitely want to pursue a Computer Science PhD, but right now my GPA is shit (3.43) and I’ve only had one summer of research (and our paper got rejected). This summer I’m also not doing research because I need to take a high paying internship because I’m poor lol. 

I’m currently not sure whether I should go MS -&gt; PhD or straight to PhD. I’ve been told that doing a Master’s if you want to ultimately do a PhD in CS is worthless, but I’m afraid I’ll be rejected everywhere I apply (I’ve already decided I’m definitely not shooting for any T20 programs) because lack of research + GPA and doing a Master’s might give me more experience. The only issue is that I come from a low income background (nearly full ride at current college) and I’ll be taking out an estimated 50-80k of loans just to pad my resume for applying for a PhD.


I don’t really know that much about grad school and I’m pretty new to this whole thing so any advice would be appreciated (even if its general advice!) Thanks :)

It's my first post here and after reading I figured out that this thread is for casual questions like mine. If by any way my post goes against the rules I apologise and will cooperate with moderators/admins.  


My story:

(23 year old male, no previous computer background, including no CS degree or money to get one)

I've been enrolled on a python course, which supposedly will teach us full-stack web dev and we are currently doing algorhitm exercises with functions, matrixes, stacks and queues. Next month we will start learning OOP concepts and such. We are constantly being told that we need to create a good git hub profile with example projects, which we build on our own. In no way however do our materials cover such project homeowrks or ideas. All we have are algorhitm exercises. Our course is aimed at teaching us some Django and some JS on the web module.

I have been checking some example python internships and junior dev job ads and I am left marvelling how will I ever be able to get a Python job. Every junior position requires minimum 2+ years of experience with Python, Django, some DBMS and a load of other unfamiliar stuff like RESTful API.   


My problem:

What would be correct of me to do, given my current circumstances? I went to Django webpage but all of the installation instructions about using apache with mod\_wsgi or using NGiNX with uWSGI and setting up different virtual environments with different settings for each project seemed a bit overwhelming.  Did I do wrong by trying to learn programming? I started my learning in september last year, but so far what I have learned does not even pass for basics and I am now insecure about the future.

Questions numbered for easier reading:

1) Can you give me any career advice? Like what sort of projects should I start building for github while still learning? 

2) What side stuff will help if I learn them? 

3) Any particular learning projects, which I can build from scratch? Because there are tons of resources online, but the example projects are ridiculously dfficult and copying step by step tutorials is useless, it does not provide any learning at all.

4) Any opinion/advice is welcome, even if it is harsh in nature (such as if you think I'm not cut out to be a programmer) as long as there is a logical explanation behind it.

&amp;#x200B;

Final thoughts:

Anyone who managed to reach the bottom of this comment, thank you for taking your time and consideration in reading this question.

Best wishes,

Python noob"

sgjo27,0,2022-01-30,A lost CS junior student needs serious help from veterans!,ZAK_2000,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/sgjo27/a_lost_cs_junior_student_needs_serious_help_from/,"Greetings to all my CS enthusiastic fellows! I am a Computer Science undergrad currently in the 6th semester (starting from coming Wednesday). 


For a little background, I want to tell you that I am passionate about technology since my school days and therefore I took CS in college (high school) and fortunately also get enrolled myself in CS in one of the best CS universities (college) of my country. 


Cutting a little short, after trying different things and having different experiences, I realized my interest is less in actual development (programming/coding) but more towards management and designing side. I'm a person who enjoys the whole process(SDLC) with a holistic approach. In my last summer break, I also tried a little bit of UI/UX with Figma. In a nutshell, I concluded after 2 years of exploration and experimentation that I'm into three fields mainly i.e. Project management, UX engineering, Data Science (like NLP). Business Analysis kind of things also. One thing worth mentioning is I did programming(usually for semester projects/assignments) in C/C++, Python, Java. Also, have some recent experience with web development (HTML/CSS/JS and React.js). Among all of them, my sweet spot can be the MERN stack(thinking to learn the whole stack).


Recently, I got an offer of a remote internship as a project coordinator for a newly emerging company. At the same time, I have a plan to start UI/UX designing properly by building a nice portfolio then getting an internship in a good company in the coming summer break, and even thinking to hunt for my first job in this field after graduation(mid of 2023). But then I discussed this all with my university senior who now have almost 2 years of work experience as a Software Engineer in a good company. He knows me for a long time( since my first semester). I'm trying to summarize what he said in more than one hour, that is don't try to become a jack of all but master of one and leave all this useless stuff and just do programming in Java or Python religiously for at least 100 days. Then kickstart your start career as an engineer/developer. This one-hour talk changed my mind completely and I had to reconsider everything from the start. I talked previously with another person and he said just chill and do whatever you like and go with the flow and become good at any one thing. 


The first person is just making me realize that I've rejected myself for the development side because of self-doubt and low self-esteem. And he's just making things more contextualized to my city and country. Like many other places in the world, here you need Java or JavaScript mainly to make good money. And there are always multiple openings in development in many local and international companies mainly of .NET, MERN, MEAN, Spring, RoR, etc. But Java is still the backbone of enterprise-level software, so Java developers are usually hired as Software Engineers then also have great long-term career growth relatively. He also said you're not that creative to shift your career completely to graphic designing/visual art( which I also don't want). This is the same reason I stop designing interfaces with Figma just after a few days because It makes my degree and all this hefty amount of money and learning questionable. 


According to that person, I need to stop all designing and management stuff and focus on my core programming which I never did. What he means is to do some good amount of Leetcoding or alternative to get a good job. 


Usually, every student gets worried about their career during or after the third year but they are confused because they know nothing good. But I'm confused because I know many things I guess(nothing to flex just surface-level knowledge).


What I want to ask is should I join that internship? that I mentioned above. It is paid but the stipend amount is negligible like around 60$ per month but I've to work remotely for about 20 hours per week. Secondly, what would be a better decision to go with UI/UX a.k.a Product design sometimes, or follow local industry trends and become proficient in development. Considering I can't risk my career because of some serious personal financial issues.


P.s. Mainly, my issue is that one minute I'm like I know everything and I'm the next billionaire and the other minute I'll feel like I'm the dumbest person on the planet. The major obstacles in my journey are procrastination, lack of confidence, lack of consistency, premature optimization, fear of failure, and time/energy management. Our university is famous for daily grinding and it is responsible for my current mental state and I face serious burnouts often. 


Ending with a huge thanks. I know this is quite long but please your single word will be valuable for me."

I'm stuck in life, addicted to comfort.

As I have read on reddit the other day, give a weak person some constant stimulation, good food and cheap entertainment, they'll throw their dreams right out of the window. This is my exact situation.

Was a competitive kid throughout my early life, and was always interested to learn more out of curiosity. Once I entered college, I just slacked off and just tried to pass the courses. Was a compsci major. With some solid loan to pay off, and 0 internships throughout college, I'm unemployed right now. The worst part is I'm not motivated to try. I feel guilty about wasting my parents' hard earned money. I just feel that I'm stuck in a loop which I cannot escape.

I just keep thinking, but cannot execute anything. I developed severe anxiety too because of this situation. There are always thoughts racing in the mind.

Has anyone been at a similar place before? please share your experience

Please share some advice guys.

Thanks for reading until here!

Don't lose hope guys! You got this. We are all in this race together. It's just a matter of time!"
sgllf1,4,2022-01-30,I'm thinking of quitting my job this week. Does this sound rational?,No_Birthday_9304,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/sgllf1/im_thinking_of_quitting_my_job_this_week_does/,"I'm a relatively new software developer with \~2 YOE (1.5 in my current role, 8 months worth of internships).  I'm currently working for a small company as a Python systems developer.  It's my first role since I finished university.  

&amp;#x200B;

My job is to write scripts, mainly in Python, that are used to sync up the company's various business systems, or based on ad-hoc requests from the finance or sales teams.  

&amp;#x200B;

Although my job title has ""developer"" in it, I don't actually work on the company's core product, rather I develop these scripts.  However, I only develop about 70% of the time; the remaining 30% of my job is to act as a sort of an internal support person to help others with the company's subscription management software (which I really don't like).  It's also an unusual role in that the team consists of only me and my boss.

&amp;#x200B;

My current job pays 77,500 CAD.  I just got an offer for a full-time developer job with the federal government for about 5k more.  The type of work I would be doing is apparently in Java using SpringBoot.  I am not much of a web developer and have never touched SpringBoot though I'm familiar with Java.

&amp;#x200B;

I love my job - company culture is great, boss is a nice dude, doesn't put too much pressure on me, encourages me to learn other technologies on work time.  But this offer is also a really good one and seems more sustainable than my current role.

&amp;#x200B;

I am racking my brains trying to figure out of this is a good idea, or if I'm making a huge mistake.  Can someone give me a reality check?  What would you do?

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Pros of quitting\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\* My current job is a ""developer"" job but I haven't been learning much, and I only actually ""develop"" sometimes.  I have enjoyed the confort and ease of the job, but I feel I'm not growing all that much as a software developer.

\* My current job involves a decent amount of non-SWE work.  Sometimes (but not always) I'm tasked with helping people out with the subscription manager.  I don't really like this because it's non-SWE work, and also because I've had screw ups with it that I feel made me look bad (I'm not an accountant!)

\* New job pays about 5k more than my current role

\* New job is a permanent, full-time government job, so very good job security and defined payscale increases

\* With the current job, because it's only me and my boss, I sometimes feel an unspoken pressure to work overtime evenings and weekends.  Wouldn't be the case with the new job

\* I'd be learning a new technology with the new job, so opportunity for growth.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Cons of leaving\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\* Current job is full-time WFH, new one is not.

\* My current company's culture is really nice and they've treated me well.  When I was job hunting, they were in the top 10 places I wanted to work so I feel very lucky to be there and have the job that I have.

\* I feel guilty because quitting means my boss would now be alone in our team, which is mission-critical to the company, so he would no longer be able to take vacations until my replacement is hired and trained.

\* I feel I haven't been in my current role long enough to quit (about 18 months).

\* Though my current job hasn't fostered growth for me, it's easy and I get to call myself a developer on my resume.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm terrified at the prospect of leaving a job of my own accord for the first time.  Please, someone tell me if I'm making a mistake."

I am a PCMB student and although I'm going to appear for JEE and probably NEET too next year I don't think my heart lies in either of those streams. And the thought of spending the rest of my life doing something I am not even interested in the first place, really disturbs me.

Is this real? Is this a common practice or a red flag?"

Why must I grind my way into a profession, while my mental health gets chipped away semester by semester ? 

Honestly I feel like there’s some sort of a pride that teachers take into making the program as hard as can be, so that only the really dedicated remain. The biggest issue tho, is that some other people could have been great engineers, but the way it was presented to them killed their interest."

Can I be picky?",WookieChemist,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/sgsrc1/student_no_industry_experience_looking_for_summer/,"So I am a second year at a prestigious university going for a BS in CS. I love computer science and am really doing well in my classes. I plan to graduate next Spring, but for right now I am looking for a Summer internship. I like to believe I have a very wide range of knowledge in CS. Beyond what university is teaching me, I also have taken side courses in cloud services (AWS), SQL &amp; databases, full stack web development + a little bit of react and next.js. Various other frameworks for random things. Lots of javascript, java, python experience...etc

So I am at a point where I really want to work for a specific FANG company to work on software engineering for the metaverse. Software engineering, cloud solutions, or VR/AR/XR technology. I like to think that I have the ambition and the drive to excel in such a position and my hope is that after my internship, I might be offered a full time position. I also think that I have decent qualifications overall EXCEPT for lack of industry experience. I can't put anything besides ice cream scooper for ""previous work experience"". So do I have the ability to be picky?

Ideally I would love to work somewhere in my city, or remotely, but I MIGHT be okay with moving to a big tech city. It depends on the position I can score.

The alternative is to just grind through various websites and LinkedIn for internship opportunities and just apply to all of them and hope that after all the interviews and everything, I have a couple half decent positions I get to choose from. What do you guys think? I'd love more input!"

I am incredibly alone, I fucked up 2 years of my college education, and in doing so, all my friends finished and left either abroad (6 of my group friends are in the same city together in France) or just finished and started an internship somewhere. 
And I feel so alone in the college town I'm in, I don't have people to socialize with and Im left with my thoughts qnd anxiety 24/7 and if that's a battle, it's one I'm losing, I'm chronically depressed and anxious, and the gateways I had to deflect from it are gone, I don't like spending time in my home city as I feel super guilty when Im with my parents knowing the level of disappointment I caused them, and I hate running into people from high-school or childhood and teen years friends (I just encountered an old friend who asked me what I was up to  and the moment I mentioned the town where I study, he said dam you've been there forever).
The thing I hate is that not only I feel alone, I also can't vent to someone and when I start feeling sorry for myself, I remember that no one from my friends when alone or going thru something have come to me, so I guess my loneliness is justified as I don't find someone to talk to just like I haven't been someone to talk for the people I'm supposedly close to.

2)In aerospace engineering its said both co-op and internship is offered so who will be the recruiters/employers/companies we would be working for for?

3)I heard online that Pratt and Whitney Canada is one of the recruiter. So do i need to have Canadian citizenship to work for them during college and after college.

4)Are Aerospace Engineering related jobs in Canada very rare or is it hard to find a job. 

5)What is the overall fees (in CAD) for the entire course for Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering

6)*this one is out of the college topic part.... Will i be able to get a Canadian citizenship before my 4 year Bachelor's course

I would be really glad if u could answer all these question and im really really really sorry for disturbing anyone with so many questions 😅😅 i hope you can help me out here

Letters of Recommendation

Physics teacher: 0/10. He's good with me and probably wrote a great LoR but I was confused by the portal into thinking the LoR was submitted when it actually wasn't. I only found out on January 1 and he sent it the next day so I'm pretty sure GT and Purdue never saw it :(

Biology teacher: 10/10 I help her with errands all the time and I'm inclined to believe she likes my participation in class. Did not submit to EA schools however.

&amp;#x200B;

Interviews

Rice alumni interview: 8/10. Nothing out of the ordinary. Talked about Rice and my profile.

Essays

Common App prompt #2: The lessons we take from obstacles we encounter can be fundamental to later success. Recount a time when you faced a challenge, setback, or failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?

Somewhat cliché (yet true) essay about being a timid kid and growing to become a good public speaker.

Supplementary Essays: I honestly believe my EA essays were very good, and I got them reviewed by my school's counsellor (who agreed with me). I don't know about my RD essays since I had to rush them to make room for my midterms. I found a great reason to pursue Computer science (computational linguistics) and made my why major essays about it.

* ASU (60k scholarship)
* GSU (in-state tuition so only end up paying 35k total)

EDIT: I applied to Tech as a BME major since my profile had no CS activities, but was able to easily switch to CS.

As the number of RD apps probably indicate, I had zero confidence about getting into GT so ended up applying to a lot more reach schools, but something clearly worked and I plan to attend next fall."

My current situation is this. I'm a junior in computer science at Purdue, and I qualify for a program that would allow me to get a graduate degree within an extra year (5 years instead of 4 years). I can get my tuition fully reimbursed by doing a TAship. I don't have any internships (summers were busy) and my project portfolio is quite lacking. By doing one, I can get an internship in between graduating senior year, and I get some time to polish up on leetcode and my project portfolio (otherwise I would be applying beginning of next semester). I'm also an international student, and getting it would give me an easier way to a work visa (h1b). It will probably also help me land my first job and have some benefit down the line (not sure how much exactly).

However, I'm not personally too interested at all in staying in school for another year (I'd rather just start working), and I'd also not get too much academically out of it, as I will be avoiding the more difficult classes to make sure I graduate (if I don't graduate within 5 years I get kicked out of the program). I'm also unlikely to take many classes on machine learning (a field where having a masters is very helpful). In addition, I'm an international student but I'm not from China or India, so if a company is willing to sponsor me I can directly try and get a green card.

Does anyone have any advice or insight? I get that it's ultimately my decision but I'd like to hear other people's opinions as well. Mostly on how much it will help having an internship in landing my first job and in the future as well."

The contract is ending and the boss is offering $50K/annum with salary recognition being possible in 6 months time.

I have applied for another spot and they're offering a free 12 week coding bootcamp for a software developer with a guaranteed job at their partner companies ( more 'prestigious' than my current startup). I like the idea of learning these more technical skills/languages compared to the low/no code stuff I'm currently doing. The pay starts $50k/annually with increases every 6 months till I reach $75K by the end of the 18 month contract. I so understand it would be very difficult and it would require a lot of ongoing effort even after the 12 weeks.

I'm a bit lost, I feel the current $50k offered is pretty low by my boss eventhough I enjoy the environment, I already sacrificed a lot the last 2 yrs by working on almost minimum wage (i live in Australia).

So basically I'm unsure if I should stay on for another 1-2 yrs and then move onto a 90k+ role or if I should go to the bootcamp and get out of my comfort zone to learn new set of skills and potentially be more attractive to an employer.

Any advice would be great help!

TLDR: feel ripped off slightly by boss but should i continue for another couple years to gain experience and leave or take a leap of faith to learn new skills (coding) and earn slightly more in the short term and potentially longer term as well."

I have to keep up with multiple MS teams accounts (and you can't stay logged in to both at once), multiple emails, and there are times when I attend meetings on one project only to immediately have one in another.  To add to this I'm a non-traditional student who never had to do things like keep multiple classes organized or have assignments no one else does, and I'm kind of wishing I had done that part before already (honestly the code isn't as hard as treating my work flow as its own project)

I can tell this need to go back and forth is pretty common, especially for senior devs (I see it as good training).  But I really need a system to document and organize things.  I would like to keep it simple like a daily notes list (I'm using a scratch pad right now) but thought I would ask if anyone has anything extra that really works for them above having a scratch pad.

sh4og5,144,2022-01-31,Something followed me from a Psychiatric Hospital,TomrummetsKald,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/sh4og5/something_followed_me_from_a_psychiatric_hospital/,"Someone from r/Paranormal told me to post this experience here, so here we go.

So, I caught a lot of shit for this story in another sub, thus I removed it. But this is a personal experience and what you read into it, yeah thats up to you.

This is a LONG story, sorry.

So, I’ve been back and forth on whether or not to tell this story. Mostly because it involves some aspects of my working life, that I am not at liberty to discuss, but also because it had severe personal implications for me. Anyway, I have decided to share it here. And I hope you understand why there are things I simply can’t go into detail about.

This alle started in December 2020. As part of my education, I was scheduled for a 6 month internship at a psychiatric hospital. I had previous experience with working with this type of patients, so I was really excited about it. I switched around the 4 different wards in the hospital, so I treated a lot of different people with lots of different problems.

I was curious about all the different aspects, so I never said no to a task, which meant I came across everything from murderers and pedophiles, to suicidal teenagers with personality disorders.

In my worklife, I’ve had people spit at me, verbally and physically assault me, throw shit at me and all that stuff. So I like to think I’m a pretty though guy. And besides that, I always carried a personal assault-alarm. One press of a button and staff from every ward would be there in a matter of seconds.

On one of the wards I quickly noticed that there was a certain room, which was monitored 24/7 by a guard. To be clear this is a pretty normal procedure, either because the patient is physically abusive, suicidal or restrained. But most patients get the watch pulled off them relatively quickly.

I asked a colleague, and she told me it was a female patient (let’s just call her Anne) who was extremely aggressive and psychotic beyond belief.

At that point Anne had been restrained to her bed for 3 months. – I could not believe what I was hearing. We have really strict procedures when it comes to restraining people with belts. (Btw, they´re soft belts made of fabric – not leather). So, restraining the patient really is the absolutely last resort we go to.

I asked the chief psychiatrist, what was up with this girl and he just scuffed and said “If only I knew, but honestly she defies logic.”

He told me that at first they though she was psychotic, but her symptoms only got worse, no matter how much different medication they tried. Then they though she might have suffered a trauma, and was in a dissociative state. But that still didn’t fit the profile of her symptoms.

She had gone from being a perfectly normal woman, in her twenties, to being violent, extremely aggressive and unable to speak - in just 4 months. That is practically unheard of, especially as no drugs was involved. (We regularly make a toxicology-check of all patients and ALWAYS when they’re admitted).

One day my alarm went off (they’re all connected so I know where I need to run to to help my colleagues). I immediately knew it had to be Anne. And I was right.

She had only had her legs and torso fixated (again normal procedure, if the patient otherwise is relatively calm.) She had defecated in her hand, and thrown it at the guard watching her. She then proceeded to bite her fingers so hard that 3 or 4 (I can’t remember the exact number) had really bad fractures. Both her hands were a bloody mess, and she needed like 50 stitches afterwards.

I wasn’t the blood or the fact that she would throw her own filth at us, I had seen that loads of times. But the screams this woman made. It was the most primal, guttural and terrifying sounds I have ever heard. It. Scared. Me. Shitless.

The best way I can describe it something like a bear growling and a mountain-lion hissing and spitting at the same time. I have seen my fair share of people in primal distress, but I could have never imagined that a person could make sounds like THAT.

As an intern, I am in no way allowed to use force. So I was just watching as seven of my colleagues tried to fixate her fully to her bed. They had serious trouble pinning her down. (Remind you these are really experienced people).

At last we called a medicinal-alarm (which immediately calls for a chief psychiatrist to make decisions). He decided to forcefully medicate her. They gave her one and then a second shot, it only seemed to piss her off, even though it should have put a bear to sleep. At the third injection she calmed enough so that they could restrain her.

She never nodded off, she just breathed heavily and kept staring up at the same corner of the room. Sometimes smirking at something only she could see.

Fast forward 2 weeks.

I was back at the ward, it was a relatively calm weekend, so there really wasn’t much to do. Anne was in one of her good periods, so she had had her restraints removed. A guard was always by her though.

I was sitting in the office, when suddenly I see Anne walking in the hallway without the guard. I don’t know if he had taken a bathroom break or whatever, but he wasn’t around. So I catched up with her, I asked her what she was doing in the hallway alone. But of course she didn’t respond.

I should mention, that many of my colleagues were afraid of Anne – and rightfully so. Even though everyone is aware that it’s the illness and not the person attacking you. But when it keeps happening that patient does catch some stigma. I for one always try to look at the person and not the illness, so I asked where we were going. She took me by the arm and led me to the common-area.

She went over to a book cabinet. Turned and looked at me, and muttered “Read… Book…” I was completely taken aback, by the fact that she was speaking.

She pulled out a random book and handed it to me. She then sat down on the floor and started rocking back and forth. I Joined her on the floor, and started reading the book. It was just some random old book, probably from a charity, and it had no special meaning. But as I read, she came closer and closer to me. She then cuddled up to me, put her head on my lap and fell asleep.

One of my colleagues came by and she looked absolutely shocked. And before I knew it, five or six people including the chief psychiatrist was looking at me reading this random book out to her.

I caught a lot of praise for this, which is always nice.

But then.. Things took a turn for the worse, for me at least.

It started one night when I was home alone.

It was a completely normal night for me, until I heard something from upstairs coming down the stairs. The best way to describe it, is like a big dog thrashing and tumbling down the stairs. You know, like when a dog rushes down the stairs to greet you? But this was bigger, much bigger. I could hear the weight of something tumbling down, while nails or claws or whatever slid on the steps. I got up, thinking that somehow there was a massive animal in my house. But there was nothing there. That scared the everliving shit out of me. I had NEVER had anything like that happen to me. I left the house and stayed the night with my parents.

But I also had strange effects on my body. Like I had a filter over my eyes or something. Everything started to seem out of focus, like tunnelvision but with a massive blur added to it.

And then I started dissociate. I had this feeling of being totally out of contact with my body.

Then came the panic-attacks. My gf called an ambulance one of the times, because I was on the verge of a heart attack. The paramedics said i had a heartrate of 240 bpm.

I have had no prior problems with my psyche, but I figured it was stress.

I have suffered from sleep paralysis before. But never with “hallucinations” or whatever you want to call it. But that started recently. I see a large black mass, with long arms and legs sit in the top corner of our bedroom. Like a massive spider, but just with four legs. This is now happening on a nightly basis.

A couple of days ago I told my girlfriend about it, because she kept pestering me with questions about my nightmares. She said “Thats funny… Everytime you’re just about to go to sleep, you look up in that corner and you sort of smirk.”

That reminded me of Anne. And now I am absolutely terrified that I might have brought something home.

Believe or not, thats up to you. I have never treated a patient like Anne, and none of my colleagues had either. It was scary stuff. And I have never suffered any psychological problems before – never. But something is going on, I am sure of it. It feels like it wants to get back at me or something idk.

And by the way, Anne is much better today. She is in a rehabilitating home, where she thrives. One day she might even be able to have her normal life back."

While lengthy I do have specific options I am evaluating and looking for input on vs a vague call of assistance to the void. If you are not interested in my back story then jump to [The Roads](#The-Roads) section of this post.

&gt; Full disclosure I have also asked this on r/careerguidance but do not seem to be getting any traction there

&gt; I am an atrocious speller and I’m sure general grammar is lacking so I apologize in advance



# Who Am I

I’m a 27-year-old software engineer working remotely based out of Colorado and for better or worse I am at a bit of a crossroads. I would like to share a bit about who I am for context then frame what exactly it is I want input on.

I’m sure a lot of my personal native is not all that unique, I began fiddling with computers in middle school and at some point found out people will give you money for that.

I was an okay student bright but not brilliant I never got the meta of school and just found it to be this arbitrary set of things to memorize that made me feel bad about myself if I didn’t. Math was especially frustrating while not really difficult for me it just felt like a random set of rules I was too stupid to get the point of (I assumed everyone else just did but am starting to suspect I was not alone). I was very fortunate however to have an awesome introductory programming course I was then able to then retake multiple years as a more self-directed experience. It was here I caught the bug for programming, I would spend more time writing toy programs than any of my other assignments by far.

I only applied to one college, Boulder, and only really attended because it was mostly on my parent's dime, and thought the paper would be useful. Again I did okay garnering a 3.6 with a B.S in Computer Science, but found most of the courses followed the “just go over the study guide the night before and you’ll do good enough to get above a 3.0 pattern.” There were a few classes that really challenged me but those were the exception, not the norm.

The most useful experience I gained here was actually developing a simple web app for a research group for a professor that taught a class I *actually* learned in. Similar to high school I spent vast amounts of time on this project relative to normal coursework. I had a few other good experiences like being a teaching assistant for the intro and data structures courses and a couple of internships.

From my connections developing that web application for the research group I landed my first job at a start-up in Denver the group consulted for. This was a very, I’ll say, interesting time in my life professionally and personally.

Professionally I learned a lot. I think working at a startup with bright people right after school is an awesome experience. Because there are so few resources you’re not only forced to do better engineering around the constraint of money people just let you do more as a junior dev because there are simply fewer people. However, regardless of the talent there we just never had an awesome product-market fit and I honestly did not care for the product. (One of those nice let's harvest all your social data and sell it platforms)

Personally, this was by far the most difficult time in my life. I’ve always had a tendency towards melancholy and couple that with a long family history of drinking I quickly fell into that trap. I was in a long-distance relationship with someone who also struggled with mental health only making things worse. After the first few years of college, I stopped running, gained a massive amount of weight, and distanced myself from all of my friends. I had very few positive experiences from this time in my life and only really grew through work, my one stabilizing ballast.

Eventually, my long-distance relationship stopped being long-distance and I moved to a remote corner of the mid-west with my partner to support her through medical school. It was here I finally stopped drinking and began to wake up to the situation I was in. I was deeply unhappy now disgustingly unfit, though thankfully sober, and in an arduous relationship. I knew I needed to do something. It took me two years to decide I should leave that relationship and spring of 2021 I moved back to Colorado.

2021 was by far the most difficult yet productive year of my life. After leaving that relationship I began to focus on my health losing almost a hundred pounds, no longer obese I was finally getting back to my old self. I did a few cliche things I bought a motorcycle, got an inflatable kayak, started to reconnect with old friends, listened to David Goggins, and started my early morning running routine.

I began for the first time to believe in optimism, as an attitude of always using your brain to problem solve regardless of how difficult things may be. I also really started to thrive at work, with all this extra energy I was getting more done and writing a lot of proposals I’ve slowly been getting buy-in on. Moreover, I finally began to really start considering how I want to curate myself vs just letting life happen to me and reacting to it.

# Where I’m at now

Software engineering has always been a positive outlet for me. I would characterize myself as a tempestuous person who constantly needs new problems and concepts to learn to stave off boredom. And software has been an awesome well of problems to draw from. However, I’m reaching a point in my career where most of the work I do feels pretty rote. I think this is natural and am really looking to increase the scale of problems I work on through collaboration with people vs the volume of software I can write as an individual.

A particular growth area for me has always been learning how to more readily socialize. I was that quiet kid on the playground who never had a lot of friends and I’ve always had to really push myself to overcome whatever impalpable divide seems to exist between me and most individuals.

I’ve had some success here as an adult I’m really less worried about what people think and am able to better vocalize myself. I would now describe myself as an introverted extravert, I really love sharing ideas and being around people but it is always stressful (I have a pretty mean inner monolog). At work, I’m effective at leading projects and getting buy-in from various groups, but this will always be something I’ll have to work at to be better at. It sounds like I’ll be a team lead soon so will take that as a bit of evidence of improvement in this regard.

How I currently view my job is let's say multifaceted. The main reason I’m here is I needed a remote position before Covid made that super common. So I accepted a gig at one of the streaming companies of the month that was pretty into functional programming, a paradigm I’ve always wanted to explore. I’m actually really happy with the role. I get to work on greenfield projects that are used by tens of millions of people, I have a lot of sharp coworkers, minimal process with a very large degree of autonomy, the pay is pretty good (though not quite FAANG at the senior+ level), and the team does a pretty good job at maintaining work-life balance. However, looking at how to optimize all the future moments of my life I’m starting to really debate if I should stay in this role.

# The Crossroads

While there is a lot I love about my current position there are a few pain points. The largest being that after crossing the no-mans-land of my early 20s I’m now single with very few actual friends.

Working remote has so many benefits but can be extremely isolating. This isn’t helped by the fact that I’m renting my parent's house from them and while this home is all a human being could ask for 1 acre in the wooded foothills of the Rockies, heated floors, walk-in steam showers, and an office that rivals what I’ve gleaned of senior management’s through zoom, it is located near an evangelical stronghold and is generally distant from most social things someone my age would want to do. I have no desire to re-locate to the organization’s main office as I have very little affinity for the topologically boring concrete jungles of the east.

The other issue I have is specific to the organization I’m at. While there are a lot of bright driven individuals here the barrier to entry just is simply lower. I don’t think there is an intrinsic issue with this but do find some resonance with Steve Job’s idea about A players. As a result, there is a large variance in the degree of talent and drive here. A lot of people here are just trying to feed their families and to be honest, I don’t think there’s a single thing wrong with that. Not everything needs to be the absolute best humanity can produce and still provide value.

However, I am someone who is *somewhat* innately ambitious (too bad I couldn’t see that in high school) and I really like to push myself. Quite a few of my old coworkers at the startup I first started at landed at the N and G in FAANG and there was something special about working with them (It was here I was first introduced to the LessWrong community, which has been a large influence on how I think about the world and its people who foster those sorts of ideas I want to spend more time with).

Another personal aspiration of mine not suited to my current situation is to find a life partner. Being in a relationship for five years, as trying as it was, really got me into that hackneyed idea that love is the most important thing one can experience and share in life. I would eventually like to start a family and want to experience life with someone who is intelligent, optimistic, creative, ambitious, open, curious, etc.

# The Roads

We’re finally getting to the section where I could use your input, what road do I take or what roads do I not even see?

What I’m considering:



- Try to get a job at FAANG in the bay area

  - Why I think this could be a good idea

    - I really enjoy working with smart people who challenge me

    - I’m looking for a life partner and I’m getting close to 30 which means age-appropriate partners who have the qualities I’m looking for are more likely to already be in committed relationships. I view this as a probability problem and the bay area has a large volume of people and from what I gather a lot of those people are pretty sharp.

     - I think it would be really neat at some point in my life to really start something from scratch that helps a lot of people. Putting in some time at a large organization sounds like a good way to find people to do that with.

     - I don’t know what this looks like but I am starting to hone in on the types of problems I might think are interesting. (Note these are all things I’m curious about but have not done a decent literature review on so forgive me if my thoughts come across as naive)

    - Solving problems related to quality of life. There is a lot of good work going to fight climate change and make us a multi-planetary species etc. But there are a lot of social problems I think that need to be solved with a similar level of earnest that tend to just get lip service by saying UBI. For example, even if you have social housing how do you give people a meaningful existence so we don’t have 90% of the population with nothing else to do but drugs as we get better at automation.

      - How do you preserve free speech and ideals in a world where over half the population now lives under a now-trendy authoritarian government.

      - Mental health and addiction. It’s a lot harder than just saying no and a lot of people are struggling. Watching Mark Lata’s soft white underbelly you see so many shattered people and the vast majority have no delusions about their situation even in cases of extreme abuse they tend to always own the situation they’re in. And given my own trials and tribulations, I at least have a lot of empathy to offer in this area.

    - Even if I like my role now I have a suspicion there is a glass ceiling on what I can accomplish vs if I were to move my career to a tier-one company.

    - My parents recently moved there and have other family members in the area

  - Questions and concerns

    - Do I have the cognitive horsepower

      - I’ve always had the view of myself that I’m just barely smart enough to *really* see how dumb I am. I’ve only recently tried to stop worrying about if I’m smart enough and only be constrained by the problem itself. But this is easier said than done. Working through cracking the coding interview brings up all those old feelings from school, I get so frustrated at myself when I don't see the trick (though am finally learning you really need to tease out the trick rather than try to see it). I am slowly getting better at these but it is not something I’m innately good at.

        - As an aside, my standardized test scores were also good not great. I have a lot of theories on why this was, given I do seem to be able to solve IRL problems *with* people I know who have these high numbers. I had a horrible attitude that “well I know what I know so there’s no need to study for these”. I have a suspension that if I just learned to play to the game of those questions a bit I could have done much better and have a number that lets me stop worrying if I’m good enough and just try to satisfy my innate curiosity. But I know the more likely answer for not getting super awesome scores *is* just because I’m not that “smart”. And therein lies the circle I am trapped in: am I good enough, what do I even want good to mean to me, if I pick anything less than what my truest self thinks is good then clearly I’m not good enough, what is my truest self is there an alternative, my truest true self will always know the alternative was an *alternative*, am I good enough (some way or another I always land back on this step no matter how hard I try to reason the query way). This is why I’m so obsessed with these companies I feel like I could finally get an answer, that I could do the same silly games that let people get the silly high numbers, but am horrified that the answer is just no. (This is part of why I think I need to at least try but the amount of anguish I experience in the process leading up to getting that real-world evidence (an offer), is a lot to endure, to say the least)

            - Pushing through these issues is something I'm open to exploring with a therapist if anyone has any recommendations I'd love to hear them.

    - I have a feeling I have more room to grow in management than as an engineer but do not know what management looks like at these companies. Is the manager role more of a pure people coordinator or do they also help facilitate what actually gets built?

    - I have what I describe as dyslexic tendencies (never actually diagnosed). Left and right are really hard and this pops up in more places than you’d expect. There are a lot of problems that feel confusing to me the same way right and left are. For example, I once almost failed a calc test because I forgot which axis was y and which was x (mind you I still did the problem correctly just around the wrong axis). There are other more abstract concepts this manifests in like I find palindrome problems very difficult. (though that may also be due to the other difficulties I have with spelling). This makes me a somewhat slow learner. I always seem to be able to eventually grasp whatever concept I’m trying to learn but seem to need more time than most. Another thing I might say is I seem to be able to very quickly develop intuition but have difficulty working with precision.

    - Mental health

      - Related to my g factor concern I try to be optimistic and maintain the attitude I should just try out and not worry about rejection. However, spending the vast majority of my time alone while not having a rich support system makes it hard to push through the seemingly endless negative thoughts I think about myself when I study leet code flavored problems. This manifests in classic avoidant behavior and I’ve noticed that I’ve been eating more. (I’ve been editing this piecemeal a few bullet points above is *really* the mental health bullet)

  - The grass is always greener

  - I am working on a lot of cool projects in my current position and there’s a lot to like there if I can solve the social isolation problem.

  - Is there a third alternative to the bay area vs where I’m at in Colorado

    - Something very important to me is living in an environment with a lot of natural beauty. I love places like Colorado and California for how spectacular the landscapes are and the endless options you have to experience them (most of my hobbies are solo outdoor endurance activities). To that end, I wonder if I can get more out of Colorado or if there is some other place worth exploring with the properties I’m interested in.

  - Is there a third alternative to FAANG vs staying where I’m working at

    - I currently make a bit over 200 TC so, in theory, I could just move to the bay area and not be impoverished. Though I’d take a palpable hit in lifestyle quality if I hope to maintain lifetime wealth parity. Ideally, I’d want at least 300 to really consider making the jump though have a feeling those all have the same leet code gate.

- Digital Nomad

  - Why I think this could be a good idea

    - I have a notion that life is kinda like a map-reduce problem you map moments in time and you reduce them into experiences you carry forward through the rest of time. The amount you’ve truly lived is the cardinality of that set after the reduction. This is why I have a distaste for things like cable television if you basically almost immediately forget that house in “House Hunters” what’s the difference between watching it and being dead for that episode (a bit glib, I know, we also have to sleep too and that really is like being dead). To that end, I think it might be worthwhile to try to generate as many experiences you actually carry forward through time.

    - Might be a good way to meet interesting people

  - Mental health

    - While I do really value the part of me that is a try-hard I do continue to struggle with depression and have always been somewhat neurotic (this is a family trait and strongly manifests maternally). If you google neuroticism the advice they give to people is to try to find low-stress positions. I really hate even considering being limited by that but I also want a stable life. If my job is pretty low stress now and remote there also seems to be a few 4 day work week companies that could be fun.

  - While I am capable of deep work and can easily get into the flow I do question my overall willpower abilities. For example, I occasionally read articles about individuals who record their workday and review the film to figure out how they can be the most efficient for every moment of the day. I am not one of these people I generally only have a few hours of deep work in me and a few more of low cognitive effort administration type work. That makes me question if I’m even capable of really having what it takes to lead large numbers of people and really push the traditional career route. (I know they say look at how Darwin and alike how they worked or more specifically didn't, but have a pretty good feeling their type of work is pretty different from my type of work, especially if I am interested in more management type positions)

  - After writing my diatribe above about my worth or lack of it my true self knows I’d be missing the mark here. But at some point, the territory forces you to change your map and that is what this option is about.

- Questions and Concerns

    - How do I translate that lifestyle into an existence that is stable over the entire duration of my lifetime? If I want to find a partner who values a true long-term relationship i.e not giving up in 10 years am I likely to find that in another nomad? If we were to have children what does that even look like?

    - What kinds of people are out there?

    - As someone who used to drink I worry about falling into some other trap by peer pressure and not having a career to worry about

    - Would this really make me happy?

    - Would I be able to make friends who challenge me and could we work on things that are interesting? I love the idea of building some cyberpunk type shit out of a van watching the waves catching the breeze but am I more likely to just smoke a bunch of weed and watch Netflix on an iPad in a Walmart parking lot?

- Just move to Boulder

  - Why I think this could be a good idea

    - I actually really love Boulder and already know people in the area

    - I think it would be a lot of fun to audit courses at my Alma mater. There is a really solid physics program there and I’ve been getting the itch to *really* find out what’s going on with general relativity and the standard model.

    - I could keep my job and mull over if I even need to move to FAANG. i.e do I really want to work there because of the people and problems or is it more because I have this nagging sense I’m not good enough and want to prove that I am. There are other ways to be fulfilled I’m sure but so far have only played to gaining esteem through accomplishments at work.

    - Likely easier on my mental health

  - Questions and concerns

    - I’m not sitting my mark high enough, just because I’m currently intimidated by the bay area does not mean I should practice giving up

    - This is a large expense I’ve moved almost every two years since starting college it would be nice if I could get a company to pay for me to move

    - I’d have to give up this space I currently occupy which has a lot of nice things I like

    - This would also be a huge pain because I’d need to pay to move and store all of my parent's stuff that is still here (if I got a new job further away they could pay to move all of this shit or at least my shit). And doing so would put a huge strain on their fragile relationship (them moving to California was extremely stressful as my mom hates the concept of California and wants to move back)

- Stay where I’m at now physically

  - Why I think this could be a good idea

    - I love this house and being so close to the mountains. I may be able to just buy this house from my parents denominated in 2012 dollars giving me a large asset. I have a feeling this is the worst reason to consider doing what I’m doing now but alas it is a notion that carries weight in my mind. Given how the housing market and inflation seem to be going up and to the right even on larger timescales, I do somewhat worry that even at my level of compensation I won't be able to find this comfortable of housing again.

    - Related to my previous point by saving money by using advantages my parents are able to give me I could use this house as a base and just travel and remotely collaborate with people.

  - Questions and concerns

    - This is all just an elaborate way to get out of making any real change and actually pursuing my goals. I don’t think I can ever be happy just sitting still.

    - While this strategy will keep me alive I have a feeling it is not the most optimal way to accomplish my goals and ambitions.

    - I’m being silly I’ll likely be able to find even better housing if I invest in myself

- Something I am not even considering right now (this is the adlib portion of the list)

I am finally getting the hang of some leetcode type questions, and received an internship offer from a leading MLOps company in the Bay Area that I am super excited to work at. I have heard great things about the company and culture, and everyone I have talked to has been awesome. 

I had a system design interview in addition to a series of pure coding interviews, and while I'm sure I could get better at both, I am thankful that I have learned enough tips from this sub to do a decent job. 

Hope you all are doing well!"

sha7gr,6,2022-01-31,"I want to work in the US, but I can't even get a CS degree. What should I do?",ZeBests,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/sha7gr/i_want_to_work_in_the_us_but_i_cant_even_get_a_cs/,"Hello,

I'm a Korean student returning to sophomore year of my 'Stem cell and regenerative biotechnology' major after completing \~2 years of mandatory military service. 2 years was a lot of time to rethink my life and explore new interests, and at the end of it I decided to transfer to computer science.

Long story short, I couldn't transfer to (or double major) computer science, and I'm now desperate to find other options. For now, I'm planning to minor in computer science instead, since minors don't have strict requirements, if any. I'm also keeping an eye on the application date for the only non-computer science developer club in our school.

But thinking about spending 3 years in a study I'm no longer interested in and make use of is depressing. I know a lot say that anyone can be a developer, but the likeliness of me beating the competition without a computer science major degree, especially in the US, where I'm foreign, seems too small to settle with. Internships are a problem as well, as the ones I've seen require me to be studying computer science or related. I am terrified that I can't even get any work experiences to show employers merely because of my major.

There are other options I'm considering, but not sure yet as they are huge commitments to make.

1. Go on a leave for a year, and retry for transfer. My school basically restricts transfers to sophomores only, so if I never start (or finish) my sophomore year, I can try again. This is difficult because if I fail to transfer again, that's another year wasted. And I'd be turning 24 that year, and I'm already older than I wish to be as a sophomore. But of course, my age doesn't matter as long as I get to study and work in the field I enjoy.
2. Get an online CS degree from Coursera or other online college. I'd essentially be double majoring, except that I have to pay way more than a double major within my school. This is difficult because my family is already so financially burdened that I meet the requirements for my school and the government scholarship program to pay for my fees entirely. Unless there is such scholarship program for an international student, I'd have to find some way to loan money for extra education.
3. Transfer to a US school. My girlfriend is all for this decision, as she lives in the US. This would help my chances getting employed in the US as well. This is a crazy decision for me to make - not only will I have to depend on loans for school fees, I have no idea how I can come up with housing, living expenses, etc. I guess I just don't feel as prepared to leave my family and everything behind as I should be. Again, my feelings don't matter if this is the best choice.

I mentioned loans as a point of burden, but I'm aware it doesn't have to be. I know that most US students graduate with debt and still go on with their lives well. Perhaps I'm a little more sensitive to it than I need to be, with my financial situation and all.

So with that, my question is: what option should I pick? Are there other options I'm not considering? What should I know more about these options? I greatly appreciate all of you guys and the community for being so helpful."
shad9a,4,2022-01-31,"Is a 3.79 vs. a 3.56 GPA worth an $11,000-12,000 loan?",kevinburns102,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/shad9a/is_a_379_vs_a_356_gpa_worth_an_1100012000_loan/,"I'm a CS senior at a moderately highly reputable state university, who has completed all my degree requirements (I'm kicking myself for not putting one of them off until now, so I could avoid this situation to begin with), with 3 options:

1. graduate right now with a 3.56 GPA (nothing lower than a B- in any course on my transcript except 3 courses:
   1. D+ in Advanced Programming (C++) in Fall 2020 (due to the pandemic),
   2. C in Linear Algebra in Spring 2019, and
   3. C- in Calculus I in Spring 2016 (taken as a dually-enrolled HS student; I retook the course once already and received an A, before the university implemented a retake policy which replaces old grades; I have been granted the permission to retake it yet again, this time to replace both old grades)),
2. continue as an undergraduate for one more semester to replace all 3 of those grades with A/A+ and to take Machine Learning, changing my GPA to 3.78-3.79, but I would have to take out a loan for $11,000-12,000, or
3. option 2 (above) but take a summer class after and THEN graduate, to raise my GPA from 3.78-3.79 to above 3.8 (I know this might be silly, but then again maybe not, and I'm listing it here for the sake of being thorough).

I strongly believe I have the level of knowledge necessary to perform very well in entry-level positions at 'top' tech companies (Google, Facebook, Apple, etc.), so the only potential barrier to entry is of course getting an interview, and thus I need to focus on my résumé. With not many extra-curriculars or projects and no internships since HS, I would think a 3.78-3.79 (or maybe 3.8) GPA could make a huge difference as opposed to a 3.56 GPA.

Thank you in advance for any and all feedback!"

Am I expecting too much?",mina-doll,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/shar7l/noncs_bachelors_i_want_to_do_ms_in_data_sci_am_i/,"I have a healthcare background, working for about ~8 years. I want to do a masters in data sciences to transition into the CS field. It’s a 2.5year part-time program and I plan on doing an internship during my last year. 

After looking through some job listings, I noticed some with entry level Data Scientists/interns asking for a Masters but don’t necessarily require a lot of experience otherwise. So by the time I graduate, I do think something like this would be feasible for me. Some with salaries starting at around 80K. 

My question is are these listings rare and not reflective of overall experiences in CS/Data science jobs? Is it unrealistic to expect 80K salaries for a new grad school graduate with an internship?"

I have sophomore level experience in CS like data structures, discrete math, etc but my uni didn't let me change my major. Ideally I'd like to apply to masters in CS abroad but I do not have anything in my profile like internships or projects.

My resume is just a bachelors degree(non-CS) with a decent cgpa at this point. What should be my next course of action if I wish to pursue masters in CS abroad?

Should I take a bridge course or a diploma in CS abroad to improve my profile for MS CS? Is there like a program which enables people to switch their fields,etc. Your views would be greatly appreciated"

I will literally take any internship that's related to computer science to ""break in"" to the IT industry but haven't had a chance yet

any tips/guidance? I will definitely keep applying but I just feel like I'm the worst applicant on the market right now"

I've been applying for junior/entry-level positions for going on six months now and I'm starting to feel like I'm never gonna find a job.   If anyone could give me some advice on how to proceed or make myself more appealing I would greatly appreciate it.

For some background, I graduated in august with a BS in computer science with a sub 3.0 GPA.  This alone feels like it immediately keeps me out a large number of positions.  I did not participate in an internship during college.  As a result I don't have the professional level experience that most places are looking for, even for an entry level position.  I don't really have any large scale personal projects to show for, and my accounts on Leetcode/HackerRank aren't anything to write home about.

I've been scouring job boards and LinkedIn since September, and almost every place I apply ends in either no response or rejection.  The few interviews that I have gotten have only lead to me getting ghosted, even on the ones that went well.

I know that I've definitely made some mistakes leading up to this point, but I really want to get my shit together and improve.  Once again, any sort of helpful incite would be greatly appreciated."
shc5be,4,2022-01-31,Windows Management in a macOS environment,Plausible_Sanity,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/shc5be/windows_management_in_a_macos_environment/,"Hi all, I've got a problem with a lack of managing windows end points (or any windows servers/devices at all) and I'm unsure of which direction I should start to accomplish my goal, so I'm hoping someone has some advice, guidance, or can point me to the right direction to tackle this request.

Some context:
-
I work at a small org supporting around ~130ish (more if you include interns and freelancers) end users between my boss and me. I myself haven't been in a Windows dominated environment in over 6 years at this point, so much of my Windows knowledge is most likely out of date and/or irrelevant. We are prominently a macOS house with the exception of 3 (yes, 3) Windows laptops and 7 Windows servers which houses AD, DNS, print server, iis, and some other misc applications/purposes all within a on premise server cluster. Pretty small environment if I had to guess compared to most orgs. Initially my inquiry was about how to manage these items locally but there has been some discussion about possibly moving everything to Azure and just subscribe to that service vs onsite hosting.

=
Our current workflow for managing macOS endpoint devices is really streamlined. Once we buy a MacBook (or other Apple product) from a vendor, it gets enrolled in our ABM (Apple Business Manager) and the machine is enrolled into our MDM environment so we can push profiles to the machine (like WIFI configurations/printers/vpn/etc). We then encrypt the machine with File vault through this process as well. We then use munki on the back end to manage various 3rd party software program installations and updates with ease. When we fire up a new machine for the first time out of the box (or a re-imaged machine), once it connects to the internet, it checks in with ABM and says ""oh hey, you belong to this org over here, go there for next steps"" which gets information from MDM environment and starts doing the needful. Really hands off approach. This is about a 20,000 ft overview of it.

=
As we sit with our windows laptops, its really really *(like why are you doing this in 2022 bad*) bare bones: Sign in with a local admin account, bind to AD (rename/etc), have the user log in and give them admin credentials (*I know*) and call it a day. No way to manage update, programs, or anything really. Same can be said about our Windows servers. We manually install updates otherwise they just sit and do the task they are assigned. Managing our Windows servers and endpoints is something I would absolutely love to change how we manage Windows to make this better for my boss and I and our end users. Ideally getting something in place would allow us to scale up as our company grows and bring on more Windows devices/servers/etc. This leads me to my question/goal:

=
My goal:
-
Is to replicate how we manage our macOS end points but with our Windows devices: endpoints and possibly servers? Is there a built in Azure/Microsoft equivalent that we could utilize to manage Windows better? Maybe I'm looking at this too broadly and need to focus on endpoints vs servers or vise versa? With how little we actually interact with Windows, is it even worth trying to implement a system for a windows environment so small? I've looked at a few free or ""freemium"" type products which don't seem to work as well as I'd hope they would. I'd like to try maybe implementing SCCM but I'm afraid the cost might be to large for how little we need to manage or if that is the right route for this project (I haven't touched SCCM since 2014 so I can only imagine the learning curve in front of me). If at all possible, I'm wondering if I could utilize Azure to possible accomplish this goal and what that'd would take to accomplish the goal as we already pay for other services in Azure (specifically some data science related environments).

=
If anyone has suggestions, guidance, or advise, I would (and my boss will hopefully too) greatly appreciate it in helping us better tackle all things Windows. I apologize in advance if I didn't provide enough details or if this is the wrong location to post a question like this. I'm learning as I go along."

I’m a 25yo graduated in Business Administration. I am about to end a 6-months internship in the Marketing department of a big automotive company and I need some advice.

I love Marketing and advertising, especially their newest, digital frontiers and applications.
My actual internship is not really related to that, but it’s Marketing nevertheless and I needed it to boost my resume 😅

They have now proposed me to remain in the company with a fixed term contract of 12 months in the Sales Planning department. It’s not something I know much about, so I may like it or not. 
However, what bothers me is that they already said that after this experience I will have to have a field sales experience: this is something I don’t want to do and don’t like.

The thing is, it’s either this or another internship with an unknown ending, and I’m tired to be an intern.

My question for you is simple: will a year in Sales Planning be “useful” and valuable in my resume also for non-automotive companies and for Marketing roles? Or will I be somewhat forced to remain in the automotive industry?"

Graduated with a master's in finance and accounting.
All my internships are in this field.

All my peers and everyone I used to know are in careers they love and started their jobs and having their shit together.

I, on the other hand, want to work in customer service and improve in that field and have a promotion in it if possible.
Despite many saying it's a shit job.

I worked for my brother for a year, handled his business; procurement, customers, intermediate services, disputes, etc..

I got a good handle and improved my communication skills, my negotiation,  how I bargain, and most importantly how to handle angry clients.

I decided to find a stable job with a good income since my brother doesn't pay me very well depending on the revenue. 

I applied and recently I had a call at this nice company and they said, I will be hired next time they open more positions.
My friend who works there confirmed on multiple occasions.

Fast forward to 3 days ago, I accidentally check my ex's Twitter profile and the bio says he works at Microsoft as a software engineer   and my heart dropped.

Good for him, but I am still here, fighting for a carrier launch.
To be fair he started his carrier 2 years before I graduated school.

I loath myself recently , can't stop comparing myself to my pees and others, can't help but think I am a failure.

I wake up at 11am-12pm, I am slouching and sulking and hating on myself to the point where I am feeling empty and filled with bad thoughts, like ending type of thing thoughts.

shg3iz,1,2022-01-31,Calculus 3 + Ordinary Differential Equations OR Two Calculus-based Statistics Classes?,__jonathanbenson__,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/shg3iz/calculus_3_ordinary_differential_equations_or_two/,"I am a junior in college pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and a Math Minor.

My math minor requires that I take some higher-level math OR statistics classes. I have narrowed it down to two choices: either I take calculus 3 and ordinary differential equations (option 1) or two calculus-based statistics classes (option 2). All my ducks are in a row to go either way with regards to prerequisites, advisor approval, etc..

Here's all of the notable math classes I have already taken (all A's): precalculus, discrete math 1 + 2, calculus 1 + 2, linear algebra, and non-calculus-based statistics.

Some notable classes I will end up taking no matter what: applied probability and statistical machine-learning.

Here are some paraphrased descriptions of the classes:

* **Calculus 3 (4 credits):** analytic geometry, multiple-variable functions, Lagrange multipliers, multiple integrals, Jacobians, line and surface integrals, Green's Theorem, Divergence Theorem, and Stokes' Theorem.
* **Ordinary Differential Equations (4 credits):** first order equations, linear second order differential equations, Taylor series and power series, Laplace transforms, elementary systems of differential equations, numerical methods, Fourier series, and boundary problems.
* **Statistics 1 (3 credits):** probability, discrete / continuous distributions, expectation and variance, and central limit theorem.
* **Statistics 2 (3 credits):** sampling distributions, point estimation, internal estimation, hypothesis testing, variance analysis, and non-parametric methods.

My interests / career ambitions: application-level and robotics software development in an engineering environment. For example, I developed a WinForms application in C# that tracked the OEE of an assembly line in my last internship. It also communicated over LAN with an Arduino that changed the color of some LED lights.

My thoughts / assumptions (spoiler alert: I am leaning towards option 1):

* Option 1 will provide me with a deeper, more fundamental understanding of mathematics whereas option 2 is more just applications of what I already know.
* I enjoyed calculus 1 + 2 much more than non-calculus-based statistics. The reason being was close to point #1 above. There were many more ""aha"" moments as opposed to ""that's so obvious"" moments.
* There have been many algorithms in Computer Science I have encountered that utilize concepts in option 1 that I still don't fully understand (example: 2d Fourier transform). It seems obvious that I would need some more stat prerequisites for my machine-learning classes!...but there are none. I feel like option 2 would be easier to learn, and more importantly *understand*, in a non-classroom setting than option 1.

**If you were in my shoes, which path would you take?**

Hopefully this will be helpful to other students in a similar situation!"

shg8tc,0,2022-01-31,20 yo Uyghur Male. What should I do to get into HSW?,Alternative_Goat_841,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/shg8tc/20_yo_uyghur_male_what_should_i_do_to_get_into_hsw/,"Hi everyone,

I am an Uyghur Male, born in London and raised in France. Looking to get feedback on the next steps I should take to get into MBA.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:**

* Age: 20
* Race: European and Uyghur (Muslim Minority in NW China)
* Applying: Starting from Sep 2023
* Work Experience: None

I'm in a non-target school because I was a complete dumbass in High school (am still quite silly tbh), I was selling drugs and didn't even know that graduate studies existed. I only woke up last year after my grandma died. I have been blessed since my mother has paid for my studies, and enrolled me in a school.

&amp;#x200B;

**Undergrad:**

* 3 Years International Business Bachelor in top 15 French School (Sep 2020 to June 2023)
* GPA: 3.88/4.0 for my two first years
* 1.5 Years abroad in a non-target UK university (2022 – June 2023)

&amp;#x200B;

**Extracurriculars:**

* Currently enrolled in a mentorship program to help young teenagers from disadvantaged communities who were in my situation, on behalf of the French government
* A lot of Uyghur people have been imprisoned in “concentration camps”, so I'm trying to find ways to help from where I am in the EU, maybe I could join some Human rights associations or something like that? I don't really know how I can help…
* I like cartography, history, painting, stock market, travelling and zoology, so I'm considering joining/creating a university club in one of these fields
* Another Idea would be becoming a fellow (member of the board) of the Zoology Society of London since I have family there, and I love wildlife

&amp;#x200B;

**Why I want an MBA:**

* I would like to create my own technology business and scale it all the way to an IPO. I believe that studying in a M7 school would be a great setting to meet smart, driven, and ambitious people with whom I could exchange ideas and build a company. After my MBA, I am planning to:
   * Work 2-3 years in IB or MBB
   * Then switch to VC at Sequoia, YC or Tiger in the US
      * Once I acquired enough knowledge in the startup environment, I try to work on my own company and start companies until one works

&amp;#x200B;

**Schools:**

* MBA Target: HSW, Columbia, MIT &amp; NYU
* MFin Target (if MFin): Oxford, LSE, Cambridge, Imperial, HEC, LBS, Bocconi

&amp;#x200B;

I know that in the US, you get bachelors, do internships, graduate, enter the workforce, and when you have a few years of WE you apply for an MBA.   
Here in the EU (unless you're at LSE or Oxbridge), quite frankly, a bachelor isn't really valuable. Because a bachelor's student is competing with masters students when he applies to internships, acquiring WE with a bachelors degree is very rare and hard, therefore, you usually enter master directly after undergrad.

I’m not sure about what I should do if I want to do an MBA in America, should I prepare for GMAT? Network with current students? Climb Mount Everest? Get internship experience?

I've seen people who have done the following: Bachelors &gt; Internships (or work 1-2 years) &gt; MFin at TOP 10 EU school &gt; Work 2-3 years &gt; MBA

I'm ready to do anything it takes, so now my question is: What are the next steps I should take to get into these MBA's?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you If you have read all the way down to here.

&amp;#x200B;

*Disclaimer:  I have absolutely no idea of how an application is reviewed and how my background looks like. But I know that my goal isn't realistic, that I should aim for something else since there's a big chance I will fail, many people have already told me so. However, I've seen some people who have done it, so it is possible.*"
