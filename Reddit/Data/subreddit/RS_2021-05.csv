I'm looking for some ideas when it comes to ECs, which I want to link back to the engineering field. Any ideas for future internships will help as well, since I'm only a sophomore. I'll have chess, CS projects and writing ECs already, so some very strong engineering extracurriculars would help to top it off. I'm already certified in AutoCAD and Fusion 360 if that helps.

Thanks for your time!"

I drive for Uber and it is getting old I've been doing it for 9 months the pay has been pretty good but is sort of unreliable long term. I want to build a career and not go through some bullshit company that sells me at a huge markup. I applied to 5 internships and kind of doubt I'll hear back I've heard back from like 3 places in the 2-300 places I applied to since graduating. Are there just a glut of CS majors? I bombed an interview at Amazon because my car just died and I was depressed because I had to leave my ra position. I should've rescheduled the interview because I could've studied the technical stuff some more but when they asked me about how hashmaps store stuff I had no idea so that really hurt me I think. They don't teach algorithms to computer engineering majors at my school. Anyways, what should I do? My brothers a senior software engineer and he's been trying to start a small company with me but wants to work on stuff I have no experience in, I finally feel ready to try taking software seriously again it's just hard to start a company and I think an internship or job might be better for me right now."

Hi guys! I'm in a very tight spot because I have to make my decision by tomorrow if I  want to commit to LB (deadline due tomorrow) or UCSD and I want to get a few last opinions to make my decision. I looked at other subs but I'm making this post to focus on Econ. I just got admitted as a transfer at Muir college (woo!)
Setting one thing aside: Cost isn't a factor. UCSD luckily gave me grants, CSULB didn't, so net cost would be almost the exact same. Little bit about my goals: I love econ and fashion, plan on going to France for my grad years, and would like to go into that field for a future job and become a designer in the biz world, super social, would like to also join their Waterpolo team.

What I loved about CSULB was the beautiful campus, very spacious, smaller classes, they have a fashion department that no other UC/CSU has.

Some cons was the area gave me negative ish vibes because of the abundance of homeless people and the area wasn't great. Commuter school. 

UCSD pros: Loved the area and campus, lowkey liked the SD vibes better, got into Muir and am excited about it. Also like the village they have for transfer students and hopefully will give me a chance to make friends and connection right away
Cons: What people say about it being socially dead. Is it really?

I REALLY don't want it to become a CSU vs UC decision, but UCSD is more internationally recognized and I would like to go to a school in France since the fashion influence is greater there. Debating whether I want a master's or PHD, but those are goals to think about a couple of years later. I'm stuck because I also want to be in LB's Fashion department, but I can also do internships in that field at UCSD.
Any feedback from current or previous econ majors at UCSD or LB lurking here would be greatly appreciated with their experiences. Thank you so much! :)"

I'm  a sophomore/rising junior at a T10 school that is a target for some  banks. I transferred after several years out of school being a caregiver  for a family member (previously had a 4.0 at a state university).  However, I have done relatively poorly as a Computer Engineering major  at my new school - my current GPA is a 3.2. Some of my previous courses will convert to Pass/Fail come mid-June, so my GPA should be around a 3.5-3.6 at that point if I maintain the As I currently have now that I'm receiving academic accommodations.

I'd become interested in IB  since transferring and thought I would look into recruiting this  quarter, being ignorant of the timeline. In the past three weeks, I've  been talking to upperclassmen, advisors, and some alumni about joining  the recruiting cycle for Summer '22 internships. I've obtained a search  fund internship, have been working part-time with a local VC  firm, and have some relevant coursework, solid non-banking  extracurriculars (economics research, entrepreneurial ventures), and a  unique/non-traditional background.

While I realize the amount of  networking/technical study needed at this point will be essentially a  full-time job, I'm hoping to get a reality check from this community. **Do you have any thoughts on the feasibility of securing a Summer  '22 internship at this point, especially considering I will need to  wait until mid-June for the retroactive Pass/Fail to bring my GPA up to \~  3.5/4.0?** I'm considering networking/studying technicals until  that point and then submitting my applications but am concerned about  rolling applications filling up spots.

Thank you!"

In about a year, I (21F)would already max out as much classes I can take at my cc so I can be ready to transfer. Here is the problem though;

1. My dad - He is a smart guy , dude is software engineer. I can't say my relationship with him is trash because we don't fight too much and we seem to talk, have convos and i do have love for him as a parent. But in the past whenever I would bring up him providing information so I can fill out the fafsa to get financial aid such as grants, student loans and such for college, he would say how college a scam, student loans evil, he can't afford it, etc etc. How he doesn't want more debt for him or me. Talking to him is like talking to a brick wall at times when it comes to that topic alone. The only thing he said was that even if mom got a part time job, it would be workable.
2. my mom - I love her but she is difficult at times. She is sahm but figuring out what chores to do and when with her is like having an overbearing boss. Everything has to be done her way or the highway.  You can see what problems can erupt. She doesn't intend to work since there is a lot of home projects and things she would rather do at home. She thinks also, college is like not something you should go for immediately.
3. My sister (12F)- I love her too but she just can be overbearing for me. Whether its blaming something on me cuz i did xyz, trying to involve me in things that don't even remotely involve me. I share a room with her so its hard to avoid her at times especially after her venting to me how much she hates me. Oh get a job then? well i want to but this leads me to my next point.
4. My parents are absolute nutheads when it comes to work. They only want me having a job if it meets their critirea's: 1) does it pay 6 figures a year, and 2) so I can work only on certain days and certain times , no but's or if's. I gotten fired just cuz they kept demanding I come home exactly when my shift ends, even though there would be like a 10 minute drive i would need to and saying how if I go to a late shift, I will get kicked out since its a minimum wage and I shouldn't be doing it anyway but they decided they will be ""nice' and allow me to have it. 
5. I am interested in stem, biotech and computer science. I can potentially make that amount, but not without college. And I don't feel like going into another career like real estate or something just to escape the situation because it would defeat the point of me going taking these classes and applying for internships. Internships are something you do at that moment, not something later on like a job.
6. Although my parents aren't mean to my sis, they can be to me. Sometimes they make comments like I stink if i put on deodarent or scented lotion, if i add 4 teaspoons of sugar into my tea they start saying how i want diabetes. My mom did have physical altercations with me several times like hitting me on the face for example. My dad hasn't though.

I just feel like I have to tip toe around them just to get through my daily life while all my other friends are partying, exploring, finishing their bachelors up , and I am here barely ready to transfer because I just can't get to the next step in my life with my parents being like that.

I have a year to prepare for transferring so I really want to know what yall's think I can do."

I don’t plan to continue to study after my Master, but at the moment I don’t know what direction I want and can go into. 

I started to look for internships already, but I’m too early for that apparently since they all seem to start in September 2021. I read that vacancies for internships for January 2022 will be opened up around Sept/Oct 2021. BUT I’m stressed already. I don’t have any work experience related to my field besides helping out with courses I completed at university. I also did no extra curriculum activities, such as a board year or joining study associations, because I had to help out in our business at home basically every day besides school. 

I feel that I lack behind everyone else now and I did not had the proper chance to figure out what I like or want to do after graduation during my student years (bachelor and master). I guess, besides having to live at home due to financial and personal reasons, I’m also to blame since I didn’t put myself out there. I’m not a very social person and lack self-confidence, which I guess is another bad quality to have. 

The only good thing so far are my grades, but I noticed also this cannot help me out anymore. I’m starting my next year in August 2021 in a different country (Sweden), since my program consists of two universities. I’m finally moving out and going to live by myself (well, and an unknown housemate). 

What do you recommend me to do in this short amount of time (in my current country and in Sweden later on) to increase my chances in finding out what I like and most importantly; landing an internship and hopefully working there after graduating. 

I will make sure to join associations, social activities and events, and in-house days, career fairs and so on. I had an appointment with career counselor from both universities already (basically telling me to be patient). I applied for some internships without a start date already, but they rejected me. I also need to work on my programming skills I think, but not sure where to start. Basically I feel lost. My close friends are not studying in the same field and the ones who were, started their career after their bachelor (in directions I’m not very interested in). 

I feel lost. 

Can someone give me advice on what else I can do and/or share their experiences?"

n2fx3h,0,2021-05-01,UCLA vs UCSD for Cognitive Science?,pitachipsandcheese,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/n2fx3h/ucla_vs_ucsd_for_cognitive_science/,"Hello!

So, I’m a transfer student who’s currently deciding between UCLA or UCSD for the Cognitive Science major and would love some advice! I have until June 1st to a decide, which seems like a lot of time, but I’ve been told I should start looking for housing &amp; roommates ASAP and so this decision is consuming my everyday thoughts lol. 

For one, I’m really into the computational/programming side of Cognitive Science and would love to pursue a career in the tech industry such as UX design, web developer, software engineer, etc. As I’ve come to understand, UCSD is far more reputable for tech/STEM than UCLA and is known to have “invented” Cognitive Science in the first place. I’ve also looked at their curriculum for the major, and several of the courses listed peaked my interest more than that of UCLA, which is more psych-oriented. Thus, as far as landing future careers and internships go and learning what I actually want to learn, I believe UCSD is the better academic fit. 

On the other hand, UCLA is definitely the better cultural and personal fit for me. I’ve visited both campuses a few years ago and loved UCLA albeit wasn’t into UCSD very much. I also live closer to UCLA and I’m not particularly fond of the idea of moving far for college at this point in my life. I would still have to move out for UCLA, as I’ve heard commuting 45mins + traffic in LA isn’t doable, but I’d actually be really excited to live in LA, whilst I don’t care for San Diego. As for academics at UCLA, like I’ve said, it seems like their curriculum is more psych-oriented than it is computer-science related. I’ll still be able to take coding classes and “specialize in computing” as part of my major, but I just feel like it won’t prepare me as much for the tech-industry as UCSD would. 

Thus, it looks like I’m deciding between academic fit vs cultural fit. In all honesty, I think like I’m leaning towards UCLA because I feel like I’d be happier there, but I mean the reason I’m going to college is for an education and UCSD seems like it will offer me a better, more hands-on education, give me more programming experience, and nail me more jobs than UCLA would. Also, as for the cost of both schools, UCLA offered me a few grand more in financial aid than in UCSD — not much to play a significant role in my decision but just something to keep in mind. 

I’ve always been indecisive, and I’m not sure what matters most. For those of you who’ve read this far, which factor was more important to you and are you happy with your college decision? Any other advice would be really appreciated too! 


Thank you so much!"
n2g0xw,1,2021-05-01,Switching from Robotics engineering to full-stack ?,Aesz14,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/n2g0xw/switching_from_robotics_engineering_to_fullstack/,"**Tl,Dr**: robotics engineer not full of going full-stack or not, because lack of job in robotics.

Hello everyone,

&amp;nbsp;

I'm kinda lost in my career and I would like to know what you think.

I graduated from a master of engineering in robotics (aka low-level / real-time informatics) in september 2020.

In term of experience, at that point, I had one 3 month internship in data-science (in a research lab in Belfast), one other internship of 4 month in machine learning (in another research lab, in Spain), where I was able to be published, and my final year in apprenticeship, in space robotics (on a project part of [PERASPERA Roadmap](https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Engineering_Technology/PERASPERA_Space_Robotic_Technologies) ).

I landed a job 3 month after, as an machine learning / software engineer, in a research lab, where I'm currently working. I'm getting paid around 25 000€ / year (in France), which is very low (but that's the state of research in France). As an upside, the work life balance is very great (I'm talking 35 hours / week and  4.5 of paid holiday / month).

I begin more and more worried about my profesionnal futur. I would like to work in robotics, but there's no job, at least in France. That's why I accepted such a low salary, prefering to trade salary for experience at the beginning of my career.
To give some perspective, half of the people I graduated with are still jobless (7-8 months after graduating).

I'm more and more considering to make the switch to full-stack, because of the lack of job. But I would to know your thoughts ?
  
 
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

* Does my current job hurt my propsect of going in robotics ?

I'm currently working, but more as a machine learning engineer / """" learning full-stack"""" than other thing.
I'm worried that, by accepting that job because I needed the money, I would be hurting my prospects of going into robotics.

&amp;nbsp;

* Would the switch be easy ?

It's kinda a... Difficult question. I'm already kinda doing full-stack at the moment (I'm working on a react-native application on one side, and on a website on the other). But public sectors and private sectors have different exceptiation. Right now, I have some experience in React and React-native, and know a little bit of Django and Flask, I plan to learn express soon. Would that be enough to be considered full-stack ?

&amp;nbsp;


* How is the work-life balance as a full-stack ? Are remote jobs common ?

&amp;nbsp;

* Would that be easy to go back to robotics after ?

A little bit of the same as point 1.

I like robotics. I would love to work in it, but that can't pay the bill currently. After gaining some experience in a domain that is different from robotics, I would like to know if you think that would be easy to go back to that one ? My main problem is that I think I would be """"less"""" interesting for employer, because I do have only a little bit of experience in robotics (my internship + my apprenticeship), but I would cost more (for my experience in full-stack).
  

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

I'm looking for job in all of France and certain countries (Netherland, Switzerland...), but honestly, I would prefer to stay in France if possible.

Apologies for my english / my long message."

So a little history is I've been writing code for about 6.5 years now. Mostly using asp.net and c# as my chosen career. 

As far as my job history goes I've only ever worked for two companies. My first job I was an intern and eventually was hired as a junior. The team was abusive and had a weird power complex situation going on, so I left after 4 years. Plus the company had been dangling the carrot oh money for a while. 

This lead me to my current venture. I'm working for a marketing company and handling five projects that are core operations for the company. I am handling these ony own. I'm the only developer that works on these projects. There are two other devs working in their own projects as well. There isn't a lot of learning or anyone to help guide me career wise, but the culture is phenomenal. Needless to say, I can't grow like I should on my own. 

This lands me on the phone with HR from a new company. I aced the interviews after a year of being told I wasn't good enough for positions, after having interviews with big companies like Microsoft, after being told I'm still junior level and after 6 years that's really bad. I'm taking a position as a lead software engineer with my new company at a 6 figure salary. Under the guidance of a team of 5 engineers as part of a bigger team of 18 engineers. I'm flabbergasted.

In the words of Rocky:

Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain’t all sunshine and rainbows. It’s a very mean and nasty place, and I don’t care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain’t about how hard you hit. It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward; how much you can take and keep moving forward. That’s how winning is done! Now, if you know what you’re worth, then go out and get what you’re worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain’t where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody. Cowards do that and that ain’t you. You’re better than that!

You can do it you just have to not give up or settle."

I got an itw coming up in IT audit and despite knowing that it gets a bad rep around here, i would like to have your take on how to answer this question ? Also the question might come up with another one like ""why IT audit and not consulting ?"" (i did an internship at a big4 and worked in both)

I was thinking of saying something like this : IT audit would allow me to delve deeper into how information systems work, and having that understanding is important to have a holistic view of how IT works since IT nowadays is basically the backbone of many companies

On consulting i would add : There are overlaping skills between IT audit and IT consulting (attention to detail, conducting itws, soft skills) and in IT audit we usually get to work on consulting assignments outside of the auditing  season (might be risky to say this if it's not the case)

What do you think ? Is there anything else i could add ?

The on boarding went well. But on the very first I was handed the server code base and was told by the manager to add two new features by the next day.

I've joined a AI research team in a big company (transitioning internally) about a year and a half ago, and got quickly promoted to project leader of a software project that is supposed to help our research team. It makes sense from the team point-of-view because I'm the only person who could have taken that role given my experience (more real SWE experience, and also experienced working in research).

Recently a brainstorming with the research team basically oriented the project toward a data processing project, which again makes sense from the team's point of view. However, for me it's depressing, I've joined the team because I'm truly passionate about ML research (although I don't have a PhD), I haven't touched a DL training for almost a year now, and this new orientation makes me think that I won't for a while.

I'm still young (29y) and even tho I understand that I'm the most qualified for this role, I don't think it's the best way I can expend my career (I'm not THAT technically experienced, most of my decisions are just educated guess and take time plan, I don't have any mentoring, I'm mostly managing interns and juniors).

I also don't think so far that this promotion got converted into title / financial raise (still not senior, even tho I've always been top contributor, and my colleague who stayed in SWE team already got promoted, and because I didn't get promoted my raise last year were imho pretty low).

I'm thinking about asking for a demotion to get back into research (I do think this team is exceptionally good in AI research, so I would prefer not to move).

Is this a suicidal move career-wise? Is there a better solution?

Our raise process is announced in June, I should get promoted senior there (I'm not sure about how much raise), should I wait for it before doing anything?

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would be really appreciated."

Received by Associates in CS. Summer 2020 I got a cool research opportunity in CS. Had a lot of fun. 

Fall 2020 started, I did horrible. I couldn’t focus while doing online classes. I only passed two of my classes. 

Then spring 2021, I told myself I’d do better. Ended up Dropping 3 of my classes. Doing really bad in the 2 that I’m in right now. 

This summer I’m doing a SWE internship at an aerospace company. 

My school said that they will be in person in the fall, but they’re prioritizing the majors that need to be in person. CS is not one of those majors. So only one class will be in person. 

I applied to a school in Texas because I know they’re gonna be completely in person in the fall. I was accepted. My expected graduation date would be the same as my current school. Also, I have family that I’m really close to that lives 30-40 min away from this school. So I’d be able to live with them.

Given my current track record:

Should I drop out of school, and just do personal projects, study up leetcode and then try to apply to full time SWE roles? 

Continue school where I’m at? 

Or, go to Texas and continue school there?"

Anyway, I'm not sure how to pick between Edi and Warwick. Edi seems like a nicer place to live in while Warwick has an attractive scholarship for international students (i.e. me) but as I understand I'll have to firm Warwick to be properly considered for the scholarship. Teaching-wise I've heard good things from both places so I'd be choosing based on other factors.

I chose physics because it's such a broad subject but I want to combine it with something else to break out into another field like engineering or finance, and Edi seems to be better for this as they do offer broad electives. I'm also worried about which uni brand would help me out more when applying for internships somewhere like London. Would a degree from Edinburgh carry any weight compared to those applying from other top unis? Am I better off with betting on Warwick + a potential scholarship?

n2o3ac,3,2021-05-01,Are internships during college worth pursuing?,LuggageMan,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n2o3ac/are_internships_during_college_worth_pursuing/,"Hello. This is a question/rant at myself.

I have 3 semesters left (including this one) before graduating. Since college started, I've been trying to land an internship. I spread myself too thin trying to learn a lot of skills needed by the internships I find. I finally managed to interview once and I passed a technical interview but I sucked at the ""management"" interview (the one where they ask you behavioural questions) so I was rejected (they didn't tell me the reason, I just assumed that it's the management interview because it came after the technical one).

It's frustrating. Every internship requires a different set of skills (at least the ones in my country) and I always feel like my skills and projects aren't enough. Right now, my resume has many skills but I'm not really good in most of them, if I had to use them I will need to review and learn more about them.

Meanwhile, I sort of neglected studying college subjects, telling myself I'll learn them later, but I now regret it. Maybe if I focused on studying the core CS subjects and did a decent project in each of them, I would have more opportunities when I graduate (e.g., be ready to do a master's).

But I'm still not sure if I should focus the time I have left solely on that or if I should still try to pursue internships. I think initially my desire to find an internship was a dumb one. I think it was along the lines of ""I want to be like Mark Zuckerberg"" or something. I thought I was special just because I started programming at 10 but boy was I wrong. Because of my humongous ego, I made a lot of bad decisions. I kept comparing myself to my colleagues who started interning or freelancing, one of them even worked as a full-fledged SWE in multiple companies!

Another reason of why I was rushing things so much is because of my anxiety that my chances of finding a job after I graduate will be very low without an internship. A lot of the companies I've seen are either looking for interns or senior devs.

So right now, I'm confused. I want to know if my fear is justified and if there's a rational reason people pursue internships during college. Right now, the only thing I can think of is money and experience. I need both but more importantly I need knowledge. I don't want to call myself an engineer if I don't have good grasp on these topics (I'm talking about OS, databases, distributed systems, even compilers).

**TL;DR** I wasted a lot of time trying to land an internship but never did. Now I have 2.5 semesters left and I want to know if there's a merit in pursuing an internship or if I should just focus on college.

**Edit** Some details about me:

* I'm from Egypt
* 2.7 GPA
* I don't mind working in non-FAANG, in fact I've seen better working environments than FAANG
* I would prefer living and working in a different country, if my job affords me to
* I will probably need to work a while after graduating because I can't afford a Master's unless it's a scholarship or something"

Alright so I know this title probably provokes some pretty strong reactions, but hear me out for a minute. Here's the story:

&amp;#x200B;

After going through a series of interview back in Fall 2020, I was offered a Summer 2021 software engineering internship at a decent company (not one of the ""top three"" or whatever y'all on this sub call it, but a pretty big company that would have been a decently paid internship).

Alright great, throughout winter etc. I sign all my forms, get my drug tests yada yada and everything is good to go.

Cut to March -- I get an email from a company that is more well known/tech centered, for a position that is also software engineering, but a lot more focused on what I enjoy and better paid. 

I just got an offer from company #2 and I want to accept it but this would mean backing out on company #1's internship which is supposed to start in like 2 weeks.

I get this would probably blacklist me at company #1, but like based on the contract they gave me, either party can terminate at any time for no reason. Is there any reason I shouldn't do this?

thanks"

I just completed my sophomore year and realized two things I didn’t really know before: 1) I really like CS and that 2) I actually have the ability to do it. I wish I could’ve seen this sooner (i.e. before I was halfway done with college), but I’m really close to pulling the trigger on switching to a CS degree. 

The one thing that really worries me is I know how competitive internships can be, as many of my friends in CS have SWE internships as sophomores. I’d be afraid of switching majors now and then having no real experience with which to nab an internship after junior year. I know that FAANG is probably out of the question and that’s okay, I just don’t want to be completely left out in the cold. 

Does anyone have experience with doing something similar, or do you think it’s too late to switch?"

I recently considered applying for a few internships to get my foot in the door. I've been on and off teaching myself Python for almost 2 years now, and I think the next logical step in my growth is to be thrown to the wolves in a professional environment.

I recently spoke to a Data Engineer about applying for the Data Engineer internship role underneath him. He mentioned that although my skills may fit the role, his company is only looking for college students. I am willing to work unpaid in order to gain valuable experience, however. 

To no longer digress, I wanted to ask, is it worth it applying to internships, when most companies hiring interns are only really considering college students? I never understood the logic. I don't need credit obviously, just experience and am willing to look for free. Should I just try to dive into a junior role at this point? I want to mitigate the risk for a company by hiring me as an intern, so I can prove my skills through that manner. 

Any self-taught found the intern route worthless?"

Dead end situation, looking for advice",Puzzleheaded_Ad323,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/n2rr0p/graduated_10_years_ago_in_chemical_engineering/,"I am approaching my 10 year graduation anniversary from a reputable school in my Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering. I have not had nearly the same success as my peers or even recent graduates. My personal life has not taken off either and my self worth has deteriorated pending a resolution to this debacle.

Background: Graduated in 2011 with a 3.0 GPA and a minor in management. Could not get an internship in the years prior (may have been attributed to the Economic downturn, but really I'm just making excuses for my failures). Had to settle for a few research lab assistant positions. No job after graduation. Hundreds of applications sent out. Did odd jobs for a year after I graduated to pay the bills at minimum wage. Had to settle for an unpaid internship in a car parts manufacturer for six months, dealing with the chrome plating process and environmental waste disposal concerns. Did odd jobs after that was over at minimum wage. Hundreds of job applications sent out. Got a job as a ""Project Engineer"" as a contractor for big Chemical companies only after a chance encounter through personal connections. What this job really started off as is alot of manual labor, shift work, 15 hour shifts 3 week projects with no days off and on top of that, I was stuck with a very very low salary with no overtime (would have done better at a slightly higher than minimum wage hourly rate). Though I am in a dead end situation, I have sort of evolved in the past 8 years. Some of my current responsibilities include:

\-Responding to RFQs with proposals

\-Project management-project scheduling, resource allocation, supervision of employees, costing

\-Dealing with plant engineers, sales managers

\-PMing of Patented (company specific) Equipment (which doesn't translate directly over to other companies needs)

Some of the negatives:

\-The same manual labor as before in the outdoors (worst I've had is Saudi Arabia in the summer time and Northern China in the winter time).

\-Way more travel/projects than before (90 hour work weeks, being gone maybe 30-40% of total time (not work time), being abroad.. even during Covid and dealing with 1-2 week quarantine periods.. can't make friends/join clubs/date

\-Still way underpaid with no overtime (about the same rate as the average entry level engineer.. except that I work way longer hours and am traveling a large percentage of the time).

\-No career path forward.

\-I have no clue what a Chemical Engineer does

So I was wondering what I can do moving forward? I have tried leaving the company since I got hired. Thousands of applications later, many interviews later I have realized.... I have no relevant experience. I can get to the interview process for a few of those applications, but once I get there, the interviewers realize that I do not have the attributes that they would want from a Non-entry level engineer. I would say I have the people skills in the interview process, I just don't have the job specific skills that they are looking for. I have tried to counter that by applying for Entry level Engineering positions, internships or technician roles to get my foot in the door but I don't get interviews for these types of roles.

So here a couple of options

\-Keep interviewing in the same manner and maybe get lucky (or alternatively wither away in obscurity till retirement or death)

\-Keep interviewing but lie about my roles

\-Apply for entry level positions with a dumbed down resume and/or change the graduation date to make it appear that I'm a recent graduate

\-Apply for other jobs not engineering related, focusing on project management (no clue how to go about this)

\-Get a bachelor's degree in accounting and forget that the last 14 years ever existed

\-Get a bachelor's degree in another Engineering field like Industrial Engineering where there are a greater number of opportunities

\-Get an MBA and hope this enhances my skill set for the work force

\-Give up and accept that this is my life forever (not my preferred option... Would rather do option 1 and fail, but I do get really exhausted with these job applications and take a few breaks every so often)

\-Play the lottery and hope I win it so I don't have to deal with this situation!

Just wondering what people's thoughts were. It's really quite depressing that I've nearly graduated a decade ago and I have nothing to show for it and would have probably been better off without going to school! Sorry for the long post!"

It was so much fun being able to learn from such an amazing team and being able to be a part in some amazing events and projects for them! I’ve learned more than I ever have in any of my previous internships.

However, since this internship was full time, along with school, and work, and other personal problems that have been in my life, I feel as if they weren’t able to see me at my all. I feel heartbroken as a month prior my supervisor and I sat down to talk about my progress so far and how I liked my internship experience. I told her I apologized for possibly not being able to give it my all as I’ve been overworked with too many assignments clashing with intern work, only to hear more saddening news that she saw that and saw how it affected my attention to detail, my communication with my team, and the times I had for work.

I work around the clock and on weekends and on my only free days to ensure I don’t overdue an assignment for them but sometimes it was taking up too much time and I felt bad. But after hearing that she told me about my “rooms for growth” which is just another word for mistakes and not being good enough, I ended up having to bite my lip before I burst out crying from feeling like a failure.

I never thought I was worthy to get the opportunity that I have with them or continue it but here I am 3 weeks away from the end! However, as I caught up and all my assignments with them are finished, I saw that I now was going to be given an exit interview and saw a list of number scores that I’d be receiving from myself, and her.

It scares me so much to see those same words, attention to detail, timeliness, and communication pop out. It worries me so much that I’m afraid she’ll give me bad scores and that I’ll be ruined for it all.

n2zb68,11,2021-05-02,"Terrible internship anxiety, anyone else feel like they don’t belong?",jasminesenpai,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/n2zb68/terrible_internship_anxiety_anyone_else_feel_like/,"Recently I’ve taken up an internship with a huge company this semester! It was so much fun being able to learn from such an amazing team and being able to be a part in some amazing events and projects for them! I’ve learned more than I ever have in any of my previous internships.

However, since this internship was full time, along with school, and work, and other personal problems that have been in my life, I feel as if they weren’t able to see me at my all. I feel heartbroken as a month prior my supervisor and I sat down to talk about my progress so far and how I liked my internship experience. I told her I apologized for possibly not being able to give it my all as I’ve been overworked with too many assignments clashing with intern work, only to hear more saddening news that she saw that and saw how it affected my attention to detail, my communication with my team, and the times I had for work.

I work around the clock and on weekends and on my only free days to ensure I don’t overdue an assignment for them but sometimes it was taking up too much time and I felt bad. But after hearing that she told me about my “rooms for growth” which is just another word for mistakes and not being good enough, I ended up having to bite my lip before I burst out crying from feeling like a failure.

I never thought I was worthy to get the opportunity that I have with them or continue it but here I am 3 weeks away from the end! However, as I caught up and all my assignments with them are finished, I saw that I now was going to be given an exit interview and saw a list of number scores that I’d be receiving from myself, and her.

It scares me so much to see those same words, attention to detail, timeliness, and communication pop out. It worries me so much that I’m afraid she’ll give me bad scores and that I’ll be ruined for it all. I’ve done all I can to help improve my communication, my timing on projects, and more within the last month and took it to a new level in order to show them I wanted to be seen as worthy, but this broke my confidence and I’m horrified on what she has to say.

n2zmm3,13,2021-05-02,Grad School after Cornell (CS),TOPsArt,Cornell,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/n2zmm3/grad_school_after_cornell_cs/,"How difficult is it to get into a highly-ranked MS program for CS after undergrad at Cornell? Is it possible to have a high enough GPA (like 3.7ish or high 3's i guess) to get into one of these programs? And still have time to do internships and research? I mean I fully intend on trying my hardest but I'm wondering if Cornell Engineering is just too rigorous to have a competitive grad school application after it lol.

Also, I'm looking into MS programs that are fully funded (I've heard there are very selective ones that offer full tuition if you RA/TA for them or programs that offer money for research or something). Is that even possible to do lol..

Know anyone who has made it into a top MS program for CS after Cornell? It'd be great to hear their story if it's possible lol.

I know there's an M. Eng option at Cornell, but I'm looking into MS particularly. This [website](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/undergrad/cscareers/placementreport) said that from a survey a lot of people go into M. Eng at Cornell if they even do grad school &amp; others just don't. One says Stanford but how do I do that and how likely is it?

Thanks!"

n30yqj,3,2021-05-02,Is a CS minor(w/Mechanical Engineering major) enough to get a Software Developer job? Or should I get a double major or maybe a Master's?,jzaprint,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/n30yqj/is_a_cs_minorwmechanical_engineering_major_enough/,"TLDR: I am a 3rd-year Mechanical Engineering student with a CS minor. I had taken a semester off for a MechE Co-op, which means I will already graduate late in 4.5 years total. Should I take an extra semester to get the CS double major(making it 5 years in college total), or graduate as is and get a CS Master's, or will the Minor be enough? (I obviously have mechE internship experience and no practical CS experiences or projects)

I had always been interested in tech and CS. In high school, when I took my first AP CS class, I was in love, but I was also heavily discouraged by some of the kid geniuses in my class. And ever since then, I had kind of sworn off programming and thought I could never make a career out of this when there are people this much smarter than me. (I know this is a terrible way of thinking. I will admit it took me a while, but I finally am not seeing everything this way) I never completely gave up CS though, just didn't make my major out of it, thinking I will just get a minor and use the programming skills in my Mechanical Engineering career as a supplement.

So fast forward to now, I had realized I don't want to block off the software dev world, and I want to do something that involves MechE and programming, maybe a software dev at an automotive firm or something. So back to my question, I am luckily well financially supported by my parents. I can afford another semester in college or a master's program. My main concern is just the extra time I'd spend in school and not in the industry. I just want to know if beefing up my portfolio with projects is enough to get some internships or an entry-level dev job, or do I also need the degree(along with an extra half a year), or should I just get a Masters in CS(along with an extra 1-2 years)?

Sorry this got kind of long, thanks to anyone who took their time to read it!"

I fell into a winner because my school's career counselor happened to share a lead with students she's worked with, and I figured I'd give it a shot with an application I'd sent to an MSP.  My tech interview was ""What are IaaP and PaaP,"" but the dude told me the previous two candidates didn't even know *that* and were in.  Worth noting:  It's also fully authorized for my school for academic credits (and a hell of a paycheck), so there should be a fair a mount of instruction and/or guidance through the program.

The concern is:  I don't know anything about cloud.  I've been so underinformed about career options that I didn't even know what consulting really is, and would never have found this posting on my own.

I'm starting at *zero* knowledge of this specific area, and want to do something of a crash course around school, and after the semester.  I have seven weeks before it starts, and want to show up knowing more than I did at the interview.

\[Hello all. Special thanks to /u/Al125478 for the excellent suggestion of a chapter/sub-chapter title. [Discord](https://discord.gg/Qtcbjj9tRU). I will clarify that Hex/Binary's crew aren't taking the Kalmyr Nykel, per se. Or at least, not all of it. I had a lot of spare time this weekend, so I took the opportunity to wrap this section.\]

***********

&amp;#x200B;

* **From Progress to Congress**

Verns waited outside Senator McLauchlin’s office, trying to look like they belonged. The father-son duo had picked the lock to the side entrance and walked inside without needing to scan in with security, keeping their facade intact. George walked up to his father, briefcase in hand. 

“Finish your job?” Verns asked his son. 

“Found the RJ45 jacks in the server room. Found the wires for the emergency signal,” he said. “No one in the server room. Snip snip. No signals, in or out. Hinge pins took the door off and from there was no lock I couldn’t pick.”

His father grinned but restrained himself from any signs of affection. “That’s my boy,” he said quietly.

A call to the senate’s secretary that a certain business and major donor were ‘sending a representative’ had sent the Senator scurrying off the chamber floor mid-debate on the vote to answer to his master. Quite pathetic, really, that one phone call from Verns’ best “powerful and important person” voice on a script the Emperor wrote for him could have such an effect. Democracy was laboriously slow until money called. Then it arrived sweating and huffing, as an old ‘public’ servant waddled toward the door.

Verns and George made a show of waiting at the door. Verns made a show of checking his wrist watch on his knockoff wrist watch. George took the opportunity to tap his recorder as the three took seats and he apologised profusely for being late, all but lying supine before a donor whilst screening calls from his supposed constituency.

“Councilman, you are here on a favour that has been called in from a certain powerful individual. I am here as their representative, and I am here to urge you to reconsider several sections of your bill, outlined here, and to preferably scrap it entirely.”

Confusion crossed Senator McLauchlin’s features. What did a corporate donor care about whether their customers were armed or not? He gave a quick glance at the paper, pretending to read it while his mind raced to come up with an answer.

“I am here to ensure your compliance and that certain promises are kept. You *were* briefed on our position regarding the matter of disarmament, correct?” Verns asked.

“Ah, I’m *aware* of it,” the politician lied smoothly,  letting down the paper and offering a shot of scotch pricier than the Verns’ work van. Verns took the offered shot and toasted, enjoying how smoothly it went down. 

“Unfortunately, I have conflicting orders that trump yours. The Shil’vati are, I’m afraid, simply not to be resisted. They say something- anything at all, and it’s like being told ‘jump!’ We don’t ask ‘how high,’ we just hope we break orbit. You know how it is. We’re in a new age and we’re all profiting, but only as long as we keep them happy. Surely, as a salaryman yourself, you understand.”

That was enough evidence alone to damn him. But why stop there? It seemed the first thing they were killing today would be time.

“Would you say everyone in office feels that way?” Asked George, examining the dirt under his fingernails as if totally uninterested. 

Verns chuckled. “Sorry about my son,” Verns patted George on the shoulder and gave a warm smile. “He’s still learning the way of things.” The Senator returned the smile with that of a used car salesman, all smarm.

“That’s okay, my daughter’s starting to go through her own rebellious phase. They learn, eventually. But I do wonder what concern his bill is to our mutual contact?”

Verns opened his briefcase, careful to keep the lid between the Senator’s eyes and whatever was inside, before pulling several papers out and sliding them across the desk.

“The particular clause we are most concerned about, after the right of bearing arms, is wherein taxpayers will be footing the bill for any damages from when the Shil’vati conduct ‘anti-terrorism’ activities- including area bombardment? We do pay taxes, you see. Or rather, they do not intend to be on the hook for the actions of a few rogue individuals, should certain tax loopholes be closed. We also do prefer that the guns *not* be banned.”

The Senator shrugged. “My hands are tied. I’m afraid that they were quite adamant that this bill include these provisions. My ink touches that paper to strike that from it, and I’m out of here and a new senator’s in this chair. It’s how they work. I’m just happy to make sure everyone toes the line for them, and they reward me for it handsomely. Maybe you should have started with my colleagues.”

“I’m sure the Senator represents only himself when he says those things, son, and that we can find someone else who is a little more sympathetic to our client’s aims,” Verns suggested to his son.

Senator McLauchlin’s expression was one of alarmed confusion. “What?”

“A replacement, might work as well. Perhaps someone could primary him, then fill this man’s position.”

“I’ve been working with your client for forty years. You know, anyone you replace me with will face that same exact pressure. You stand up to them, you’re gone, that’s it, you’re out of here. Heck, they don’t have to even come through here much anymore. Fly their dropships overhead, do a little force projection, that’s it. You toss me out, some hothead who stands up to the eggplants, and the other senators will see it as an extra credit assignment for the Shil’vati, a chance to kiss ass and prove they can be trusted to cooperate. You wanna try and compete with them?” 

“We think we can,” Verns’ answer was steely. “I believe we will soon make a compelling case for cooperation.”

The Senator seemed to stare in disbelief before making a show of stacking the papers on his desk. “Good luck! Ain’t no amount of money anyone’s got, and I don’t care how much the company thinks it has or can donate to my account, is going to change that. Whatever replacement you scrounge up ain’t gonna get far effecting change, either.”

“So, then, there is nothing we can do?” 

“Now, say you swing me a check with enough zeroes on it, and make assurances they won’t come down on me from on high like a ton of bricks, then I might be able to make *one* item ‘vanish’ between drafts back and forth between an intern and me.” The corpulescent man leaned back in his chair. “But I frankly don’t get why anyone at DuPont gives a shit about the civil rights of citizens.”

“And that is all? Money?”

“Money, moolah, pesos, as long as the check clears, but power-wise, there isn’t a power I’ve heard of, not even religion, that can compete with what they’ve got, so, yes, let’s just say money. You have to keep your expectations realistic, I thought you would have-”

The lights flickered and the emergency lights switched on, the senator trailing off as he glanced around the room.

“Well, son, I’m afraid that the senator’s mind may simply have been made up and there is no convincing him,” Verns said calmly.

The two exchanged a glance, and hands went into briefcases and put their masks on, and drew pistols in hand. George pulled his recorder out and waved it at the senator. The senator stared for a second or two, then hit the panic button. Deep in the bowels of the facility, the emergency generator kicked on, and the signal tried to route out via the server room. G-Man’s work had cut all the data and phone line cables.

“Now, Senator, you were quick to adjust to the power structure the aliens brought, and have led the charge on this bill. What do you say we have two names of the co-authors of your bill? Or, alternatively, two people you suspect are not so loyal to you, and who have opposed you.”

There was shouting in the hallways- and then gunfire, followed by an inhuman and high-pitched shriek. The Senator looked shocked, now, and was trying to shrink into his own chair. “There went your bodyguard. I’d say you have about five seconds to name them.”

There was a knock- one-two, three-four, five-six-seven. *Olly Olly Oxen-Free.* Or, *Alle, alle, auch sind frei*. George got the door, and stood aside.

Emperor walked in, mask-on, voice deepened to a dull and deep roar. Shouts filled the hallway as congressmen were pulled from the chamber, being marched behind him. He was flanked by men with rifles who stood guard, all cutting an imposing figure as he’d slowly filled out through months of training and preparation. “Senator. It is so good to see you at last. How are we this evening?”

“I’m afraid our esteemed Senator is a little slow to come up with any names of collaborators or new allies, my Emperor.” Verns actually made a show of bowing, pistol still in hand but no longer trained on the Senator.

“Then we take him outside. He will be the first. Ensure that our men handle the security tapes and join us.”

“At once,” G-Man agreed.

The Emperor plucked the Empress’s flag off the desk, holding it up to his grey mask. “Oh, and this is mine now. I think I’ll wipe my ass with it.”

G-Man noted the look of horror on the Senator’s face as he cowered in the corner with a satisfied smirk.

&amp;#x200B;

*  **Alea Iacta Est**

We led the befuddled Senator outside, to a scene of total chaos. A mob waited for him on the steps of the state capitol, everyone who was inside being led out at gunpoint. Dumpsters had been filled and set ablaze, and a clearing had been left in the center of the courtyard outside near the fountain.

The Senator’s head craned, as if looking for a squad of Shil’vati marines to come swooping in to rescue him. We were only a little over a mile from the military base’s perimeter, after all, and for him it was unthinkable that they wouldn’t. I saw four rebels hauling a dead Shil’vati security officer’s limp and bloody body behind him. One of the resistance members had her rifle, and was passively attempting to overcome the bio lock. No such luck to be had, of course. Otherwise a railgun would hardly be necessary.

“How could you have done this? How?” 

“With dynamite, trickery, misdirection, poison, guns, sabotage, a few like-minded people, and a little gumption?” 

Was this a trick question?

“Our democracy -“ 

“Oh, that.” I switched gears mentally, hopping out of my analysis of the overall mission’s progression to give him a proper answer. 

“Give it a rest, old man,” Grey Mask taunted as we walked up to The Barrel. It had been lowered off a trailer and steamed even against the heat of the warm spring night. I’d had to give up on finding an actual cauldron, and had settled for an enormous industrial steel container, shaped like a 55-gal cylinder, except far *larger*, with a fire cooking underneath, and a circular saw had cut it down to approximately waist height.

“Honestly, when you and your kind worked together to oust any political expression that ran against your beliefs, then you killed democracy. The idea is supposed to give *everyone* a seat at the table. Instead, you’ve changed it where whenever anyone pipes up with a contrary opinion to ‘let’s suck the clit of our new Shil’vati Empress,’ they disappear, or get purged, or chased out of life and livelihood. Turns out, that isn’t very popular.”

Before he could say anything, though, Grey Mask got in his face.

“Like *Parker and Pierce*, or Senators Burroughs, Siegfried, and Bouchard. Those names ringing any bells for you? You only worked with them for a few *decades*. You’re supposed to be a team! We’re supposed to be a team! Now you tried fighting for the wrong side, look where it got you!”

Damn. Words taken right from my speech in the parking lot earlier. I guess it had made an impression on him. 

“Was it them who put you up to this? *Some ideas* have no place in -“ I shushed him a few times, cutting him off and waving the knife back and forth, Grey Mask stepping aside to let me speak now. When he kept sputtering, I put the knife against his throat, holding it there while I circled around until I had my mouth against the senator’s ear.

“Those senators have no idea we even exist, let alone put us up to this!” I shouted into his ear, as if amused by his accusation we were anyone’s agents. “I don’t even know if they’re alive.” He winced but kept his throat carefully still, and didn’t dare speak with the tip of the dagger resting where it was.

“How does it feel now, knowing that I’m cutting off *your* speech? It is, after all, what made all this possible. Now that you can’t speak, though, do you still defend your actions? Or were you only okay with it as long as you were winning? Total lack of principles, I say. It’s all about power to you.” 

“We’re- we’re not so different, you and I-” He started.

“Don’t self-aggrandize,” G-Man spoke. “Barrel’s ready.”

I took the knife off the Senator and shoved him forward toward it. The fat man stumbled a few steps with the hard shove while I turned on my heel to speak to the rest of the Assemblymen.

Grey mask took over. “You, a snivelling traitorous coward who bows down on both knees. Gonna teach you the cost of disloyalty.”

I watched Grey Mask slash his knife across his man’s shirt the moment he opened his mouth to object further, opening it- and likely the skin underneath as well. He shrieked in terror, then started whimpering as more slashes followed, literally cutting and stripping away his clothing until he stood bare and bleeding, surrounded, and being herded toward the gigantic barrel.

I spoke to the assemblymen. 

“That’s the difference between the Shil’vati and us. The Shil’vati mostly play by the rules of the game they create, but ensure those rules are stacked in their own favour. No wonder you spineless sacks of shit love working for the eggplants so much, you’re so alike! Us, though? We don’t even care about the rules in the first place!”

“Quit fucking around, and TAR AND FEATHER THE SONS OF BITCHES!” Sam bellowed from the crowd, and everyone around him roared in approval.

I took a step back from the assemblymen, and looked over at the naked senator and insurgents who surrounded him. The largesse he’d accumulated off the public dime exposed. I’d seen the man’s fine scotch, desk, suit, and near-million dollar luxury car parked in the lot. He lived far in excess of the means of any public servant. I held my hand out in front of me, and made a thumb’s down.

‘Tarring and Feathering.’ It sounded so nice and harmlessly comical. Like you’d imagine turning someone into a chicken. Something modestly humiliating. It didn’t bring to mind the third degree burns and blisters.

He kept begging until they shoved him in, tipping him over and then shoving his kicking bare feet until they submerged, too. At last, he surfaced, screaming, blind and hands finding the edge, managing to pull himself out. The smell was of a toxic chemical, some bromide cooked up in a wicked vat to choke and poison a planet with, and it covered him like a second skin. It seemed fitting for such a loathsome creature to be slicked with something so vile and putrescent. The whole crowd went up in a cheer.

He staggered away from the barrel, trying to blink his eyes clear, likely trying to find the fountain.

He sank to his knees, and was held in place by two women, wearing honest-to-god floral baker’s oven mitts and aprons, their masks a matte black so dark they seemed to swallow even the streetlight. The feathers got dumped over his naked body next, and he was turned in place and lifted, then shoved forward to walk toward his horrified fellow assemblymen until he fell to his knees again.

“Hold him up,” I ordered, then speaking so loudly the rest of the men and women we held hostage could hear over his quieting moans.

“This can right here?” G-man held the jug high in his teflon gloves. “It contains boiling ink. Quite expensive to fill, you know. Far more than the common man makes in a year, but that was the cost of your ear.” I knew he was lying. It was tar- we weren’t nearly rich enough for actual ink. But who was going to say otherwise?

Now I spoke.

“This bill you’ve written. A hundred and twenty pages? Here, let me summarise.”

I held out a few pages of his proposed bill in front of me, and pretended to read from it aloud.

“‘Dear subhuman filth, we own you. There is *nothing* we can’t pass that you can do anything about. In fact, we are now daring you to try. Please come kill us, if you can.’” I turned to the gathered crowd. “I think that sums it up nicely, don’t you?” The crowd cheered again, and the assemblymen started trying to shout their objections. “Our lovely assistants here have turned a copy of this bill into something more useful, a paper mache funnel!”

He shook his head, and tried to speak, only to scream as the hot tar stretched over his jowls. “No - no! That’s not - I didn’t -”

“My apologies, senator. It seems you need more ink to issue a correction.”

The women holding him each worked to turn his mouth skyward, forcing his jaw open with the expertise of practiced nurses who had uncooperative patients. They stuffed their homemade, comically oversized paper mache funnel into his mouth. I worked with G-Man to upend the pitcher, watching as he thrashed, gagged, and then flopped on the ground, and then he went still. The nurses peeled their oven mitts off him, taking his skin off with it.

“He should have been afraid for his life when *I* killed the Governess, with my bare hands, in her own home, with this very knife!” Technically, it was the same *type.* Larry had refused to either clean it or hand it over unless I told him exactly what I was using it for. But he had sourced a similar, mean-looking [Gerber Mk. II](https://imgur.com/a/YMia49E) for me. Assuming the aliens did any forensics at all, this would confirm that I was ‘the real deal’.

“If they couldn’t protect her, and they couldn’t protect him with the base a mere mile away, they cannot protect *you*. Some of you, I believe, were simply too afraid to oppose the aliens, too afraid to even defend those who did stand up to do the right thing. But I ask you now, who do you fear more?”

I turned to the next Senator in line, slowly. He began to babble.

“You’re right. We were scared. We were scared of what they would do to us. What they would do to you - so we fed them a little. The ones who were too loud to sweep under the rug. But the whole time - the whole time, we’ve been *protecting* you, blunting their will.” He was begging now, still on his knees.

I smirked. “See, I *might just believe you*, but for one little issue. I already know who the dissidents are in the government, the resisters who have held the bill up this long, and I know you’re not on that list. But, well, there’s still room for it to grow. Out of mercy, we’ve decided to give *some* of you a chance to prove you’re one of them. Name two of your colleagues that have been disloyal to humanity. We’ll corroborate it, check it against the list of loyalists. Now, step forward, quietly.”

“I - I -” he babbled, “I can think of one,” he said, eyed not leaving the barrel. “T-two,” stammering as I drew closer with the knife. In truth, I’d only wanted to hear who he said.

“Names.”

George and Grey Mask wrote them down for me.

**Stimulus Response**

“Ma’am! The state legislature! It’s awful!” 

Governess Bal’Shir brought the soldier’s hand to her own ventilator mask to help keep her lungs moving. The fabricator was churning them out quickly, but they still needed tending to and monitoring, and anyone who could stand was called in to assist.

“What’s happening now?”

“The State Capitol is under attack!”

“What!? That’s so close by!” Governess Bal’Shir glanced over to the General, who was helping chart each name and track their condition. 

“General, can we deploy the base perimeter security?”

The Governess glanced at the person the General had in her arms, and realised they were wearing the striped armband of a perimeter sentry.

The General paused from her duties to shake her head. 

“We rounded up almost all the healthy bodies we had handy to staff the dropship and respond to the threat at Lewes Beach. The base perimeter’s automated defenses and our own point defenses are almost everything we have left. While I’d love to go on out there myself,” the old warrior gestured around the room full of marines on death’s door. “We’re a little busy in here keeping our own girls alive. I’m not about to sacrifice them for some humans.” 

The idea hit the Governess like a thunderbolt.

“Right! Of course, the humans!”

“Ma’am?” 

“I know it’s early, but I want you to call in that new branch we formed out of humans. The new 'Security Forces' branch. We've had them holed up in the River Fortress for training. I think it's time we called them out to assist in quelling these riots and protests. Mobilise them, right now. Bring some here, have them help guard the base as well, and send a patrol vehicle out to investigate the courthouse.”

“At once ma’am. If there is actually a problem at the state courthouse, they may need more backup than a single truck.”

The Governess considered for a second.

“What about the dropship? Can we bring the soldiers back, then deploy them again to back up the patrol vehicle, if there is an issue?”

“We can’t leave the nobles there. Politically, it would be suicide. They’ll say we abandoned them,” the Governess said hastily.

The General grit her teeth. The Governess wanted to play politics. She offered no solutions, for she had none that the Governess would accept. Calling for reinforcements from other Nobles was a career-ender, an admission of weakness and incompetence. Couldn’t the Governess see they were well past that point?

“What if we put the nobles *in* the dropship, with the soldiers, bring them back here? Then, if need be, they can back up the Security Forces?” She tried to clarify her suggestion.

“That… might work,” the Governess agreed slowly. “It’ll be far from their usual luxurious accommodation, but I suppose we could, yes.”

An autopilot system attempting a docking with a replica of a wooden ship from the 1600s with a replacement crew wasn’t ideal, but neither was leaving the nobles to fend for themselves.

The governess sighed and gazed around at the floating beds and helpless state of the General’s marines. Titans of muscle, armed with lasers and armour strong enough to shrug off rifle fire lay helpless and writhing in pain, fighting for their lives.

“Make it happen, General.” the Alien Governess swore. “Load the Noblewomen and bring them back here. The bastards who did this will *pay*.”

“Yes ma’am.” The general sent the order for the soldiers to return to base. The dropship was loaded, and its autopilot began its return flight along the same path it had taken to depart.

n340b5,6,2021-05-02,Does a PhD make it any easier to get a job at big tech companies?,ggPassion,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n340b5/does_a_phd_make_it_any_easier_to_get_a_job_at_big/,"Topic. I am curious to know if pursuing a PhD in Computer Science would make it any easier to get a job at a big tech company (FAANG or Big N) for someone with little to no experience. I just finished my master's and I passed up on a PhD opportunity I was not sure about. I understand that generally people who go for a PhD want to do research on a certain topic or pursue academia. Now during my job hunt I have seen quite a few (not necessarily a lot though) jobs at big tech companies like VMware and Nvidia that want people with PhD degrees. So it is making me second guess my decision about the PhD. However, I really want to go in a security focused role and my understanding is that experience should be even more viable in that case? I feel like I have a long road ahead of me trying to find my ""dream job"", so to speak, coming out of a Master's program with only a couple of internships and I don't know how to take it.

Is UOB a good uni for a decent paying SWE/SW developer grad job, and internships, or should I be looking into unis elsewhere like London? Looking at the salary sharing thread I see many graduating from top London unis"

Today's highlight will be featuring Arizona State University, located in the Phoenix metropolitan area with multiple campuses in locations like Tempe, West, Downtown Phoenix, etc.  Here are some amazing things about ASU:

* The university is in the top-10 for NASA-funded research expenditures, which is pretty neat.  ASU even built the LEED Gold certified Interdisciplinary Science and Technology Building IV for NASA in 2012.
* In fact, ASU spends nearly $660 million in research expenditures in 2020. ([Source](https://www.asu.edu/about/facts-and-figures))
* There's over 1,100 student organizations!  ([Source](https://dcranchhomes.com/15-interesting-facts-and-statistics-about-arizona-state-university-asu-tempe/))
* Home to 7 libraries, which host 275 research databases, 50,000 full-text online journals, and 25,000 books. ([Source](https://dcranchhomes.com/15-interesting-facts-and-statistics-about-arizona-state-university-asu-tempe/))
* Also home to 493 classrooms! ([Source](https://www.admitsee.com/blog/10-fun-facts-about-arizona-state))
* 34.9% of courses are fewer than 20 students, and 81.8% of courses are fewer than 50 students with a student-faculty ratio of 20:1. ([Source](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/arizona-state-university-tempe-1081/academics))
* 91% of ASU undergrads get to work on individual projects (whether this  project be a thesis, capstone, research project, internship, etc.) with an ASU faculty member. ([Source](https://dcranchhomes.com/15-interesting-facts-and-statistics-about-arizona-state-university-asu-tempe/))
* [92% of committed students received some form of financial aid in 2019.](https://www.asu.edu/about/facts-and-figures)
* [Although rankings should be taken with a grain of salt, its online school is ranked top 10 in the country, and 79 of their departments are ranked in the top 25 in the country.](https://www.asu.edu/about/facts-and-figures)
* Similar to schools such as Iowa State University, ASU allows students to apply rolling admissions, which gives you a lot of flexibility to when you'd like to apply.  The requirements are spelled out on their website, which you can see [here](https://admission.asu.edu/first-year/apply), and you can do it through ASU's own application, the Common Application, or the Coalition Application.
* Barrett, the Honors College at ASU, is one of the top honors college programs in the U.S. Some of the benefits you receive are the chance to live in a [four-year residential community (such as Latana Hall)](https://barretthonors.asu.edu/student-life/housing/residential-college-experience) and honors-exclusive internship, research, and travel opportunities.  You also get to participate in [a unique interdisciplinary curriculum](https://barretthonors.asu.edu/academics/advising-and-requirements/lower-upper-division-requirements), which is great for those who want to figure out their interests more or spend time with different fields, and you get a [dedicated advising system](https://barretthonors.asu.edu/academics/advising-and-requirements) to support you along the way.
* The graduate outcomes of alumni from Barrett is also really cool!  The most common places students went to medical school were Northwestern, Mayo Clinic, the Ohio State University, UMich Ann Arbor, UCLA, and Baylor, and the most common places students went to law school were Harvard, Columbia in NYC, NYU, UChicago, Penn, UVA, Northwestern, UC Berkeley, Cornell, and Georgetown.  If you'd like to see the full data, especially for the other graduate programs, the source is [here.](https://barretthonors.asu.edu/sites/default/files/graduate_outcomes_sp19.pdf)
* The graduate outcomes of alumni outside Barrett are also really amazing!  89% of undergraduates looking for work were hired or started their own business within six months, 48% of them participated in research/student teaching/internships/etc, 55% earned academic credit for doing so, and 57% were paid for their experience.  16% of the undergraduates were also accepted to graduate school. ([Source](https://career.asu.edu/Graduate-career-outcomes))
* Some of the top employers for ASU graduates were American Express, Intel, Mesa Public Schools, Starbucks, Arizona, Boeing, and the U.S. federal government. ([Source](https://career.asu.edu/Graduate-career-outcomes))
* For those interested in athletics, ASU is part of the NCAA Division I and has a pretty famous Sun Devils sport team, hosting over 26 varsity sports and winning over 24 NCAA national championships.

Hope this helped!

Good luck to all of the seniors on the subreddit with their commit decision this weekend and to all the juniors trying to develop a school list and finish out the school year.  I am rooting for all of you!

n381vs,12,2021-05-02,Need advice regarding this weird workplace.,speedx10,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n381vs/need_advice_regarding_this_weird_workplace/,"Hey fellow redditors!

I work in a startup as a Computer vision engineer (just title only lol).. I have to do frontend, backend, integrate software modules with robots, even go make dataset by myself from scratch, integrate custom circuits with the software myself, write unit tests and check if the machine (It's like a prototype for a production line with computer vision, robotics and other automated solutions) is working correctly. 

When I joined this startup back in August 2020, They literally gave me a shitty accountant's computer and was like good luck. No onboarding, no shit. They were like they want to do X. So I, from scratch had to build up the codebase that we currently have . Also note that there is nobody to help me label the images or to create datasets, I spend my time building datasets and implementing machine learning pipelines for this system. 50% of my time, I write new features for the code base I make, and the other 50% I test and make sure everything works (physically on the machine / hardware setup) without glitches. There were times when I had to literally go and solder connections between different microprocessors in different modules of this system. I had to setup the system infrastructure (Nvidia GPU Compute server + Network based control and integration different electronic subsystems) and Software Architecture from absolute scratch.

Now the CEO (an asshole) keeps pushing new features one after the other like a feature creep, he doesn't care what I do, he doesn't understand shit about code. Nobody at this startup codes. Recently, he has stopped caring about this project like there are no meetings, or so regrading this major project. He gives a big fuck to the smallest things like why is there dust on the robots? (LOL). So recently, This Boomer CEO is like can you teach me how to code so he can do my job(lol wtf?) . I genuinely thought he is interested in learning programing. Now he is blackmailing me if I don't teach him with PowerPoint slides he is gonna fire me. How the fuck did I end up at this shit show?. Also the CEO is a moonlighting idiot, he rarely cares about this startup and does his 2nd job all the time. Recently he hired some interns to setup his mining server lol.

Oh by the way I get paid 1500$ per month lol (yep in a shitty 3rd world country).

How can I save my career ? How do I make an exit? How bad is my future gonna look when it says I left a company after 9 months. This is also my first job after college. Please Dear senior CSE, guide me. 

Thanks."
n382j9,0,2021-05-02,Advice on Internship,inq_lv,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n382j9/advice_on_internship/,"Hey guys, 

I am in process of finding an internship for this autumn. I got contacted by a small consultancy company, and after talking with the CEO he offered me a chance to work on a new project developing a WEB application from the ground up, that will offer a new service to their clients.

My concern is that only me and another intern would be working on the project. The choice of the tech-stack, design, etc. will be left up to us. It feels like quite a lot of responsibility for an intern with not that much experience.

Another problem is that the CEO will be our supervisor. He isn't a strong programmer and we won't have access to more experienced developers to learn from, ask questions, or get some suggestions. I lack the confidence that we can make the best decisions and handle all the aspects of development by ourselves as interns. On the positive side, if we come up with a viable solution we will have a job there after the internship.

What do you guys think? Am I overthinking this and should just accept this internship position or try to find a place that has a bigger dev team that I could learn from? How important was it for you to communicate and learn from more experienced developers during your internship?

TL;DR - Got offered an internship position in a small company where I won't be able to work with or learn from other, more experienced developers. Should I still take it?"

**Intended Major(s)**: Political Science &amp; Philosophy

**A little info about my school so this makes sense**

I go to what I call philosophy school. Our entire education is based around the Socratic method. We do not offer APs. Taking philosophy is a 4 year graduation requirement. Think of it as a liberal arts college, but a high school! It’s pretty cool!

**Academics**

* Rank (or percentile): n/a but I know I’m in the top 3

 - Dual enrollment course on political violence

 - Model UN


**Standardized Testing**

* I’m from CA so there were no opportunities to take the SAT (I tried no less than 4 times). It was great for me because, on top of coming from a no-name school, I didn’t have a test
(but I wouldn’t trade my high school experience for anything, I’m incredibly grateful). I do, however, think that really hurt me some places.
* APs: 5 on APUSH, 4 on AP US Gov

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

1. Secretary General of an international Model UN conference (participants from 5 countries). 10 hr/week commitment. Started junior year. 
2. Political volunteer. I worked 8 hr/week for Bernie’s Presidential campaign for almost two years and also have done work for down ballot causes through the Friends of Bernie Sanders and I have worked in a local campaign. 
3. Summer policy intern for my city councilmember. 45 hr/week, 4 weeks in the Summer after my Sophomore year. I focused on a niche area of research and one of my suggestions was passed by the council. 
4. I created and operate a blog about my favorite hockey team that has been read and praised by members of the organization. I also run a popular fan Instagram. 5 hr/week. 30ish weeks per year. 
5. I work at a summer camp. From the summer after 5th-9th grade, I was a volunteer CIT and I became a paid counselor the summer after 11th grade. Canceled 2020 :( 45 hr/week, 4 weeks per year.
6. Gender-Sexuality Alliance. Co-founder/President of my school’s first GSA. 3 hr/week

8. Art. Mostly self-taught. 4 hr/week. 
9. Summer International Relations Program in London after my sophomore year. It comes up in my essay.

**Letters of Recommendation**

1. Counselor Rec: AMAZING! I got to read it and it was so sweet and personal. We are actually really close (I spend most of my frees with her just chatting.)
2. 11th grade bio teacher/MUN advisor. Also AMAZING. He isn’t the best writer in the world but he asked me to do mine and it really came across how highly he thought of me! We’re also close! 
3. I’ve had 4 classes with her. She’s just the best ever human and, although I didn’t read it, I know she wrote me a great letter.

**Interviews**

Georgetown: by far my best interview. It went about an hour and a half and we were just able to talk. 
Harvard: meh. My interviewer had his personal assistant schedule the interview. He showed up late and poorly dressed. He was nice and all but he was just trying to do it quickly and not actually get to know me. Kinda turned me off Harvard ngl.
Yale: really good! My interviewer was great and we had similar interests. He seemed impressed by me.

**Essays**

Common App: I wrote about my friendships with my two closest international friends and what we have taught each other. Very good. 

Additional Info: I explained by 3 hour daily commute to school, why I switched schools after sophomore year, rediscovering my love of learning at my new school, and how I was helping take care of my 90 y/o immunocompromised Grandma b/c covid.

* Georgetown University RD (I shouldn’t have even applied because I know they don’t like test optional lol)

All I wanted was to go to Columbia. I was quite sad when I was deferred ED.

It’s a crazy, stressful process but I think everything works out for a reason. I’m incredibly excited to join NYUs class of ‘25!!"

After doing a CS BSc (at a crap uni) and then a Data Science MS (at a medium-good level uni), and working my butt off during a research intern, I finally got enrolled into a Top 8 worldwide (in CS) uni for a paid PhD program in Machine Learning !

I am so happy, and I also get paid a fixed salary as a research assistant while simultaneously being a doctoral student.

My plan is to try and do an exchange semester with one of the 7 universities ranked above this one.

Hopefully this will also open doors to PhD interns with tech companies like FAANG !

EDIT: I was actually in EPFL for my BSc for 2 years, repeating the first year because I hadn't passed all courses (the competition is insane for first year here, 65% people fail).

I had to go join a much below average university later because they were all asking for my bad EPFL marks, rather than my school marks. I had to start from scratch (no transferable credits), adapt to a new culture (couldn't understand any accents), and was pretty much un-adjusted and kinda depressed (not medically) for 3 years.

I am really happy to climb back up and return prophetically where I belong ! I feel like Altair from Assassin's Creed 1 lol."

**Letters of Recommendation**

I had one from my APUSH teacher and Student Congress advisor. He is a very good writer and definitely likes me, so I think his recommendation was good, probably an 8/10. The other was from my science research teacher to emphasize my research. She definitely likes me, but I don't know how unique this was, so maybe 6 or 7/ 10. My counselor likes me, but I don't have a super-strong relationship with her. She still knows me more than she knows most of the other students at my school, so maybe a 6/10.

**Interviews**

Look, all my interviews went relatively well. I interviewed at 15 schools so I don't think it's worth it to go over each of them. The only school that offered interviews that I didn't get an interview from was Middlebury. Amherst, Williams, Brown, and UChicago did not offer interviews.

Here are my only interviews that I think were noteworthy in some way:

Bowdoin College: My interviewer was a little arrogant and made me want to go to the school less, but I think it went ok.

Yale: This one went really well. I had a great connection with the interviewer because we talked about her senior thesis for a while.

UPenn: This was my best interview by far. It lasted over an hour and the interviewer was very kind and supportive.

Everything else was relatively similar. They all went well, but nothing crazy.

**Essays**

I wrote my main essay on why I love Shakespeare. I highlighted my love of language, drive for learning, and determination. I think it's pretty good, but not really mindblowing in terms of a story.

I think my supplements were pretty strong, but I don't have a great sense of where I would fall when compared to the entire applicant pool. I tried to frame my essays in interesting ways. For example, for the ""why this college"" essays, I started by talking about this list of thing things I want to learn that I've had for the past 5 years and then I talk about how the college embodies it. My essays tended to focus on one of three things: my fascination with the way literature and politics intersect, my list of things I want to learn, and my community in the creative thinking program I mentioned previously.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* Brandeis, with humanities fellowship (RD)
* Hamilton (RD)
* Colgate, alumni memorial scholar (RD)
* Lafayette, Marquis Scholar (RD)
* Middlebury (RD)
* Wesleyan (RD)
* Vassar (RD)
* Amherst (RD). I was so excited about this one. I couldn't stop smiling!
* Cornell CAS (RD)
* Yale (RD). I literally went into a state of shock guys. I was freaking out.

*Waitlists:*

* University of Chicago (RD)

n3bian,10,2021-05-02,Gap semester for fall 2021,[deleted],berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/n3bian/gap_semester_for_fall_2021/,"My situation is kinda complicated, so I did really bad spring 2021(dropped almost all of my classes, end up only taking one) and want to withdraw this semester. However, I realized that I have made this decision too late and if I withdraw now I would be dropped from all of my currently enrolled classes now. Now the problem is, I'm a cs major, and all cs classes that I haven't taken yet are full, if I withdraw spring 2021 that means I would not take any cs classes fall 2021. So I'm left with two choices:

1.suck it up and move on(but I'm a rising junior and haven't land any internships yet, no personal project either, i know, I'm a loser)

2.withdraw summer and fall 2021 to grind on personal projects and apply for internship, read some books and think about life, then come back as a second-semester sophomore again. But I don't know if that would look bad to HR(like taking a gap year not doing anything actually productive like internships or study abroad)

If you have experience with gap year or you heard someone else did that, I would really really appreciate any insights!"

But they also said if not, it’s not a problem, and they said they have other departments dealing with laptop development and security that could potentially offer me a position as well instead.

&amp;#x200B;|My [2015 Ted talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gates_the_next_outbreak_we_re_not_ready?language=en) was more viewed after the pandemic than before which is too bad.

Hi Bill, What do you think is a reasonable percentage tax rate for the extremely-wealthy to pay? Either on their income, gains, or total wealth.|I have pushed for the Estate tax to be higher. I think it is an effective tool for revenue and avoiding dynastic wealth.
&amp;#x200B;|I have a piece on [Gates Notes](https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Year-in-Review-2019?WT.mc_id=20210319110000_HTAACD_BG-RE_&amp;WT.tsrc=BGRE) that talks about more progressive taxation.
&amp;#x200B;|You can tax income up to 50% but once you get much above that you have to worry that people waste a lot of time getting around the taxes. Each country has to consider what works for them. I only know the US system and it can be somewhat more progressive.
Hey Bill! Why are you buying so much farmland?|My investment group chose to do this. It is not connected to climate. The agriculture sector is important. With more productive seeds we can avoid deforestation and help Africa deal with the climate difficulty they already face. It is unclear how cheap biofuels can be but if they are cheap it can solve the aviation and truck emissions.
What niche technology do you believe could play a significant role in the future in the battle against climate change?|We need a lot of technologies - synthetic meat, energy storage, new ways of making building materials...
&amp;#x200B;|We want to be open to ideas that seem wild.
&amp;#x200B;|Fusion might come along but we can't count on it.
What one piece of advice you would give to a 19 year old?|You should learn about climate change. It doesn't need to be a full time thing - you should pick the job you care about and feel you can contribute to but also have goals that aren't just about your own success.
Hello Mr. Gates! Do you still code on your computer? If so, how often? If not, have you gotten rusty? Thanks!|My code no longer goes into shipping products so I am rusty. I do like to try the new tools to understand how they help. I just did a review of the low-code tools where there is a lot of great innovation.
Hi Bill, It's well established that you bring a large tote bag of books on trips and usually finish them all prior to returning home. How are you able to focus and absorb so much information, especially when (I assume) the main purpose of these trips isn't usually reading? Is there a specific note-taking strategy you use? What exactly do you write as you're taking notes? I've been trying to read more during the pandemic and sort of succeeding, but at times I find myself looking at words and not absorbing their content. This is partially due to ADHD, but I think learning to take notes will help. Thank you!|On vacation I get to read about 3 hours a day so I get through a lot of books. I only take notes on about 20% of the books I read. It takes me at least 2x as much time when I write notes but for a lot of books that is key to my learning.

When Oxford University was working on a COVID-19 vaccine it announced that it would be made ""open source"", meaning that any pharmaceutical manufacturer would be able to produce it legally without infringement on any drug patent, which would make the vaccine more widely available and less expensive, enabling widespread vaccination of the economically destitute populations in developing countries. But after their announcement that they would make the vaccine free to produce, they received immense pressure from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (wherein Oxford research staff were threatened with the reduction or elimination of all grants from the Foundation, not limited only to those for medical research) to patent the vaccine and partner with AstraZeneca to sell it. So, now, not only did AstraZeneca receive all the accolades for ""developing"" a vaccine (which the company did not do), it's also being produced in limited quantities and sold for $4 per dose to the federal government, which is about 20 times more expensive than the estimated cost if the formula had been open source and allowed to be mass produced by any manufacturer with the required equipment. In addition, because it is patented, it can only be produced by AstraZeneca, and poor countries have no or limited access to inexpensive vaccines. Why did you do that, Bill?|Our [foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/articles/coronavirus-vaccine-equitable-access) has given over $2B to help with this pandemic. I value anyone looking at what we have done and giving us suggestions. The problem with vaccine manufacturing quickly is not an IP problem. We sent funds to Serum and others early in the pandemic because of the lead time for factories including regulatory review to make sure the factory is high quality. This vaccine is inexpensive - around $3 to $2 once you get into high high volume but there are fixed costs to get going.
Hey Bill! How do you think Seawater Desalination will impact the issue of global water shortage in the coming years?|Yes. We have lots of water. The problem is that it is expensive to desalinate it and move it to where it is needed. This is all about the cost of energy. The cost is prohibitive for agricultural use of water. New seeds can reduce water use but some areas won't be able to farm as much.
How do you think the PR-problem of nuclear energy can be solved?|I hope so. Nuclear has had real cost problems as the systems have gotten more complex. A new generation that starts over and gets rid of the high pressure is needed. Explaining how the new safety systems work will be very important. The actual record of nuclear isn't bad compared to coal or natural gas but we can do better with the new design which can be inherently safe.
How does it feel to know that a creation of yours - windows - completely changed the world?|I am proud of Microsoft and the work we did on great software and helping the Digital revolution. It was fun to be part of it. I actually enjoy my current work on Global Health just as much but it is different.
I live in a mid sized city in Canada (Winnipeg). What are the most effective things I can get my local government to do that will have a positive impact on climate change while being cash positive or having a tiny green premium?|Electric buses are becoming economic. There has been an issue with cold and hot temperatures but that is being solved as the demand scales up.
&amp;#x200B;|Cities are often involved in electricity generation so they can help drive demand for clean generation.
How misinformation, disinformation, and fake news can do damage to society?|This is a huge issue. Some false information is more interesting than the truth so digital channels seem to magnify echo chambers with bad facts. I haven't seen as much creativity on how we solve this as we need.
Hey Bill, I will be doing my first internship this Summer as a Software Engineer for a well known bank. I am a little nervous and really want to perform well. As a successful figure in the tech industry, do you have advice or insight for a young intern going into the tech industry? Thanks in advance and thank you for all the good you have done in the world.|You can surprise people by learning a lot about the company and its competition and its systems. If you are helpful and friendly you will likely get good mentorship from the experienced employees. I think you can be open about your nervousness and a reasonable company will embrace your honesty.
Thanks for doing this AMA! What do you think are the most important things that regular citizens can do to decrease their carbon footprint?|Your political voice is the most important thing. Getting educated and convincing people of all political parties to care will make a huge difference.
&amp;#x200B;|Then you can consume less and when you do consume buy green products like electric cars or synthetic meat.
&amp;#x200B;|You will also be able to give to a fund to help with this.
&amp;#x200B;|Another area is to make sure your company is paying for offsets and doing its part.
&amp;#x200B;|If you want to help, [there are ways everyone can get involved](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Energy/What-you-can-do-to-fight-climate-change?WT.mc_id=20210319110000_HTAACD_BG-RE_&amp;WT.tsrc=BGRE).
^(the below is a reply to the above)|&amp;#x200B;
What are you personally doing to consume less?|I created [Breakthrough Energy](https://www.breakthroughenergy.org/?WT.mc_id=20210319110000_HTAACD_BG-RE_&amp;WT.tsrc=BGRE) including the Venture fund, Fellows and Catalyst to help with climate. To me the innovation is what will make it possible to provide services to everyone without emissions.
&amp;#x200B;|On the personal front, I am doing a lot more. I am driving electric cars. I have solar panels at my house. I eat synthetic meat (some of the time!). I buy green aviation fuel. I pay for direct air capture by Climeworks. I help finance electric heat pumps in low cost housing to replace natural gas.
&amp;#x200B;|I plan to fly a lot less now that the pandemic has shown we can get by with less trips.

What is your opinion on ""engineering"" a solution for the climate change problem? Economist Stephen Levitt has written on this topic [[1](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/geoengineering-is-no-free-lunch-comment/)], [[2](https://harvardpolitics.com/steven-levitts-solution-to-climate-change/)], [[3](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/freakonomics-authors-make-controversial-case-for-geoengineering)], and has even bet that geoengineering is pretty much the only solution that will get us towards the goal of cooling the Earth by about 2°C pre-industrial levels [[4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095809917303077)] in time, before catastrophic, irreversible changes. On a similar note, what is your opinion on large scale carbon sequestration projects and carbon offsets that corporations purchase? Stripe has a Climate division now that lets customers divert a fraction of their dollars to purchase carbon offsets [[5](https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/climate-launch)]. Do you think such efforts are important in preventing large scale climate change and what are your views on it? Also, did Vaclav get a chance to read this book? What did he think of it? Thank you again for doing this AMA!|Direct Air Capture will be important for things we can't solve directly. Today the cost is over $600 per ton. I think it can come down to $100 with companies like Carbon Engineering as they scale up over the next decade. We don't know if we can get it cheaper than that. Companies that are buying offsets are fantastic. We need to work on rating different offset on how impactful they are. I even am putting together something called [Catalyst](https://www.breakthroughenergy.org/scaling-innovation/scaling-innovation) which will direct offset money from companies to getting green products to be less expensive.
&amp;#x200B;|Geoengineering should be explored but only as a backup.
Hello Mr. Gates! How long did it take you to write your new book (including researching, interviewing, and the general writing process)? Thanks for taking the time to do this!|I had a lot of help from my staff including Josh Daniel and I was able to draw on all of my learning about climate from over a decade. I would say it was 2 months of full time work spread over a year including a big edit this last November.
What is your favorite comedy film?|Obscure film - Its a Mad Mad Mad Mad World...
Do you think lab grown meat will become widespread and replace livestock? Do you have experience with lab grown meat?|If the cost of making synthetic meat comes down it might be competitive even without considering climate or animal welfare. There are 2 approaches - one is growing the meat in the lab (cells), the other is using plant material to make the meat. Right now the plant approach used by Beyond and Impossible is cheaper.
&amp;#x200B;|I hope we can reduce emissions from cattle also since a lot of people depend on the value of their livestock. There is some research on this.
Do you see UBI as a sustainable way of economic?|Today we provide income to people who are disabled in many countries. The question is can we afford to do this for everyone. We are getting richer as we innovate but I question if we are rich enough to discourage able people from working. Over time we have been more generous and we will be more generous. The discussion on this is very interesting but it does come down to numbers...
What's the best scenario if we do nothing about climate change?|It gets worse over time and natural ecosystems go away. The migration away from the unlivable areas around the equator will be massive. We won't be able to support a large population if it gets a lot warmer.
Is it possible to stop global warming without decreasing of the population growth number?|Fortunately population growth stops when countries improve health and get to middle income levels. Population will peak around 10B if we are generous to the poorest countries particularly in Africa. Africa faces climate problems and population growth so having enough food and education and stability is a huge challenge. It was looking at African agriculture and how the climate is making it less productive that got me to study climate.
&amp;#x200B;|So we should help moderate population growth with aid for health, education and good governance. The best book on this is Hans Rosling's [Factfulness](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Factfulness?WT.mc_id=20210319110000_HTAACD_BG-RE_&amp;WT.tsrc=BGRE).
&amp;#x200B;|10B is a lot especially as they consume more so the imperative for innovation in seeds and green approaches with low premiums is urgent.
Why can't we read your book How to Avoid a Climate Disaster for free?|We are working on a way for college students to get free access digitally.
Best burger in Seattle?|I am eclectic. [Dicks](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/agqj4t/billions_served_bill_gates_photographed_standing/), Burgermaster, etc.. Seattle has a lot of good choices. I encourage people to offer synthetic beef as a choice.
Will climate change make future pandemics more common or more severe and how?|I wouldn't tie them directly. Pandemic risk is hard to compute but with humans invading nature more and more it has gone up. Travel causes fast spread which makes respiratory diseases very scary. We can prepare for the next pandemic with tens of billions in investments. I will be talking about this more this year to make sure we do the right things while people still remember how bad this pandemic was.
Hi Bill, How do you think misinformation plays a role in difficulting the battle against climate change? Do you think it has a meaningful impact or is it minimal?|The damage in the past was huge. Now the oil companies have stopped funding these things so I think climate denial will go down. There are issues about how we go about reducing emissions but I hope all young people agree that is a critical goal.
Hello Mr. Gates! What is something alarming about Climate Change that most people don’t know about? (something that was not included in your new book). Thanks for doing this; it made my day!|I didn't spend time going through all the bad things climate will do if we don't solve it. However the list is very long and some things could accelerate as we heat up. The damage to nature is going to be massive. David Attenborough has a [movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11989890/) that isn't really about climate but more about the beauty of nature and what we are losing that is very good.
Hey Bill, How does it make you feel when you see these conspiracy theorists talking about how you are plotting to take over with the Covid-19 vaccine? Also, GME?|Vaccines are important and it is too bad they are so controversial. I don't know why people think I want to track other people - it is unfortunate if this makes people not wear masks or consider getting the vaccine.
Hello Mr Gates, do you think crypto mining should be banned globally due to the energy costs involved? Edit : expanding on this, they contribute significantly on pure energy, let alone the carbon footprint of computer chips that are used to mine currencies. They seem to be easiest to remove carbon emissions because they hardly serve value apart from investment. Single transaction costs 700-800 kWh and that's just not acceptable.|I have a lot of issues with anonymous money transfer compared to attributed systems where you can dispute and reverse transactions and make sure taxes are paid. The electricity use is just one issue. We do need digital money but without that overhead.
Hi Mr. Gates, I am a 16 year old at Wilson HS in Long Beach, California. My passion is education and I know that many students can share this desire, but it is hidden beneath distractions and social norms for so many people around the world. My school has a majority low-income and 81% minority enrollment and we have been doing remote learning since a year from this date. During this time, I decided to start a non-profit online platform that focuses on increasing the motivation and confidence that students have for education, keeping in mind the fact that students learn differently even among similar areas, cultures, and backgrounds. My goal with the platform is to be a place where students create their own instructional videos, which solidifies their learning and gives them motivation associated with the satisfaction that comes with creating the end-product of a video. The result is that students learn from teaching, also known as the protege effect, and gain opportunities to practice their presentation and technical skills in a world that embraces video presentation skills. On the platform, students can also learn from each other by interacting with the videos of their peers from around the world. I know that it is an ambitious and not mainstream concept to have students teach and make videos, but after personal experience and research that backs it up, I have conviction that this can improve motivation and outcomes for all students. To help foster the growth of this concept, and to make it mainstream, I plan to raise funds to hold quarterly scholarship competitions to encourage more participation in this opportunity throughout the world. What advice can you give me about my mission to introduce this idea to the mainstream of education?|I think people connecting across country boundaries is important. We should understand the perspective of the young generation in China, Nigeria, India, etc.. If we can use digital tools to connect like this that would be great. I also think on-line learning can improve a lot so it is great you are working on that.
Hello Mr. Gates! I am curious about this: How do you cope with hate, theories and conspiracies about you? Thanks for doing this!|I get both positive and negative feedback for my work. Intelligent criticism is helpful. If people have ideas about how to solve climate that are different from mine or better solutions for global health I want to hear about. Just personal attacks don't move things forward as much but I don't let it stop me.
Hi Bill! How are you doing today?|Great! I like typing...
Are you familiar with Bjorn Lomborg's works, of so what do you think about his book False Alarm, and the idea that Climate Change, even though its a very serious problem we should solve, isn't the one we should prioritize?|Bjorn focuses on the need to innovate but he is far too narrow. He doesn't appreciate the need for demand for green products to scale up these markets. I enjoy talking to Bjorn - he has done a lot of good work but climate needs a lot more investment and policy work than he suggests.
Hi Bill, Firstly, thank you for doing this AMA! At what percentage would you say our chances of reaching (net-)0 emissions by ~2060 are at today?|It really depends on whether the younger generation worldwide adopts this as a moral cause they force us to pay attention to. If they do then I would say 75% chance of success. If there isn't that push then the investments may not get made. Innovation is hard to schedule but with lots of inventors some will succeed. We are seeing a lot of amazing companies which Breakthrough Ventures is funding. Now we need to create the demand and scaling of the successful products including in hard areas like steel and cement. Governments are engaged because they see the voters caring more and this year will have some key events like Glasgow."
n3fpl4,28,2021-05-02,23F scared to make a career change and can't help comparing myself to peers,bubble_wobble,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/n3fpl4/23f_scared_to_make_a_career_change_and_cant_help/,"Hi there,

I would really appreciate some advice as to how not comparing myself to others (especially peers), not dwelling on regrets and keeping a positive mindset for the future during a career change.

**tldr: Got a bachelor degree. Currently interning in the field of said degree. Can't see myself in that field at all even in other roles. Considering alternatives which require to go back to school for another bachelor degree because that's the only way to get the positions I'm interested in. Can't help comparing myself to friends who already found their path. Feeling scared, ashamed and insecure.**

I graduated last year from a bachelor degree in communication. Currently interning as a copywriter/community manager at a start-up focused on education. The problem is that I really can't picture myself in the communication field, not even in other related roles (video editor, digital marketer, business analyst, sales). I'm just not interested in those positions at all, don't care to learn more about how to become better at what I'm doing, I despise most social medias, I despise most influencers, I hate to advertize things, I hate to analyze my performance, I hate to work behind a computer. My boss is sweet, my colleagues are sweet, it's not a problem of environment but a true mismatch in terms of what I'm interested in doing.

I initially went for these studies because I used to dream of becoming a journalist as I liked to write and interview people. You need a master degree here to enter journalism so communication seemed to be the most logical path. Unfortunalely I fell out of love with journalism during my studies and I never plan to do it in the future. As I was already half-way through the degree, I decided to finish it. I managed to push through because some classes were really interesting even if they didn't teach employable skills.

I'm more and more interested in the education field. After some thinking, I'm almost sure I will love to work in that field but to be sure I'm doing an internship next year as an educator in a special ed school. The problem is that if I really want to work in this role in the future, I will need to go back to school for a 3 year-degree. That's just how it is here. They don't hire people who don't have the official paper except as interns. You also need to be selected from an entry exam. My other alternative is becoming an elementary school teacher but that's another 3-year degree because shortcuts simply don't exist and you can't access those positions without the right paper.

I'm really depressed about struggling to find my path. I feel stuck, lost and scared. I blame myself for not having made the right choices younger. I will be 27 by the time I finish another degree. This is still pretty young in theory but this means I will live in a perpetual state of emotional and financial insecurity until I find a stable job... in 4 years ! I don't know if I can handle that, but staying in communication seems so much worse.

I'm also terribly scared of failing my future studies, because what will I do if I'm in this situation? I don't have much job experience except internships and student jobs. I can't really fall back on my last career as I don't have a career.

Some friends already landed their dream jobs and live with their boyfriend/girlfriend in a rented appartment. I thought I would be there by my age, but I can't be further from that. I'm still living with my parents with a mom who is a bit overprotective, I've been single all my life because of a fear of intimacy, I have no independence at all, I'm struggling with some mental health issues that refrain me from moving forward. I feel I will never be happy until I reach my goal of landing a stable job that I like and which I find meaningful.

I'm trying to stay sane by telling myself it's okay to change careers and not find your path straightforward, that many people are asking themselves those questions, that I'm still young and have time to figure out something that I like, that we all have our own path and set of struggles. I'm also trying to run regularly to keep my energy levels high and trying to stay in touch with friends more to not fall in a state of loneliness. It's still so hard to not spiral down into negative thoughts though."

I know that there's some links between Québec and France, but I don't really understand how they work, who they are for, and if it would help me. If anything, I'm perfectly bilingual, so language isn't an issue for me.

I would like to move to France, but I'm kind of starting from scratch. I have a bachelor in art history and I will finish a second one in computer science, most likely in April 2022, and I had 2 internships as QA analyst/automated test developer, totaling 12 months of experience in internship, and I'm currently working as test dev (fresh out of internship, so my total work experience as QA is a year, and my contract lasts until the end of December). While I did see a [master in QA](https://www.cftl.fr/master-2-itvl-1er-master-diplomant-et-certifiant-en-qualite-et-test-logiciel/), I don't really know how the procedures work, if this master applies for me, and how I can find a place to reside/money income. I read about au pairs, but it seems like I'm too old for this route...

I would prefer the north of France, but I would also like to just move to France.

I wouldn't mind studying in another field of IT like web design or analytics, QA is truly my call, but if it would help me get in the country, I can work with that. If my current qualifications can land me a job, that would be even better, but I'm in the belief that a master would be an easier access for me to the country than a job, or am I wrong?"

a. What level LC do unicorns usually ask? I took some automated OAs this year (Tiktok) and that shit was LC extra hard. 

b. Is having a ""tier 2"" company on my resume good enough to clear the resume screening? I also have some prior research experiences and some side projects as well. I am also hoping to cop some referrals as well .

c. When is the best time to apply to these companies? For the 2021 summer cycle, I was a dumbass and started applying last December, which is prolly why I got 0 next-round invites for FAANG."
n3iziy,3,2021-05-02,5 months into new corporate job and I feel like I’m burning out. Should I resign?,duparnon,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/n3iziy/5_months_into_new_corporate_job_and_i_feel_like/,"Early in Jan this year, I took a full-time job offer as quality assurance at a company I interned at for 6 months last year (this is my first full-time job in corporate). At the end of the internship I commented that I felt the work culture and style was a bit overwhelming and hostile (no transparent way of communication between managers and subordinates, flip-flopping/lack of direction in department, severe micromanaging) and they said they’ll look into those comments. Later on I was offered the full-time job with the promise that those comments have been looked and taken into consideration. 

It’s been almost 5 months and I am miserable. The lack of direction is more apparent, the micromanaging stopped for not even a week before it went into full force (and more) and with my area now getting into a third wave of COVID I am becoming more and more anxious to the point of getting a panic attack every morning and demotivated to continue working. 

Unfortunately I have yet to find a job even though I’m aggressively applying. My parents keep telling me to suck it up and keep working because I haven’t completed a full year of employment and it’ll look terrible on my CV. But I am losing my mind and becoming desperate. 

Should I just continue? Should I resign? I am at a loss as I’ve asked some friends and coworkers and to they said to continue working until I find and secure another job, but I am getting more and more sick the more I stay. 

Hope y’all can help."

The other half so far has been at a help desk role because the company I interned at couldn't sustain itself during the beginning of COVID. Help Desk has been great and all, I got to learn more about Windows environments, but it's not where I want to BE. 

I'm used to scripting all my troubles away and using new and innovating technologies to solve problems, but that's just not what my job wants/requires. I still script (Powershell for the win!), but due to the human need of supporting oneself via monetary compensation, I can't spend ALL my time spinning up Linux boxes and configuring them with my ansible playbooks. However, I'd love to make a career of it. It's very much something I love and enjoy, and I do have experience from my internship and self-study/projects. Are there any tips to make a successful transition from help desk to DevOps?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: I've got experience with cloud infrastructure from an internship but couldn't continue it due to COVID, so I've been working Help Desk to make ends meet but I really want to get back to the DevOps side of things."

Being 'non-traditional', recruiting for internships has been awkward to say the least, but before I graduate I will at least have one solid Finance internship (through personal connections), along with hopefully a solid internship elsewhere as well.

I want to make my self very marketable after I complete my undergrad, and MSF seems like the proper route. How do I get in to a top program, and for those of you in such a program what is recruiting like? What positions are recruiters hiring for internships, are they the same internship positions available to undergrads?

I'm a freshman in the CoE and wasn't able to get any STEM summer internship/research opportunities. I'm still searching now but I don't think there's much I can do.

I have one small part time thing lined up that has to do more with working with kids/social skills, but I've done stuff like that already here at Cornell in clubs and in high school. I want to build STEM experience to get some internships!

I'm considering pursuing something related to ECE or Materials Science. I don't want to take summer classes, it feels like it's a huge amount of money and not worth it unless I want to graduate early. I'm considering self-studying a computer language (C++, Java, Python) and/or Autocad since I've noticed a lot of places like experience with those things. I'm not sure how productive that is to try to teach myself using programs like codecademy or udemy though. It's hard to keep yourself on track, and I'm not sure how legitimate it looks to say that you taught yourself vs. if you took a real course at a school on those subjects. I also think it'd be cool if I could think of something I'd want to create and use the code that I just learned to do it. 

Besides that, I was thinking it'd be nice to relax and pursue some passion projects that aren't related to my career path at all but I enjoy doing! 

Did anyone face a similar situation and what did you do to secure a research/internship position the next year/following semester? And are any of the things that I mentioned above worth doing?"

I am 23 years old. I’m from the Caribbean, have British citizenship and I’m about to finish a BSc. Nautical Science from a South American school and I want to go back to school to study a different major, specifically computer science.

I made a really dumb mistake at 18, I was in a bad place mentally and in my home situation, young and uninitiated. I threw myself at a scholarship opportunity to get away from home and too late realized I had made a mistake. Long story short, I hate the profession and have neither interest nor aptitude in it.

Furthermore, after having completed 4 years of study, I won’t actually get the degree. In addition to four years of academic study I’m required to do a year of sea time and write and defend a thesis.

This process takes upwards of 2 and a half years. While working on board I would be making $500 a month, not be able to study towards a different career. With the pandemic job availability has plummeted and there are tons of people who have already left that are sitting at home waiting on a contract.

The prospect of making below minimum wage, gaining no transferrable skills and racking up mental health problems on a floating box is not appealing.

I’ve decided to cut my losses, accept this failure for what it is and start fresh.

**I am now looking to pursue a career as a software developer. I want to work in the UK, get some experience save up and then go for a Masters preferably in the US so I could have the opportunity to work there.**

I have a few options to choose from and would like some help in deciding.

&amp;#x200B;

**Option 1: BSc. Computer Science at the University of the West Indies.**

Pros: It’s affordable, good standards of education (if you don’t compare it to North America), I would have the opportunity to live at home and work part time so my expenses would be very low.

I know if I get a good GPA I can get into a North American or European University for a Master’s.

Cons: I’m not sure if I would be able to get a job in the UK with the degree in the interim though. That would be my main concern.

&amp;#x200B;

**Option 2: BSc. Computer Science at a UK University**

Pros:

\-Great education, internship opportunities, connections within the UK and the degree would be respected everywhere.

Cons:

\-I’m broke. My parents are not rich. In the UK, despite being a citizen you have to have been living in the country for 3 consecutive years to qualify for home fees or student loans. I would have to move there and work for three years and then apply.

\-There is no guarantee I’ll get in (my grades are good but not great, solid B student) and there is no guarantee I will have been able to save up the money or qualify for enough student loans to cover my expenses.

\-Also that would be 3 years of potential lost opportunity. A lot of uncertainty here.

&amp;#x200B;

**Option 3: BSc. Computer Science full Scholarship abroad**

Through the local government and international scholarships I could study abroad in Asia. I have been considering Taiwan, but there are also full scholarships to China, Korea and Japan.

Pros:

\-Full scholarship tuition + stipend

\-Always wanted to visit Asia maybe even move there.

\-The quality of education I suspect would be better than UWI.

\-I love language learning and studying in a foreign language is not a problem for me, I’ve done it before and I could add an Asian language to my CV.

Cons:

\-A degree at UWI or in the UK would be 3 years. With a year of language study this option would take 5 years.

\-Also, there is no guarantee I could get in.

\-If I do get in I might get accepted to Tsinghua but I could also be accepted to middle-of-no-where-no-name-Tech. Coin toss.

\-I would run into the same problem as UWI: could I get a job in the UK with a foreign degree?

&amp;#x200B;

**Option 4: Programming Boot Camp in the UK**

Pros:

\-Quickest and cheapest option so I could start my career faster.

\-I can save up and get a degree after a few years.

Cons:

\-I am under no illusion about the difference between a 3-month crash course and a 4 years degree. I would be at a severe disadvantage in the job market.

\-I am also wary about the validity of such a course, I don’t want to waste time and money just to be unemployable.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, note that in choosing these options I am not discarding the importance of self-study, developing a portfolio, and doing open source projects. These are the options that I have found and seem feasible to me, but I am open to all suggestions!

n3w0j5,10,2021-05-03,Worried about getting drawn into a different career path,AmbitiousSnowman,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/n3w0j5/worried_about_getting_drawn_into_a_different/,"Hi all,

I spent a long time learning to be a software engineer, coding and watching online courses for React &amp; Angular, and then moving onto Spring Boot. I've also spent a lot of time studying design patterns and architecture patterns, and what it is to write clean code. However, my internship experience is moving me more towards a Devops style role.

So far, these internships have been a Linux role at a web hosting company, and I've got another internship coming up as a ""Software Development Engineer"", but have been placed on the Platform Engineering team - where they use lots of Devopsy type things such as Ansible, Terraform, Kafka, AWS.

I worry that this is not the career path I set out to be on, and due to the last 2 internships I have, I'll  only be looked at for Devops type roles.

What would you guys do in this situation? I suspect that I could probably learn to love Devops as I find hard problems interesting and I imagine any stream of CS jobs will have that. But I can't help but think that I'd enjoy being a Backend Engineer more. The company that I'll be interning at has options to move teams if you work there full time, and don't pay badly (£\~40k grad salary), but I'd hoped to start at Amazon or Facebook as a new grad next year and worry that without the relevant experience I won't be able to. I worry that if I continue down this route and try to switch careers after a few years of experience I'd be stuck in the golden handcuffs situation where I'd have to go back to being a junior engineer and be forced to take a lower salary.

Has anyone been in this situation before where your past experience is taking you down a road you're not sure about going down? How did it turn out if/when you switched streams? Any general thoughts/recommendations?

Thanks"

I plan to stay and work in the Netherlands (or nearby countries) after a Master's degree. I have applied for many unis and received admissions. Now I am most interested in two programs:

1. VU &amp; UvA: Computer Science - Big Data Engineering (I was told that it is easy to find a related internship in Amsterdam, and I can also change my track to software-related.)
2. Eindhoven: Data Science and AI. 

My questions are:

1. In terms of finding a job, is it more difficult if I choose the DS &amp; AI program TU/e?
2. Is it more stressful to study at TU/e? 
3. Which program do you recommend?

Personally, I prefer Eindhoven because there are many high-tech companies and my background is mostly about data science and AI. A local person recommended TU/e to me as well. But I am worried that studying in DS &amp; AI means that it might be much more difficult to find a job at a company. My doubt comes from a friend of mine working as a data analyst at ING, and she said data scientists often come from various backgrounds (she has a business degree herself) and since I have a BSc in Computer Science, it might be better if I choose the software side."

HR sent me the email, and to ask any questions. Would it be okay to ask for full time? I feel bad because in the interview I said I can do part time or full time, but preferred full time. I should have specified more. 

Also, I’m so nervous!!! I have other jobs I am waiting to hear back on, and I’m scared I’ll say yes to this and miss out on work from home opportunities. They want me to file paperwork asap but I’m like wait!!!! Hold on!!! Lol 

Edit:
I’m kind of wondering if maybe I’m taking an position that Doesnt allow harder skills development. Other jobs I’m waiting on are paid internships and such. However, the interviewer who would be my manager was SO nice and said there is lots of room for growth. Or, I don’t know. Maybe I should just do part time since I have so much going on? I just want to support myself as much as possible financially when out on my own.

I took all the advanced classes at my school which is a college prep school. I took honors world lit, honors algebra 2 &amp; geometry, APHUG they were all the advanced classes I could take in freshman year. 

I have also been learning python with a friend and I learned a little JavaScript, html, and CSS before but I haven't brushed up on them in a while. My AP exam is tomorrow and I am cramming like crazy. My finals are coming up soon and it got me thinking.

What do I want to do in the future? What college do I want to get into? So I looked up some requirements to get into good college and I kinda freaked out. I really half asses this year of high school. Online school is really boring and I have an extremely short attention span but I learn extremely quickly on my own. For example during my math classes I would never pay attention and on the day of the test or quiz I would learn the concepts he taught during class literally just spend like an 2 hours then I would have the test. I averaged around a B. For APHUG it was even worse I didn't open my book the whole year until prior to the finals and read nearly 1000 pages in one sitting. I scored on the second highest range of my class. However there were some classes I absolutely fucking despised and were so boring with shitty ass teachers I just  gave up on them. I got like C on those classes which brought my GPA down a lot. They were classes like Arabic or religion. 

So now I am at the point where summer break is approaching and I want to make use of it. I have a few goals in mind such as finish learning Python and relearn some of my old coding languages. I also want to be a much better student next year compared to last year and start practicing for my SAT and AP exams a lot better. I also want to try and get some job experience so it would look good on my resume. My parents have told me they know some people in the IT department who could hook me up with an internship. I really don't know what path I want to take in the future so I have just been learning a very wide range of skills such as programming, video editing, art, physics, and some more stuff. I am genuinely interested in a lot of those subjects and learn a lot of them in my free time. I am wondering how I should pave the path in my career. I don't want to limit myself to exactly one thing as I feel I am more than capable to learn more than one skill set. Any tips for preparing for college and doing well in high school as well as gain some job experience in high school."

I’ve been in college since I graduated high school and until this semester I was excepted to graduate this December. I’ve had an “eh” time in college so far. I’ve changed what I am studying numerous times (nursing, teaching, hospitality/tourism) but I settled on Family and Consumer Science because I thought it was a realistic career that I was familiar with. 

I’ve had a ROUGH past couple of semesters and I’m really not sure how smart it is to continue on with a 16 hour course load during the summer and Fall to graduate on time. A lot of life happened... I got engaged Dec 2019 and married March 2021, changed jobs due to losing mine to COVID (better paying but set m-S schedule which prevented me from returning to on campus classes), and really just a bad mental state that I’ve been trying so hard to get out of. 

I have been looking into other career paths and trying to figure out what skills that I have and can build on. I enjoy math and technical things, would like a career that could be used anywhere (I live in no where Alabama, so moving out of my current area is important to me), and is a job that doesn’t deal with the direct public like in jobs I’ve had in the past (serving, sales). I’ve recently started looking into coding. I saw where Google offers a certification program that I could do, so I am considering giving that a go but I’m not sure if it would be beneficial or another failed career attempt. 

I’m just not sure where to go from here. I need to decide if I am doing the internship class during the fall, which would be just sticking it out til the Spring when I graduate, or if I should pursue something else."

Here is the sixty-second installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

n440oh,15,2021-05-03,Degree feels worthless,iAccidental,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/n440oh/degree_feels_worthless/,"Hello, this might get a little lengthy and I'm not even sure this is the right flair for this as I feel it is a combination of a few.

I am a music production major (Bachelor's in Communication on paper so most media jobs are applicable) and I am having trouble finding any work. I just graduated a couple days ago and the past four years already feel like a huge waste of time, especially this past year due to COVID. When I was in school I had trouble finding internships.

The music industry is highly competitive and I personally felt my school didn't do a whole lot to help with job placement, only resume writing, etc. which I learned in high school. I loved my professors, I loved the course content, but I could've gotten the same information from watching YouTube tutorials.

I found out late into the game the music industry really relies on experience, which at my school you had to first compete for and then pay a good amount for (SXSW trip, working at Bonnaroo, etc.)

I asked my family (financial support system) if I could take a year or so off of school until COVID blew over so I could actually get the in class experience I was promised by the university (I could have put this on a resume). Instead I had to do my projects with royalty free music tracks to edit instead of recording actual bands and working with them proving I can work with clientele. My family said they wanted me to stay in school which is understandable but this situation really fucked me over. I don't blame them, I just wish I could have been more convincing. They're beginning to understand my struggle now with the job search.

Part of the struggle is COVID itself. There aren't many music industry jobs due to concerts and things not happening. I would take literally any media job if they didn't require so much experience. Even the entry level ones are terrible with asking for 3-5 years. The other issue is the jobs that are out there right now that are in my area where my degree is applicable (music, video, audio, social media management, podcasting, graphic design, etc.) all want you to have experience. While I do have personal experience on my resume, I don't have any work experience. Shitty to even see unpaid internships require bachelor's degrees.

Lots of applications have been sent, in the hundreds, zero companies have gotten back to me. I even got a ""guaranteed"" unpaid internship interview (desperate for experience) that I followed up on with no response after talking to the person doing the interviews.

I don't want a pity party thrown or anything, I just want a god damn job so this degree feels worth it. I know I'm not alone either. Getting severely depressed because of this. I live in a small shitty town with no opportunities for my field. Wanting to move but don't have the money for that. I'm in a band signed to a small DIY label with a tour planned for October (COVID depending). Putting my priorities into my creative outlets so I don't absolutely hate the music industry for the rest of my life."

I had to choose between accepting an offer at a company ( let's call it B) that gave me the role of an associate software engineer and looking for more jobs in the domain I really want ( embedded). The pay is shit and I'll barely survive at company B but the work life is said to be chill and not a lot of stress. Plus there's free food. 

When I asked my friends for advice, they either said "" the pandemic man, take what you can get"" or "" You deserve better and can do better"". I've been studying and applying for jobs non-stop over the past few months on top of an internship I'm doing. If there are any Indian engineering graduates trying to get into embedded, you guys would know the pain of going through job descriptions that fit every skill set you have but needs 2/3+ years of experience.

Been diagnosed with chronic stress and episodic depression due to the fear or being unemployed, aging parents and the pandemic. Indian here, shit really hit the fan here. I'm afraid that one wrong move in my career would mean I would never get my foot in the domain that I want and would mean I'm a disappointment to my family. 

Anyway, I thought things would get better after studying 4+ years by giving my all but man, the stress and the competition never ends. I feel like a coward but I took the easy out, I'm going to take the offer at company B and focus on my mental health. I saw my dad's face drop when I mentioned that I might take the offer instead of continuing the job search. 

I just want some time off man. It just feels like constant grind and stress every day. Am I making a mistake? I don't know. I might even be overthinking, but if you're Asian or come from a family that puts so much pressure on you to succeed, you probably know what I mean. Fuck."

My expectations for this internship were to maybe debug some code, write small scripts (I work for an automation team), and do small things to start. I wrote maybe half of a working script before I got assigned a major project. 

While I'm grateful for the experience this gives me, I still feel like maybe I was overworked? Overestimated? I'm to build a web app from front-to-back, that helps us automate some internal workflows. I was assigned this entirely to myself, the intern, and had freedom to choose the tech stack. I was given some repos and libraries to reference, as they were similar/needed to what I was tasked to build. Then, off I go to build an entire web app.

I was interviewed for Python automation, but now I'm building a fullstack web app from scratch. I'm spending most of my time writing React code, which I had 0 knowledge of going into this. I was hoping for more Python work, as I would like to go into Data Science in the future, and Python is heavily needed for that, but I'm stuck writing JavaScript.

To be fair, I have learned a ton. Enough to produce a pretty usable app, but there's a lot of fault and bugs that I'm sure are due to my lack of experience. I'm constantly rewriting my code, my manager doesn't look over my code too often, and I'm kinda just this free-roaming fullstack web developer with little guidance. My mentor isn't too available, and remote work make this whole internship a hell of a lot harder.

Is any of this normal? Is this just my imposter syndrome? The job ends in a month and I don't know if I should tough it out."

Others mentioned in Additional Information section

**Letters of Recommendation**

*purely speculation*

1. Honors Bio Teacher: 9/10; Very good relationship with her; when I asked her to write one for me, she said “of course” and that I was the best student in the class; I had spoken to her before abt college stuff and had offered information and advice since her daughter was also applying to study art the same year.

2. Introduction to Photography and Digital Arts Major Teacher: 9.5/10; Had him as a teacher twice, photography club advisor, and did my internship with him (upon his request). Said he only survived the class (that I was interning with) bc I was there to help.

3. Guidance Counselor: 8.5/10; haven’t had the most amount of communication with her throughout the years, but she was quite involved with helping organize my internship (normally only seniors can do internships through my school). Good relationship with her, and my school sends out a sheet for all students and parents to fill out for information for the letter, since they obviously can’t know everyone super well.

**Interviews**

Tufts: 7.5/10; Optional, but recommended since they monitor continued interest. Went quite well, very conversational and easygoing. I wasn’t the best prepared to ask a couple questions, and she didn’t have the knowledge to answer some of my questions (went to Tufts for grad school not undergrad).

**Essays**

I think my essay was very good. My mother is a published writer, who helped me clean up my word choice. She loved it, my friends who read it loved it, and my guidance counselor started tearing up after reading it. My essay was about the intersection between my identity as an international adoptee (who was adopted as an infant) and as a photographer. It described by internal conflicts with memory and culture that stem from being an adoptee, and how photography allows me to come to terms with and regain control over them.

Quality of supplements varied

**Portfolios** (Added Section GASP!!)

Portfolio for Drexel was the weakest bc it was the first (EA).

Loyola University Maryland, RIT, and Syracuse did not require portfolios.

Based on portfolio reviews from NPD:
• FIT liked but didn’t love my initial portfolio (didn’t get the updated one reviewed). Required writing was pretty good, but nothing special.

• Rutgers liked the initial one but loved the updated one (flagged me for potential scholarship). Required writing wasn’t super strong.

• Tufts loved it every time, and I had it reviewed three separate times (months between each)

• Ryerson liked it, but the reviewer wasn’t from the photo department, so she wouldn’t be reviewing my application anyway

Did not get it reviewed by NYU, but similar strength to Rutgers and Tufts. Additional required writing was the strongest but also caused me to have a breakdown during it.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

EA: 

• Drexel University: 22.5k Deans Scholarship and 5k Westphal scholarship (didn’t apply to any special programs)

• Loyola University Maryland: 30k scholarship (max)

RD: 

• Rochester Institute of Technology: 19k scholarship and invited to Honors College

• Rutgers University NB (in-state): 13k scholarship and invited to Honors College

• Ryerson University (Toronto, Canada)

• Fashion Institute of Technology 

• Syracuse University: 28k scholarship (max) and asked to apply to Honors program

• New York University (Tisch)

• Tufts University and SMFA at Tufts 5-year dual-degree program BFA+BS/BA (Committed!!)

**Additional Information:**

Self diagnosed myself with rare medical condition, which was later verified and officially diagnosed by a hematologist. This causes me to have a 504 plan, which excuses me from Phys Ed (a normally required course all 4 years).

Attended a pre-college class at FIT over the summer. Finalist for Drexel University’s HS photography contest in 2018 (and later 2020 but was too lazy to update), 1 Scholastic Silver Medal, 2 Gold Keys, 1 Silver Key, and 1 Honorable Mention (would later get a 3rd Gold Key, again too lazy to update).

I just finished my junior year in CS and I'm expected to graduate in Spring 2022. The past few months I've been looking to apply for internships, and I haven't had a lot of luck with the dozens of places I've applied to. I'm really just looking for any kind of software development internship, but a lot of them are looking for some kind of experience with certain frameworks and technologies that I just haven't been exposed to in my curriculum. 

I'm looking for some way to bolster my resume this summer if I'm not lucky enough to nail down an internship. From a little bit of looking around, Coursera seems to be the best way for me to gain a little bit of extra experience over the summer. 

This may be a bit of a foolish question since I don't have anything specific in mind, but are there any sorts of courses/specializations that you would recommend to someone that could help me cast the widest net when applying for jobs in the future? 

Thanks in advanced."

The second month, I switched mentors to a senior dev to work on a brand new software tool.

The  dev basically told me what to do in a sentence (no explanation, no  background, just the product they needed), then completely peaced out  for the next two weeks.

In which I  found one of the steps in the program I was creating that he wanted me  to do was basically impossible with the framework they needed me to use.

I kept asking him about it, and he just ignored me.

After  the two weeks he finally responded and helped me with a little piece of  the problem. (It was due to a longstanding bug in the framework) With  that in place I was done (could have finished much earlier if he had  responded two weeks in advance)

I  just had a performance review where he told me that he felt ""I was  struggling"" because I ""depended on him too much for help instead of  doing independent research"". I'm completely crushed. I DID do  independent research before coming to him.

I  consider myself to be an independent learner and don't ask many  questions already but I thought it was an intern's job to inquire about  unfamiliar technology.

Instead I  was completely reprimanded for doing just that. I don't know how to come  back from this, I've noticed a couple of similar attitudes on this team  as well.. What should I do?"

I’ll be graduating later this month with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering.

I’m having trouble choosing one that will benefit my career long term as well as job security for now.

Company A is a summer internship. PCB analysis, motor control theory, digital signal processing and control.  Pretty well known international company. However, no guarantee that I’ll be getting a job offer at the end (they said only if spots are available). 

Company B is in production and entails mechanical assembly, calibration, testing, troubleshooting. It is also an international company. They stated that there is potential to grow within the company to an engineering position. 

Both seem good to me (leaning more towards company B), but I wanted to seek advice from engineers with experience. Thank you in advance!"

I was at salon T from September till last April untill I got an opportunity at salon K, which is a franchise of the chain I was aiming to work for in the future, so to start there as an intern is an amazing way to get my foot in the door. I've been working at salon K from April till now and I've been loving it. 

Untill Saturday when the owner took me aside to tell me she won't be continuing with me.

She said it wasn't because of my work, that I'm a great student aside from my lack of confidence, I'm good at what I do and hardworking, but that my mental health issues make me too much of a liability, especially since she has a history of workers having to quit or go on sick leave due to medical issues (I know the last was a girl with a muscle disease) and with covid hitting the business hard, she can't risk it.

I have diagnosed Adhd, autism and chronic depression btw. I also had a burnout at 18 (now 23) and I get that that isn't the easiest combo to deal with. I stress out easily, give myself a hard time needing to be ""perfect"" and am also not the best at reading the room, but I've worked my ass off the past 5 years to where I'm now back in school, living on my own and holding the Fort down with minimal breakdowns, when 1year ago I was afraid to even touch the laundry machine.
To hear this was heartbreaking to say the least. 

Now I know discrimination on medical grounds is illegal in my country, and I could have a case in court if I really wanted to...

But with the thought in mind that I still want to work in the greater franchise, at a different salon, that she made this choice as a struggling business owner and that my boyfriend works at salon O of said franchise in mind too... Should I just take the L and ""be a bigger person"", leaving the salon but showing her in another that she was wrong about me and its her loss, or should justice always prevail?"

n4dj9y,18,2021-05-03,Filipino Female Applying to US Film Schools/ CHANCE ME,PomegranateCharming5,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/n4dj9y/filipino_female_applying_to_us_film_schools/,"Hey! I’m currently a Junior High-school student from the Philippines, and I am very interested in going to film school for university. I am looking to apply to schools abroad — mostly in the United States. This’ll probably be really messy and all over the place, but here we go!

A few little things before I go over my stats and all that... 

My dream schools are currently Chapman (film production or creative producing lol I haven’t decided yet), Loyola Marymount University, Emerson, Syracuse University, UCLA, and New York University. 

I’ve got other schools in mind, such as Florida State and UT Austin. I haven’t read up on those schools that much tho. 

The reason I’m so so so interested in Chapman and LMU is because I’ve become so familiar with California already. Back when COVID wasn’t a thing, I visited my family in Orange County + Los Angeles every year, and I fell in love with the area! I also love both of their film programs.. especially Dodge since I know a few people who go there already. I’m just having trouble with deciding whether or not to enter Creative Producing or Film Production, since both programs are so interesting. It’s either I choose the business side of film — which would probably give me some more stability after I graduate (idk lol but probably) — or film production — I really think that I could make truly meaningful stories in the future (coming from my background and experiences) but I don’t know if I’d be okay with not having a secure path... sometimes I feel like I’d be fine as long as I do what I really WANT to do but idk. Also, I hear that it’s a lot easier to get into Creative Producing... though it’s still HIGHLY selective as compared to other programs and colleges. LMU also really interested me because it’s around the area. I also follow a few people who go to that college and they seem to be doing a lot of jobs and gaining a lot of experience from the program.

Okay enough about that. Here are my stats, ec’s, etc. 

GPA (4.3 scale): in freshman year it was about a 3.8 but now it’s a 4.1-4.2 (Junior Year, first quarter of the second semester)

APs: I literally only am taking two.. haven’t taken the tests yet! (AP English and AP World History).. our school only provides two AP classes each year and only during junior and senior year. I’m planning to take Art History and AP English Language next year, but I hear it doesn’t really matter if you’re applying to film school. Not sure tho! I’ll still take them just incase. 

My school/background: I go to a pretty small Catholic International school in the Philippines. I’m full Filipino (lol obviously) and if I never transferred to the US I’d be first gen ??? (idk how that system works) I’m fluent in English and Filipino, but my parent taught me more English growing up! Most kids from our school apply abroad and get in, but we’ve only had 3 graduating batches as of now. It’s a really small school!! I’ve lived in the Philippines my whole life. I’m not a citizen in the US, so I don’t know if I’d be able to apply for financial aid in some schools. I know Chapman has a need-based scholarship for international students but idk if that would be a ton of help to go! I need to apply to more schools that would be a better financial option. I know Chapman’s really pricey and I love it, but I don’t know if I’d be able to support myself financially. My counsellor told me that there are part-time jobs the schools in the US offer to help pay.. would that be any help? Does anyone have any suggestions?

ECs and volunteer work:

- 16 minute documentary about the mental health stigma in the Philippines (I wrote, edited, and directed Freshman year for our passion project).. I had collaborations and a team that helped me make this.
- Multiple video projects throughout highschool for different classes.. including a stop-motion commercial for soap lol
- Film Club (3 years)
- I wrote many articles for the school newspaper, interviewed students + teachers for that too (1 year)
- I participated in the school news.. this was mostly showcased in the school admin. I made and edited videos, learns how to use green-screen, wrote many scripts, and even appeared in some news sections! (1 year)
- I’m a project manager for a STEM company for their video production team. I’m the youngest person there and I work with a bunch of college students + adults! Most of them actually already go to film schools or are pursuing jobs in the industry. One is even working on a movie! I’m the only project manager as of right now with two directors above me and a few interns below me. I assign tasks, facilitate meetings, mostly edit a TON of videos and make scripts for them, I also need to have a bunch of Zoom interviews to record and edit, and I need to contact a bunch of people for footage (of schools or whatever we’re making a video on)... it’s an American company so meeting run early for me and most (if not all) of my co-workers are from there too. 
- I did a 3 week summer program in New York Film Academy. I met a bunch of people there and worked on a bunch of films.. two of which I directed, edited, and wrote myself. I made a bunch of connections from there and my teachers were really cool! I even attended a talk with Matt Kaplan (the producer of a bunch of teen Netflix movies like To All the Boys I’ve Love Before)
- I’ve got three more film internships this summer (one of them is the biggest production company in the Philippines)... mostly going to be marketing and pitching films tho (COVID and I’m a minor so there are limitations... I don’t think minors in the Philippines can work a bunch since it’s a lot stricter here) 
- I made a bunch of films throughout highschool! I won one film festival as of now and have been selected by over 5! I don’t usually submit my films to festivals but I’ve submitted like three lol... I’m def submitting more this summer. I’m currently working on a stop-motion film (also side note: I literally just submit my films to the free festivals but I’ll look for some that don’t cost a ton to apply lmao) 
- I was accepted to the USC, UCLA, and Columbia film programs last year but didn’t attend due to COVID. Not sure if I can put that in my actual resumé
- I started my own film studio company! We’re hosting a student film festival this summer but this is still in the works. We’re using all the money to fund for a kid’s school tuition! (most schools in the Philippines require you to pay because the government’s whack at creating a good program for public school) We also sell clothes and send 10% of profits to an organisation we’re partners with. 
- I directed our class for our “Sabayang Pagbigkas” during Freshman year. we got third place out of the eight batches. Basically it’s spoken word poetry that we had to choreograph and perform. We had a bunch of light effects and sound stuff too. 
- I’m part of the Basketball varsity but idk if that does much since I’m applying to film. I’m Division 1 center and we won championships last year.
- I’m a student ambassador at school. I basically do a bunch of open houses and present speeches to newcomers. We facilitate a lot of school events for prospective students!
- I do weekly meetings and mentor 6th grade girls to become better leaders in their community. I usually show them a bunch of films with morals in them and I organise a session every week! We do a lot of games and discuss a lot of lessons (social media, recent history, don’t change who you are, etc.)
- I was a camp counsellor for over 100 kids (4th grade to highschool)! This was located in Texas since I spent my summer there with friends. It was only a week long camp. Made a bunch of friends with other counsellors and I was able to lead a group of 7th grade girls. Still talk to them today! 
- A lot of volunteer work in the US (since I spent my summers there) over 100+ hours.. this included spending two weeks in an immigration facility (talked with newcomers in Spanish which I am not all that fluent with, organised and gave belongings, prepared food, etc.) and doing work at children’s hospital. 
- A lot of volunteer work in the Philippines! also over 100+ hours. There’s a lot more to name but I spent my days in a special needs children facility and every year and participate in town events.
...idk if I’m missing anything but that’s all I can think of for now

AWARDS

- top english grade in our batch
- top art grade in our batch
- top music grade in our batch
- leadership award
- honor roll (every quarter in freshman and sophomore year) and principal’s honor (every quarter right now during junior year) 

That’s all I have for now! Sorry it’s really really messy."
n4e5z3,1,2021-05-03,I’m not sure if I should leave my full time job for a 6 month internship! I’m getting super overwhelmed by this scenario 😭,Nicholaslau95,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n4e5z3/im_not_sure_if_i_should_leave_my_full_time_job/,"I currently work for a very large global company that offers good benefits and a 50k annual salary, but I just got offered an internship with the Disney College Program which lasts about 6 months. I graduated a year ago in May 2020 and getting to for a famous entertainment/tech company seems like a dream come true. This internship pays me 1/3rd less than what I’m being paid right now. Here are some thoughts I had about this scenario: 

If I leave my current company and go for Disney, I’m going for something... 

1. I have a chance for something that seems like a lifetime! It’s like you rather go for something and say you did it rather than regretting later that you should have done it 😭 
2. My dream company is Disney 
3. It might open opportunities for me because I work for Disney at a certain period 
4. And I’m looking for a job now anyway trying to get out of my current job! 
5. It’s 6 months and the job isn’t secure 

If I decline the offer from Disney,

1. I don’t like my job that I’m currently at and I’ll keep thinking about declining that offer I had from my dream company that I had a chance to! 
2. I have a full time job now vs 6 months at Disney.
3. My associates I work with now are amazing which I can make new friends at Disney so I’m not too worried about that. 
4. The pay is way more here than in Disney 
5. Can work and still make money while looking for a new job rather than a deadline if I were at Disney 

I am so excited about this opportunity but the thought of leaving my current full time job for “just a 6 month internship”, which makes me so overwhelmed! 

I started this job last December 2020, and my internship begins in August 2021! I had an internship with Disney back in August 2020 but it got canceled due to COVID - 19.  I’m afraid I’m risking for something that isn’t secure when I have something already secured. And I know my parents wouldn’t be too happy with that as well. I want to ask for time off but 6 months seems like a lot of time. 

I’m 23 and I live with my parents. I’m saving a lot of money now but my current job requires a lot of relocation in the future for higher positions. The situation at home is getting unbearable which is why I’m always out all the time until I have to come home.

So it really feels like I’d be wasting this opportunity if I I don’t take it. And this internship is a big change for me where I feel like I can’t say no. But I feel like if I leave my full time position for something that’s temporary - I would feel very uptight about it. 

I’m afraid I may be making a huge mistake for my future and feel so indecisive as to the pathway I should take. If someone has some good advice, I would love to hear it and would greatly appreciate your input!"

I helped organize the University’s cybersecurity CTF competition that took place remotely in late 2020 and have been apart of the competition’s team (Dec 2019 - Pres) that participated in CCDC and other CTF competitions. My University also has a Cybersecurity Operations Center that I have worked in as a Security Analyst since May of 2020 and have been asked to continue working there until I graduate in December. That is my only cybersecurity internship, my other working experience are camp counselor and building decks with my father, while I was taking summer courses. For career goals, I don’t have any place in particular that I would like to live so location isn’t a problem (currently on the East Coast) and hope to find myself working at one of the three letter agencies (DHS, FBI, etc.) in the future. I guess I am extremely stressed because of the internship opportunities I tried applying to for the summer. I applied to 20+ internships on the East Coast. I was already asked if I would work for the University over the summer, even though it wasn’t required to retain the position in the fall. I wanted to try something different, but that didn’t work out and I will be working there this summer. There were a bunch that didn’t respond to my application and others that rejected me. I had gotten interviews for couple positions and tested for one. The company I tested for, which I thought I had done well once I saw my score, never responded after the test was completed. Two rejected me after the interviews, I thought I did well. The last I would have gotten the position if I had told them both my uncle and cousin worked for them, but I wanted and thought I could get it on my own to which I have learned my lesson. No one in my family is in the field of computer science or cybersecurity so my contacts are previous classmates, coworkers, and friends. However, they haven’t been out of college for very long and don't know if they could help me find a job. 

So, my questions:  
1. Was this summer an anomaly for internships because of the pandemic or is it hard to find and get security internships in general?

2. When should I start applying for positions (end of the summer, beginning of my last semester, or earlier)? I plan on going to the career fair at my college but in the past I haven’t seen any looking for cybersecurity candidates. 

3. I like what I am doing now as a Security Analyst for my University’s Cybersecurity Operations Center, so what job titles should I be looking for and what positions should I be looking for in general?

4. I always hear that there are tons of jobs in cybersecurity and that I shouldn’t have a problem finding one, is this true or a folk tale presenters tell?

5. I am just suffering from imposter syndrome or should I be worried about my qualifications?"

I took my first CS class in my senior year and have now completed the data structures class in addition to another applied coding class.

I think CS is pretty fun and I'm rather certain that I'd like to be a SWE. I've started leetcoding and have now about \~25 easy question and think they are a tad fun albeit struggle through it.

What should I do to be a SWE? Do I go for a masters in CS? Should I try to delay my graduation by a trimester (i.e. grad by end of 2021), do a minor in CS? Will companies even bother with someone with no CS internships and little CS classes under the belt?"

so during high school I had a 4.0 GPA (European equivalent) and few extracurricular activities, which I felt in a way bottlenecked me so that I didn‘t get into the top top schools I would have loved to go to. Then as soon as I began engineering in college last year, I started a lot of stuff. I founded a uni club, took on two charity projects, joined the rowing team etc. 

However now after the first round of exam results, I‘m just over a 3.3 GPA and am beginning to realize that I‘m probably never going to go to MIT or Stanford, not even for my graduate studies. 
So my question is, will extracurricular achievements benefit me significantly in finding a job or an internship later on or could I just as well turn it down a little if I don‘t have a shot at the very top of unis anyways?"

I’m beginning an internship next week in video postproduction (only got the answer yesterday) and I need to get a new laptop as I will not be provided with a desktop computer. It has to be a laptop since I have to be able to use it at home but also at the office, at school and on long train rides. I already have a quite big laptop monitor at home and will also be provided one at work. 
 
I will predominantly be using Premiere Pro and After Effects and to a lesser extent Photoshop, Lightroom, and other Adobe softwares. Realistically I could currently spend 1300€ but I’m open to laptops up to 1600€ since it’s an important purchase. I’ve been looking at several laptops and reading about specs and other reddit topics but since the purchase is quite urgent I would really like to know what laptops you’d recommend. Thank you very much 
 
Here is also the laptop questionnaire: 
 
LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE 
 
Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US: 

     1300€ (preferably) but up to 1600€ if it’s worth it. I will purchase it in France. 

 
Are you open to refurbs/used? 

Yes 

 
How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life? 

Performance is the most important element, a good battery life would also be a plus 

 
How important is weight and thinness to you? 

Not important 

 
Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A. 

N/A since I have monitors but preferably 13“-15“  

 
Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. 

 

The most important softwares that I’d like to run smoothly on the laptop are Premiere Pro and After Effects 

I also use Photoshop, Lightroom and Illustrator. 

No gaming. 

 
If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want? 

N/A 

 
Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)? 

A reliable build quality and a touchpad would be great 

 
Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion."

My name is Rishiraj Chakravarty, some of you may remember me from my earlier posts here. I asked for some help and many of you responded and some even helped me out financially. I will be forever grateful for that.

I just wanted to let you all know that I have finally cleared my class 10 exams. This is absolutely a ""Pappu pass ho gaya"" situation for me. If you're wondering why it took so long for me to pass, well I dropped out of school when my mental and physical health started deteriorating and my family could no longer afford to send me to a regular school. I joined NIOS in 2014 and ever since then my physical and mental health issues got the better of me and I couldn't think straight... Forget studying, I had no will to live. After four psychiatrists failed to help me in any way, I decided to fight my demons myself and I conquered them.

Right now, I just want some advice. My financial situation is still disastrous and with the pandemic raging on, I fear what is going to happen to us. On my previous post a person offered me a content writing internship, I was very grateful for it but unfortunately at the time I was going through far too many problems and uncertainties that I couldn't deliver what was asked of me. The internship was for a month with a possibility of extending it, but I quit after a month since an acquaintance was pursuing me for a call centre job, I also had to take care of many problems and go out of town with my mother as she was trying to get a job. The call center job didn't last long and my mother didn't get the job either. I still feel guilty that I couldn't deliver as per expectation during the internship and I left so abruptly.

So what do I do now? What can a 10 pass guy do to survive? What kind of job should I pursue? I am already registered at a consultancy service, and I have appeared for two interviews but I didn't get hired. When looking for jobs online I have found most of the ads are actually from consultantcies. I still haven't used any of the crowdfunding money, it is still my backup plan to buy a scooter and be a Swiggy delivery boy.

There's more than enough scam call centres here in Guwahati, they will hire me without a second thought but I cannot bring myself to scam other people no matter how bad my situation may be. I worked for one scam centre briefly and I absolutely hated it.

Also, before I am called a fraud again I want to make it absolutely clear I am not asking for money. I just want some advice."
n4pdz8,4,2021-05-04,Everything sucks,plsdonottalktome,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/n4pdz8/everything_sucks/,"If i start from the beginning, I live in a country and city where parents are hyper-attached to their children. I mean live with them till you get married (girl) and even after that if you're a boy. Plus, they will be hyper-involved and nosey through all of it.
So being from a family with 2 daughters only is all that into 10 atleast. Every decision is a family matter, every meal is a full family thing, bla bla.
I(22F) am overall a little reserved person. I've had my doses of depression and anxiety but my family doesn't know about it. It would just make them even more intrusive.
I'm not my parents' favorite or even slightly liked child and it shows.
So, my younger sister (20F) had to go to a different city for her course internship for 3 months. Family being hyper-attached, got all sentimental over it and would be calling her 2-3 times a day. Makes sense, she left home for the first time. When covid started getting worse here, it increased to 5-6 times a day, each day, and ending the call with ""now come back home, we'll do something about the requirements.""
Meanwhile, we've been getting out kitchen constructed for quite some time now so i tried to keep the parents busy throughout the day so they didn't feel too empty. They focused 2 kids worth of helicoptering on one. Awesome. In any case, I was doing all the house chores, taking care of groceries, talking to dad to keep him occupied and overall just not being myself i.e. chatty. I had my studies and exams as well so i tried as best as i could, to not let them feel like something is missing.
I've never been very close to my parents because i felt unwanted around them. And that has returned with a new force since my sister came back. Her internship ended early due to covid so we planned to surprise the fam on my dad's bday with her coming back.
Since then, it is like my family is truly disgusted by me being around them. They keep hugging, talking and calling my sister to be around them and complaining, insulting or sending me away for something or the other. I enter the room and my mom or dad would leave, or tell me to get something from outside, or become quiet. If I am somewhat close then they tell me it's covid and we should keep distance, and then go on to hug my sister and chat around with her.
I feel like an outsider in my own family and it just sucks. If my own family is somehow so repulsed(?) by me then what can I expect from others. It's been such a shitty and lonely time this month. It is like I am nothing but a replacement or filler for people. This daughter is nice until the other one gets back. She's my best friend until the other one is free to talk again. I've tried everything I possibly could so that maybe my parents might get to know me and then maybe they won't be so...against me or whatever. It's just exhausting and suffocating to be in this home and knowing that with covid again and everyone staying at home 24*7, I don't know. I'm just very fucking tired.

Thanks if you read through the rant. It's fine if you didn't. It doesn't matter."

n4pwl2,1,2021-05-04,Should I give a two week's notice,goggamanxp,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n4pwl2/should_i_give_a_two_weeks_notice/,"So a bit of background:

* I started out at this company as an intern last summer. After the summer, I was offered the opportunity to co-op part-time while finishing up my last year of school. I graduate in just a couple of weeks now.
* In February, I asked my boss about a potential full-time position after I graduate. After some back and forth, he basically said that quarterly results would depend on whether or not a position would be available. However, I would be given the option to extend my co-op until August to see if any more positions open up then.
* In April, I bring up the question again. He says that at the moment he can't tell me anything. 
* Yesterday I asked him if my next steps at this company were to continue the co-op or if any positions have opened since I graduate soon. I have not gotten a response as of the writing of this post.

While I understand that the bottom line ultimately affects the availability of positions, this company has also been hiring for similar positions while I've been co-op'ing for them, so I find the 'quarterly results' reasoning to be a bit questionable.

That being said, I can tell that my boss has definitely made an attempt to get me a full-time position since he has generally been impressed with my work. I have a feeling that he couldn't tell me anything in April because he was in the middle of discussing it with the company.

As for the lack of response from yesterday's email, I think it's most likely because he thinks that I'm going to leave if he tells me there isn't a position now. 

I haven't had trouble landing interviews, and I know that it's only a matter of time before I land a position somewhere. Money is a little tight, but I will be able to manage for the time being. So, should I give my two weeks' notice?"

I find myself in the situation where all the bad experiences have cumulated and I find no more pleasure in programming and now I can't think of what else to do.
Long story short: 
First internship: was put on a project on which my mentor ghosted me for the entire 2 months and whenever I asked questions he responded with one word (not to talk about how he went in a vacation in the middle of the internship and nobody knew what to do). I did everything as good as I could and people were impressed, but they did not take me because they said that the project had no future, since it was too different.
First job: was hired as a ML developer in the testing department and was the only Machine Learning developer in the firm. Never had a mentor and was put in the position to talk directly to clients. No code review, no guidance, they just asked for solutions. And the pay was terrible (even though the company is big). After 3 years and 3 solo projects + extracurricular activities (mentorship, student contest organising and promoting company and jobs) I left because they refused to pay me more than a junior.
Now: changed my job but since I'm doing almost the same things I find it hard not to think that this will end the same and that people don't care. So I try to give 100% while also working on my Master's degree and feel like I'm not getting anywhere.

Right now I don't know whether I should keep grinding to get to be a senior which stays in meetings 8 hours a day or change careers."

\- EC's: four different research projects/internships; two computer science programs; environmental sustainability fellowship; not sure if it counts but I've been part of my local cc's gear up! program for 6 years now; graphic designer position for a few clubs! + a few more things :)

\- no awards apart from winning small poetry contests :-)

\- Unsure of major: Environmental Science, Computer Science or Philosophy

&amp;#x200B;

**things i would like in a school:**

\- diversity (really important to me :"") ); mental health resources; safe for lgbtq+ students

\- good environment for students in terms of ""competition""; i really like the idea of being surrounded by a supportive group of people :)

\- weather: i prefer the colder and rainy weather; really hot areas make me sick :(

\- location: im open to leaving the states as well; i personally like uni's that are close to city's :-)

\- research opportunities + internships (just a lot of opportunities in general! such as ability to take different classes and learn kind of outside your major if that's possible? i really like interdisciplinary studies and such :))

\- nice library / campus (i personally love appreciating both architecture and nature idk if that's important lol)

\- also i want to emphasize that the school doesn't have to strictly fit into these guidelines!! if one or two things are missing from a school i think i'll survive (hopefully??)

&amp;#x200B;

**for reference**, some of the schools im interested in are Brown, Grinnell, Case, Barnard, Smith, McGill, Concordia (CA) (as you can see most of these are reaches and i really need help with balancing TvT) also im sorry if the formatting is really hard on the eyes!!

I'd appreciate literally any suggestions, thank you in advance! :-)"
n4v1it,1,2021-05-04,"[NJ] In a bind here. 26 y/o and just accepted sales role with Dad's company after resignation from full-time position. Realizing I may not even like sales. What to do, or how to navigate this?",Holi_hockey17,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/n4v1it/nj_in_a_bind_here_26_yo_and_just_accepted_sales/,"Hey CG community, 

Having a tough day. Not really sure how (or why) this hit me as hard as it did today, but it happened, and I need to figure it the f\*ck out (and fast). For reference, I just accepted a full-time sales role with my Dad's company at 26-years-old after resignation from a full-time position this past February. This is my second day here and I'm sitting at my desk right now writing this. Will certainly need to get back to work, but need to get this out there and off my chest first.   


Quick background because it may help with much needed advice here... 

  
26 y/o male now. Graduated college with a Marketing degree in 2018 from a well-known University. Had two different sales internships then. Prior to that, I sold Cutco cutlery in high-school and did quite well. Did well in my internships, too and made some good money for a college kid. 

  
Fast forward to graduation and I accept a full-time position at a recruitment agency. Youngest in the office of 32-people and the least experienced. 

  
Get put on a performance improvement plan 6-months into it. Decided to get on the horse and ended up closing three deals in one month. After coming off the PIP, two months later Covid hits and I get furloughed. Came back four months later with a bunch of money from unemployment and had an incredible 2020 Q4. Feeling good, the company was impressed and I was promoted. Then the bonus came and it was an absolute slap in the face. Decided I was tired of killing myself for frankly, not ""that"" much money, and resigned on February 8th. 

  
Bank account was declining quickly, so I went out and started my own recruitment agency the following week. S-Corp through my state's department of revenue, LI Recruiter license, have an EIN/W-9, company name/email/website, the whole 9-yards. 

  
Closed one deal for a flat $2K fee with a client I worked with while I was employed in the recruitment world. Did not sign a non-compete with my past employer. 

  
Fast forward to this past week after my bank account hit $0 (literally) and I approach my Dad about working for him. He has a small company and is on the brink of retirement. For the next two years, he's on a growth plan for the business as he has someone interested in buying the company, but because they're oversees, they want to see a larger footprint than we have now. There is a payout upfront for the purchase of the business, and a final payout in 2023 if we hit our numbers. 

  
How do you hit the numbers? You need sales. So we figured at this time, this might be something I could help with, and there may be a nice little pot of gold for me at the end of it (same with his other sales people, not just because I'm his son). If we help him hit the number, he pays us handsomely. Figured I need the money and he's in the tech industry (I'm definitely into technology/software), so thought this would be a good step in the right direction for my life-long career in the software/tech sales space. 

  
Wow, was I (maybe?) wrong. 

  
There's not a doubt in my mind that I ""can"" be a high-performing salesperson. Sales is really just getting through to people in a non-threatening way. You make people aware of why you're reaching out (and the nature of that reach-out is where many miss the mark), see if there's a possible exchange of value, and go from there. And don't be an asshole. It's certainly a large volume game, depending on how you go about it. But I digress, as this is a conversation for a different sub. 

  
So here I sit realizing I've followed in my Father's foot-steps for essentially my entire life, and now here I am working for him. He too was in sales and started a company with his brothers that has since been sold. This is his second company he has started personally. 

  
That said, working for my Dad really isn't the issue. I don't see his name on the offer letter, I see the company's name, and that's the honest to God truth. It just so happens that he has a really cool company, and he's in an industry I **am** interested in. From a logical perspective, it's actually not a bad move. I can make good money here and did not see a future in the recruitment space. Software/tech sales can be a very lucrative career for anyone in sales/business development. 

  
But now, I'm realizing I may not even see a future in sales at all. I've literally never had a job or internship that wasn't sales. I feel so stupid just realizing this now, that I never even tried anything else, and now it may be too late to restart. I don't want to go back to square one, though I guess I'll have to if I do make a switch. 

  
I don't even know if I enjoy sales. It's like throwing darts in a dark room and then out of nowhere, one hits the bullseye. Rinse and repeat. 

\- - - - 

I've watched a few videos / read some books (What Color Is Your Parachute, for example), and I guess here are some answers you guys will probably ask in advance: 

1) What do people tell me I'm good at?  
\- ""Sales""   
\- Talking to people / comfortable being around   
\- Listening / being understanding   
\- Navigating high-stress and difficult situations with patience / calmness (very ""in the moment"" situations... I tend to be very good at remaining calm in the heat of a ""high-stress"" moment) 

2) What I believe I'm good at:   
\- Sales   
\- Being told what to do and \*always\* doing it, unless it sounds ""off"" (you could say I've always done significantly better with a coach (with anything, really))   
\- Working hard (never had a problem with discipline, and when my passion meets discipline I can get extremely, extremely focused and driven, largely in part because of my OCD (though minor OCD)   
\- Completing tasks that are clearly outlined (in sales, I have a real problem with not knowing whether or not the 30 dials I'm about to make are even going to have a person on the other end of them... sometimes it's like spinning tires in mud, and I hate that. I want shit to get done, and to know I directly took it from point A to point B effectively).   
\- Managing many things at once. I'm really organized and always have been. You could say I have a sort of passion for organization.   
\- Managing people (based on the previous points about somehow always being able to ""get through"" to people in a kind and efficient way... a way that ""motivates"" them, I guess). 

  
So there you have it. Maybe I'm just having a sort of mid-day freak-out, but I can't really tell. Maybe this is just something I'm realizing now, that I didn't realize in the past. Who knows. All I do know is now I've gotten myself into a position where my own family, and co-workers that have worked for my Father for many years, are under the impression that I'm here to make some sort of positive impact, and for a number of months (dare I say years). 

  
TL;DR   
I guess if you could read the entire post, I'd really appreciate it. I've tried to lay it out as simple as possible, and maybe it'll be interesting for some of you as it's sort of my professional story riddled with ups and downs, but if you didn't read it, no worries. The TL;DR is that I'm currently working for my Dad because I thought software sales (he has a software company) would be a good move for my sales career, only now (and on my second day as a full-time employee here), I'm getting the feeling that I don't even enjoy sales and I've never done anything but sales. I've laid out some things people have told me I'm good at, and things I believe I'm good at, but really just looking for some guidance here. I use my Reddit account as a sort of journal, so I guess you could say this post is as much for me as it is seeking help from all of you. 

  
Cheers all. Apologies in advance for the length, just didn't know how else to lay it all out..."

For some context on who I am, I'm going to graduate May 2021 and that is basically guaranteed at that point from a college in the Midwest. I didn't get an internship because of COVID. Moving onto the situation at hand, I'm having a bit of a hard time determining which option is better. For extra context, I would have to relocate for either of these jobs, and I am looking to relocate out of the midwest.

Right now, I have an offer from Cognizant, now I've looked through this reddit and heard a lot of mixed things about the company as a whole, but from what I'm able to see the offer looks good. Now then, this offer expires in a few days, so I would have to make the choice pretty fast.

The issue is I recently got in contact with someone at General Motors, who I have heard a lot less negative things about on this reddit. My interviews with them would start past the date of accepting the offer from Cognizant, and I'm not guaranteed to get a job with them after I go through these interviews. But again, I have heard less negative things about them compared to Cognizant.

Both of their start dates are in June, and are fairly close in what times they will reopen and I will have to relocate to where they want me to work at. I'm looking for any advice or opinions on either of these companies, or what I should do regarding if I take the offer I have now or try to go for the offer I could get from General Motors."
n4yes7,1,2021-05-04,Building on my volunteering from awhile ago to get a real job,thomburnerslee,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n4yes7/building_on_my_volunteering_from_awhile_ago_to/,"When I graduated with my bachelor's in Computer Science, I really wanted to go on a data science path, deciding to start as a Data Analyst and later go back for my masters to try to be a Data Scientist. For reasons I don't want to get into, I decided that's not the path I want to take, I want to just do programming full-time. I do a little bit of SQL and Python at work, but not enough to satisfy me, or tell interviewers that I did proper software development in those languages, mostly bug fixes and scripting.

Unfortunately I didn't have any real internships, I just volunteered on-and-off for about a year and a half on a website my friend made, it was C#, MS SQL, and Bootstrap. I wrote maybe like 10 web pages of varying complexity, with a lot of guidance from my friend. My friend stopped doing the website several months ago and I can't really carry it on, I don't have the permission or expertise, as he pretty much told me what to write and only I understood some (but not all) of it, though towards the end I was getting more independent. 

The C# stack my friend used is pretty old, I really don't see many jobs requiring any of the front-end stuff we used; it's all react/angular and typescript/javascript now from what I'm seeing. In the few technical interviews I've made it to, they're surprised/disappointed I don't know REST, MVC, or Javascript. The jobs I'm applying for I can usually do fine in the interviews and pass the (easy) coding assessment, I just don't think I tick the boxes for recruiters or hiring managers because my stack isn't really common anymore.

As all my C# experience sorta ended several months ago, I'm really rusty on remembering how certain things worked and my friend really isn't available to help me with that stuff. Unfortunately for me, this seems like the best life line I have on my resume to hop over to software development.

Are there any options I have other than just spending all my free time forcing myself to learn javascript/typescript/angular/rest, or will the right opportunity come along eventually? I don't really care if I'm front-end or back-end, I just want a job and obviously the least amount of extra work I have to do after working 40+ hours a week would be nice. Are there other things I should prioritize learning instead? And just as a note, I'm not trying to get into a FAANG here, just any old job would be cool.

**tl;dr - Only real experience other than my cs degree was some volunteering on a website where I was guided through everything by a more senior dev. The site used an older stack that didn't use javascript/typescript/react/angular/REST/etc. so I was wondering if I had to learn those to get an entry-level job. What do I need to do?**"

But even in spite of this and doing everything I can, it's not enough. I didn't meet the criteria according to the testing center. I've been putting aside important therapy-related things for MONTHS in pursuit of ""one focus"" to make life easier, despite not wanting to, and I'm just so incredibly tired of it **never being enough**. There's way too much going on 24/7 and I can only control SOME aspects, and I can't even control them all the time! 

I'm scared of trying to get screened again for ADHD because at this point, IDK what help accommodations would actually *do* for me. Despite repeated mistake patterns (confusing order of things, understanding concepts but not being able to apply them, etc), the testing center didn't want to check for a potential learning disability because '**there's no way you've got one of those with your grades.**' 

This isn't the first time I've been invalidated, because, apparently, you have to be a complete trainwreck, failing all of your courses in order to have problems. This assumption is why it took half my hair falling out for my anxiety and depression to get diagnosed two years after they presented as a major problem. *I'd been s-icidal for months.* **Just because I've got protective factors doesn't mean I'm normal or healthy.** 

Despite explaining I've grown up in a household of psychologists and that **I've had to learn to bend over backward and follow an incredibly strict system to function as a normal adult,** I was disregarded as just another overly anxious kid. I don't want to be put on stimulants, and I'm not drug-seeking at all, I just want answers that *make sense*. 

My psychiatrist and everyone else who knows me suspects that I've got ADHD, and trying to figure out if I'll get screened again soon is overwhelming. I don't know what to do, and I'm exhausted from being invalidated because I'm not meeting some extreme enough. The lady who screened me didn't even consider the reason I'm rarely late for appointments is that I show up at LEAST a half hour early because **otherwise** I'll forget/miss them. *Having to make six reminders so you don't miss an appointment isn't normal.*  All of my other coping methods I've had to learn, like sending myself emails AS I'M TALKING TO SOMEONE (incredibly socially awkward) so I don't forget to do something, writing things down a billion times all over things I use so I keep up with scheduling, they all indicate to me that something isn't right. I've been infodumping (thankfully my friends love me for it) and a weird kid all my life, and I don't know what to do. Does anyone relate to this?"

Is Data Science For Me?,BabyOk8799,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n4yp7x/feeling_a_little_lost_is_data_science_for_me/,"I'm a university student, planning to finish with a BS and an MS in CS by 2023. Basically, I still have a lot of world left to see.

This whole time I've been vying for a career within data science. I've been doing work in my internships related to that as well as doing research and taking classes about the concepts in the field.

However, I recently had a meeting with an advisor (a well-respected CS prof at my uni) who claimed that data science is like cookie cutter coding... you just use code that's already been written and mold it to fit your problem (his sister is a data scientist at Facebook). I don't know how much of this is true, but it really turned me off to the idea of a career in data science and now I'm feeling a little lost as to what I want to do.

I was drawn to the field because of the possibility of working with the cutting edge, solving new and unique problems, and doing super cool work. I've enjoyed the projects I've been able to work on so far, but I know there's still so much of the industry I have yet to see.

**Can anyone tell me more about what it's like doing data science work in industry? Also, do you have to be at a big flashy tech company to work on interesting data science projects? (I realize ""interesting"" is subjective, but I'm curious to hear people's opinions)**"

I've been at Microsoft  for 2.5 years as a PM for a couple teams. I've been working here since graduation and have an EE degree with a minor in CS. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to code or do many 'technical' projects while on these teams and don't have any internship experience, so I'm considering myself as having 'zero-experience' although that's not completely true. I would like to switch roles to software engineering as I think this position better aligns with my interests and provides an opportunity to gain more useful and tangible skills. I have a couple questions I hope folks could help me with:

1. [I saw this older post from the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6e0dm4/are_remote_entry_level_positions_rare/) about finding entry level remote positions, and how rare it is. Now that we've been working from home for the last year I imagine (or hope) that there would be more opportunities for entry level remote work? If that's the case, any advice on where to look? If not remote, what would be the best listings to find entry-level positions?
2. It will be easiest for me to pivot internally but am interested in exploring other companies. I'm not sure if being at Microsoft is a better help considering my role but, is there anything you think I could do to better my chances of switching companies (beyond ""doing side projects"")?
3. I'm currently going through CTCI and attempting a couple LeetCode problems a day (studying Java). My coding experience is limited to Java and C which I studied in school. I know that lots of companies use more modern languages such as React, TypeScript, etc. Is it necessary for me to learn these to standout as 'relevant' (such as taking a bootcamp course, or doing a side project in these languages)?  I know ""anything helps"" but 'm trying to optimize my studying since I have a full-time job.

I may need some help deciding on whether to pivot companies or try to move internally (and then pivot) but would like to start here. Thanks for reading and any advice"

So the title basically says it all. I'm a Computer Science student from a tier-1 college in India currently looking at masters programs to apply for in my final year (Join immediately after graduation). I have submitted two papers in the ML domain in good int. conferences (will get acceptance results this summer). Both the papers were a result of working in my college's (two different) research labs. I also have a research internship in the final year at a top University in the US, and my work will mostly involve building models using Computer Vision. I have a summer intern at a good MNC, where the work might involve ML based on what team I get. Apart from this, I've done several projects in Machine Learning and Deep learning, and did well in all related coursework in college. I am extremely passionate about ML, and I want to work as a Machine Learning Engineer in the future. 
I'm really confused whether I should apply to MS DS programs or to MS CS with specialization in ML. I'm making this post since I haven't been able to find relevant information to my specific situation. Here are my concerns:
1. MS DS degrees are fairly new, and I've heard that are not as well structured as MS CS degrees.
2. MS DS degrees seem more stats based (I feel my statistics part is very good, and I enjoy it as well). However, I'm not sure if this can help me land an ML engineering job. Some programs that I saw didn't even have a Neural Networks or Deep Learning course . Most MS CS ML tracks tend to cover all possible aspects of Machine Learning in this regard, and hence I feel it'll be a better choice 

My main concern is that an MS DS will be insufficient for an ML engineer role. I'm not concerned of the flexibility that comes from doing an MS CS, since I do feel that this is the only domain I want to work in. So, I don't find MS DS limiting. 

It'll be really helpful if someone could help me with these queries. I'm unable to find much information about my specific queries on the internet. I'm also open to exploring masters programs in non-CS degrees but which provide specialization in ML. 

Thank you !"

n51olj,48,2021-05-04,We found a Roman account on what really happened at the Battle of Teutoburg Forest [PART 1],Mr_Pagan665,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/n51olj/we_found_a_roman_account_on_what_really_happened/,"Time is a brutal thing, so much knowledge is lost in time, and so much more will be in the future. There is no doubt that our human past Is often shrouded in mystery, there is simply so much to uncover and there are things that could reveal the very importance of our existence but due to circumstances they may never be found.

I work as a volunteer archaeologist on an internship programme in Germany. We were excavating a site about 5 kilometres south from the famous Teutoburg forest. Apparently remains from a roman camp or fort as they are often described, were found near a slight elevated terrain leading to a small hill.

Despite the excitement there were questions regarding this newly found “Roman Fort”. For starters the excavations near the sight propose that this camp was significantly smaller than the usual camps Romans often build. It lacked proper design and structure, as its barricades or fortifications were simply placed in a defensive formation with more emphasis on the northern part facing the direction of the forest. There was speculation if this was in fact roman, but the many artefacts that were found there seem to suggest that some form of roman presence was possible.

Many scholars from my field proposed the idea that perhaps it was some makeshift campsite or some early form of roman outpost to probably defend a group of Romans from the Germanic tribes. After further investigation however a very important artefact came to the surface that tells the story of this peculiar camp.

Remains of a man were found in fetal position clutching near his chest a plain bronze cylinder. It was not very heavy and upon analysing we were astonished as what was inside of it. Apparently it was a bronze sheet covering wooden tube of sorts and inside was the true gem of this find. Relatively well preserved documents addressing the emperor of Rome at the time Augustus.

Of course its contents however were truly defining history. The document has been translated and what follows is the written accounts of a roman equite by the name of Flavius Octavius during the battle of Teutoburg. It was supposedly meant to be a message reaching the roman emperor but due to circumstances that will be mentioned in his story such case never happened.

“To Augustus Emperor of Rome,

I bring ill news forth my Emperor as the march of Varus to meet the Germanic revolt in the West had proven to be futile. There so much I want to write yet so little time ahead of me. Nonetheless I shall try to be as consistent and as precise I can to regarding the ambush that has taken us by surprise in the Germanic forest.

At first we were informed by Varus that a march would commence leading the army towards some winter quarters west of the great river. During the preparations of the march we were informed by a revolt that had begun westwards that had to be dealt with.

Here I must profess my personal observations of the matter. From what I obtained by speaking to Claudius Antonius, a centurion in the 5th cohort we were about to embark on a march guided by locals appointed by the Principe Arminius, of course there was a lot of common talk on such decision, and on the matter if Arminius can be trusted at all since he was appointed as a chieftain to his barbaric tribe.

Furthermore, on the day of our departure news came forth that Arminius accompanied by some local men had left on gathering the remaining auxiliary forces that were scattered amongst the Germanic land. I cannot hide my disappointment and utter suspicion regarding the matter but we were expected to march westwards nonetheless.

With the first light of day peeking between the black trees, my auxiliary company along with some Parthian Archers, followed the three legions of Varus into the barbaric lands. I dare to speak that I believe this march was doomed from the very beginning since the weather ahead wasn’t promising. The sky was clouded making the shadows of the dark trees grow larger and surround us and it is what was possibly hidden among these shadows that made some of our legionnaires quiver.

It was soon understood that the terrain was rather unforgiving. From up hills of solid rock to muddy roads that were covered in stone cold water and having to drag our carriers, cattle and camp equipment was a rather tedious task. Soon the army was forced to stretch forward since the road through the forest was becoming more tight, this in return made the supply line to go further back making it impossible to reach the main army force if something were to happen.

There were moments were we would simply sit and camp while waiting to be able start walking again. And it was at such moments where we felt most vulnerable. While you sit and indulge on your meal the shadows of the forest are talking, they are conspiring against us, the whispers amongst the branches and the foul odour or the surrounding damped earth made me rather anxious.

But things became worse when an auxiliary scout had arrived to our cohort and began informing us on the news from the 17TH and 18th legion.

“We were ambushed! It is ordered by general Varus and his Centurions that all cohorts proceed further into the forest with caution and in battle formation if possible. Leave part of the supply line behind as there is an expected opening just less than a half days of walking ahead where a temporary camp will be risen. “

And with that ill news the scout had left and continued informing the other 5 cohorts behind us. We were rather shocked on the matter but there was not time for that, with haste we gathered our gear and left the supplies that weren’t as necessary behind just as the centurion had ordered us. Then the march had commenced.

Few moments later we had arrived at the sight where the ambush had taken place and I dare say it was horrifying to say the least. There were bodies lying in the tight forest road and we were forced to walk over them as some grotesque carpet. What the 17th and 18th had faced one can only dream yet, but their expressions speak of malicious horrors.

There were men half crashed with heavy boulders, others pierced with arrows and spears, and then there were those whose heads were ripped off and torn. Their eyes were fixated and showed the expression of pure fear, what faith had the gods bestowed upon the mighty sons of Mars, with half the army almost crushed what was in store for us?

The smell of blood became unbearable the further we walked on the path of death, and with every step more bodies began to pile up. One could find the occasional barbarians dead with pilum and arrows in their chest, lying next to our fallen brothers. The forest felt more dangerous now, as its shadows were creeping more with the fading sun and one could feel the eyes of the monsters of this forsaken land staring at us, waiting for their chance to storm us.

What was rather strange was the pile of dead animals one could see on that cloudy day. There were wolves, stags, boars and even ravens all of them pierced by either pilum or gladius and their blood pooled mixing with the rest of the corpses, adding to the casualties. If this was some form of tactic used by these barbarians, I dare say it was rather effective, as many of our troops seemed to have either claw marks stretch across the whole surface of their body, eyes torn or gauged can be found nearby others in the mouths of crows while other simply caved in and smashed.

Chunks of flesh were missing, as the necks of our soldiers were barely connecting to the body by the now visible spine. In some cases, one could see the spine protrude where the head was missing and the muscles around it indicate that it was somehow torn or ripped from the torso.

Mercenaries from Parthia and Gaul seemed to had fought mercilessly as their barbaric ways seem to be able to counter attack the Germanic ambush. I dare say they seem to manage to withhold for a while the beast but alas they succumbed nonetheless. Such disaster I had never seen in any of my campaigns, and what ill fortune is awaiting us further down these hostile lands.

It was clear that we were in a rather disadvantageous position, on our left and right there were slopes that towered above us twice the height of our men. The very same slopes those barbarians must have ambushed the front legions, its sides were covered with rubble and unsteady soil which is drenched in both Roman and German blood. Above the slopes, dark trees were situated in line as if a garrison protecting a fortification.

Our feet came in contact with rough soil and pools of blood and the soft bodies of men and animals and to further add to our ill fortune the weather had become darker and more treacherous with every passing moment. As the golden chariot of Sol had been driven behind the tall trees of Germania, making way for the barbarian god of thunder and lightning. It is clear as day my lord, that our gods had left us at that moment and we were met with theirs.

The army had finally reached the clear opening where the scouts had informed us about. Upon arrival I could see the left over men of the 17th and 18th legion making preparing the fortifications before the weather becomes more unbearable. In all my years in wars and battles, had never seen soldiers building the temporary camp this fast as these men did. There was an unusual fear in their eyes, they were sharp and alert of everything around them like animals that know they are being hunted.

The rain had begun to fall stronger making the soil muddy and our vision blurry. The camp was built before nightfall, and one could see the effects on the morale of our soldiers. Most of them were weary, tired anxious and most importantly scared, not many had dared to speak of the horrors they faced some of them I heard had even taken their lives. A shame to the Roman military, but I fear my lord even the strongest of men could not be ready for what this army and ours had faced.

I managed to get some information on what happened to the first ambush by speaking to some of the sanest soldiers of the 17th and 18th Legions. It is said that while they marched the narrow path they were forced into formation when a sudden smoke had begun to form ahead of them. The blowing wind was forcing the smoke to travel to the cohorts and eventually blinding most the soldiers.

Swords were unsheathed and spears were held at ready and as the sounds of iron and commands had subdued silence was followed. Only the trees could be heard for a moment one soldier stated, until that mournful horn blasted amidst the foggy forest causing chaos amongst the ranks and even more so the environment itself. Crows began to flee the scene and one could hear rustling above the slopes, behind the dark trees shades of dark could be seen moving ever so.

The horn had blared one more time, and its sound was even more deeper this time. Some soldiers said it reminded them of the Carnyx horn used by Celts and Gauls, but to others it was as if Morta and her hounds were unleashing their voices, their voices of death. Then arrows and spears began to fly making their way into the Roman lines, wearing the solders town as they tried to form any formation but panic soon overwhelmed them as the narrow space of this path was making things more complicated.

One soldier described to me how that the earth began to shake and when he turned to face his comrades he saw boulders rolling down the slope and crashing them in place. The Germans made their attack when they began to pool down from the slopes with spears and swords in hand ready to kill every single Roman, or die in the process.

Some said that they battled as animals and some say they were animals themselves. One roman soldier from the 18th legion spoke that he saw a wolf transform into a German barbarian moment before he jumped down the slope to meet us. With his bare hands he tore the Scutum in half and then ripped of the head of the legionnaire that held it, he roared as an animal while he was impaled with three spears from his sides. He began to move closer while the shafts were getting deeper into this ribs and chest until his hands were barely away from the head of another roman. He was eventually taken down by a gladius to the face by a nearby centurion that tried to keep the men in line.

Another soldier said how he came face to face with a group of barbarians that were trying to make their way into the 17th legion trying to capture Varus. Despite the group being barely protected with proper armour, they clawed and roared their way through the line of Gaul mercenaries before reaching the trained legionnaires. It is at this moment he saw their eyes, they glowed crimson red and were menacing as if an animal ready to capture and tear down its pray. Their expression like madmen, and their movements fast as if lightning, their hands were covered in both blood and soil and from their mouth red and white liquid flowed.

The guard had stood its ground and subdued the attack and what was left before them in their place were carcases of animals. In the midst of battle, no roman could say for sure if they indeed turned into animals but one thing was for sure the bodied of both roman and Germans were piling.

Hearing the tales of the mad soldiers definitely had put me on edge the hostile environment was playing tricks on my now tired and weary mind. I saw shadows move in the treelines and sometimes accompanied by small flames that flickered, there was moment also that I thought I heard that mournful horn amidst the heavy rain. But I guess such ill fortune was to be expected, especially when we agreed to be guided by those men sent to us by that treacherous Arminius.

I started at a university to get my bachelors in CS back in 2019. Spring semester we all got sent home for Covid and I finished my freshman year online. Online classes and a friend’s internship experience led to me believe that I was going to hate CS in the long run, because I didn’t want to stare at a computer screen for 8 hours a day. I didn’t mind coding, actually kind of enjoyed it, but I absolutely hated just sitting at my desk staring at my laptop all day. And I knew that whether I worked in an office or remotely, that was gonna be my life if I continued down the CS path. I lost interest in CS but really didn’t know what else to do. The school I went to was very expensive, and so I didn’t want to continue to spend a ton of money without having a clear goal in mind, and so I made the tough decision to just drop out completely. I’ve been working full time as a bike mechanic since. Bikes have become my passion over the last few years, and I think staying in the bike industry would be a ton of fun, but no matter what you do, the pay is garbage. If my only interest was bikes then maybe that would be enough but I have other expensive hobbies and interests that $30-40k per year just won’t fund. I’m still at the bike shop, but a few months ago decided I wanted to get into automotive repair. Being a bike mechanic taught me that I really like working with my hands and turning wrenches and playing with tools and just kinda fixing stuff, I’m very mechanically inclined and pick up that kinda stuff easily. So my thought process was that auto repair would satisfy that but give me a bigger paycheck. But upon further research I don’t think they even get payed all that much. Some of the best and busiest techs can make a lot sure, but not quite what I’d like to be making. My goal for a very long time has been to make 6 figures, doesn’t have to be some absurd amount, $100k is fine, but I wanna earn a 6 figure salary. I think that would be a sufficient amount for me to live comfortably, provide for others, and allow me to do and buy things and go places that make me really happy and allow me to put enough away each year to be able to retire in the mountains. In theory, staying in CS and becoming a software engineer would be perfect for me because I could work from anywhere, it would allow me to travel and also allow me to afford to do to things I enjoy. So, basically what I need is a job that gives me the benefits of working in software: remote work and high salary and the satisfaction of working physically in repair. If anyone can think of anything please let me know, but I’ve pretty much come to the conclusion that a job like that doesn’t exist, and I just need to decide whether job satisfaction or life outside of work satisfaction is more important to me, and I honestly have no idea how to even make that decision. I feel like I’d need to see my life 15 or so years in the future on either side and see which one I liked more. Both are 9-5 jobs, but with software there sometimes seems to be some kind of expectation to work longer hours or teach yourself stuff related to work outside of work hours and not get paid for it, where as with auto repair I’d put in my 8 hours and be done each day. I’m very confused and feel like I have to make a decision pretty soon, especially if I’m going to go back to school and do software. I feel stuck and don’t know where/how to move forward. 

Tl;dr - 
I want a job with the benefits of software engineer (can work remotely and high salary) with the satisfaction and work/life balance of something more physical like auto repair. I’m not sure that job exists, and so idk which path to choose."

Worked my way up from a lowly highschool intern in IT Security, through college, and eventually became a CISSP with a decent title. Growing to know most people in IT while I was there.


I had just finished with implementing the  Identity and Access Management tool for all corporate and retail employees, and received a job offer to double my salary at a different company.


It was a tough decision, I didn't want to leave my coworkers with a system that only I had just implemented so I asked to start in a month.


Two weeks of documentation and system administration go by and it turns out the application was nearly flawless.. except one thing. Employees were termed in the morning of their last day.


Simple fix, changing a &gt;= to &gt; in a database script for querying users to disable. So I put in for a change request and we have to wait 2 weeks to implement because this system is considered to be Tier 1. With a sole IT person running it..? Anyway.. that's scheduled to be implemented on the Thursday in two weeks.


I submit my two weeks for this new job, and my VP was very happy for me to find somewhere that could pay me what I'm worth.


The day of my last change control, word had gotten around I was leaving. We review the changes as normal, talking about procedures for implementation, testing, validation and backout. My change comes up..

$me: This change is to fix a problem where employees are terminated the morning of their last day. Yada yada

$ccb_admin: I noticed you left the validation procedures blank. Surely this requires validation.

$me: The only way to test is upon employee termination, so I guess I'll find out Friday morning if it worked.


And the room just erupted with laughter.


I really loved working with those people. My current job is more stressful but better experience, and pay to boot."

Am I better off spending my time on shorter Udemy courses over the summer or should I try and take the Google class for certification? I'm not exactly sure I'd be able to finish all the courses for the certificate before my semester starts at school so they'd overlap with my classes (assuming I take about 6 months to complete)."

I am graduating from a Computer Science degree in 2023. I have been fortunate enough to work a summer internship as a full-stack developer utilizing React and Node.JS (typescript for both) as well as a year long internship working as a system developer using Java (no frameworks AFAIK). I also have a lot of AI experience through clubs using Python but I am not really a big fan of working with ML/AI, still worth mentioning since I believe Django has a decent market share for backend.

I am trying to make myself as attractive a candidate as possible through bolstering my personal portfolio. I have two projects on it thus far, both of which have used React and Node.JS. I am hoping to have a couple more full stack side projects by the time I graduate, on top of having my AWS certifications and enhancing my side projects with their services. 

I was wondering if you guys think it would be worth creating projects in C#/Java since currently I am hoping to work primarily in backend as this is the field I have found most compelling so far. Those two languages obviously dominate the backend job market currently but it seems like overkill to use these for projects that aren't of enterprise scale, in addition to having a higher learning curve than other languages and frameworks. I really like working with Node.JS and am quite comfortable throwing servers together with Express. I also have demonstrable work experience with Java thanks to my current internship even though it is not in a traditional web development setting. Ultimately, do you guys think it would be worth it to teach myself Java or C# for the backend of future side projects or would it be better to gain more experience with Node.JS? If so, should I bolster my Java knowledge or jump into C# which seems to be a much more developer friendly experience? Job market seems evenly split in my area.

TL;DR, upcoming CS graduate can't decide if I should continue making side projects with Node.JS or branch off and learn Java/C# to prepare me for enterprise jobs"

Sorry this is gonna be something I wanna get off my chest. I’m a third year international student at tech. I’ve come to the point in my life where I feel like I have ruined my entire career. My GPA is not great to start with, it’s pretty average. I spent my freshman summer back home, interning, and my last summer at home taking classes. I’ve tried really hard to bag an internship this summer and received nothing but rejections. Capital one, Koch industries, Coca-cola, Home Depot, NCR, and a list of other companies that I’ve been applying to since winter break last year have all turned me down. I’ve had my resume reviewed by friends and faculty and implemented all the feedback received, and they say it looks good. My career buzz shows no opportunities available for this upcoming summer. I really wanna do something in life but I think my past experiences just make me seem like a worthless candidate at this point. And don’t get me wrong, it’s not the interviews that I’m bombing, because I only received interviews from 2 companies I applied to. I always have the opportunity to return home, but not interning in the United States just seems like a dumb thing to do, or very unconventional for a third year student. It gives me immense joy to see my friends from all different majors receive offers, it’s just I wish I had that experience too. I really don’t know what to do. I just feel useless. My parents are spending a fortune on my education and I really want to be able to be financially independent but I do not know how to. I’ve been using LinkedIn to reach out to people but it seems like it’s the end of the recruiting season now. I don’t know what is causing this. Some say it’s because of sponsorship requirement in the future, others it’s because of my academics, some say it’s because of my major. But I see people from my major (IE) do really well in their professional careers. I really do not know what to do."

Pros:  
\- More prestige? Bigger name so might help with future job searches  
\- Higher pay

Cons:  
\- Potential toxic culture and bad wlb  
\- Don't know projects as well. Also will (most likely?) be working with Java which is a language I have no experience in

Pros:  
\- Better wlb, and company as a whole seems a lot more chill

I worked retail for far longer than I had wanted. I landed an internship as my first IT job 5 years ago and I had slowly built experience and credibility. But after all that time, today I accepted a full time job as a System Administrator. I'm 33 years old.
I know this is probably not a huge deal for all you brilliant folks, but this is pretty surreal to me considering the challenges I had to overcome. I graduated from high school in 2006 which turned out was never accredited (private church-run school). I wasn't able to secure financial aid so all my education expenses were out of pocket. But now, 2021 and i have a degree with no college debt and finally have a position I've been pursuing for years.
For those trying to overcome challenges while pursuing your goals, I promise you that if I can do it, then so can you. Some days/nights are going to SUCK. I went through it too, just stick with it and you'll make it."

I've received 1 job offer from a Consulting firm but didn't feel it was the right place for me, especially because they are known for unpaid overwork.

# Now I've received another job offer from another consulting firm with these Pro's and Con's:

**Pro's:**

* They primarily use new technologies
* The pay per hour seems like the average in my country
* Overtime work is paid
* Paid full-time, even if they don't have enough projects for me
* Learning on the job with courses from Pluralsight, if you are unprepared for some new technologies
* Possibility for going remote if I go part-time, rather than full time

**Con's**

* Transport time is not included in the work hours (but luckily most customers we visit and work at will be within 20 miles)
* Not many machine learning tasks (but I don't know how hard that will be to get in a job anyway)
* If I go part-time to become remote, then they pay less, and only when they can find work for me

The job seems good, but I'm the type that always thinks about whether I could get something better...

I've heard it looks bad on your CV if you don't stay at least 2-4 years in each job, so I want to be sure I pick the right one. 

But at the same time I don't know how picky I can be with my qualifications:

* I only soon have a bachelor in Software Engineering
* I haven't had any internships, but only developed my own apps in my free time and been a teaching assistant at the university in the ""Algorithms &amp; data structures"" course.

**I haven't started my job search yet (these companies reached out to me),** and I will first start in a job 3-4 months from now in August/September. So I'm a bit worried about just picking the first and best thing, rather than waiting to see if I get better options. I haven't even used much time looking at what's out there as I haven't started my job search. 

**What are your experiences? How picky should you allow yourself to be as a newly graduated bachelor in Software Engineering without internship experiences?** (I live in Denmark)"

I’m 24 and graduated in 2019 with a mediocre liberal arts and social science degree which led to zero opportunity then Corona happened. Luckily, I made a ton of money the past year and can afford any education I want. So no debt.

I’ve been experimenting the last year and really like InfoSec. I've been playing around learning coding, taking online classes on security, building stuff, and sites like TryHackMe. I would really like to do this as a career but I have no job experience and no relevant degree. I know to get into InfoSec, one usually gets there through Network Admin or Systems Admin so I figured this degree might help.

I got books/resources to start taking the basic certifications this year but also applied for an online Masters and got accepted at a decent school. The curriculum is way more technical with 2 business classes and looks promising. Should I take it and shell out the cost? Would it be worth it?

I know experience and certs matter more but it’s also hard to get entry level opportunities with a CV of liberal arts and irrelevant experience. Plus I could get student internship opportunities. Maybe also get into SOC.

Any advice to break into IT going for a role in InfoSec? Would a masters help? What kind of opportunities and internships should I pursue?"

Not that the work on my part is done, I would like to know the following:

1. Do recruiters look at GitHub repositories and LinkedIn profiles? (my GitHub and LinkedIn, both are up-to-date)
2. Will they ask me to run the projects which I have worked on previously?
3. What exactly do they ask from the resume?
4. What are some examples for project-specific questions? (**Do they only care about the general explanation of the project along with briefings about the various components and the technology stack used or is there more to this?**)

I have been practicing on LeetCode, however, it feels like I worked on these projects ages ago and if they are going to look at project simulations, I will have to prepare for them specifically.

2. Been using custom ROM in Android with understanding the concepts of firmware, bootloader since 6th grade. Always been fascinated about root privileges and tinkered my whole phone for years. Currently with a knowledge of data privacy, using a Degoogled phone for a year.

3. Switched from windows to GNU/Linux a year ago and learnt many concepts and it even helped me during my internship as using cut, grep and other CLI commands were very useful and kept me on track.

4. I took courses and read books, documentations regarding CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, CCNA and even understood in depth TCP/IP model, IPv4 and IPv6 packet analysis, Usage of wireshark, tcpdump, Nagios core, Bro/Zeek packet analysis tool,

5. Learnt the basic docker concepts, as I have a future goal of having a selfhosted environment. Currently, learnt and practised above concepts in VM's in my homelab.

6. Have knowledge of basic cryptography, which algorithms are better.

It worked but the conversation was taking long to communicate what I was doing. They said ""one of the reasons to use Python is because its simpler to understand but I can't understand your code."" We're a busy team and small so I don't think they really have time to do code reviews.

Most of their code are really small functions. Like 5-25 lines. The way I think about things, I tend to think each function does one, non-repeated, decent sized operation per function. I'm not really sure how to define what that means but essentially most my functions end up being 20-70 lines each.

When I look at popular GitHub repositories, it seems more like theirs. Each function is extremely small and most of it is like if checks and try blocks to catch errors. For example [https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/master/requests/utils.py](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/master/requests/utils.py)

I'm not sure how to ask this but how can I get myself to code more like that? How is the problem being thought of to end up that like? I feel like I'm producing newbie/novice looking code."

I want to make a complete career switch and have no idea where to start. I believe getting some kind of online degree in computer science would be the most practical and effective way to start a new career. 

I went to school to study geology because I thought it’s what I would be passionate about, then during the course of school and having several internships doing field work I thought I would go into geotechnical consulting and then eventual down the line get my certification as an engineer. 

After working in this field for two years, I have decided that I can tell that this is not what I want to do for the rest of my life. 

My hope is that my background in science (geology, chemistry, physics, etc.) will allow me to transfer credits towards another scientific degree. I will need to take classes 100% online so that I can do my coursework at night/weekends when I’m not working my current job, and I understand computer science has a lot of options for online degrees from places like SNHU. 

Unfortunately, I also currently have around 30k of student loan debt I am currently trying to pay off from my geology degree so I also need the cheapest option available. 

Any and all advice on how to get started would be greatly appreciated.

I do the classic run like most of us, check tickets, go and fix them, add new features or sometimes bigger projects like adding a new page with a brand-new UI/UX Design.  It seems okay to me so far then I realize that I am the guy who fixes or does stuff as co-workers, QA guys, managers report. Right after I read the ticket, I go and do my best to fix bugs or do the task. In our last project, I got some tickets that I couldn't understand very well and for me, the logic that I needed to change wasn't right but I did it anyway( and I start to understand something about my working process). I like my manager, he is a kind guy, we talked a little about why ""I jump directly to fix bugs or do the tasks"". As a developer, we are responsible how the app interacts with the user, if there is something that does not make sense to you, or you think it is not the right way, you HAVE TO speak up, you cannot go and do what you asked to do every time. If later, someone sees that there is something wrong, you had to change back and you wasted your hours...  Especially implementing new tasks and features, I was just coding what I asked for. Now I am understanding that I need to think about the ticket, is it a necessary feature or the bug is a real bug or it should be the working process of our app etc.  
Sorry, it was a long post... What I wanna say is, not only go and do the tasks but share your ideas, thoughts about the ticket and if you are not clear with that, ask and try to understand and after if you think it is the right thing to do... then do it.

As this was the case I started off my current project on Angular last week and have basically had to relearn everything again, and it's going pretty well.

However when searching through Stack overflow and YouTube tutorials to get things running, React just keeps coming up, and it's sparked my interest. From my research into comparing the two I've noticed a couple of things. 

 - Angular looks to have more support, probably because it's  older

- Any React demos I've looked at seem to have a slicker look to them regarding animations etc

- React seems to have overwork Angular in popularity


Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on those. 

This is hopefully going to be released in the real world as a revenue generating product, and I'm wondering which framework would you guys recommend out of these 2? 

I'd be particularly interested on the actual frontend / UI advantages or disadvantages to either framework as I don't have much knowledge in this field at all, and looking for the quickest route to a nice looking and functional demo before I inevitably have to outsource.

Without giving any IP away, the most important functional features would be:

 - A metronome component (also partially implemented)
 - Backend storage of the audio (already implemented with angular and firebase)
 - running some *secret* code on said audio on the backend  (yet to be implemented)

4. *4-time Gold key recipient in writing, 2016-2019 Scholastic Art and Writing Awards, Hudson to Housatonic region*

**Letters of Recommendation**

*We only got to read one of these so I am guessing on three of them:*

· **APUSH Teacher:** *He got along well with her and I think he was one of her favorites in class, but who knows.*

· **AP Lang Teacher:** *Teacher really liked his work and he got a great grade in her class, so I think this was good?*

· **Counselor:** *I think this was a good letter because we are still in touch with him with updates and he always responds and seems happy to get them?*

· **Skating Coach:** *My son passed all his Moves in the Field test from Pre-Preliminary to Junior with this coach whom he skated with for almost 10 years.* *Was a great letter.* *It’s a shame we only got to submit it to two schools – both of which admitted him, btw. :)*

**Interviews**

· **Princeton:** *My son said he was nice and it was more of a conversation than an interview, but nothing really stood out for him.*

· **Georgetown:** *The interviewer was really interested in learning more about his skating and how he got into it, so they spent a lot of the conversation talking about it.*

· **SciencesPo:** *This interview is an extremely high-stress process.* *Participants have about 45 minutes to read and take notes on an article about international current events in the area they are interested in studying, then are questioned about it and any other relevant details by 3 interviewers for at least another 30 minutes.* *I would have nope-d the heck out of that, but my son seemed to really enjoy it and it seemed to go very well.*

**Essays**

· **Common App:** *Was about how he hated skating when he first tried it but how watching a US team’s original dance in 2010 made him rethink that decision and want to try again.* *It was really nicely written and he got great feedback from it from several of the schools he applied to.*

· **College supplements:** *The Princeton short answer questions were a lot of fun and the only time he will probably ever get to answer “Accidental Eddie Money Enthusiast by Mike Polk Jr” to a question. :)* *He had a lot of supplements to write and they were ok, I don’t remember anything being particularly outstanding or memorable other than the Princeton answers.* *If whomever read his Princeton answers discovered the comedic hilarity of Mike Polk because of his application, I consider that a win. :)*

**Additional Information:**

The outright Georgetown RD rejection was hugely surprising considered both my father and I are alumni, and we both volunteered for the school as alumni interviewers in the past. They probably did us a favor with the rejection, however, because there was no way we could afford to send him there. His final four were Sciences Po, Seton Hall’s School of Diplomacy (a hidden gem IMO that treats prospective students and their parents amazingly -- please look into it if you are interested in IR!), William and Mary, and Trinity in Dublin. He’s always been interested in travel, and after spending the summer before Senior year in Morocco, the idea of getting to actually use the 6+ years he spent studying French was too tempting to pass up. I know a lot of people hear about Sciences Po because of the dual degree programs it has with Berkeley and Columbia, but my son didn’t have any interest in attending either of those schools. Sciences Po's tuition is ridiculously reasonable at approximately 12,000 US a year for a 3-year undergrad program, with living expenses also being fairly reasonable and in line with what you would pay for room and board at a state school. He has also had so many opportunities he wouldn’t have had if he had remained stateside. He was set on going to American University in Cairo for his third year program for quite awhile, something he could not have done from a US university, until changing his mind to attend Boğaziçi University in Istanbul for his final semester next year. He will be spending his fall semester at a think tank internship in Zagreb, Croatia. He went to Cairo last February to do research on a political science project and ended up getting to run a half marathon around the pyramids, and he quarantined in Zagreb for three months with his friend from school. Needless to say, his college years so far have been quite an adventure!

A quick note to anyone considering a European school – I don’t know about the rest of them, but you need to be a very independent person who is good at figuring things out without a lot of help if you go to a school like Sciences Po.  It is very very different than the typical US university. First years do have the option to live in a dorm, but you have to figure out your own food/cooking while you are there. Second years can live in the dorms, but many opt to buddy up and rent locally, which brings its own set of adult responsibilities such as dealing with leasing agents and how to get broken appliances and internet routers fixed. You need a lot of patience and not need a lot of hand holding, but if this sounds like you, I would highly recommend it. We will end up paying less for a full undergrad degree than we would have for just one year at Georgetown, and the international connections he is making while at the school are priceless. If you have any other Sciences Po related questions, please PM me and I’ll try to help!"

I just would love to revise a little or prepare myself anyhow, but just no idea what could be helpful. 

I applied for EY audit internship, I sent my resume and now they asked me to do an online, 1h test which is supposed to test my „(...) numerical data analysis skills and competences required in our organization.” Im wondering, what could that be? Are there any practice tests available for that? 

Thank you for any advice. Btw it’s my very first test such as that one so that’s why I’m a bit worried, and no no, Im not lazy, I tried checking it out online what this could be but Im still unsure. Maybe there is someone here who knows a bit better or has experience with that. Please share, thank you so much :) I appreciate it."

Worked my way up from a lowly highschool intern in IT Security, through college, and eventually became a CISSP with a decent title. Growing to know most people in IT while I was there.



I had just finished with implementing the  Identity and Access Management tool for all corporate and retail employees, and received a job offer to double my salary at a different company.


It was a tough decision, I didn't want to leave my coworkers with a system that only I had just implemented so I asked to start in a month.



Two weeks of documentation and system administration go by and it turns out the application was nearly flawless.. except one thing. Employees were termed in the morning of their last day.


Simple fix, changing a &gt;= to &gt; in a database script for querying users to disable. So I put in for a change request and we have to wait 2 weeks to implement because this system is considered to be Tier 1. With a sole IT person running it..? Anyway.. that's scheduled to be implemented on the Thursday in two weeks.


I submit my two weeks for this new job, and my VP was very happy for me to find somewhere that could pay me what I'm worth.



The day of my last change control, word had gotten around I was leaving. We review the changes as normal, talking about procedures for implementation, testing, validation and backout. My change comes up..

$me: This high risk change is to fix a problem where employees are terminated the morning of their last day. Yada yada.

$ccb_admin: I noticed you left the validation procedures blank. Surely this requires validation.

$me: The only way to test is upon employee termination, so I guess I'll find out Friday morning if it worked.


And the room just erupted with laughter.


I really loved working with those people. My current job is more stressful but better experience, and pay to boot."

n5lntg,1556,2021-05-05,Another advice thread from a graduating senior who landed their dream job,Long_duck_of_the_law,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/n5lntg/another_advice_thread_from_a_graduating_senior/,"A little background: I’m a good student, graduating with a 3.6 GPA. Last week I landed my dream job at a dream location with a dream salary. Most of this advice is geared toward my Mechanical brothers and sisters but most of it can apply to other disciplines as well.

1. Take a picture of everything you make. Even if it’s shit. You’ll get good eventually and then you’ll have a nice portfolio of pictures to screenshare during zoom interviews.

2. Buy a 3D printer and use it.

3. Pirate your textbooks. Spend the money you save on tools or materials for projects.

4. Be mindful of how much time you spend playing video games. It is a fantastic way to waste time and you don’t realize it until it’s too late.

5. Suggested tools to own as a ME: dial calipers, digital multimeter, full screwdriver set (full size and mini/precision size), pliers and cutters, needle files, measuring tape, knife, flashlight, epoxy, cordless drill, ratchet and socket set. Don’t be the person on your senior capstone group who doesn’t know how to use a drill (true story…). Personally whenever I need a tool for a project I just buy it instead of borrowing it from school. Now I have quite the arsenal and it’s empowering to be able to work on things on a whim.

6. If you have a car, do your own oil changes. Or at the very minimum, do it once or twice so you at least know how.

7. Learn LaTeX. Overleaf is a good place to start. I learned it sophomore year before I learned how to use MATLAB. It gave me a huge leg up when learning how to code. You’re going to hate it at first and spend way too much time trying to figure it out but if you practice by using it for all your lab reports you’ll have the skills to make a god-tier resume.

8. Join Toastmasters. Being good at public speaking will make you stand out and you’ll be much more confident during job interviews.

9. You should always be doing something engineering related outside of class. Participate in research for professors, join a club, do an ambitious personal project. If you join a club, be an active participant and do work so that you have something to show for it.

10. Turn in every single homework assignment. If you do all your homework you won’t have to stress over tests because your grade has a little padding.

11. Keep your head game strong. Engineering school is hard. You will fail a test every semester (at least I did). Even if you fail a test it is possible to get an A in the class.

12. I always try to front load every semester and start strong. That way at the end of the semester you can fail all your finals and still pass all your classes. However, if you start strong you will be able to do just fine on your finals without stressing too much.

13. Sleep is very important. There is no glory in being sleep deprived. It’ll make you retarded, sluggish, and you won’t be very effective at anything.

14. Visit your professors during office hours. Even if you don’t have any homework questions. Ask them about their career path. Ask them for suggestions on how you can get involved on campus. This is common advice that often gets ignored but it is one of the most important things on this list.

15. If you don’t get a summer internship (lets face it, statistically, you won’t, and that's okay) do a summer project. Do a long one that takes all summer. Work on it 4 or 5 days a week. Being poor isn’t an excuse; it will pay dividends in the long run. If anything, take online coding courses and learn Python. This will give you advantage over other ME’s.

16. Don’t come to classes high. Even if you can still do the coursework just fine, it’s not a good look. Your peers will be your future network after you graduate. You don’t want them to remember you as the guy that was baked 24/7. Smoking weed after school is fine though. These are your glory years, don’t be afraid to live it up.

17. Try to get A’s in all of your lower division classes (calculus, physics, etc.) because this will make it much easier to comprehend the upper divs. These are worth grinding hard on. Also, this is a good opportunity to pad your GPA.

18. Don’t take too many classes at once. 99% of the time it’s not worth it.

19. Exercise. Even if it’s just yoga a couple times a week. Don’t ask me how it works but it’s good for your brain.

20. Make friends with people who are better than you. Find out the habits that make them successful and pick up those habits.

21. For a calculator, buy a TI-36x Pro and learn how to use every function on it. It can do matrices, curve fit, interpolate, solve equations (solve for x, saving you from doing the algebra), imaginary numbers/phasors, dot and cross products, statistics, and so much more. You can use this calculator on the FE. Don't get a graphing calculator because you should be doing your graphing on MATLAB/Excel/Python. 

22. If you are ever considering suicide, see a school counselor/therapist. It's typically free. I've been there too and it is nothing to be ashamed of. You have worth.

That’s just about all I can think of. Most of it is pretty generic advice that has been said before but it’s worth repeating. Good luck my friends."

n5m3o4,19,2021-05-05,Horror is my drug of choice,JohnnyBlanco69,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/n5m3o4/horror_is_my_drug_of_choice/,"When people say that you need to experience college to not only get a better job but to broaden your horizons here’s my advice. 

Don’t. 

If the concept of soul crippling debt, taking classes on things that you will never use in order to get a degree you will probably never need sounds good to you then by all means go to college. Trust me when I tell you as I am in my late 20’s and never used my associates degree that I struggled for four years to get. Hard work, dedication and a strong work ethic has gotten me to where I am today. 

I wish I had known that so many years ago. Before I was trying to get into college. 

When you apply for college they don’t always look at your grades otherwise choosing people would be an easy process. On the application they want an essay and they also look at your extracurricular activities. They want things like leadership abilities, internships, all types of crap like that and I was severely lacking in that department. Asking my mom about this in my junior year of high school was a mistake as she worked at a clinic. This clinic helped people with substance abuse issues along with giving them a place to eat, shower and sleep. My mother hinted that they were always looking for volunteers and it would look good on my college application. 

In hindsight I should have said no and just figured out a way to get into the school I wanted. Maybe there was a way to scrap all of this and just go to a CUNY school and get my degree that way. 

So for the next eight months my Saturdays were spent at the New Horizons rehabilitation center. The first few weekends they gave me mundane things to do like mopping the floors or doing laundry. However, they also saw potential in me to counsel some of the people that were residing at this facility. They gave me some training on what to look for and potential red flags and before you know it I was going to be talking to a few people every single week. Now I am not a psychiatrist by any stretch of the imagination and that wasn’t going to be my job. My job was to just talk to these people as if they were exactly that.

The first person assigned to me was Allen, an older gentleman in his 50’s and he had an addiction to painkillers. His dependency on these drugs was through no fault of his own as he served in the Vietnam conflict.  Our first meeting he was a bit skittish as he had more than a few conspiracy theories about everything from 9/11 to aliens in Area 51. While it unnerved me a little to hear him recount stories about his glory day back “in country” he seemed mostly harmless. 

Brian who was the second person assigned to me, had a multitude of problems as he was kicked out when he was only 18 years old. Not having a choice he fled to the suburbs and tried to eke out a living. He lived on the streets, was in a band and did a lot of things both legal and illegal in order to survive. Of course he was hooked on drugs to either get away from his problems or as an inhibitor to make a good time even better. Every time we got together we would talk about music, about what he liked to play and what styles he was into at the time. To my surprise he was a Ramones fan like myself and we would talk for hours about their music and how he was going to start a band when he got out. 

And then there was Jeremiah Benson.

When you first looked at him before your eyes could even process what you were seeing the smell hit you. This was someone that had lived on the streets and his tattered clothes looked as if they were hanging on by bare threads. He was unshaven and his brown and bushy beard seemed to stick out at odd angles. If you were to see this man on the street you would either pay him no mind or toss him a quarter for his troubles. At first I had no idea how to engage with this guy as part of me wanted to know about where he was from and how he got to where he is today. 

“Drugs, of course” saying with a smirk that was barely concealed behind his beard. 

The first session was trying to get him to open up to me and it was met with nothing but failure. Every attempt to try to reach him was either met with sarcasm or a wild story that seemed to eat up the rest of that session. At one point I asked my supervisor to reassign me to someone else that I might be able to help but they sat me down and explained it to me. 

“Look, I know that Jeremiah is a... difficult case. However, even the difficult cases need someone to confide in and I think you are perfect for this.” 

The head of the department seeing that this was a difficult case assigned me more time with Jeremiah and less time with other clients. Of course my rounds consisted of checking in with my other clients on how they were progressing and if they needed to talk to come and find me. So during my second six hour session with Jeremiah it was like talking to a brick wall. The whole session was going to be a complete waste of time except for the last thirty minutes when I tried a different tactic.

“What kind of movies do you like?” asking with hope of him letting his guard down.

He looked at me as if I asked him a question about quantum physics and before mulling over it for a minute or two he uttered one word. 

“Horror”

I quirked an eyebrow “So, you love horror movies?” 

He nodded but then looked at the clock on the wall with a pained look. “It’s a pity. If I would have known that then we could have talked about horror this entire time.” 

“Well there’s always next week?” 

Jeremiah looked a bit uneasy “I hope so. See you then?” 

“Sure, see you next Saturday”

Leading up to next weekend was spent searching around my house for things that I had no longer needed or wanted. Most weekends were spent with my folks as we went to the various flea markets that were scattered around our area. I remember going to a vendor almost every week and buying various comics and magazines and paying only pennies on the dollar for them. 

These flea markets also had a history of selling all types of fiction for relatively cheap. Everything was available from fantasy, science fiction and of course horror and picking up these paperbacks cheap was a thrill for me.  Choosing a wide selection of both classic and more modern anthologies like the Book of the Dead or Silver Scream. By the time Saturday rolled around I had two big shopping bags full of periodicals for Jeremiah to read. 

Arriving at New Horizons one of the guards stopped me as they stated they had to search my bags for any contraband. As they finished their search one of them commented how cool this stuff was. I gave him a nod making my way deeper inside the complex until I was right outside of Jeremiah’s room. The door was wide open and rapping my knuckles against the steel door seemed to get his attention. Placing the bags gently on his desk piqued his curiosity and as he opened them it was as if he was a kid on Christmas morning. He took each of the contents out of the bag carefully examining each of them as if they were an undiscovered treasure. 

“Are you sure about letting me borrow these things for a while?” asking as he studied the back of one of the novels. 

Giving a slight shrug I responded “Actually, if you wanted to keep these you could. I have a big enough collection as it is.”

This seemed to trigger a reaction in him as if a dam had burst as he looked at me not as some intruder in his home. Now because of this simple gesture Jeremiah now considered me as a comrade in arms as we shared a common love. We both loved horror and loved being scared by things rational and irrational. And when I say irrational the chances of either giant mutant spiders or zombies rising from the grave are highly unlikely. 

The rest of that session was a mix of going over some of the items that I had given him to talking about favorite movies that we loved. Even going into some situations that kids might get into such as “who would win in a fight Freddy or Jason?” With around ten minutes to go and turning to him to announce our time was almost up a question was asked that I would forever regret.

“How did you come to be in New Horizons?”

His demeanor shifted from his current happy go lucky self to when I had first met him. A broken, disheveled form of a man as he looked at me with something that rivaled a thousand yard stare. Jeremiah then looked at the clock and scowled before responding. 

“Meet me next week and I’ll tell you how I wound up here.” 

My mind went blank trying to find the words to say and failing miserably as I got up and left without saying a word. Even the day had changed from bright and sunny to gray and overcast to match my mood. Getting into my car and starting the drive home was spent in silence pondering how to undo the damage that was inflicted on today’s session. Jeremiah could go back to being a recluse and if that were the case it would be a lost cause as no one else would be assigned to him. Eventually he would be phased out of the program and thrust back onto the streets and might be picked up by either this or another program.

Rinse. Repeat.

There was a part of me dreading my next session with Jeremiah and at one point part of me wanted to quit. My parents encouraged me to make the right decision as this was beyond going to a great college. It was helping out someone. My actions could help Jeremiah become a better person and with this renewed determination I could not wait until Saturday. 

Eventually the day came and I made sure to get there a little early, eager to hear his story. The drive there felt shorter accompanied by a lead foot and running a few yellow lights to make it to the facility in half the time. My fast pace had gotten me outside his room almost a half an hour early where he was sitting at the same table last week. Jeremiah looked up at me with a pained smile and offered me a seat across from him. 

“Alright you wanted to know my story? Fine. Here it is. But I have one condition.”

“And that is?” asking inquisitively

“You can believe it or not that’s up to you but please don’t interrupt me until I am finished. Do we have a deal?” he extended his hand

Grasping his hand firmly sealed the deal, the iron grip betraying his frail appearance as he started his story. 

“Living on the streets people take you at face value. If you wear ragged clothes, dig through garbage for food and panhandle for change then you’re a bum. However, when people look at me they never consider where I came from or how did I get here. You wouldn’t know by looking that at one point had eight figures in my bank account. My parents were always struggling to make life for me as joyful as possible with my father even working two jobs to keep us all comfortable. High school was spent getting my grades to near perfect levels as any time for socializing or after school programs were all out of the question. One of my happiest days was getting a letter of acceptance from a college stating that I was chosen for their scholarship program.”

“During my second semester of college my cell phone woke me up at an ungodly hour. It was the police to inform me that my parents had perished in a house fire. I was crushed as all that was loved was taken away from me in an instant. My family’s insurance along with a decent settlement from a furnace company gave me a nice little nest egg. Later that year two of my friends approached me with a lucrative business deal. They asked me if I wanted to be on the ground floor of this opportunity. Part of me wondered what would have happened if this opportunity passed me by. Would my future be different? Or what if this business failed?”

Sighing, he took a second and looked out the grimy window. 

“Of course it was an overnight success. My small nest egg grew to eight figures almost overnight. Do you have any idea what it's like to grow up struggling and then have a life changing amount in your bank account? It was as if a switch had been thrown that anything in the world could be mine. Bills and outstanding debts were wiped away in a matter of minutes as the majority of the money was sunk into various investments. A house was bought in one of the neighborhoods that surrounded Atlanta and after that was bought I dropped out of college the same day. Thankfully, my house came furnished so just a few finishing touches was all that it needed to turn it into a home. Being retired at the age of twenty four, owning my own home and having disposable income to do whatever came to mind freed me. However, part of me had no passion about any one subject or field.”

Jeremiah smiled as he recalled this part of this story

“It was late one night scouring the cable channels for something to watch and that’s when it appeared. A story about four survivors trying to take over a mall from flesh eating ghouls as the story and the gore intrigued me. After the movie was over it was nearly 2am it was as if a switch was flipped and a hunger welled up inside me that knew no bounds. From that point forward horror became my drug of choice as I started to consume all I could. Books, movies and even podcasts were the first phase however, part of me wanted and needed more. Searching the web looking for conventions and events flights were booked and experiences were had. In fact after watching Evil Dead 2 a few days prior there’s a picture of me somewhere of myself and Bruce Campbell strangling each other. There were even things that were borderline illegal such as breaking into abandoned cemeteries and holding a séance or going into the infamous MckAmey Manor. That experience pushed me to my breaking point as it wasn’t even a haunted house. It felt as if it was borderline torture as things were done to me that pushed me way out of my comfort zone.”

Jeremiah stood as he stretched walking around the room his eyes darting around as if looking for something out of place. 

“When I was in Texas after visiting an amazing haunt called Thrillvania one of my friends came up to me and asked me what was up? Now don’t get me wrong this place was great but suddenly my heart wasn’t in it anymore. Part of me wanted something new to experience raw terror without the point of death. My friend Chris grinned at me and nodded saying that he knew what I needed but it wasn’t cheap. A new drug was on the black market named HT-STPR (or Heart Stopper) and it promised to give nightmarish hallucinations that people could hear, see and even feel. At that point money wasn’t an objection asking how much for a single dose.”

Chris grinned at me “$500,000 as this drug is highly experimental.” 

Jeremiah slumped in his chair almost looking defeated as his voice was barely a whisper on the next sentence. 

“Of course my dumbass arranged to get four vials of the stuff delivered to me.”

He straightened up as he looked at me dead in the eye with a cold stare. 

“The drug came in four vials and thinking that I could cheat the system sent off one to a high grade lab in order to clone the formula. That failed as there were a few unidentifiable elements that showed up in the lab work and without those missing pieces the drug would fail to work. There were also strict written rules on how to get the best experience such as either bound to a hospital bed or locked in a room. So I shelled out another five grand to get a hospital room for the night and had a nurse administer the drug.”

Jeremiah shivered as he looked at the floor and continued his tale. 

“It was a rush. At first there was nothing and then I felt myself moving around and running away from a horde of the undead. The world had gone to hell and it was as if I was on the set of the Walking Dead. This wasn’t like the times where I went to haunts or other attractions where there were limits to what the actors could do. My legs ached from running as air burned in my lungs from the effort. This drug would play off all five senses so the immersion into these hallucinations. After what seemed like hours the illusions would begin to fade and everything would go back to normal. Sleep, believe it or not came easy and the next day I was convinced that a zombie bit me and looked for bite marks. None were found.”

His voice quivered as he struggled to go on.

“Then I got the bright idea to go ahead and start a movie while being on this drug in order to influence the trip. In the mouth of madness played on a TV that was fixed over my hospital bed and in a matter of moments my body was ripped from the bed. The world was a hybrid of our own normal architecture fused with cities that housed old, dead gods. Even the inhabitants ranged from vaguely humanoid monsters to things that even now I could not describe. At first these constructs just ignored me until this one being seemed to glare at me and then announced my presence with an unholy shriek.”

Jeremiah looked actually panicked as he retold this part of the story. 

“It was like a chase scene from an old action movie that seemed to go on forever. Run up to the top of a building, jump to the next one and run downwards. Eventually these things cornered me in an alley however, before they even got to me the drug’s effects started to wear off and the visions faded. Nurses rushed in as my dumbass was laughing hysterically as they had to restrain and sedate me. After two days I came out of whatever drug induced hell that trip put me through. This would be the point in the story where normal people would take their losses and their six million dollars and be happy.” 

He grimaced and shook his head

“I was stupid. I funneled all my money into researching that drug to find out where it came from, the genetic makeup of what ingredients it could be, etc. It wasn’t even a year before most of my money was gone so I sold my house, packed up my things and moved back here. The reason for this is the last trip this drug gave me was not only amazing. But it almost killed me.” 

Chuckling nervously, Jeremiah recounted his last trip with HT-STPR.

“Deciding to repeat my last trip my dumbass decided to go with another movie. This time it was a classic being the original Friday the 13th. The trip announced my arrival on a weathered, old school bus that was also packed with screaming kids. Getting off the bus I was quickly introduced to the counselors that this would be a summer not to forget. The day was spent watching kids, preparing meals and having a few of the female counselors getting frisky with us. Everything was great until the sun went down and they retold the legend of camp Crystal Lake.”

Jeremiah stood for the last part as he started to pace back and forth. 

“The counselors started to pair off and go their separate ways as people tend to do in a horror movie. A cute young girl by the name of Marcie took me over to her cabin and surprisingly it was empty except for the two of us. We removed our clothes exploring each other's bodies as we started to make love. Once we reached the peaks of our mutual pleasure all I remember was a sharp pain in my chest as the tip of a hunting knife emerged from my chest. Letting out an ear splitting scream of anguish, the last thought in my mind was of medical staff yelling out a bunch of commands before fading into darkness.”

He looked at me, gripping my shoulders as his face was only an inch from mine. I could smell his rotten teeth hitting me in the face like garbage from a landfill. 

“A few days later the road to a long recovery had started. It was a month or so of rigorous treatment to get me back to a point where it showed on paper that my vitals were healthy. That was it for me. Any money that was leftover was immediately consumed as everything was lost in this pursuit of this drug. After being on HT-STPR no other drug could even come close to matching that high although it didn’t stop me from trying. And no one ever knew where it came from whether it was from some mad chemist who died after he perfected it or a clandestine branch of the US government. All I know is this drug was nothing but trouble and if someone ever offers this to you just tell them no. Trust me you’ll be better off for it.”

Jeremiah slowly moved towards his bed looking like a bitter and frail old man. This signified that the conversation was over and all he wanted to do was rest. Part of me wanted to say some comforting words however, none came and I left him be. When the director approached me asking how things went with today’s session the words leapt from my lips as if it was the truth.

“We made some progress today as Jeremiah told me about how he got to where he was. He confided in me and shared things he hadn’t told anyone in ages. Part of me thinks that he is on the road to recovery and in a few months he can be an outstanding citizen once again.”

That’s the lie my brain told myself and while wanting to believe it part of me knew what was going to happen next. The rest of that weekend was spent in a fog wondering what was going to happen to him. Trying to lose myself in my various distractions didn’t help and the rest of the week was split between schools and trying to quell the feelings of dread in the pit of my stomach. When Saturday rolled around part of me knew what was going on before going inside New Horizons. 

Running up the steps the security guard met me at the front door as if to impede my progress.

“Hold on, if you’re here to see Jeremiah he checked himself out of the program early this week.”

My heart hurt as this gentleman told me his life story and then just ran out on someone that was trying to help him. Thanking the security guard I rushed back to my car and started to look for him. Even being brave enough to go into some neighborhoods that even the cops hated patrolling. As the sun began to dip down towards the horizon the realization hit me that Jeremiah left and did not want to be found. 

Upon arriving home my parents asked me what happened and through tears I recounted my story. They hugged me as my mom understood that it was the end of me working for New Horizons. And that was that as my application was accepted by a local university and the next four years were spent in pursuit of a degree that was never used. After graduating a firm approached me offering me an entry level position and I graciously accepted. The job turned into a very lucrative career as negotiations are ongoing to purchase my first house. 

A few days ago something happened that keeps me up at night. My mind has been reeling wondering how this parcel found its way to me. This should have been impossible as in the past eight years I have moved THREE times. The parcel was delivered by a small courier service that asked me to sign and did so as my mind was on autopilot. 

The parcel was a padded envelope and there was something wrapped in layers of bubble wrap. Nestled deep within the layers of plastic was a vial of clear liquid and a label that had several characters on it. 

HT-STPR2

Included in the envelope was a plain sheet of white paper with instructions on how to administer the drug. Turning the paper over foolishly and seeing what was written on the back makes me stare at this vial and wondering if I should toss it out or take the drug.

I’ve contacted all the teachers at my school in the relevant departments (hoping to major in econ or poli sci) asking if they know of any internships but none of them have. They said that they’ve talked to a couple of teachers as well as contacted our co-op board and will let me know ASAP. The only “hope” I have as of now is hoping that a professor can take me on for an internship but I’m not sure if that would be possible and if it is… how I should go about it hence my question. 

Should I try contacting professors in universities local to me with experience relevant to my intended major, wait for my teachers to ~potentially~ get back to me, or just stick with my co-op? Also, does anyone have any situations where a professor took on a high school student?"

I'm going to be an undergrad junior in the fall, but I can't take upper levels til next winter because I only started CS coursework last Fall (premed freshman year). I have an internship with cybersecurity at a non-tech company (with a tech internship program)  this summer, but I got to final interview with a FAANG company earlier this year (but bombed it because I got a question on binary trees, at which point I hadn't even learned about pointers or linked lists). After that rejection, I kept looking for other positions but didn't hear back at all (so maybe the FAANG interview process was a fluke). Outside of classwork and a computational bio internship, I don't have any experience with software dev, and I have no clue what Dev/Ops or Full Stack or Front/Back end even means (though I think I could just google that lol). I just feel like a tiny fish in a huge pond.

I know C++ a good amount (that's what my classes are taught in) and at my current job I use Python. I learned Java in high school and I can use R for statistical programming. What additional skills should I develop? Are there are any project ideas that I could take on over the summer (couple hours on weekends/after work)  that will make my resume stand out and my portfolio less barren? I want the internship search to be different next summer, and I want to go in feeling confident that I'll breeze past the initial resume reviews.

It was so difficult and challenging especially when you’re in a new country while the rest of your family is in a different country. Decided to take a certification program at UCLA extension just to make my resume look good. Then some drama last week, about my cousin talking shit behind my back saying I should find a job and stop being unemployed (cue Paris Hilton telling poor people to stop being poor) and more relatives drama basically painting me as someone taking advantage of my student status (my parents abroad are supporting my studies and agreed I can do full time student during pandemic). Furious, I applied to multiple jobs but this time, I focused on putting my digital marketing credentials and previous marketing internship as a relevant experience (it was only for 3 months) and lo and behold, I got a job as a social media marketing associate!! I tried so hard applying to marketing jobs with a finance background but also, the market seems to be pretty optimistic now compared to months ago. Plus the fact I am finishing a certification helped so much in landing this job. It has full benefits too so I’m happy! So to my fellow job seekers looking for a job and coming from a different field, definitely look at your resume.

My problem mainly stems from the fact that I feel that I don't really have the skills that most companies are looking for due to some off-kilter experience.

As for why that is: I actually did a dual degree in Computer Science and Engineering Physics (EP first, then started CS in 3rd year). This was partially because EP has few job prospects unless you're going into research or are gung-ho about space (which I am not), and partially because I wanted to get an internship through the CS department's internship program (which worked out, thankfully). Throughout these degrees, my accumulated experience amounts to 3 summers of research writing data analysis code for radar and satellite data (with 2 papers published with co-author credits) and a 16-month internship writing image analysis code for a university group that was half research group and half startup company (its weird). As for projects, I was focused on my classes, so my projects mainly stem from them: a Python simulator to recreate the results of a networking paper, a mechanical device for rotating tiny samples in a vacuum chamber (for the EP degree's final-year project), and other small things that recruiters likely wouldn't care about like a dead-simple stepper motor driver.

As a result, I don't seem to mesh well with most entry-level software development positions. I don't have any web-dev experience, whether front, back, or full-stack (despite the image analysis code being made for a web-app; I just didn't write much non-analysis stuff for the backend codebase, which was mostly Python, Django, and an abuse of ElasticSearch as a database). Embedded and IOT stuff seem interesting to me, but they seem to require hardcore C/C++ experience that I don't have plus a bunch of other weird skills that I've not have encountered before. Cloud and database stuff is also interesting, but they similarly have high requirements that I can't really meet. It seems that all I could really do is data analysis, but I'd much rather be a software developer and not be pigeonholed into just analysis, even with substantial coding involved.

And so, I haven't applied to as many places as I should have so far. I've gotten 1 interview, but only because a friend of a friend (/my supervisor for my internship) gave me a referral to a popular local company with Master's level AI people also applying to it. I just don't know what positions I qualify for or should apply to. I don't know how I can convince recruiters and companies that I could easily learn and do embedded, or cloud, or web development with what is largely analysis experience. I don't know how I can spin my mish-mash of experience into a full-time software development position.

Job: Software Engineering Intern

Salary: $28/hr + $3000 housing stipend

Location: Lynchburg, VA (on-site)

Description: Ill be working with embedded software in radios.

Company: Mitre

Job: Cybersecurity Engineering Intern

Salary: $27

Location: Chantilly, VA (remote)

Description: computer forensics, software analysis, malware analysis, reverse engineering.

To me, the Mitre role seems super interesting and I think I will learn a lot about cybersecurity (which is my focus at school). I always wanted to be more of a software engineer but I think this opportunity is really cool and I'd be working on some interesting projects. The only downside is that they are paying me a dollar less. 

L3's role in my opinion seemed a little boring and outdated. I personally don't care for embedded software too much and would rather work on more innovative projects. The other thing is I will be working onsite in Lynchburg. They are, however, paying me a little more. 

Please let me know what you guys think. I think Mitre's job description seems a lot cooler but if anyone has insight on either of these companies, let me know."

- my twin is EDing to Penn for sure and idk if I want to go to the same school as him? he’s going for Wharton tho so I guess we won’t see each other idk... any advice from twins lol?

I think I’ve got some of those (very good academic transcript at the moment + an engineering scholarship + an academic award from yr. 12), volunteer work on Saturdays, and co-curriculars and leadership including clubs and societies (committee member, ambassador for my faculty at uni, and mentoring high school students in an engineering mentoring program).

How should I approach internship applications and writing cover letters?

My school doesn't offer any data analytics classes within my major, currently, I'm in a marketing research class but it's very basic statistics that are all done with a program.

Recently I finished a digital marketing certification through Google. I was looking into data analytics certification (a sea of them), some are very expensive, my school offers a duo that would come out to over $4,000. While researching, the general consensus is that I should spend my time/money learning SQL, Phyton, Excel(pivot tables/VLookup) instead of a broad data analytics cert.

Does anybody have any advice? I think the best thing is experience but to gain that experience it looks like ill have to invest time into myself after class.

I'm hoping to have these in my back pocket so I can look for an internship which will have to be during my Senior year since I'm taking summer classes.

(I bought SQL and Phyton Bootcamp courses through Udemy for $50 total just as a starter and have linked learning through my school in which I'm taking an excel certification)"
n5vgr8,1,2021-05-05,How can an older worker going back to CS find a position?,throwRA_hardened,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n5vgr8/how_can_an_older_worker_going_back_to_cs_find_a/,"I recently spoke to a woman in her 40s or 50s who would like to go back to work after two decades of not being in the workforce. She worked for the US army as a programmer before she had kids, but took a long time off to raise them. Just talking to her I could tell she was quick, conscientious, and would learn fast, but she doesn't know current frameworks in depth. (For reference, she learned COBOL in college.) She's also looking for flexible or part-time hours, so that she can be home for her kids. She'd be happy to do a trial period or internship first. 

I think there are a lot of companies that would like to hire people like this - not FAANG perhaps, but smaller companies who would want someone smart and with life experience, and are willing to train a new employee in their specific technologies. But we weren't sure how to reach such companies.  Does anyone have experience finding jobs that would fit this profile? Where would you look?

(If you would like to hire such a worker in the NY area or remotely, PM me!)"

n5w6d6,2,2021-05-05,"Offered FT job 1 year before graduation -- Accept and potentially renege, or decline?",FerdaBoyss,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n5w6d6/offered_ft_job_1_year_before_graduation_accept/,"Hi everyone!

I got offered a full-time SWE position for a mid-to-high tier US based tech company, at one of their Canadian offices. The TC is pretty good for a Canadian new grad position and it is a company I would enjoy working for and has good learning and growth opportunities. 

However, the TC does not compare to that of high tier US tech companies, and is also less than that which the US offices for this company offers. I know people say cost-of-living is different but the Canadian office is located in one of the most expensive cities in North America (and I'm also 'meh' about the prospect of living there). Furthermore, I still have 1 year left before graduation and still have 1 more internship left to complete as part of my degree so I'm still quite ambitious on aiming for a better offer at a higher tier company -- which I believe is achievable given my recent internship experience at the company who gave me the FT offer.

So my question to ya'll is, would you simply decline the offer (the ethical choice) or accept the offer with the intent of reneging if something better comes along in that year before graduating? 

P.S. I know there's a faq on reneging offers, but I think my situation may be somewhat nuance in that I haven't yet accepted the offer on the table..."

n5wyox,5,2021-05-05,"How long can it take to get an entry level position with a undergraduate degree, but with little knowledge?",Imaginesafety,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/n5wyox/how_long_can_it_take_to_get_an_entry_level/,"I graduate in a couple of weeks with a Bachelor of Science in Informatics/Data Analytics. My motivation has been close to zero since pivoting to online school, and I'm not sure what my best options are. 

I've had experience with Python, KNIME, R, Excel, SQL, and some web development languages like HTML and CSS. However, these were limited to the classroom in situations where the teaching wasn't very immersive. It was kind of just ""do this assignment"" and move on; no synchronous teaching. The teaching only became a problem for me when we switched to online. I understand the future may require a lot more remote work so it's no excuse, but a combination of our school not being prepared for remote learning, and my father passing took a huge toll on me mentally. I lost so much motivation.

Anyways, I have not retained almost any information and I realize how fucked I am. Everytime I find the will to self teach courses I've already purchased on Udemy, I'm reminded of the mountain of class work, and internship work I need to complete. I do have free time afterwards, but my brain is usually too fried at that point to do anything that involves hard thinking. I have maintained a 3.5 GPA overall, and 3.8 in my major if it's worth anything, but I have no technical skills to complement it.

After graduating, if I force myself to at least get the basics of some of these programming languages down again; could I get lucky enough to find an entry position in my field due to my degree? Right now I'm focused on re-learning/improving my Python, SQL, and Excel skills. The courses are already purchased, but I don't know if I'll be wasting my time. 

Alternatively, I thought I could go to grad school to give myself more time to learn. Data Science honestly looks too rigorous for me, and I don't think I'd qualify. My other interest, Cybersecurity, seems to require a lot of programming experience I haven't yet used, along with it being recommended to share past projects just to get into the program I'm looking at. There's also Information Science, but I'm not sure how useful that would be. I messed up big time, any advice?"

What should I do?,HUGEEBALLS,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n5x94m/impostor_syndrome_kickingin_what_should_i_do/,"TLDR; Getting recommendations about summer internship, and was emailed twice about it. Not sure, what to do. 

I don’t just have impostor syndrome, but I feel my grades and my resume makes me feel insignificant and impossible. It is the barrier to securing any internships. This one is from one of the FAANG companies. 

So, I got a recommendation of Google Internship through my uni. I brushed it off, as I assumed it was they sent it to all other students as well. It mentioned. “I found your details when looking for students who might be a good match for our Summer 2022 Software Engineering Internship!” (I had given my details earlier)

But, when I got the second email. I thought, I could do something about it, instead of letting it slide off. It mentioned, ““I sent you an email a few days ago and wanted to see if you were interested in Google's Software Engineering internship.”

I know I will very likely be rejected, but I want to atleast attempt my way to present myself for this internship opportunity. I don’t want to be turned down because of my grades, that would exacerbate my impostor syndrome. 

My GPA is around 2.3, but my interest in tech, is often much outside the classroom and grades. I would say I have a fair knowledge about tech, from the YouTube videos I watch. I know it is unlikely but should I contact the representative and talk or not do and skip it. Emailing the representative would help me better represent myself then my terrible GPA and transcript. I had re-done couple of classes, because I have failed them. And the pandemic put a major hit to my GPA. I want to capitalize on the very slim chance of trying for an internship. I wouldn’t want my GPA to be the sole reason decision of my rejection

I have no degree, and I've only worked in retail. I have a few projects in my portfolio, but if I'm going to be completely honest I feel as though my skill level is very much internship level. Nevertheless, I hate my job and the CS job hunt for internships has been  rough. I'm getting desperate as I want to quit my job and get into the field soon. So I have put together a few options and I would like to get some opinions as to which course of action I should take:

1. Programming Bootcamp (will have to be remote due to my location)- Pros: Networking, certification, refine my skills, access to teachers for questions, they will likely improve my chances of getting hired at a high paying job. Cons: Expensive, lengthy, no guarantee of job quickly, I will have to put up with my current job for about another year.
2. Unpaid Internship- Pros: Networking, experience with interviews, work experience to put on a resume, real experience with programming within an organization, access to higher level devs for questions, I could possibly graduate to a paid position? Cons: Unpaid, no guarantee of graduating to paid position, experience on resume still may not be enough for future job hunt.

What do, frens?"
n5yvs5,3,2021-05-06,Internships - 2 x 3 month internships or 1 x 6 month internship?,chinggyy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n5yvs5/internships_2_x_3_month_internships_or_1_x_6/,"Hi everyone,

I currently have a predicament. I can undertake either 

1. 1 x unpaid 4 month internship subject (jul-oct), and 1 x paid 3 month internship (dec-feb) or...
2. 1 x 6 month paid internship (jul-dec)
3. 3 month internship (dec-feb)

Option 1 is a subject offered by the university and is likely to be undertaken at a startup. Since it's offered by the university, it is legally able to be an unpaid internship. I will likely have to work 3 x per week for 4 months, whilst concurrently completing 3 subjects. After this subject, I will likely have another internship secured over the summer holidays (in Aus) at a reputable company.

Option 2 is basically working full time for 6 months at another reputable company, therefore it will be difficult to study on the side and I will need to defer university by 6 months.

Option 3 is just the 3 month internship from option 1 - is one internship sufficient/competitive?

Which would be preferable and increase my chances of getting a good full time job? 

Is it worth deferring my graduation for experience?

Thank you!"

I majored in Mathematics with a focus in Computer Science from NC State. Upon graduating I had experience with C, C++, and mostly Java. I didn’t work on personal projects and I didn’t practice Leetcode. I had one internship that I got by networking over Xbox Live where I didn’t write a single line of code all summer, mainly just did IT support, systems administration, and some simple automation with Microsoft Flow. I I didn’t have any database experience with SQL or anything else, had no experience with APIs or any front end development. I had two offers, one with the company I interned with l, as a data analyst, and one with the company I signed with, as a software developer. There was no code interview, only a somewhat technical screening asking what languages and technologies I was familiar with, projects I had worked on, things of that nature. I interviewed really well just by keeping my composure and keeping a lighthearted mood. 

My point in all this? Not to bash myself, but I was pretty underprepared, and I still got the job. You don’t have to hit a home run with your first job out of school at a FAANG or big tech company. I read all the talk in here and on other forums about how hard code interviews were and how much everyone was practicing Leetcode, and I let it worry me. Try not to. Have some faith, things will work out the way they’re supposed to. Try not to compare yourself to everyone else. Not all interviews are the same, not all companies have the same expectations. There are jobs out there, you just have to find them. Both of the companies I applied at, I got interviews with. Have some faith in yourself, you guys are awesome. I hope this helps anyone who is super stressed with interviews or finding a job."

I got into some pretty good colleges but got waitlisted at all my top choices. 

Truthfully speaking, this is not me trying to be pretentious or arrogant, I'm just not happy and I really don't know why. 

I got waisted at Stanford and 4 ivies for Engineering.  ( I'm international )

I've committed to CMU Engineering. I know it's one of the best engineering schools in the world but I really wanted an 'ivy' or just more prestige idk what. 

Like I worked my ass off. From the past 4 years I've been the top of my class. Rank 1 ! And I'm not boasting, but it was really difficult. I got a perfect score on SAT subject tests in phy, chem and math. Got a 35 on my act. Got 5/5 on 8 APs. Excelled in national Olympiads, AMC, AIME and even international spelling bee competitions. I'm an avid debater, public speaking enthusiast and have numerous leadership achievements. I'm the head boy of a school with 5000+ students, have started 3 clubs ( founder and president ) and have practically taken the hardest courses I could. 


 Did amazing research. Had 3 internships. I am also a national swimmer and play for my state's soccer team. I had stellar recommendations , poured my heart out on my essays and am not even applying for any aid. 

I did everything I could. There was nothing else left to do. It just feels bad. My friends and teachers all just look sad at CMU. They see the college ranking on US news and it's around 25-26. They're like : We expected you to get into the top 15 atleast. I'm trying to explain to everyone that it's perhaps the best school for engineering and an amazing fit but still I feel sad. 

Please don't take this as a shitpost or me trying to be pretentious. These are just my true feelings and if I'm wrong, please help correct me. It'll be appreciated. 

I'm just not happy. Any tips besties?"

I'm very traditional when it comes to schooling and the workforce. You need to get an internship first and then you can get a job.

I hope everyone is having a splendid day. I come to you all in need of some feedback and advice in regards to what you believe I may have been doing wrong in my job search process. I graduated last year in August, and have been looking for jobs since September.

Fortunately, I was able to secure a few interviews in which I felt that I did well as an Entry Level candidate however, after a few days of each of them, I would wake up to rejection emails suggesting that I did not have enough work experience or, an email directly from the interviewer suggesting that they found a candidate who had at least 1-2 years of experience more than me. 

I did two internships during the summer after my sophomore and junior year (2nd went on for 6 months until Covid hit and I got laid off - FML) however, they had a hiring freeze throughout 2020 and I received a rejection that went along the lines of the context I mentioned in the previous paragraph.

Throughout the past few months, I've just been depressed after receiving countless rejections, however, I did prepare myself for it, as the times are very difficult due to covid, but the impact of rejections was inevitable as it took a toll on my mental health. 

This past week, I gathered myself and have been putting in the maximum effort towards job search in hopes of success. I have been working in a startup part-time to maintain my visa status as I am an international student which I feel has provided me some valuable experience that I can now bring into my resume. 

Yesterday, I was considering exploring different paths/fields with my Computer Science knowledge and experience such as Salesforce Development and Data Analysis but I am a little misguided in regards to them and would appreciate any guidance that anyone may have.

I would also be grateful if you had any feedback or recommendations in regards to how I should up my game in job search and practicing interview questions on leetcode. I am a small Liberal Arts College grad who's looking for any sort of opportunity. Harsh feedback is welcome as well. Thank you for your time!

TL;DR: 2020 Grad still unemployed seeking guidance in job search and exploring other paths."

I am pursuing a software engineering bachelor's degree and am currently in my second year. As part of the programme I have to hold an internship position for at least 16 weeks.

I am currently in the third week of the internship and goddamn I feel so useless here. The tasks assigned to me by my supervisor feel so out of my league. I had to submit some pretty lousy work and it's making me feel extremely guilty. Just now I had to tell him I really couldn't do one of the tasks he gave to me and I felt like I just hit a new low. 

I should be learning and helping out the main team but at this point I feel like I am really slowing them down. A lot of the program I had to write here are done in languages that I have no prior experience with so I had to spend a lot of time just looking up the basics of the programming language itself. I have been skipping lunch these few days just so I can spend more time working but in the end I still end up with some shitty work instead.

I finished my internship (6 months) and got an offer from them to be a full-stack developer. I'm currently employed at said startup but now I want to quit.

I have always been a self-learner. When I got the internship, I didn't even know Ruby but I was familiar with other programming languages. During the internship, they taught me barely anything and I had to self-learn everything to deliver. They threw me immediately into the codebase and gave me problems to solve. Sure they made me do one learning project but I also didn't get any guidance while doing it. And when I showed them the project, it barely got reviews. Almost no feedback. I don't think they even read the code. At the time, I was really just happy I got myself employed and I didn't know any better.

After a few months, I was able to make a lot of contributions. That continued throughout the internship which is why they hired me as a full-stack developer. At the end of the internship, I was hesitant to work for them because I didn't get any guidance (I realized at the end) but I took the offer because didn't want to be unemployed.

Fast forward to now, I'm burnt out and I feel like I'm not learning anything new. My growth has stagnated. They also make a lot of things complicated because of poor architectural decisions (which I get into a lot of debates about, but even If I prove my point, it's their implementation that I have to implement anyway because they said so and they're the boss).

They're not bad people but they make work so stressful and also I feel like I'm not growing. That's why I've been thinking about quitting for months now.

I don't think I can wait til the contract ends. I want to quit now. But should I?"
n65yvi,1,2021-05-06,Should change my job? Am I missing something by not leaving from here?,-daniel--,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/n65yvi/should_change_my_job_am_i_missing_something_by/,"Short Question:

I have been working for my current employer since 2016. I started as an IT intern. They paid for my tuition, so I had a contract with them to work till 2022. The contract ends soon, and I am not sure if I should continue work here or explore other companies. I don't have any problems here. I kinda like to work here but what if I am missing a big opportunity by not leaving this job.

Long Question:

Before I start with a long answer, whatever I am mentioning here I am not doing it to brag about it. I am mentioning this information because I want genuine opinions from you all, and I want you to know all the parameters to the puzzle.

I started working at XYZ company in October 2016 as an IT intern. In December 2016, they liked  my skills and talents and decided to pay for my Bachelors and Masters schooling. In return, I have to work for them for 3 more years after I graduate. XYZ company paid about $20,000 for my Bachelors and $30,000 for my Masters. I started my Bachelors in Aug 2014 and graduated with Master’s degree in May 2019. In signed contract, we also mentioned how much they will pay me. In 2016, they were paying me $17.50 per hour, 2017: $20 per hour, 2018: $22.50 per hour, 2019: $25 per hour, 2020 and now: $27.50 per hour.

I don't know, but I was/am really grateful for all the assistance they provided. Over all, I was a happy employee. I graduated with no student loan.

In addition to my Master’s degree, I also have Google Cloud Certified Professional Cloud Architect, AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate, AWS Certified Security - Specialty, and Azure 300 Architect Technologies. Also, I am always working on getting new certifications. If you are in IT, you will probably know these certifications can land six-figure salary.

Furthermore, my job is pretty stress-free. When I get work I get a lot, but that doesn't last for long. Some days, I spend my entire day watching TV shows (My supervisor knows about it). My colleagues are friendly.

The only downside is the company doesn't have good benefits. Currently, I just have 2 weeks paid work off. No 401K match. Expensive insurance.

Couple months ago, I had a meeting with XYZ company's owner. They wanted to ask me if I want to continue next year after the contract expires and what I am expecting my Salaries to be. In addition to that, they also mentioned that when Vice President of IT retires, they want me to have his position. The VP still has 10-12 years to retire. I know the company is small, so I gave them a number which they can afford it. I told them that I am expecting $85,000 to $90,000 a year and $85,000 will be the lowest I will be able to do. They said it could be doable for them, and they will talk more in detail about this later. When they do, I decided to also mention them about yearly increments. I am expecting 5% increments every year, some increment in my paid work off days and if possible little share from Sales commission because the Marketing team is heavily dependent on the software integration I developed for them.

They might agree to my offer, or they might not. But I am not sure if I should continue to work for them. I have never worked at a different company. This was my first ever professional job. Should I make it my last by continue working there? What if there is a big opportunity out there waiting for me to leave this job? I did talk to my friends and family. Some say I should continue working here and other says I should explore. I am super confused. I would like to know your opinion."

**Additional Info**

I don't know why I got rejected, maybe the lack of SAT/ACT score, or perhaps it's just the unpredictability of this process. While keeping in mind my background, I kept my expectations realistic, but I was still confident that at least one top college would accept me. The comments on [my chance me post](https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/k2l7md/chance_me_duke_ed/) were also very positive. Nevertheless, my deferral and waitlists indicate that I have the potential to be in one of those colleges, so next year, I will apply again with a more solid and well-tuned application.

**I decided to take a gap year! What I will be doing differently:**

* Get a high score in SAT/ ACT.
* Get a high score in TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo.
* Apply to more colleges in the early round.
* Spend more time on essays.
* I got a sports-tech internship in Munich! I will be going in July if COVID allows. Another great EC."

Currently college requires an internship to graduate but I've been applying since February and still no luck.

I've been applying to unpaid internships so I could at least get experience and learn more but so far it's gets overfilled fast. I've been trying to get internship in sophomore year but during Covid a lot of companies canceled the internships so there wasn't any luck.

College wasn't exactly helpful because they had to deal with more than half students who didn't manage to find internship. 

Managed to get accepted to the internship but the found out that it's isn't suitable for college requirements. 

I'm mostly good at Java and React Native. So there weren't a lot of positions suited for me.
I've been applying to internships that was available to me. I get passed at CV screening and even do good at the interviews but sometimes I get really anxious at technical questions that I almost forget everything only after the interview I realize how that I could have done so much better answering those questions since then I've been studying questions about algorithms more. 

I also get take home assigments but sometimes it's either the college assignment deadline or I have to learn new language and framework to do the assigments. Once I have given assigment to the algorithm that didn't exist (at least when I tried to find mathematical formula in scholar.google.com). Other time I managed to complete the assigment and build a Springboot backend but the company replied that I didn't do the requirements that wasn't listed in their task. 

Perhaps I wasn't exactly dedicated to the programming as my peers were, since I was also busy with my second hobby? 

Previous semester I've had to take 7 classes (In Lithuania you can't select how many classes per semester you should take) so I didn't have time to built my portfolio though I have college assignment in github but I don't think that's enough. 

Currently I just feel hopelessness and tired. Though I will be applying to more companies before I would have to take an academic leave perhaps then I would have time to make portfolio.

I would like to hear suggestions on where else I could apply to and what else I could work on."

I am currently in my final year of highschool, year 13 and will hopefully be going to university this September, granted I meet the entry requirements. This university, which is quite prestigious, is known for the internship opportunities it provides as well as the large international student body it has. Whilst I am going to stay in accomodation in my first year, it is less than an hours drive from my house. This scares me as I believe it could potentially inhibit me from living a 'freer' life due to the fear that my parents can literally stop me with ease. Idk, maybe I'm being naïve to think that my parents can realistically have autonomy over me once I go to uni, but they have definitely instilled it into my mindset that their opinions on me matter, out of fear and shame. More importantly though, I am hoping my university experience will give me a springboard to get out of this country and be free from the judgement of my parents and live a happy life and be openly gay. Hiding who I am around my parents has resulted in a decline of my mental health, especially given the fact that I've been aware of my sexuality for years. I cannot recount a single day since I was 10 where I didn't have a suicidal thought, and to be honest it has been eating me up. Has anyone been in a similar situation and gotten out?

**Context**

I’m making a small indie game that is basically a comedy platformer where you play an intern who’s employed as a monster in a video game.

It started as a Ludum Dare game jam where the theme was “You are the monster” and we had this idea where you’re just the basic mob that gets stabbed on the first level. It went really well and had a lot of positive reviews! A few months later me and my friend decided to continue the adventure and make it a real game.

During a game jam you work very fast and the results come quick so you think that actually doing a full game will not take a long time, right? That’s what we thought and we couldn’t be more wrong. We initially thought that the game would take about a year to complete but actually we’re now 4 years deep into it and it’s not even finished yet. But it’s fine because I don’t have a money problem since I’m still employed 4 days a week in the other company (and I love my work there, I still learn a lot of things).

We already rescoped the game 3 times by cutting some chapters and merging others but if you want to do something good, it always takes time no matter what.

**Organizing time**

Eventually everything boils down to how many hours you cram into making your game. Working one day a week plus some time on the weekends is not great so you have to be sure that those hours are the most effective you can have. To boost my productivity I usually think about the design during my free time (before bedtime, during showers, when I’m bored, anytime) so that when I sit in front of my computer on Fridays I know exactly what I have to do which is very motivating. This is where Trello comes handy: everytime I have an idea I immediately write it down so I don’t forget it. The next Friday if I struggle to find something to do, I just open Trello and pick stuff to do from there.

Additionally my friend sometimes comes at my place for the weekend and we work together for 3 days non stop. We usually do about 35 hours on the weekend which is good (we’re not married nor have kids, that helps).

**Using the right tools**

Working as an indie is so different than working in a regular studio, especially when the core team is only 2 people. I’ve been in the game industry for more than 10 years and I’m used to having a strict schedule with deadlines, tasks, JIRA bugs and so on… I really had to reinvent myself as an indie: experiment with tools, try new things and see what works for me. I discovered that I don’t need more than just a text file and a Trello board to write ideas and stuff to do.

**Having multiple roles**

One of the things that I like the most about being part of a very small team is that there’s no clear separation between roles. I’m initially a coder but I’m also doing game design, level design, some sound design and marketing too! I’ve learned so much in 4 years and the more I learn the more I discover new things. For instance I don’t even consider myself an experienced game designer yet and I know I have a lot to learn before claiming that title!

**The tech part**

I’m the only programmer in the team so I have total control over the technical stack and that’s refreshing compared to my corporate job where I sometimes have to deal with dozens of programmers around the world (I’ve worked 5 years on AAA games, clearly not my cup of tea).

It’s a 2D game with some 3D in it but nothing hard so I made my own engine for it in C#. I’m not a fan of using third party engines, especially Unity and its “putting things under the rug” philosophy, I prefer to spend a little more time on low level programming rather than having unexpected bugs that I can’t do anything about.

The engine part clearly took some time but 1) you’re way more productive after it’s done because you know exactly how it works 2) you don’t have to worry about licensing, especially if you’re porting the game to a console which I will probably do, 3) the time that you spend making the engine at the beginning is time that you save at the end of the project because fixing a bug on your engine is so much easier than trying to figure out why the bug happens in an engine that you don’t know (and generally you end up updating the engine which implies having news bugs that you don’t know about).

**Conclusion**

The last four years have been really wild and going indie was the best decision I took in my career :)

Next steps, I finish my game and quit my regular job to go full indie!

I've been looking into internships or entry level jobs but I haven't been too confident in my coding skills. I decided to look for something java related since my school randomly sent me a certificate for it, but I'm not very confident in the skills the school gave me for the language after searching online and seeing a few things and the whole reason I went to school was to help give myself better direction in what skills I should learn since I wasn't sure where to start, my school had me go through lessons on  sql/javascript/html/css/c++  and java.

As far as java is concerned, this is what was taught to me in school:

Chapter 1 How to get started with Java and NetBeans

Chapter 2 Introduction to Java programming

Chapter 3 How to work with data

Chapter 4 How to code control statements

Chapter 5 How to validate input data

Chapter 6 How to test and debug an application

Section 2 Object-oriented programming with Java

Chapter 7 How to define and use classes

Chapter 8 How to work with inheritance

Chapter 9 How to work with interfaces

Chapter 10 Other object-oriented programming skills

Section 3 More Java skills

Chapter 11 How to work with arrays

Chapter 12 How to work with collections and generics

Chapter 13 How to work with dates and strings

Chapter 14 How to handle exceptions

Section 4 GUI programming with Swing

Chapter 15 How to develop a form

Chapter 16 How to work with controls and handle events

Chapter 17 How to develop and deploy applets

Section 5 Data access programming with Java

Chapter 18 How to work with text and binary files

If I wanted a job involving java, what other skills should I learn before looking? or do you think it would be fine for me to apply for entry level/internships in my area? Sorry for the format this is my first reddit post."

I'm in the last year of an MSc in CS at an uni in northern Italy and I'm doing an internship as a data scientist / analyst in a local startup. I'd like to expand my knowledge to data engineering (maybe because lately is hyped and I'm being dragged in) and also get better as a DS. To achieve this goal and also become more competitive in the market, someone suggested to me to get a Microsoft Azure Certification (genuine hint, not sponsored). In particular, I'm referring to fundamentals AZ900. The exam costs 99€, but I'm wondering if there's any university discount or something like that. Maybe some Italian will know. 

More in general, I'd like to know your opinion about this, and your strategy to improve as a data scientist / analyst / engineer. My dream job would be working as this kind of professional in the fintech market.

So far I've worked for 2 years after uni (computer science degree) and the job was not the glamourous thing people probably imagine, but simply adding new features and fixing errors to a 20+-year-old program written for the ministry of Finance that does something-something with some finances. (Delphi)   
Except for the obvious more laid-back and slower pace of working for a government job, I just found naturally that I did the job by sitting down and churning out code for a few hours (let's say until lunch break), hyper-focusing on it, only going to the bathroom when needed and not talking to anyone and there aren't many people to talk with in the first place.  
After that, I felt dead tired and obviously couldn't continue and had to spend half of the day counting the seconds to go home while fiddling with my phone (work computers don't have internet cause government secrets! duh!)  
Now that I have to leave the job in a few months I have the option of going back to my status as a fresh computer science major who has to first spend months learning extra stuff and internships in an *extremely* competitive field before landing the job that I imagine would be those hours I spent per day hyper-focusing on code except a whole 8 hours of that!!!!  (I hope other people from IT can prove me wrong on that one cause I've seen so much of ""you gotta work hard and then stay overtime to work harder and then in your free time you also gotta do extra work to make it in IT!!"" and I simply can't imagine doing what I'm doing for that much hours a day)  
And the other option is to change career, I guess, and I can't stop thinking about my friend who is a school-teacher-turned-private-tutor, her job isn't easy of course, but it all boils down to really working a few hours a day. Some days fewer hours, some days more. No distractions or having to count the seconds counting down to the end of the day.

  
So **here's my question**: without needing to get a degree are there any careers you can start with work structured more like my friends rather than the typical 8-hour workday we all hate?  


TL;DR Scared of 8 hour day of just sitting in the office, what are the careers you can go into without a diploma that involve flexible hours and probably are closer to being done with a job in that one day (ie.   
 a teacher's lesson, a guy fixing your washing machine, translation work per text) rather than a long term project like the same developer job but without a proper schedule"

I'm a 21F Software Engineering  junior student in Lithuania.

Currently college requires an internship to graduate but I've been applying since February and still no luck.

I've been applying to unpaid internships so I could at least get experience and learn more but so far it's gets overfilled fast. I've been trying to get internship in sophomore year but during Covid a lot of companies canceled the internships so there wasn't any luck.

College wasn't exactly helpful because they had to deal with more than half students who didn't manage to find an internship. 

Managed to get accepted to the internship but the found out that it's isn't suitable for college requirements. 

I'm mostly good at Java and React Native. So there weren't a lot of positions suited for me.
I've been applying to internships that was available to me. I get passed at CV screening and even do good at the interviews but sometimes I get really anxious at technical questions that I almost forget everything only after the interview I realize  that I could have done so much better answering those questions since then I've been studying questions about algorithms more. 

I also get take home assigments but sometimes it's either clashes the college assignment deadline or I have to learn new language and framework to do the assigments. Once I have given assigment to the algorithm that didn't exist (at least when I tried to find mathematical formula of it in scholar.google.com). Other time I managed to complete the assigment and build a Springboot backend but the company replied that I didn't do the requirements that wasn't listed in their task. 

Perhaps I wasn't exactly dedicated to the programming as my peers were, since I was also busy with my second hobby? 

Previous semester I've had to take 7 classes (In Lithuania you can't select how many classes per semester you should take) so I didn't have time to built my portfolio though I have college assignments in github but I don't think that's enough. 

Currently I just feel hopelessness and tired. Though I will be applying to more companies before I would have to take an academic leave perhaps then I would have time to make portfolio.

So far I applied in LinkedIn, Glassdoor and other lithuanian websites that dedicated for internships. 

I would like to hear suggestions on where else I could apply to and what else I could work on.

I'd be happy to get an internship that will be accepted by college even the internship will be unpaid and have to learn new language."

As  part of my internship, I have to develop a custom driver for the  STM32H7's ETH interface. My company is aware that one already exists within the STM32Cube package, but they specifically want me to write my own.

My issue is that the interface does not receive frames directed to my  interface, only broadcast frames, unless I either set the interface in  ""receive all"" or promiscuous mode.

I  programmed the board's MAC address in the MACA0HR and MACA0LR  registers. I did not modify the other MAC address registers. I did the  rest of the initialization following what is done in STM32Cube for my  board (NUCLEO H743ZI).

I  checked the state of the MACA0HR and MACA0LR registers with a debugger  and it seems OK. I also use source address replacement for TX, and the  correct MAC address is inserted by the interface before transmitting  frames.

Is  there anything else I need to make filtering work? Basically, I want  the interface to accept broadcast frames, and frames with dest MAC addr  == my board's interface MAC addr.

Does anyone have experience interviewing for new graduate Quant Trader positions? 

I went through the interviewing process at a number of firms (roughly 10), this past fall for Summer 2021 QT internships, but unfortunately was unable to get an offer. Some of the firms I interviewed at included Optiver, IMC, Flow traders, Jane Street, DRW, and Akuna Capital. There were a few other smaller names, but the ones I've listed are probably most relevant. 

I was able to pass several rounds of interviews with some of the firms, but ultimately fell short, but I've definitely learned a lot that I think can be used to help me when interviewing for new grad roles. 

What I'm most interested in learning is if interviews for Fulltime positions tend to be more selective, if the material is relatively the same difficulty, and if graduating a semester early will give me a bit of an advantage due to less people graduating in December. 

Just for reference, I'm a rising Senior and will be graduating a semester early in December 2021, and have a 3.6 GPA pursuing a BS in Stats from a semi-target in the U.S.

Also there is no real HR person in the company.,weewoo1998,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/n6h5oo/can_im_a_young_manager_and_im_stressed_also_there/,"I just graduated university in Fall, but have been working at a smaller tech company part-time since May 2020. Within 8 months I was promoted to a marketing manager position once I went full-time. Pay is meh but I'm in the mindset of learning as much as I can to prepare me for other opportunities.

I'm a 23 F and I've never had an official manager position. I've worked retail, serving jobs, school internships, freelancer, etc. I work hard, I'm super organized, and I'm a great collaborator, which is probably why I was given the opportunity to be a lead on my team. Launching into this position with no experience managing people has been super challenging but I'm determined to get better at it... but oh my god it's a struggle.

I've dealt with many personalities in my life, but I'm finding it hard to manage this particular person on my team. I actually know this person from high school and uni, but the only interaction we had was through small talk. The thing is... they are great with clients but they do the bare minimum. They were hired a few months after me. There is no initiative and I find myself having to constantly check in to push them to move projects along. There are also other things that I've noticed about them that are super unacceptable: texting during meetings, missing calls, showing up hungover and even admitting it to me and other people on our specific team. Also since we're all working for home, I know damn well this person probably spends a majority of their day fucking off and doing shit like laundry LOL.

I've brought these issues of distractions up to my superiors, and the employee directly, but I can feel there is no actual respect from the employee. Also, it might be the fact that I'm younger than almost everyone that I manage (I don't outright tell everyone but if they really dug, they would know I'm the youngest lol)

The last thing I want to be is a micromanager. I've been using all the tactics my managers used on me when I first started this job- allowing this person to help out on different projects, giving this person projects to lead, allowing this person to dive into projects that align with their interests. I've already expressed all of this to my CEO and CFO- the relationship I have with them is super professional but I feel comfortable enough to look at them for management advice. Also, we don't have an HR person. Yup. The company is so small that they thought the previous HR person wasn't needed. This hasn't been a major issue for me, but if I needed similar advice, I'd have to either talk to other managers or the CEO and CFO.

They have been noticing this employee's disengagement too, and we have all been probing this employee during one-on-one's to see what they enjoy about the job, what their goals are, and what they think should change. We're all boggled because this employee tells us they love their job, but shows us no initiative to gain any sort of other opportunities + they are obviously distracted. I've even let this employee know that I would love to see them gain more opportunity in the company given that new hires have slowly been coming in (and honestly have been surpassing this person's performance). I asked them what their dream job is and they said anything to do with communication (uhhh yeah...I don't know how they were hired).

I'm in the camp of just accepting that this person's behaviour will get them as far as it can in their career. I totally understand that some individuals are happy with not moving up in their positions or venturing into other opportunities. I believe that other people on the team with initiative will surpass this individual in regard to opportunities, and maybe this would be a wake-up call for them. The CEO and CFO advised me to monitor the situation and that they would too. As a ""test"", we have been providing this individual with more side projects that they would lead. So far, I see little to no improvement. I know this takes time but I really doubt this person will come around.

It's draining to love your job but work with individuals who seem to give no fucks or have no ambitions. Also, it's shitty knowing that as a manager at this company, I probably don't make much more than this employee does.

I enjoy my job because it's such a big learning experience. It's rare to be at a company and be given so much influence at a young age. My goal is to gain as much as I can here and then move into a more creative industry that values collaborative + creative individuals (and pays waaaayyyyy more).

I'm open to any advice or literally anything that will ease my stressed-out mind. I know this is just the start of my career but I take this shit seriously 😭"

So here's my story:

It's my final year of engineering in 2019 and 21-year old me got a 6-months internship offer which can turn into a job offer if I do well, in a decent startup as a Data Analyst. I start in December 2019 and by the end of my 6 month internship I'm the top performers and we're in the middle of the pandemic. Now I get offered the job but I couldn't take it cause of 2 reasons. 
1. One of the co founder I was with, didn't like me cause I was not doing the work marketing was supposed to do.
2. They cut the original offer by 65% due to the Pandemic.

No issues I get back on my feet. Last day was on Thursday and by Monday I start a new job as Business Analyst in another startup. Now this one is not like the last one and more of a corporate culture. I had some red flags but shrugged them aside like hiring in great numbers (10-15 people a week). I tell myself I just need an year of experience and then I'm out of here to do my masters in Australia which I already have the offer letter to. But knowing my luck it wasn't that easy. I worked at this for 6 months and it was appraisal time. People were excited. I had my review in Dec 2020 and the manager was not too happy cause the only analyst in the team of 30 (me) is also supposed to the job of an developer alongside others. Then we didn't hear back from them for 2 month. It's Feb now and I am thinking just a few months before I quit. I got a message from HR on 11th Feb and they terminated me and 12th Feb was my last day at work. My session in Australia starts in September so I have 6 months in between. 

I say to myself ""Hey, I can do this just 6 months before I get back on track"". But it obviously didn't. Pandemic decides it will not let me and there comes another wave and Australia shuts it's border again and I'm not willing to take the course online. I can't do a job for few months and then leave again. I can't expect to start a business and expect it to be profitable in whatever little time I have. In the end I'm stuck with no job and no offline start date to my masters. I don't know how much time I have in between and I don't know how to spend it. I am doing courses from Coursera but I'm not able to justify this time waste to myself. Any word of advice would be greatly appreciated."

As luck would have it, it was on my mom's birthday too.  


I'm a student doing my 3rd Year in a 4 Year Computer Science Course (Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science Engineering) in India. This question has been posted to cscareerquestionsIN as well.  


I have 3 semesters left out of the 8 that I have in total. I will be graduating in mid-2022.  


Right now I have a mother and 2 siblings to take care of, both of my siblings are currently still in school, with one of them about to graduate in 2 months, (+2 or 12th grade) and start looking for colleges.   


As far as financials go, it seems like we will have around 15 lakhs or 20K dollars to spend on everything. It's not a lot, but from what I can estimate it seems like it's enough for me to earn my degree, and educate my sibling who is still in school. However, my graduated sibling will have to wait a year to enter college, and that's if we're lucky, which we're not.   


Lastly, I want to talk about the experience I currently have

* I have web development as my main domain I've been working towards. I'd prefer a SWE position if I can, but anything goes at this point.
* I have only worked on 2 projects at best. They are pretty barebones, however.

Right now I have the following questions:  


1. Should I even continue my degree? Should I instead just try and apply for a job right now with the experience that I have?  

2. Is there any way I can try and earn money while in college that would help me sustain my family? I'm thinking of internships or part time jobs, but I'm open to hearing what other options there are.  

3. Should I try for remote jobs and explain my situation? This is a very unlikely scenario from what I've observed, but it might be useful to hear your thoughts on it.  


I'm still hazy from the shock, but I don't want to waste time. I'm willing to provide further information in the comments for any further questions. Please,  I would really appreciate it if everyone could provide me with some answers!"

I feel as if the majority of skills internships ask for aren’t covered in school. Full-stack skills are in high demand and yet my university barely covers any of those skills, so I have to spend extensive time learning it outside of school.

Most universities teach Java or C++ but this simply isn’t enough for most internships. I feel as if there’s such a disconnect between the already difficult classes we have to take, and the skills required to even be picked up for an interview.

Does anyone feel similar and have any advice?

First, I graduated from a pure math BSc with a GPA between 3.3 - 3.6 (the conversion varies from sites to sites) however one of my transcript is missing (4th semester) and I can’t seem to find it, can I still send an application ? 

My second question would be concerning my current GPA. For now, I have a 2.9 - 3.0 GPA for the first semester but that’s because we have something called « rattrapages » meaning that you can take the tests again  on the subjects in which you performed poorly, however the results of the rattrapage will be given after the 1st July, should I try to apply with this GPA or should I rather wait the results and apply for Spring 2022? 

For the record I’ve done a 3 months internship as a data scientist, a project in Finance with ML and I’ve done a MSc thesis on the subject « Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques applied to the prediction of a tennis match outcome » it is really math heavy but have some code inside as well.

I keep seeing great sales on the 10th gen intel cpus which tempt me to pull the trigger now to upgrade my current system but I'm not sure if that's the best idea (I know that means a new MOBO and ram too). When I first built, AMD was always second to Intel, but I hear great things about the new CPUs. I'm looking at 5 and 7 series from both companies as I mainly game and do a small bit of coding, but as it stands I don't want to buy the R5 3600 as I know the 5600 is a lot better, so in short should I buy a 10th gen i5/i7 now or wait for the prices on the 5th gen ryzen cpus to go down?"

I (26M) graduated with a Masters degree in Chemistry back in 2018. Sciences were always something that I had an aptitude for at school, and thus it led to me starting a full University programme at 18, taking me through to 23, equipped with new extra-curricular passions, an incredible experience studying abroad in the US, friends for life (I'm from the UK). I couldn't fault the experience for what it gave me.

However, I knew quite late on that I didn't have the level of aptitude for a career in academia, nor did I really want to spend the next 30 years in a lab doing something like R&amp;D. I found this was a big limitation whenever I sought careers advice from the university.

One thing that stuck with me throughout my studies (and since a kid) is my interests in the creative space. I took up a position running my extra-curricular club, overhauling its design and branding image, even taking on another design project with friends setting up a nightlife brand during my 3rd year.

Design and especially photography, have started to take up more and more of my brain space, and I've started to add to a barebones portfolio. I've found however that moving past odd projects for friends/working for free or little remuneration has been difficult without formal training. Formal training is essential, which I now absolutely cannot afford, as I'm already pretty spent up/in debt from my Chemistry degree, and I'm struggling, in general, to find stable work during the pretty atrocious job market situation to even think about beginning to save and climb out of debt.

The absolute dream would be able to find a space where I can somehow fuse my science background and passion for the arts together, but I have had absolutely zero luck so far. Most design industry internships require bespoke formal training to allow you to get a foothold, and most science positions don't even come close to accommodating people who are also interested in the arts space.

Here I now am, turning 27 at the end of this year and growing increasingly hopeless (and pretty depressed) about options withering away about where I'm going to go next. I almost feel like my situation of having too many interests has paralysed me with indecision, always in limbo about where I'm going to end up next. Temp roles have been something I've fallen back on to help fund things like travel and general life pursuits, but it's getting to the point now where a lack of any viable career coming together any time soon is really starting to fill me with despair.

Any advice on how to proceed would be such amazing help

I majored in CS because I thought I wanted to make games, but I realized that 1) the games industry is shit and 2) what I really liked about game design is the idea of creating characters and telling stories. I figured these things out pretty early on in my CS degree, but I decided to keep going because software engineering is such a lucrative and stable career path.

Even though I was in one of the top CS programs in the country, I didn't learn much. I lagged behind in my group projects. There was always some genius who could have done the whole project by himself, which makes it really hard to learn. I was a solid B/C student, and I never snagged any internships because I was shit at technical interviews. I've never been able to finish a side project.

I took on a minor in film industries in my last couple of years, and it was just a completely different vibe. The people in my classes had, like, actual personalites. Sometimes I think about trying to do something in that field, but watching how much COVID has fucked with people's livelihood (and looking at the looming threat of my student loans), I think I really need the steady, reliable paycheck that a tech job would give me.

I haven't got much response from applications, but that is the norm so that's alright. I've had one very low paying offer, and an interview from a major semiconductor company. The thing is, after this interview, they told me to expect a notification in 14 days. 14 days passed some 3 days ago, and no email. So naturally, I emailed the HR who contacted me. Two days later and still no email. Funny thing is that another HR at the same company emailed me to offer an internship (which as a graduating student, I'm actually not eligible).

Did I bombed the interview that much to be not worthy of even a rejection?? Just send me an automated rejection or something I'd be happy enough, but no, nothing. 

Looking at job postings makes me sick these two days, knowing it's either low paying 3D drafting job, or a senior engineer position. I'm taking a break for the weekend. 

How do y'all cope with all this?"

My internship was in Web Development and so was my first job that ended up being sort of a scam that lasted for a month. I've been in love with computers for the past 8-9 years and have been the center of my hobbies since. My ideal job would be in IT where someone pays me to build and deploy computers, etc. that's my happy place.

I got a call from my Alma Mater 8 months ago for a position as a Lab Technician, but what I'd be doing is setting up and managing their new Robotics Lab and probably a Cyber Security Lab as well and bringing it up to par with a competing University with a leading Robotics &amp; IoT Lab. Due to various roadblocks it has taken 8 months of negotiation my salary up from low to average for a Computer Engineer. I was told this position doesn't have any salary progression or any promotions; so it would be mainly for 1-2 years for the experience.

My other option is an offer made by my dad who is currently a CEO of a factory that needs Ficep Beam cutting robot expert, as well a Solidworks Design Engineer and juggling those two. Now the caveat is being a trainee at first until I proved my value for the chance at the owner hiring me later on. It's nowhere near what I imagined myself doing but it also has room for growth if I work hard for 10 years and may progress to a managerial role. (Initial salary would also be coming out of my dad's pocket until I get hired. I HATE asking for or taking my dad's money)

My parents have been a huge part of my life, I stayed back home instead of going to my dream University because my mom made a fuss about not being able to see me if I travel halfway around the world. And I'm a goody-two-shoes who doesn't like to make his dad upset so I typically conform to whatever I think won't upset him; which led to me being very influenced and swayed by his opinion. This made me sway back and forth between both decisions for the past 8 months more times than I can count. Temporary job that I like vs. a job with career progression that isn't what I want. I want to pave my own way away from my parents. I don't want to live with my dad and also work for him.

I'm sorry if this entire post seems pretty childish and that I'm VERY privileged kid but it is what it is."

My internship starts a week from Monday and the TA position starts the week after that. I am afraid of what will happen if I get an offer for the full time job and the best way to go about backing out of the other offers. I think it would be better to back out before it starts but I don’t know if I will have an offer by then.

I was accepted off the waitlist to Princeton and I am having a lot of trouble deciding if I should attend. I am very, very passionate about medicine but I can also see myself doing something with other healthcare professions/science. Below I have outlined some of my concerns based on what I have heard/read about Princeton and UCF. Please correct me if anything is wrong--I need to know the truth.

Some of my concerns:

* At Princeton, I am quite worried about the fact that Princeton has no medical school and no hospital. I have heard that there are many great opportunities for research, internships, health profession ECs, and volunteering, but this is a major worry of mine as the state school has a larger amount of pre-med students, a hospital, and a medical school.
* I have heard that most Princeton pre-meds take a gap year between university and medical school to study for the MCAT and get clinical experience because the junior papers + senior thesis take up the time usually used to study for the MCAT/apply to med school. I'm not sure how I feel about this yet, but I am worried about using up another year of my life that could have otherwise been spent jumping straight into med school.
* Princeton is more expensive than UCF (Pton: 30k/yr, UCF: full ride national merit) but I will not be taking loans to pay for Pton, so not a huge concern.
* I have often heard that undergrad does not really matter in the scope of medical school and the medical field. I don't know if this is true, but it scares me.
* Of course, Princeton is more prestigious than UCF, but going off of my last point, I don't know how meaningful this really is. At the same time, Princeton is harder, though I'm sure I can handle it. At UCF, I'll be in the honors college.
   * One thing I am intensely afraid of is only going to a school for its prestige--this is something I am very against. Though Princeton has a great reputation, I want to be confident that I will receive a worthwhile, rewarding education, too.
* Despite having visited neither campus, I feel more connected to, more interested in, and more passionate about Princeton's culture and overall ambiance. I feel that I would fit in better there.

I want to make my decision based on a combination of factors: good academic/career opportunities, good culture/atmosphere, and (less so) good deal. I am also quite scared of making the wrong choice/regretting my decision later, especially if I pick UCF over Princeton. In general, I am just very lost and torn between the two options.

A little background about me : Aside from being a full time student, I currently work as an account executive support representative in one of the leading cloud company and also a junior scientist in a BPO company. I was a valedictorian in high school and I got a ""with high honors"" award in SHS. I'm not that involved in orgs and extracurriculars in college since I was busy with juggling school and work.

1.) Do management consulting companies only accept students from big 4 ( because I was not from there)?

2.) Do they accept sophomore interns?

3.) Do they provide programs that is intended for students? ( For example,programs from FMCG companies like Unilever, P&amp;G,etc.)

4.) What are the skills needed in order to have a career in consulting?

Last week I landed as an intern on a tech company, when they interviewed me they asked me what I knew, I told them what I knew and my preferences, which was mostly front-end stuff(Angular, Vue, JS, HTML, CSS), I didn't tell them I had any experience in Wordpress(which I unfortunately have) so I could try and attempt to prevent working with any CMS.

All I've been doing since I started the internship is working with Joomla and making HTML e-mail templates and I really hate it. I have to make html e-mail templates and make sure they look right in outlook and I have to use tables (it's 2021, who the fuck decided outlook should use word to render HTML instead of a proper browser engine such as webkit, etc...?) , an I'm struggling to position stuff with tables, I hate I can't use flexbox or any modern css code.

I'm lost with Joomla, Joomla doesn't have a visual feedback of the changes I make, it's counter-intuitive to use and its developer experience and UI sucks(imho).

I'm supposed to get taught stuff in the internship but the team lead and my internship mentor are too busy to teach me how it works. I feel like I'm doing the job no one wants to do

The only reason I persevered and managed to get through the course is because ""CS and Java is where the money's at,"" but I still hated the whole thing. Back in college, the modules where more focused on the IT field and was something I actually enjoyed doing, so I decided to jump ship and focus on a career in IT instead.

My IT skills are limited such as basic networking concepts, familiar with Azure Directory, assembling computer systems, some experience with Linux and virtualisation, hardware and software maintenance. My only professional experience was working (unpaid) part-time for a relative's internet café.

I'm planning on starting as a help-desk but I don't exactly know what skills I need to put in my CV or what recruiters are looking for in a CV. I know that customer service is important, and I have some experience on that working as a barista and supervisor (unpaid) for a relative's shop, but I don't know if there's any technical requirements needed for it or if I need certifications.

I have received almost no replies from recruiters and haven't had almost any interviews.

Now I'm not eligible to apply for such positions as I have already graduated the university. And I don't really know how to make my resume to appear more appealing.
Recently I cleared the CFA level I exam. And during pandemic have been practicing and improving my programming skills with SQL, python, and Excel.

I was born in the US (one of the parents was US citizen) but I was raised in Romania. I graduated the summer of last year with a degree in Computer Science (from the country I currently live in). As of now I have had no luck in securing an internship or job.

I was thinking whether moving to the US for work would be feasible given that I have a foreign degree. I wouldn't mind a lower pay as long as I can gain good experience and learning opportunities. I'm not confident that I am competitive for the coastal job markets such as SF or NY but I think I would be if I had work experience.

How can I compensate for my current situation? is there anyway for me to leverage my education to find a relevant job? What are some good cities or towns to move in with good tech industries? any articles or websites that document good cities to move in depending on your career?

So far its been induction and a whole lot of HR stuff. Understanding the structure of the app and technologies like Jira and Kibana. No actual coding yet. 
This is pure Java and xml, the app is built using Spring framework and we also use mysql. 
I know I'm not going to stay with this company for too long, 3 years max - then I'm relocating. I've decided I want to work for startups after that because I don't like big corporate culture. 
I know Java is a trusted and reliable language especially for companies like banks. At the same time - Javascript is gaining a lot of popularity and chances are I will be using JS if I join a start up. 
I like backend, I don't hate Front-end, I wouldn't mind branching into AI - I actually do like the field. 
Now I'm not sure whether to continue with Java cause it's what the company uses and it's also easily transferable or I should do JS on the side and polish it up for when I decide to switch companies and because it makes sense to learn JS - its growing rapidly and this means more job opportunities for me?"

I feel so lost...,PopCandy420,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/n765ih/my_family_is_planing_to_move_to_texas_in_a_year/,"So lets just begin by saying that we aren't a perfect family. Dad likes everything to be about him and craves attention all the time, Mom wants us to read her mind, and my sis is well a preteen/teen rn so its just a shitshow. I (21F) can say though that even though we fight often, I still love them and I think they love me too based on what they do for me, or at least I think so.

So about 2 semesters ago, my mom was saying how Dad was offered this higher up position that has been vacant for a long time since no one was able to fill it in at his company. The location though, is in Texas. How she doesn't know if Dad would take it, its up to him and whatnot.

In the mean while up until now, my dad would make a comment here and there about texas. Something texas has that california doesn't etc etc. 

I currently still am in a cc and its been a struggle honestly this past year with classes and getting internships with everything I currently have on my plate. I still am trying to positive and work hard, even got a therapist to work on the issue I have but sometimes, its just a lot.

My sister yesterday told me how she is excited to visit texas and how awesome itll be to move their, how they will be going on house tours for a week and Im like....what? Because while my mom and dad mentioned things about it, they never once said a single thing about about full on shopping for houses.

And i am so confused as to why no one told me....

I feel like there is something really wrong going on, like they know I won't be thrilled (ofc why would I be, I have so many plans here in la) so maybe they want to spring it up to me if they decide to commit to moving and force me to come with them because they will sell our house and plus there is a pandemic, so doubt i can just move in with one of my friends. I feel that this what they are betting on and its scaring me. I lost my job beginning of the pandemic, got laid off in my previous one due to rona, and still am searching for one.

I get that I am not the most easiest person to deal with and can be difficult at times, hence why I still am in therapy and getting help. But this is just a slap on the face.

I really am struggling to keep this all in and not lash out on them, just talking to them is taking a lot of work on my end because I don't think they know that I know.

Any advice as to what i should do and what resources I should look into so if they decide to force me to move ,leave everything I have here, uproot and start again which is not what I want to do in the next few years?

Edit: dont know if this helps but my family is slavic so keep that in mind"

I have to choose my major 2 or 3 months later.

In advance, sorry for not sufficient knowledge on technical domains and the Reddit platform. This is my first post on it.

My interest includes robotics algorithms (mapping, localization, motion planning, and so on), computer vision, machine learning, low-level programming, autonomous driving systems. I would like to work in the robotics industry as a software engineer or research engineer. To get job opportunities in these competitive areas, I plan to get a Master's degree or Ph.D. in a related area. I recently have got an internship (almost equals to a part-time job) as a computer vision engineer, which attracts me so much. So, I am eager to get deeper into these areas.

Because of my broad interest and probably vague understanding of these domains, however, I have trouble with deciding whether I will major in Mechanical Engineering or Computer Science.

The same kinds of questions are already posted, but courses of CS and ME are a little bit different from ones in general. For your better understanding of my situation, I give a brief explanation about departments in my university.

The department of Mechanical Engineering in the university where I learn provides so many courses about mechanics (heat, fluid, material, mechanisms), control (classical &amp; modern), and mechanical designs based on CAD, but not enough ones about robotics software, especially about the algorithm area. In lab classes, they deal with more heat systems like engines, less intelligent robots, deep learning, or software (not zero).

The department of Computer Science provides a deep understanding of computer systems, algorithms, low-level programming, machine learning, compiler, and logic. Especially, since I like low-level programming and computer system, these kinds of classes strongly attract me. However, they learn nothing about engineering concepts such as control, signal processing, and robotics algorithms. In addition, they learn mathematics from so theoretical point of view, which does not seem to fit me. I like math, especially optimization and geometry, but classes like ""definition -&gt; proof -&gt; definition -&gt; proof -&gt; ..."" are boring for me. Historically, CS in my university derived from Math and belongs to the School of Science, not to the School of Engineering, so it is natural that professors studying pure discrete mathematics and pure logic in CS. In my view, though a CS degree is said to be good for jobs related to software, it is not necessarily true for robotics software.

In summary, it is a problem like ""Hardware side with so much mechanics and design or Software side with computer systems and a little bit too theoretical mathematics"".

I hope to get some advice from those who are related to the robotics industry or academia.

Thanks for reading and answering, in advance."

I'm a CS major that graduated college about 10 years ago, but since third semester been involved and in love with networking, working on it for the past 13 years between internships and full time jobs. About six years ago I was hired on a sales program for a fortune 100 company and have been here since.

Now, after the pandemic, I'm starting to get a little anxious about work (have taken a lot of time off in the past 2 months and am seriously considering a career change.

I wanted to get into a dev career path but I don't know how to go about it. My programming experience is what I needed to pass my college courses with good grades but have never messed with it ever since. I did my assignments on python, C/C++ or Java, depending on the professor requirements, but that's all.

I'm looking to study it again and actually get more knowledge and experience so I can get started in this career.

I'm 32 and make good money now so it's tough if I have to downgrade my career too much. I'm married and sole breadwinner due to our current visa situation.

As I have talked with a few friends from school and others, my current plan is:

-get some programming related certifications that will be relevant for my current job (I know they'll likely help very little on my new career but it's a start and will be backed by my management)
-learn python and go (python because it could be helpful on my current job and I heard go is the cloud language) 
-start contributing to open software to get ""real world"" developing experience

I'm curious to hear your thoughts, experiences, tips and whatever else that could help me (: if you have any idea of what kind of salaries I could expect in the NYC area that would be helpful as well!

Thanks!"

n78fev,26,2021-05-07,Advice from 3x Big Company Entertainment Intern,kerry2654,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/n78fev/advice_from_3x_big_company_entertainment_intern/,"I’ve interned for ViacomCBS twice (BET + Nickelodeon) and interning with Disney this summer. This happened with a lot of hard work and strategy, especially since I go to school in IL (previously was in DC at a smaller school). Prior to interning twice with ViacomCBS, I was rejected 3x. I have also developed relationships with recruiters at ViacomCBS, NBCUniversal, and Warner Music Group so advice has been confirmed by them + my own personal experience.

* **Go through a partner organization.**
   * That’s the real secret for these competitive companies since those orgs have an established relationship with the recruiters and are prioritized within application review. Some companies also do target sourcing through partners - my Disney internship was never uploaded on the website!
   * IRTS Foundation, Emma Bowen Foundation, T. Howard Foundation, HBCU in LA, FUTURE NOW, Management Leadership for Tomorrow, MAIP, MADE (ANA Educational Foundation), Prep for Prep, Gyrl Wonder, etc.
* **Start preparing for opportunities with your desired company as soon as you know you're interested.**
   * It makes it easier to know when opportunities become available, knowledgeable about company, and build a rapport with employees.
   * I prepared by doing research, reaching out to current/former interns inside and outside my network, looking at old job descriptions, looking at intern testimonials (YouTube, TikTok, old blogs), setting up job alerts. I made a Google spreadsheet (now a Notion) for my internship search and had separate documents of compiled notes for each company/brand.
   * **Please note that recruitment for entertainment internships is Oct to April/May for Summer, May to August for Fall, and Sept to Dec for Spring.**
* **LONG before applications open, take your time crafting a master resume and a resume targeting your desired career area that sells yourself well.**
   * A master resume has the same format as a company-friendly resume, but it involves EVERYTHING you have done without any limits on bullets and pages - every single position and every single assignment and task you have. Extracurriculars and campus experience, school projects, part-time jobs, internships, fellowships, industry programs, relevant coursework.
   * From the master resume, make a resume(s) for your desired career area(s) and have them reviewed by professionals, professors, mentors, connections, friends, etc.
   * These companies look for direct, relevant, and transferrable experience, skills, and exposures.
   * **HEAVILY tailor your resume** and cover letter to the job description and connect the dots for the recruiter and hiring manager on why you're the best candidate - the information from your informationals, research, the job description.
* **Research to be able to answer clearly Why This Industry, Why Company? Why This Position? Why You?.**
   * I've had recruiters and hiring managers tell me that they passed on candidates on who had no clear comprehension of the position, team, brand and/or parent company, industry, and their vision and direction. People see their dream companies and ignore the position to say they're open to anything when you should specifically pitching yourself as the top candidate who is an asset.
   * I recommend doing so before you apply so you can be intentional with your applications and it will also carry you through at every step of the recruitment process so you're not scrambling.
* **Network before and after you apply so reach out to current/former interns, assistants, coordinators, school alumni, or maybe a potential hiring manager for an informational. Ask about working at the company and how you can position yourself better for future opportunities.**
   * I reach out through LinkedIn - you can also use Clubhouse, Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook groups.
   * Young Entertainment Professionals on LinkedIn and HUE You Know for BIPOC in Media on Facebook.
* **Stay aware of opportunities to gain experience, networking, mentorship, and/or insights into the entertainment industry**
   * Whether your own personal endeavors, local opportunities, or smaller organizations, these opportunities will prepare you and position yourself for larger companies.
   * These larger companies like those with an understanding of the entertainment business, who are active outside of just going to class, and have previous office experience or very relevant campus or personal experience (side/passion projects).
   * Networking and mentorship will help you build connections, put yourself out there, and increase your understanding of the industry. It's less about who you know, more about who knows you!
   * LAGRANT Foundation, Center for Communication, All Access: An Early Entertainment Community, Color of Music Collective, Amethyst Collab, Gyrl Wonder, The Creative Collective NYC

Currently an IT Engineering BA student (second semester, 25yo) and kinda hate programming.

Most of my courses heavily lean on programming and I'm not interested in them, however I do understand basic programming and I'm willing to learn enough for a decent job.

My main interests are computers and tech in general, I'm good at troubleshooting software and hardware (also mobile) and have been a video games journalist for a popular Persian website.

Don't have any networking experince since I've never worked with any. But am a fast learner and will learn what's necessary to make progress.

I don't have any actual work experience and I'm kinda overwhelmed on where to start

I have terrible depression and can't really study more than 1-2 hours a day. However I do have good social skills and can be very friendly and nice.

I love tech a lot but I'm not familiar with fields that are in demand. I'm currently studying for the A+ cert as a starting point (pretty simple stuff cause I was already familiar with most of the topics) but honesly don't know what to do after that. What I do know is that I want my job to require as little programming as possible and actual space for progress and getting better job positions.

I would appreciate any opinions on what to persue and learn towards a good 6 figure career.

n7dq1h,0,2021-05-07,Too early for an MBA? - Five Internships + Two Jobs + Business Owner + 20 Years Old (Australia),jimjams1616,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/n7dq1h/too_early_for_an_mba_five_internships_two_jobs/,"**MBA Info:**

 

* **Why I want an MBA:** I enjoy learning, especially ""on the job"" and I think doing an MBA is a good mix of applying your own knowledge//experience + leveraging other peoples experience. In addition to this, I am unsure exactly where I want to go career wise at the current moment, but I do know I will most likely need an MBA//it will help. ((More details at the end))
* **Why I want one now:** This is what I need to figure out! I am young, and I have great ((possibly overselling myself)) experience, so I can probably get into an above average MBA program here in Australia. I feel like if I get it while I am young, I can use it for longer + it may open doors sooner. ((more details at the end))
* **Target schools:** [University of Melbourne](https://mbs.edu/degree-programs/full-time-mba?sc_camp=0FDB0EDA759048419C75EA84F79CA824#how-to-apply), [Australian Graduate School of Management](https://www.unsw.edu.au/business/agsm/learn/agsm-programs/mba-full-time), [University of Adelaide](https://business.adelaide.edu.au/mba/adelaide-mba) (top preference) + open to others in Australia

**Background:**

Age: 20

Australia Citizen

**Education:**

Currently in my last year of a Bachelor of International Business (Marketing)

GPA: 5.6/7

Harvard Business School Online: Negotiation Mastery

Harvard Business School Online: CORe ((Pre MBA program))

**Work Experience:**

Started an entertainment company ((weddings, corporate events etc)) when I was 17 with two friends. It is going pretty well, one of them now work and live off of it full time. 

5 Internships (each 3 months long)

1. Mining improvement start up ((great experience + leadership team + brand name))
2. Cow IVF start up
3. Digital marketing agency
4. Wind Turbine start up ((great experience and brand name))
5. About to kick off a start up at a mid tier Energy and Resources consulting company

**Job 1:** Working at the event company I started ((2017 - now))

**Job 2:** Mining Improvement start up hired me as a Marketing and Sales Coordinator ((due to understaffing, I have worked on some killer projects well above my paygrade and experience)) ((still there, 1.5 years including 3 month internship))

They have said they are more than happy to rotate me around the business pre//during my MBA to help with my learning.

**Job 3**: Marketing Manager at a renovation company ((still there, 1 year))

\---

I feel like I can get into an MBA program with my experience + ""I am young and will be an interesting fit into the class room"". However, I really need to understand:

1. Is it too early to do my MBA?
2. If I don't do my MBA now, will all my grinding over the past 3ish years go to waste?
3. If I do an MBA now and work while I study, will I still be underqualified for most MBA jobs?
4. Is it work doing an MBA in Australia?
5. If I do an MBA now and excel at my career, can//should I go back and do another one early 30s maybe M7 or T15?
6. Maybe I get 1 or 2 more years of experience at Mining Company before doing my MBA?

I think more than anything I am looking for a bit of perspective. I completely agree with all the threads here which say that you shouldn't do an MBA straight out of UG, but I feel like I have enough experience to do so and do it well, but is it worth it?"

I am a UK national and it is my biggest dream / goal to move to one off these countries as I have seen the quality off life there and much prefer it to the uk, traveled to the middle East and really love it there and currently in the process of learning arabic, honestly I'm drained and done with the UK I love it here but can't see myself here for the rest off my life. Partnered with my struggles post grad struggling to find a job and have basically been left behind by everyone I studied as they have all started their careers and are prospering which I'm happy for them. (Not to sound like an a hole) I achieved the high grades and have experience but really struggling I just don't understand what the problem is and it's really depressing everyone just saying keep trying which I am but the longer I don't get a relevent job the less value my education will hold. Honestly I'm done with this place need a fresh start and will honestly do any job at this point. Any help or advice would be much appreciated thank you guys in advance. Sorry if I left anything out."

n7ewem,3,2021-05-07,Unorganized training and unhappy workers. I don't know if it's something I did or part of the territory of being new?,Autist_establishment,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/n7ewem/unorganized_training_and_unhappy_workers_i_dont/,"**So I just started this job last week. There's some stuff to get used to.  Anyway, my help desk associate lead, everyday, he bounces me from person to person to train me everyday so far. There's no set person to train me for the weeks I need to train.**

**I notice I've been getting strange, strong behavior from at least two or three coworkers already. One has a really sharp tongue with me so far, her mood is really tense when it come to me. The other never came back to me when she was supposed to and the other one read my message and ignored me after saying that she was going to take me under her wing today after the other had to leave for lunch.  To get to the meat of the story: I sat here wondering when the lead was going to come to me again about who to train with, since he usually told  me first. I didn't feel like it was my job to go out asking employees to train me.  None of my other help desk agents came back to me after I messaged them either.**

&amp;#x200B;

**This whole situation is confusing to me. I'm a computer science student whose trying to get IT experience and so far, after the last IT/help desk position, I'm really not liking it so far. The other job didn't train me enough and just threw me out there. This one is very unorganized? Their workers are tired, been there for years without a raise of pay and are good at what they do BUT I guess the higher ups never noticed that, which is something I've heard being told to me for days on end since I started working here.**

&amp;#x200B;

**I find it unfair that they have to train someone during their work hours, I doubt they're getting raises for doing so, because they wouldn't act like this. I am now skeptical on what the coworkers and leads agreed to upon my arrival at the company. My team lead, from what I observed, gets up in the morning, picks a help desk agent and tells them to train me for that day. No plans before hand, nothing.**

**Monday, I'll tell the team lead to let me do calls on my own and I'll just come to him whenever I need to. Deep down I feel like a burden.**

&amp;#x200B;

**I can't leave because I don't have any offers elsewhere. The cyber security internships I applied for have not been coming out alright. How long should I stay here? Are my feelings valid?**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

n7fr4q,2,2021-05-07,An open letter from someone in their 30s,Dodec_Ahedron,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/n7fr4q/an_open_letter_from_someone_in_their_30s/,"Dear US population that is 50+,

First a little about me. Just know that I'm in my 30s, I've been working 60 hours a week at the same job in real estate for nearly a decade, and worked in a restaurant for 7 years before that (yes those time periods overlapped and I went a LONG TIME without a single day off) and the only time I take vacation days now is to go work odd jobs that pay better, but only last for a few days at a time. I live in a suburb that's just on the boarder of being considered rural so the cost of living isn't too high, but I can be in a decent sized city in about 30 minutes.

I constantly hear older people talk about how my generation doesn't know the meaning of hard work and sacrificing for a better future. Well allow me to correct you on that.

I grew up watching my dad bust his ass everyday at a car manufacturing plant, only to see them close the plant and him be unemployed for nearly a year because the only jobs that were available at the time paid less than his unemployment did, and the ones that paid a decent wage had 3,000 of his former coworkers applying for them. My dad was forced to take a job out of state to support the family and he's been living there for 12 years now. My mom had to stay here to take care of my grandpa and so my sister could finish her senior year of highschool with all of her friends. Since then, my dad has had to work even harder, just to try to keep his head above water despite multiple setbacks, having the house foreclosed on, and a mountain of medical bills from issues that kept my mom out of work for nearly two years. He has worked himself to the point that he has congestive heart failure and has been hospitalized multiple times, all so that he can just now start to get ahead financially in his late 50s, with almost no money set aside for retirement because we needed every penny to survive. He showed me what work is, and I learned my lesson. I used to go with him to cut firewood for a guy he knew who heated his house with a massive wood burning stove. The guy said the average person he hired would cut 1-2 chords of wood a day, and he paid by the chord. We cut AND stacked 6 chords a day for nearly 3 months.

I watched my parents life fall apart while living trying to start a life of my own in '09. It went as you would expect for someone in my position. That is to say, what little I was able to achieve stagnated for nearly a decade before I started making gains agin. I've spent the past seven years living in a shitty duplex with a roommate. When I say shitty, I mean shitty. There are gaps around the doors and windows so heating is expensive and cooling is almost impossible. I even paid to replace some of the windows out of my own pocket because the landlord wouldn't (and yes I replaced them myself and didn't hire a contractor). We have a basement that floods and a driveway prone to washing out in heavy rain. In fact a couple years ago, it fully collapsed from the creek that flows under it washing everything around the culvert pipe away. I couldn't get my car out of my house for almost a week before it was fixed (I didn't miss work though). I say all this in the hopes that you understand just how much I am TRYING to not be in the same position as my parents were in. To see that I work my ass off and that I am sacrificing like I've been told to do my entire life. I just bought my first house and am in the process of renovating it (again by myself) so I can turn it into a rental unit for students at a local university. It's taken me years to get to this point. A point that, when I look back at history to compare myself to someone from even a few decades ago in the same situation as me, should have been available to me well over a decade ago. As if being a decade behind where my parents were at my age (and over a decade behind where my grandparents were) and starting my life in what was the worst economy since the great depression wasn't bad enough, as soon as I started to recover from the '08-'09 crash, the economy tanked again this past year.

I have done everything that I was told to do. Sacrifice. Get an education and a good job. Work hard. Check. Check. Check. And check. And even after all that, I'm only marginally better off than I was when I was just a cook right out of highschool. I'm proud of what I have, but I'll be damned if it isn't depressing to see a decade's worth of busting my ass be rewarded with a few thousand dollars more a year and newly minted mortgage that is looming over my head.

I've even considered getting another job, whether it be part time or full. Jobs don't pay well and careers are few and far between nowadays. Most major companies are shifting to a gig worker model, and what positions aren't gig or temp jobs, have unrealistic requirements. I'm talking about entry level positions that require a college degree, multiple certifications, and 2 years experience. You can't exactly get that job straight out of college. Hell, I saw a listing for a position that required a MASTER'S DEGREE and only paid like $12/hr. The only thing you'll be lucky to be offered is a 1 year, UNPAID internship all for the CHANCE to be offered a position that doesn't pay absolute shit when you're done with that. I don't know about you, but if I had enough in savings to be able to live for a year without getting paid, I wouldn't be so hard pressed to get a job.

And people my age can't exactly pick up and move across the country anymore looking for better prospects, at least not as easily. Rates of interstate transplanting (moving to a new state) are at multi decade lows. Last year, my sister managed to move from Ohio to Virginia. In order to make that happen, her boyfriend (now fiancée) who is in the military lived in the barracks on base in Virgina and took odd jobs for nearly a year prior to her moving, just so he could get place for them to stay. We moved everything down their ourselves, no movers, and just rented a truck and a trailer to haul her car. It still cost close to $5,000 to move her 8 hours away. And that was to move her to a place where she had already secured a job and had a place to live. I would imagine the cost would be much higher if she had to pay for the move, and have savings to last long enough to find a job, and pay for a hotel until she could find housing. It would likely have been closer to $10,000, and for that much money, she could have put a down payment on a house.

I am not alone in these struggles. My entire generation is on track to be a lost one. We were born into a world where those ahead of us refuse to step aside so that we can advance and those behind us are catching up quickly, but are 10-15 years younger and don't have families to support so they can take a job making less money. I've seen people be passed up for positions because they have kids and thus would be more likely to have to call off. As if the very fact that have kids doesn't mean they would be less likely to leave that job because they have a family to support.

My generation is constantly ridiculed as being lazy, selfish, and ungrateful. Well news flash... We want to work, we want to succeed, we want to have the American dream. But instead we have those dreams squashed and we've been told to ""stop bitching"" by the very people who squshed them in the first place. You see my generation take to the streets and riot and call for reform over everything. What you don't realize is that we aren't just fighting for justice and equality, but we are rebelling against the generations that have come before us, left us with a pile of shit, and complained that we couldn't turn it into gold for them to add to their hoard. We are fighting not to take what is theirs, but for the chance to earn our own.

I hear people talk about my generation as being hateful. And you know what... we are. We hate the world we're being handed. It's polluted. It's corrupt. And worst of all, when it isn't blaming us for problems we didn't create, it ignores us. We weren't the ones subsidizing the fossil fuel industry to the tune of BILLIONS of dollars a year... YOU were. We weren't the ones allowing corporations to grow so large and powerful that they own politicians and see illegal activity as ""just the cost of doing business""... YOU were. We don't look to the younger generation and blame them for anything other than shity trends like fortnight dancing and TikTok videos. Sure, we had Vine, but we at least had the decency not to directly monetize it. You had to make a YouTube compilation for that. What does my generation get blamed for? We want electric cars instead of massive SUVs. We don't make enough money to support social security in the future. We don't get married and we don't have enough kids. We don't just do as we're told told or respect our elders. We buy too much cheap crap instead of buying quality goods. All we do is watch Netflix and get high.

Well allow me to respond to those in order.

We want electric cars because we want to at least TRY to not leave the Earth a flaming shit pile for future generations. Also, isn't the advancement of technology something to be praised? If we stuck with the mentality of ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" we would still be riding horses and carriages. But we didn't do that did we. We recognized a problem with that system and created new technology to replace it. Well now we've recognized a problem with the internal combustion engine and we've developed new technology to replace it. The question isn't if ICE cars are replaced, the question is when. And if my generation has anything to say about it, the answer will be soon.

Next. We don't make enough money because the people at the top (AKA boomers) are so concerned with maximizing their own profits that instead of paying us what we're worth, we're being paid what they can get away with, which in a lot of cases is just nothing as they continually ship work overseas. What work we are left with is overly demanding and typically underpaid for what is being asked. We are also under constant threat of being fired for literally any reason (I'm looking at you ""at will employment"") and companies constantly reducing or completely cutting what benefits we do manage to get, and that's when they aren't trying to classify us as gig workers so they don't have to pay for them at all.

Next. We don't get married or have kids because we can't afford it. Why would we want to bring another person into a world that has been so harsh to us? And even if we did, it wouldn't be until we were settled and able to support that child, but we're still probably only having 1 if we want to help send them to college in 20 years which at that point would be over $200k on average. And don't even get me started on home ownership. As I said before I recently bought my first home. Let me tell what the experience was like. I had to have my friend who is a real estate agent get my name on a list to see a property that wasn't even technically listed yet, but was going to be listed by another agent in their office in the next week. The day it hit the market I went to see it to make sure there were no major red flags and made an offer that night. It had been on the market for approximately 10 hours and I still had to pay $10k over asking PLUS sellers closing costs AND call in some favors from my contacts in the industry to fast track the sale. Why? Because I had beat an offer from from a guy who works for the real estate division of Berkshire Hathaway who was looking to flip the place and add it to their portfolio. Yes I plan on using the property as a rental myself, but I'm going to be renting rooms to local college kids for reasonable rates while I still live there. I'm not going to be a soulless corporate landlord looking to make as much profit as I can at the expense of my tenant. My point being that even though I have been in the industry for years and know the area and the market well, even though I have excellent credit, a sizable down payment, and industry contacts to help ""grease the wheels"", I still had a hard time finding a place because residential homes are becoming increasingly difficult to find and when they can be found, they are prohibitively expensive. How can you honestly expect a person to start a family without secure housing?

Next. Why the fuck should we just do as we're told. And why should I care if you're older than me? As far as I'm concerned listening to you fucks hasn't gotten me anywhere. At best it's kept me in the same place instead of falling behind. And as for the age thing, age does not necessarily equate to wisdom and respect isn't given it's earned. If you think you know better than me based solely on the what year you were born, you can go fuck yourself. And if you think I give a damn about what title you have, what school you went to, what letters you get to write after your name, what robe you wear or what piece of metal you pin to your shirt when you go to work, you are sadly mistaken. I will treat you with the same level of respect you treat me until you do something to convince be treat you another way, be that for better or worse.

Next. Do you want to know why we buy cheap crap? It's because we're caught in a viscous cycle. Shitty companies like Amazon and Walmart come in and put good companies out of business. Without those good companies, we make less money and have reduced access to good products. With less money and less access to good products, we are forced buy shitty products from shitty companies, which only let's them grow larger and shittier and take out more businesses offering good jobs and products. Before you know it, you have entire towns beholden to Amazon warehouses. It's almost like we've been through this before as a country. You know... owing your soul to company store. That's never worked out poorly before. /s

Finally. All we do is watch Netflix and get high. I won't argue with that, but I will justify it. I can watch Netflix as much as I want for a whole month for the same price of a movie ticket and a small popcorn. You would think that when theaters started running ads before movies that the costs of going there would go down. You would think that, but you would be wrong. And what better way do we have to cope with the constant barrage of shit that we're blamed for and forced to deal with than to just get away and escape, even if only for a little while. But wait, we can't escape. We're expected be available around the clock for our jobs, taking phone calls and answering emails and texts. Even if we decide to unplug for a few days, we still have to deal with the fact that everything is so expensive. Wages haven't kept up with inflation since the 80s (thanks Reagan) and they are getting to be unbearable now. But even if we decide to go completely off grid, with no phones or computers, and we were to grow our own food and never have to pay for anything, we would STILL be getting fucked the Earth constantly warming, weather getting more extreme, and the air and water being more and more polluted. We literally can't even take a vacation to escape the constant reminder of how those before us have completely fucked things up and how we're going to be the ones to pay the price. So you know what? If I, or anyone else from my generation, decide to check out for a little while, you can't really blame us. Everyone needs a break sometime.

Sincerely,
A pissed off millennial"
n7gkcs,1,2021-05-07,Need Advice For My Significant Other Finding a Front-end Web Developer Job,LeManateeMan,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n7gkcs/need_advice_for_my_significant_other_finding_a/,"Hi everybody!

My 26yr old S.O has a bachelor's degree in computer engineering from a school in Thailand and she has been having great trouble finding a full-time job in the USA since she moved here to live with me (\~2 years ago). The best she could find was an unpaid internship as a web developer at a crypto startup, but she isn't happy with that job since it doesn't pay anything, so she currently works part time as a licensed massage therapist. I am also in fact a computer engineer, currently working as a video game programmer at a indie gaming company.

My S.O applies to about 10 jobs a week and has applied for over 300 places now, I think. She has gotten like 3 interviews in 2 years of searching. I have worked with her to revise her resume at least 4 times to no avail. She has setup accounts all over Monster, Indeed, Angelist, etc.

Possible reasons why she has trouble finding interviews

1. Resume is probably not written well.
2. Her college is unknown to pretty much everybody in the U.S.
3. She doesn't have any full time work experience in the U.S. as a programmer at a well known company.
4. She is here on a long-term green card (she sometimes puts this on her resume).
5. COVID impacting hiring.

Is there anything she can do to improve her odds of finding a full-time web development job in the U.S?

My only advice:

1. Get her resume professionally written.
2. Get a masters in computer science from a well known U.S. university.

I would love to hear experiences from other immigrants who might be in her shoes and if/how they have overcome it.

Thank you."

I am currently in school for a bachelors in Psych with a minor in Computer science.  I feel like that might not be enough especially since applying for software engineering internships has been rough to say the least. 

Should I consider applying for a masters in csc or data science? Im not too keen on working in the data science field due to many subreddits stating that many data science jobs today are not at all like the cool stuff you learn in school, also that many of these ""data science"" jobs are really more like data analytics and things of that sort. Machine Learning does seem very interesting but I am not sure if that field is dealing with the same things I have read online with data science. Can ML engineer be a similar work environment/field as a software engineer (assuming you work at similar tech companies). Idk much all I know is that I feel more challenged and more satisfied when I work on my csc projects. I'm also taking an aws cloud technical essentials course on coursera so maybe I could work with that to start my career and then transition into software engineering?

I really want to get into Waterloo cause it has the best CO-OP for computer science majors and I really wanna get the real world experience after having completely wasted my time during undergrad doing nothing, no internships, no co-ops. 

I regret my first 2 years of college where I failed classes. I currently have 4 F’s on my transcript (all deleted from GPA though). I graduated a year late. I got all A’s my last 2 semesters of college. UofWaterloo states that to be eligible I should maintain a 3.2 or above GPA in my last two years of college. I think I did!

UofWaterloo also stated that I do not require GRE and IELTS if I graduated from a North American university. 

 My question is, what are the chances of getting in with my current transcript of having Fs in my first 2 years and having Ws as well? I graduated a year late btw (primarily due to a long term medical illness that I faced during my senior year for 6 months that delayed my graduation).

My girlfriend an I intend to move to Canada from Belgium after finishing our studies (maybe in mid 2023) . We are both 22 and looked over the Federal Skilled Worker Visa. My CRS score estimate is 552, considering that I am offered a job in Canada after my studies. My partner's CRS score is slightly lower (around 465) because she will probably not get a job straight away. She's thinking about working as a freelancer, which could be trickier regarding the immigration process.

The biggest issue is that we are fairly young (but very lucky) and probably neither of us will have the required funds (around 12,000 CAD x 2). However, if I do get a job offer, I won't be asked to provide a proof of funds.

Does this mean I don't **have** to obtain the specified amount ? I understand that it is very important to have a sufficiently large emergency fund. Also, I read many answers on this subject explaining that stocks (ETF in my case) cannot be considered as proof of funds. Though, I did not find any official sources confirming this. In the worst case scenario, I still have the possibility to liquidate my positions which would solve the matter. As a matter of fact, I think it will be necessary as my broker (Trading212) does not operate in Canada.

I am also wondering whether it is safe to consider getting a job (while abroad) in Canada without relevant experience (aside from internships and projects). I have a bachelor in Computer Science and I'm currently pursuing a Master in Data Science. This might be a misconception about Canada, but I was told that the financial sector is more developed. It might be offer many opportunities because I am also interested to work in this area."

n7o06i,2008,2021-05-08,The gap between rich students and poor students is just getting worse cause of the pandemic,Im_babie-uwu,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/n7o06i/the_gap_between_rich_students_and_poor_students/,"I wasn’t entirely sure what to write for the title, I’m also pretty sure it’s been already talked about. But, here’s something that’s just been sitting on my chest for a while. 

I used to go to a really elite private school with the top 1 percent (no, not in America but, they could qualify in top 5 percent there, I think), and now I go to a middle class public school. I still kept in touch with my friends from the rich school and with the pandemic still raging on, the opportunities they have compared to students like me in public schools is really really disheartening and discouraging. Just like other kids, I’ve not even been able to do most regular extra-circulars because everything is shut down. Meanwhile, their rich parents are getting them very impressive ECs like internships at big companies or even just handing them smaller companies to “run”. They have access to things like high level tutors that essentially just help them cheat. I’ve even heard rumours of certain parents bribing teachers (it was kind of a small school). 

On the other hand, people at my public school are struggling with online school and trying to teach themselves subjects. Covid is getting worse and nobody has the chance to get vaccinated so, no idea if even next year things will go back to normal. It’s pretty apparent that applications like mine would be nowhere near as frivolous or nice as theirs. Most of the kids at my public school are such hard workers and they honestly deserve at least the opportunity too. The pandemic is just making the gap bigger and bigger. I don’t think schools are going to pick applications like mine, when their applications are definitely stronger.

n7rhup,11,2021-05-08,ik this is a bit long but i wld rly appreciate help!!! is it better to have two really good humanities recs or one good humanities + one extremely mediocre stem????,starshinez05,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/n7rhup/ik_this_is_a_bit_long_but_i_wld_rly_appreciate/,"so my 2 teachers that im going to ask for recs are my apush teacher (who is also my counselor, but im going to ask her to write it \*as\* my apush teacher if that makes sense) and my ap lang teacher. they both think highly of me academically and personally and obviously have insight into my writing which imo is def what takes their understanding of me to the next level (like what u write, even in class, reflects the way u interact w ideas  + think about the world u know). i would say theyre both solid like 8/10s; just 2 points off bc i guess a 10/10 would be, like, this teacher supervised my lab project to cure cancer and we developed a bond during the lab work or smth LOL. but i think for a ""normal"" rec letter, they're both as good as can be.  

i casually mentioned this to a senior &amp; complained about how like i really can't think of a single stem teacher who would be able to write me a good rec letter. i mean even a decent one is unlikely. and (while i obv take it w a huge grain of salt like she doesnt know everything but she did get into a hypsm which STILL doesnt make her a pro lol but yk) she was like, ""look idk but in my experience i think that a generic stem + good humanities &gt; 2 good humanities."" she also told me i should look elsewhere for a supplementary rec letter if i think i have one that shines. the best i can think of is the law internship im starting this summer, but i \*obviously\* have not actually experienced this yet so idk if anything will come out of it. 

just to give a more clear picture: 

my stem teachers in hs have been

* bio + ap psych: doesnt know i exist 
* ap physics 1: i hate that class so much like my least fav subject actually. also i was depressed the year i took this so i would like sleep in class and stopped studying halfway thru the year. it was kinda bad. shes sooo sweet and like shes also technically the supervisor for like this comp i do &amp; win at, but she legit just knows my scores. AND everything i won was in english lol
   * (she's also my algebra 2 teacher. i was amazing in that class because i found the subject easy but i cant really think of anything special to say about my experience. like i dont remember a single thing abt that class that would make for material other than like, ""good grades! :) x"")
* geometry + precalc: i think she likes me on a personal level, but she knows like how disorganized i am/how much my adhd affects me academically more than literally anyone else in this school. this isnt even smth i wanna put on my apps since it's not documented in my academic history, but like she gives me more informal accommodations ig on like due dates than anyone else. soo possibly not someone who would give me a good. u know. Academic rec letter
* ap chem: ive participated in this class maybe like 3 times this whole year. also my chem teacher from the yr before but i slept thru that class often (year i was depressed) and only got an a bc a lot of it was stuff i had a strong background in from my intro to chem class in eighth grade, which i took in a diff school w a stronger curriculum 

and thats all the stem ive taken so far. my only stem class next year will be ap calc or stats, depending on what i end up doing

SOOO LIKE. is it honestly awful to have an apush and ap lang teacher for rec letters? the thing that also worries me is that what they say about me may be excellent but also overlap a lot, because a lot of my same strengths are showcased in those classes (background knowledge, strong writing, interesting discussions, try to bring in other perspectives in essays/discussions, etc). 

sooo i just really have no idea. sorry for the long post but i'm really conflicted! i need to ask for rec letters soon"

I'm currently a sophomore, and am lucky enough to have two offers. One is from a small bioinformatics company (&lt;10 people) and the other is from a large company (Juniper Networks). My main goals for the internship are to get experience, learn a lot, and do interesting work. I'm leaning towards the smaller company that pays less, but lmk what you guys think. Would Juniper Networks look a lot better on a resume than a tiny company that no one has heard of?  

&amp;#x200B;

Pros of small company:

\- actual software engineering internship 

\- what the company does is more interesting 

\-cons of small company: 

\-pays less (25 an hour)

\- less name recognition, which might make getting internships+jobs in the future harder 

&amp;#x200B;

pros of big company:

\-more money (35 an hour plus a small bonus)

\- it seems likely I'll have an actual whole project to do

\-name recognition might help me get a better job in the future

cons of big company:

\- it's a software automation internship, not a software engineering internship, and I don't think I wan't to be a software automation engineer?

\- the company seems a little boring"
n7ufp5,2,2021-05-08,Any other interns making more than their parents or come from a low income family and it feels extremely weird?,internally,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n7ufp5/any_other_interns_making_more_than_their_parents/,"It feels really weird to me. My dad is a security guard who works night shifts, morning shifts, noon shifts.. he is working whenever he's not sleeping it feels. I'm expecting an offer this Monday after getting an email entailing ""great news"" and a phone call from the company I interviewed with for two months, where I'll be making $28/hr for really cool tech stuff. My dad makes six dollars less than me with fifteen years of experience (we live in NYC so that is really not enough to live off alone haha). So I dunno man. T_T 

Granted, I worked extremely hard to make it to this position too. This will be my fourth technical internship on top of other extracurriculars and hardships I faced (my grandfather died from COVID. also, poor grades lol), so I'm very happy, but do feel a twinge of ""something.""

I think I just want to give back to my family honestly. They're not bad people (well, my mom treats my dad as a ranting bag thoe). Only thing is that my dad is extremely tired and overworked for what he's paid, and both my parents don't clean up after themselves. Security guard work isn't necessarily hard but during the pandemic, my dad would say things like, ""If we die, we die,"" which implies that he doesn't think much of his life. Not sure what to really think or if I can even help him change that.

Point is, coming from a low income family to having pretty decent wages is like, mind blowing. I have such a hard time spending money because I'm used to not having much haha.

Edit: The question is poorly written. I meant to ask if any other CS interns are making more money than their parents OR are advancing a lot from previously being low income - and are feeling weird about it."

n7v57s,4,2021-05-08,What horrible truth I found out working for an Indian tech company as an Intern.,HellVVraith,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/n7v57s/what_horrible_truth_i_found_out_working_for_an/," I used to work at Justdial. If you're from India, you must have heard about Justdial. Amitabh Bacchan along with some other actor suggests removing all the apps from your phone because Justdial is an all-in-one app for it. For those who haven't heard of it, the company is the literal embodiment of the phrase 

&gt;“Jack of all trades master of none”

So a little bit of back story, I am a computer science engineer in my final year of B.Tech and when I was in my third year, I was looking for an internship to cover some expenses and add some experience to my resume. Right around that time JustDial came to our campus and offered us an internship opportunity. Having heard about Justdial literally every day for the past decade made us believe that the company must have a clear business plan, a strategy, and the resources to pull off the services that they claim to be giving.

**Spoiler Alert: THEY DON’T**

When we first joined Justdial, we under the management of Mr. Z (can’t use his real name obviously). He walked us through the entire process of how the company works with its clients. We were part of the web development team and our primary objective was to use a ripoff of wix.com that they created in-house by the name of **Justdial Omni.**  Calling it a rip-off is being generous because it barely had any feature. We would work with fixing the bugs and tweaking features in the platform and at times we were directly put in contact with the client so as to discuss the requirements and better understand them. 

2 weeks in and I started feeling something off about the entire thing. The website themselves were good (when I say good, I mean barely passable), but one of my friends that worked in the customer service department casually told me how many complaints they get each day. People who paid Justdial over 25000 INR wanted features that are actually very common. Like having a custom header. Justdial would keep beating around the bush and when someone actually got pissed off enough to call this out, they would tell them that once they created the website, it was the client’s responsibility to manage and actually make changes to it. For those who haven’t figured this out yet, all they did was hand the client a template website and charged them 25000 for it + the cost of domain and SSL certificate.

I often met clients who knew what they were doing and would point out this very fact but to no avail. The company was essentially scamming people by promising them a custom website and handing them over with a template “wix” website. 

I left the internship in 2 months because it went against everything I ever stood for as an aspiring software engineer. You don’t make fake promises about wild features and then hand them over a barely functioning website because to be actually able to call you out, the client would need to read books on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Also, this is just the interaction between clients and Justdial but the other side of this is the interaction inside Justdial itself.

The entire point of an internship is to learn, or at least that what I used to think. An intern I didn’t know once asked our manager in a Whatsapp group that was meant for this kind of conversation about adding a certain feature. Within minutes, and I’m not making this up, the group was flooded with literal memes about how the intern didn’t know how to do it. I’m not sure about others but this does not qualify as professionalism. Following this, one of the full-time employees wanted to take a leave as someone in her family was suffering from COVID and she herself was not feeling very well. Her request was denied and what would you know, the entire office had to be shut down because she tested positive. Oh did I mention that the workers were forced to come to the office and were not allowed to work from home except the senior management?

Justdial is a company that doesn’t care about its employees and sure as hell doesn’t care about its clients."

I feel so frustrated with programming right now. I spent about 4 months trying to teach myself programming basics such as html css and JavaScript. Then I signed up for a boot camp that focused on react and a bit of backend. I feel like the boot camp was so fast - I couldn’t retain the knowledge. I did the assignments but can’t convert this stuff into my own projects.

People say do your own projects. I don’t know how to do that without looking up stuff like tutorials. Then I hear tutorials are bad. Docs look like jargon to me, where do I go to learn these concepts so I don’t get stuck just sitting here when it’s time to try this stuff out?

I feel so disheartened because I really tried to learn and understand these concepts from my boot camp on react so I can build a portfolio. I got a graduation certificate but I don’t feel like it means much because I feel like I would fail the coding interview questions

I hate my job now it’s become so stressful this last year with all the changes and I was using this to motivate myself to apply and get into some kinda intern or entry level job and I don’t feel like it’s possible right now. 

I feel like I really failed so far. I tried studying today for 4 hours to build a basic app and I can’t do any of this. I sit here learning functions and basic JavaScript but I don’t know how to convert it to do on my own

TLDR;
I feel like I’m trying to learn programming and none of it is clicking. What should I do? I don’t want to give up

Edit: Thank you everyone for the responses! I've been reading them throughout the day and it's really helped me get a better understanding of where my focus is going to go so I can keep learning!!"

Heres some background about me; I'm from NJ, I don't really care for city life or weather. In that sense I don't think NYC/Pittsburgh would be thaaat important for going out reasons.

Both schools cost similarly around \~30k a year after fin aid. Columbia slightly more, but not enough to be financially troubling.

Career wise, I'm majoring in CS and would like a lot of internship oppurtunities. I think CMU would be better for this, but I don't think Columbia is lacking either. Aside from normal internships, I'm also partially interested in software startups and potentially founding one of my own. I think NYC would be better for this with more VC oppurtunities.

Academically, to be honest I don't really care about course difficulty. I much prefer practical work, so rigor wise classes at either school probably wouldn't make much a difference to my interests.

Haven't visited either campus, so that's that.

I do realize that depending where you serve your internship will affect the housing costs, however I'm not sure what offices he should apply for. He's majoring in computer science, so is there an office that most computer science majors get sent to, or is preferred among applicants? We live in the south-west, so I was thinking we'd apply to the states in that area so he wouldn't be too far away, keep the cost to send him out their cheaper, and potentially have cheaper housing. What are people's opinion on this?

Lastly, he also has been working full time and only taking a class a semester since that's what we can afford at the moment. From what I understand, you can only apply if you're a full time student during this upcoming fall semester. Is that correct?

I am considering negotiating a small increase however I am worried they might take the offer off the table so I want to make sure that I am not asking for too much.

Also are L4/SDE1/Graduate Roles all the same level? Maybe the reasoning for the slightly lower compensation is due to me being a graduate?

Since the start of corona I've been seeing my main friend group less and less which has caused me to feel really lonely. One of the things that is bothering me is the fact that I am realising this friend group doesn't really share the same interests as me, and lately isn't showing much interest me as well. Currently I am in my third year of a bachelor and because I was still very close to my old friendgroup for the past 3 years, I've never really made any real close friendships in my study which I regret. The distance I have to travel to my school has been one of the reasons it was a bit harder, as I wan't able to hangout that often. To solve this I managed to get place to rent near school twice but had no luck with the corona epidemic that made me leave as the the school closed and all lectures changed to online platform. 

I'm afraid because in 2 months most people of the study will go into minors and internships so I won't be them that much anymore ánd the friend group from highschool is slowly falling apart. 

I am planning to do master which is 2 years but I feel like it will be hard to make new friends over there as there are less people that allready have friendgroups and spend most of their time on studying. 

So in other words I have no clue what to do at this point. Should I talk about this with my parents? Should I take another approach to this thinking wise? Does anyone have some advice for me?"

Should I cover up my software engineering internships and reword them as computer engineering? Is it me or computer engineering internships are really hard to find and it seems that SWE is the mainstream. (maybe I'm not looking well enough) Is anyone in a similar situation as me?

However, since I did not receive a return offer, I was on the job hunt but could not find anything before covid hit. I'm an international student so it was hard to find a lot of companies that were willing to sponsor me in Fall'19. I did have some interviews at the start of the pandemic but none of those turned into offers.

As a result of this, I enrolled in graduate school and am on track to graduate in December of this year. However, it's been tough to get an internship this time and I currently do not have one for the upcoming summer. 

It's just been a very difficult time (I know not just for me but for everyone really) and I'm wondering if employers would care about my lack of internships/technical jobs since September 2019? I've done research in grad school and have published one paper until now but that's been the only big change in my resume aside from a couple of new side projects and my new degree (MS CS).

n86uwg,0,2021-05-09,Pay issues = suspended = fired,Sofakingcute2,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/n86uwg/pay_issues_suspended_fired/,"So i had worked for this company for 5 years, i loved what i did and did an awesome job! My reviews were excellent, always meeting or exceeding expectations. I was QA lab tech at local factory. On factory floor hourly wages was posted throughout the factory. This was for all job titles from maintenance, shipping/receiving, production, even temp pay was posted for all to review. Where i could see that anybody coming in after two years was top out and making what someone who been there for 30 years was, hence the top out. 
In lab we were considered salary non exempt. No top out, raises were yearly. I was on 3rds alone, 2nds had 2 people and 1st had 2 along with manager, chemist and interns when we had them. 3rds was growing at a rapid pace and i voiced my opinions on pay and or adding another person, literally same amount as 2nds. I had multiple meeting with HR, Plant Manager and QA manager, i always got same reply, merits are the SAME across the board for lab techs, and not in budget to add another lab tech on 3rds. 
When they hired two new people onto 2nds, they informed me they were making 14 cents less than me, with little to no experience! 
Called another meeting, at this time they stated they realized i was on low end of merits and didnt quite understand why but would correct it and .60cents would be added onto review raise. Excellent!
Got my review, 60cents was added. I asked new hires, what they got. Now they are making 60 cents less than me. (((So if my generous plant manager didnt give me the 60 cents they would be making same))),,, so me being who i am, called yet another meeting. Voiced my opinion, my PM pretty much called me ungrateful and i wouldnt appreciate anything and would always want more. I basically told him to piss off in a nice way and left the conference room.
2 years passed, we get our reviews/raise for 2021. Now this is where is gets juicy!
I came across lab tech review that is on 1st shift, showing them making FIVE DOLLARS more than me an hour. This said person hardly does any extra work, does the bare minimum and super super slow! So human nature, Im pissed! And i vented to a handful of my coworkers about it. Word got back to HR, PM and my manager. 
I was called into meeting where i was asked about a pay rumor, i stated yeah i heard of something, but its high school all over again in a factory, rumors will happen. He asked if i would tell him where i heard rumor, i politely said no. He said that i was refusing to comply with a serious investigation, i said i wasnt going to rat anyone out, no need for all that. PM and HR left room, came back in. They stated they knew it was me who started it and did i want to start being honest. I said i started it huh!? He said we going keep playing this game. I said fine, yes i came across someone pay, doing same job getting paid more and i felt it was wrong and vented! He said was that in your best interest. I said obviously not since we are having a meeting. He stated i was suspended til further notice, next day was called and terminated!
I was not told exactly why just that details of their findings will be in letter i should get on Monday!
Now i know i have a right to talk about wages. Im sure their reasoning will be misconduct, breaking company policies or something. I may have been in wrong for exposing someone pay (who, btw tells ppl they are getting paid way less(bc obviously they even knows its wrong to a certain extent)). 
I have contacted a lawyer for advice(dunno if i have a case or not, unfair wages?, discrimination?,  wrongful termination?), contacted Labor Board, and unemployment(which i have never been on). 
Has anyone dealt with this kind of situation? Please be kind, as i am my own worst enemy atm. I dont need ppl negative crap."
n87rqz,4,2021-05-09,Should I leave a startup as a co-founder?,ayoungtadpole,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/n87rqz/should_i_leave_a_startup_as_a_cofounder/,"**This is a long post, if you don't want all the details you can read the TLDR.**  


A little bit of a backstory, I'm a Computer Science student who has built a product before (mobile app) and sold it. About 8 months ago, while I was mostly in the ideation phase of a product I was working on with someone else, I was approached by someone, call him Tom for this scenario. Tom had an idea that sounded interesting, it's one of those startup ideas that sounds ""cool"", while the other idea I was working on didn't sound as exciting but was solving a problem I had personally faced and that I was looking forward to building a solution for. I made a huge rookie mistake and decided to join Tom as well and work on his idea concurrently as a CTO. I regret this decision as It has been very busy and stressful since then, as you may imagine juggling 2 tech startups, and later starting the school term at the same time. I definitely have learned how bad of an idea it is to work on 2 startups, and while it may be manageable early on, it will eventually lead to the abandonment of one, unless you are Elon Musk and have significant experience, funding, and resources.  


Tom's idea was in a niche I had absolutely no experience in and I think the novelty of the idea (to me) attracted me to it. In retrospect, I regret not doing my due diligence and thoroughly researching the product, the tech, the market and a range of other things. Since Tom was not very technical and this wasn't his niche as well, it became apparent over time that his understanding of the tech and the product was not detailed enough either. Basically, the initial requirements I was told would need to be implemented were not entirely accurate and we soon realized there was a significant barrier of entry to try and build an MVP that was synonymous with our expected value proposition. However, I had spent around 3-4 months, before coming to a lot of these realisations, building the initial architecture from scratch and building the base auxiliary functionality of our product. We had then hit a roadblock, so I spent less time coding and significantly more time on product development.  


In the meantime, I also continued working on the other startup. Keep in mind, both founders from the 2 startups knew I was working on something else, and yet they were okay with it. They are both pretty new to startups, this is their first startup. However, it was my own fault to join another startup, I should have known better. Fast forward to this point, and we still haven't launched an MVP for either startup, which is bad. The first startup had some issues because something we had spent a lot of time building turned out we wouldn't be able to use, so we ended up just working on the other core functionality and we will launch a private beta soon (like in the next week) from the mailing list we built up. The other startup is significantly more complex with so many other companies and parties we need to consider. As I had mentioned, the barrier of entry was quite steep and due to our lack of experience in this niche, it took us a long time to figure out things we should've known before. Therefore, we haven't even built the core functionality yet, we've built the general required architecture for an application and placeholders for when we are able to get what we need to build out the rest. However, we do have a plan to launch a crowdfunding campaign in the next 2 months (which would need to succeed for us to meet a minimum order requirement) and then continue to build and also fulfill the orders in the following 2 months (I think it will take longer). It's also important to note the entire team is doing school.  


I am seriously considering leaving the startup with Tom for many reasons. The first being the conflict we have on a daily basis. I like Tom and he would make a great friend but it is extremely difficult for us to work together at times. We argue so much and spend hours going back and forth for things I feel are very obvious (and he likely feels his side is very obvious). While I am a co-founder, I am also a CTO, yet I spend most of my time in these product development calls and arguing with him about everything. It is getting exhausting and I think it is because our personality types clash. I am quite analytical, which helps me be a good technical person as well as develop a good product sense. He is on the other hand, more of a driver, which is someone who usually wants to get things done and may overlook a lot of the details. Add to this the fact that he is not technically well versed yet, which notoriously leads to more oversimplification and failure to consider details. Again, I am not trying to bash Tom, I like Tom, but it is becoming very very hard to continue working with him, which I am not blaming on him as I realize we have significantly different personalities and experiences. Tom has been a part of this startup for quite some time, (probably a year and a half at least?) and I also worry that he has developed ""startup goggle"" or tunnel vision about the idea and its success.  


The second reason is that I have realized I don't care too much about the problem we are solving. I have not personally experienced it and so a lot of what we consider are assumptions. In fact, both of us aren't (and never really were) our target customers, which is pretty bad. I am not heavily invested in finding a solution to the problem, mostly because I do not have an emotional connection to the problem, and as I have had to learn more about the niche and dive deep into the tech, product, and market, I have felt that our solution does not offer much more value than what's already there on the market. Basically, at the start I seemed to be attracted to the novelty of the idea and that it sounded ""interesting"", however as I progressed and had to learn more and decipher all the obstacles and the realities of the situation, it became more apparent that we were out of our depth in this niche, and that there was significantly more to it than expected and what Tom had told me at the start. I think the idea still has potential (an accelerator contact said so as well, although it was over a very casual chat), quite a few people had expressed that it was interesting although I don't take that as seriously since that doesn't necessarily mean they will convert to customers especially since again the idea is one of those ideas that sounds ""exciting"" or ""interesting"" to the average person. However, I feel as though the barrier of entry to get to the product is not really worth it, due to my lack of passion in this niche and problem, as well as the different added value it may bring customers. To build this out successfully I would have to learn a significant amount more in this niche to keep up and fulfill my role, however I don't think I have an interest to spend the next couple of years doing that. The other startup does not require such a thing since its niche doesn't really require much specific knowledge whereas this does as the niche is huge and complex.  


Another thing is that the product itself has two major components. Each one alone can be a product by itself, and there are actually products like each one on the market. We are essentially joining the two into one cohesive platform. Another major player of one of the components has also announced that they will add the second component by partnering with another major player of the second component. We plan to have an advantage over them but they also have advantages over us. They are also in another country, so there is a gap in the current country's market which is an advantage. However, I feel the barrier of entry is still significant, and they have also been in the market for almost a decade. We are also partnering with another company to use their first component instead of building it ourselves since it is very expensive or requires a lot of expertise to replicate what they have. However, this is not very good since this component is the most important and the one that the second component relies on. The main worry I have is we now have to basically excel at building two separate components, where we have to compete with all the first component players as well as all the second component players since although we are partnering with the company that will integrate their services into ours, we will still heavily spend some time on the first component with added features and making it better. So I feel as if we are building 2 products at the same time, which is a recipe for disaster. I have also expressed this to Tom, and he is quite adamant on eventually building out a full-fledged solution for the second component as well. I apologize if this was too generic, but I hope you get a general idea.  


So I guess the main thing I am wondering when considering leaving is being okay with this decision. Am I okay with the situation where the company succeeds and does great shortly after, and I did not get any palpable results of my hard work? I think I am since I have learned a lot from this experience, from the business and product side of things, to the tech, and the newfound knowledge in this niche. I feel it isn't the best idea to stay on hoping for this project to succeed while not really enjoying it and having very high stress due to founder conflict and other product things, as well as my other startup, and school or my full time internship which I'm starting soon at Amazon. What is the point of working on something, especially solving a problem I do not personally relate to, that is just making me unhappy when I have the capability to work on other things and I've been blessed with other opportunities? Moreover, due to the current stage of the product, the core functionality hasn't even been built yet (although according to the company we hope it integrate with, this can likely be done in the next few months), but a significant amount of dev work and product development has been done. However, If I were to leave, now would be the time before the core functionality is built and we potentially start getting funding or customers, making it harder for me to leave and where the stakes are even higher. I also would not be leaving Tom in the dust since we have another engineer who is extremely intelligent and who I know can easily step into my role if he wants to. I think the key takeaway is even if the product is very successful and I miss out on a lot of money, do I want to stay on while stressed and frustrated just in case this does happen? I think life is too short for that, and just because an idea may be interesting or even has potential does not mean I have to work on it especially if I am unhappy with my relationship with my co-founder and I am not personally invested or passionate about building a great solution for this problem. If you've read up to this point, that's crazy but I appreciate you and would love to hear your thoughts.  


**TLDR:** I made a rookie mistake and joined a second startup as a CTO and I am now a part of 2 startups and doing school/work and I am not very happy working on the second startup due to founder conflict, lack of experience and passion for the niche and the problem being solved, the high barrier of entry to build the product, and the stress from doing too many things at the same time. It's been 8 months working on the second startup, we have not launched yet but we are supposedly going to in the next few months although the core functionality has not been really built yet although there is a plan for that. I am seriously considering leaving, I will likely have a talk with my co-founder very soon. I am wondering if any of you have been in a similar situation or have any helpful thoughts. My main takeaway is even if the product is very successful and I miss out on a lot of money, do I want to stay on while stressed and frustrated just in case this does happen? I think life is too short for that, and just because an idea may be interesting or even has potential does not mean I have to work on it especially if I am unhappy with my relationship with my co-founder and I am not personally invested or passionate about building a good solution for this problem."

I knew about this issue therefore last year I applied for an internship in the US and in fact got one but due to covid the company where I was supposed to start working cancelled my contract. they told me when the situation will get normal they will allow me to start with them. but I haven't heard back anything from them. so I recently started applying for internships in Germany, unfortunately, no luck so far. Most students suggested to me that it's very difficult to find an English speaking internship in Germany unless someone refers to you.

For my Bachelor's degree, I was living away from my hometown. The first year, I stayed in the college hostel with two roommates. Later one of my roommates(R1), one of our mutual friends(R2) and I decided to look for a flat outside. For the next three years, all three of us stayed together. We changed flats, had a couple of other roommates come and go, but we three were always together.

Now amongst the three of us, I came from the most well-to-do family. That isn't to say that my family is very affluent, but we are financially stable. R1 and R2 both have financial troubles at home and were studying on loan. In the very first year, I had realized that both of them were very bad at handling their money, which became very apparent during the first month of us starting to live in the flat. So I took it upon myself to handle the finances of our home. R1 comes from a rough background and was into smoking and drinking before I even met him. R2 and I were squeaky clean but over the first two years, we got into smoking, drinking, and even weed. Now, even during all that, I was always very conscious of how I spend my money. I set a self-limit of asking for a maximum of 12k (rupees) from my home, and the rest of my expenditure I would handle by doing odd jobs, internships, or by selling articles that I wrote. R1 and R2 would ask for almost 20k and 25k each month, and they would burn through that money. Because of this, often I had to use my own money during the month ends to manage groceries and utilities. So I started collecting the money for the rent, groceries, and bills at the beginning of each month. I maintained records of all expenditures and kept bills of everything in a file.

Both of them knew that my family was better off than theirs, and they would often borrow money from me. I would give them the money at times, but I had my own expenses too. And the way that I saw it, they were getting far more money from home than I was. But being an emotional fool I would succumb eventually.

Around the end of the third year, I finally decided to clean up my act. So I stopped attending most of the parties. I would still do a little bit of everything, but now I kept it very limited, and wouldn't share my packs or stash. I got labeled selfish, but by that point, they combined owed me about 45k. I had told them very clearly that I would take their share of the security deposit to make up for it (even then it would fall short by about 7-8k). The last year, I would stay out for most of the day, and would only go to the flat to sleep. In the final semester, I vacated the flat but kept my name on the lease. I was traveling for interviews so didn't stay there anymore, but due to academic requirements would have to come back for a week every month. So it made sense to keep paying the rent and the lease was in my custody because I no longer trusted them. I had a bad feeling about all of it.

Just as I had feared, they accumulated a huge amount of debt, and in a matter of 3 months, they had completely trashed the place. We lost all the security deposit, and in fact, owed the landlord about 10k in damages. As I was mostly the one responsible for handling everything, the landlord was on my ass for a few months. It was already a stressful time for me as I was trying to get into a good university for my Masters, and was not in the zone to handle all this. Seeing no respite, I gave the landlord the whole story and told him to get in touch with the families of these guys. Shit hit the fan, and the friendship was destroyed.

This was 3 years ago. As of today, I have a stable job, and I am earning quite well to maintain my lifestyle, which if I am being honest is a bit expensive. But I am supporting my own self, so I don't see how anyone else can really criticize it. R1 reached out to me a month ago, asking for a loan of 10k. He said that he also has a job and stuff and he'll pay me back soon. I refused because he barely earns enough to sustain himself, and I know he can't pay me back. We had a huge fight, and he basically tried to guilt me by saying how I should be there for my friends and how it is my moral and social responsibility to help out those in need if I am better off. I said no, and then he spread rumors about me all throughout my social group. Even R2 jumped on the wagon, and two days ago, they both tricked me into a group call where they called me out for my unkindness and shitty behavior.

I don't know what to do. Honestly, I don't think that I should give them the money even though I do have spare cash. But at the same time, I feel guilty because somewhere I still have a soft corner for them. They were there during some of the hardest times of my life, and have been generally supportive of me.

The good people of Reddit, I come to you for judgment. Am I in the wrong here, and what should I do now?


Update:
This is a bit late, I took a break for a while.

So I talked to the two of them. It was a very heavy conversation. I literally listed down all the things I had spent money on for them or the times I gave the money. (i used to note all of it down in a notebook)
They became very defensive and tried to downplay the whole thing.
We had a fight, and a lot of old things came out. I too realized that I had kinda forgotten all the emotional support I had gotten, and it became uncomfortable for a while.
We cut the call saying that we'll reach out whenever we've calmed down.
R1 called me the next day, and we had a heart to heart. He was in a really shitty place and said that he felt bad, and knew he was being unfair to depend on me. We ended up talking for a couple of hours, and I promised that I would help him find a better job (we've ended up working in the automotive industry). I've forwarded a few leads to him, and suggested a few resume tips.
We've texted a bit back and forth, just casual stuff. 
I think we might get through this.

R2 hasn't reached out. I tried calling him a couple of times, including when R2 and me spoke (tried to add him on conference). He hasn't responded. I don't think I'm going to reach out any time soon now.

So yeah, that's that.
Thank you everyone for your suggestions, you've been all very thoughtful and kind.
Best wishes to you!"

I am a mathematics student who is interested in becoming a SWE. However, there aren't many opportunities in my (developing) country so I want to go abroad to a developed country. The best way to find a job at a tech company is to do an internship there and convert to full time in the end, so I decided to look for SWE internships abroad. I am a competitive programmer and I think I have a pretty good chance of passing any coding interview if I am given the chance, but I am afraid that my country of origin will prevent me from getting interviews. Thankfully, I know some people in my CP circle who can give me referrals for several FAANG companies, but how much of a chance do I have even after getting a referral? Because I've heard that even if you have a referral, you might not get an interview if you are a foreigner. How true is that? If you are from a developing country and managed to get an internship abroad, can you share your experience?"

I know both the languages, as well as Python. Now here's the problem:

I am quite comfortable in Python and have even done an internship where I used Python as the programming language and when it comes to solving coding tests that companies conduct, I solve the problems using Python quite comfortably. I mostly use Python for string problems.

When it comes to Java, I've solved about 20 problems(I know its not much) on Leetcode using Java. But this is only on Leetcode where all you have to do is just fill a method with code. In some coding tests you have to enter the entire code from the main method on your own. I suck at reading data from input in Java. I feel this is easier in C and C++. So my Java code is almost always filled with compilation errors. I know the Collection framework in Java better than STL in c++ because of solving some leetcode problems.

C was my first programming language, so I feel at ease when I'm writing code in C and I basically write C++ the same way.  But then again I don't know STL.

So whenever I sit down for one of those coding rounds, I keep switching between languages. Sometimes I write in C and sometimes in Python. When I try to code in Java it always leads to errors even when I know the approach."

I'm struggling to understand the alignment in cad and on the plans.  How is the location of the alignment selected? Does it have to be in the center.of the road?  

Civil 3d draws your surface on profiles from the aligent, so if I was doing a waterline (or sewer or whatever utility) ONLY with no roadway, would it make sense to make the utility line the alignment for more accuracy?

What's the purpose of the alignment?  How do contractors doing the construction and surveyors use the alignment in the field?  

Do the numbers on the alignment matter other than to show distance?  I mean can engineers start the alignment from any number?

I have an average GPA (8.129/10) which is kinda plummeting everything i have done to pursue a PhD in CS (at the top 100 institutions in the world) after my bachelors .

But throughout the research groups i look at, i cannot find a single Indian Undergrad who has made it at a low GPA like mine. Most being from IIT hold 9+ GPAs. I have talked to seniors and some tell me that they reject your profile based on your GPA, even before reading your SOP/LOR and all that stuff.

I've been in an internship as a Network Engineer since the end of first year of college (2019) and worked at many places since then, now I have a software engineer job and planning to choose SE to be my long term career path because I love making Softwares.   
I'm still in school, working as part-time employee only, but school makes me hard to have a good salary or making my way into big corps because 2 big corps have turned me down just because I can't commit full-time. Now I'm working in a start-up company which the job and my colleagues, my boss are very nice, nothing to complain, but the thing that I usually have to spend time for class, exams makes me really hard to involve into big or important projects of the company, really frustrating to me.   
And after first year of college, my family also met a big problem which makes us have big debts and my dad really struggle with my tuition fee every year (which I don't want and we didn't really expect this to happen). My house became a toxic environment because no one is comfortable anymore. You see, obviously if I quit school now and be able to commit full-time, I could have a decent income to solve my family problems, my dad won’t have another 5k$ debt just for my tutition fee, well what kind of people who can just stand there and watch our parents being miserable. I have these thoughts since this incident happen but I tried to be in school because my dad would be heart-broken if I quit (education is highly important to Vietnamese, as all Asians lol) and I think that without a bachelor degree, in the future, the HR or managers of every place I work in will crush me down, means that it will be hard for me to be promoted when I reach 30 or something, at least that is what my seniors told me.  
But my program become very bad lately, since the start of my 3rd year, unrelated courses, all of the greatest teachers have left the program, most of my classmates have sick of this (but they're still trying to finish too), bad syllabus and study schedule, they started to hire bad teachers to replace the great people who left.   
All of these things have make me always on my edge to quit school, I'm just really tired and out of energy whenever I think about this or even go to school. Can anyone give me some tips or advice on this? I have 1.5 more year to graduate, and that’s hella long"

* Honors Algebra II and AP Stats Teacher: I have to imagine this was a very strong recommendation. I’m not usually a very strong math student, but this teacher loved me and recommended me for AP Stats. He told me I am one of the top 10 students he’s ever had and I am still very close with him.
* AP Lang Teacher: I am not particularly close with this teacher, but she liked my writing and I did well in her class. She’s know for writing really good recommendations, so that’s why I asked her to write me one. 
* Leadership and Student Government Advisor: Definitely a strong recommendation, I’ve known him for all 4 years of high  school. He really likes me and depends on me for lots of things getting done around the school. 
* Internship Supervisor: I only submitted this one to Barnard College. The woman who was my supervisor at the Sonia and Celina Sotomayor Internship was a Barnard grad and when I mentioned to her that I was interested in the school, she offered to write a letter to the Dean of Admissions for me. I actually got to read this one because she sent it to me first. It was a very very very sweet letter and she wrote a lot about my leadership qualities and how my work was at the level of the law school students who she had supervised before.

**Interviews**

* American University: Group interview with regional admissions officer at the end of August. It was my first college interview of the process but it went well, there were so few questions that I feel like the didn’t really get to know me though.
* Barnard College: Alumni interview in October. I connected with the interviewer a lot and we had a really good conversation. She answered a lot of my questions, but her kid was in the background crying and she was a bit distracted so it was short. 
* Cornell University: Alumni interview in late February. Super super awkward, by far my worst interview. It was a phone call instead of a Zoom and the interviewer kept saying “one second” in the middle of my answers and leaving for like 2 minutes at a time. I hated every minute of it and I think I kind of made myself sound like an idiot.
* Georgetown University: Alumni interview in early October. Pretty good, I liked my interviewer and I think she liked me. We had a good conversation about our high school experiences. Nothing too special. 
* Princeton University: Alumni interview in early February. Completely the best interview I have ever had, my interviewer and I loved each other and she seems very impressed by me. We bonded over books and love of cooking and we were talking like we’d known each other forever by the end of it.
* Tufts University: Current student interview in late December. It was decent, nothing special. I told her a lot about why I liked Tufts, but it was sort of short because neither of us had a lot of questions.
* Wellesley College: Alumni interview in early December. Super awkward, almost as bad as Cornell. For some reason her video was frozen for me for the entire interview so I was just staring at a frozen contorted face. She was really obnoxious to be honest and all she takes about was Wellesley’s connection with MIT, which I honestly wasn’t very interested in as a humanities applicant. She ended the interview by giving me lots of negative feedback on my resume completely unsolicited. 

**Essays**

* My personal statement was about overcoming my fear of public speaking. It started with an experience I had in middle school and then one I had freshman year of high school. Then it went on to talk about the international public speaking competition I placed second in. It was honestly mediocre and I wasn’t proud of it. I put a lot of pressure on myself about it which definitely made the writing worse.
* My supplements were all much stronger than my personal statement. Columbia University, Smith College, Princeton University, Barnard College, and Boston University were my strongest supplements. American University, Stony Brook University, Wellesley College, and Tufts University were my weakest supplements.

The undergraduate portion is completed in 2 years and the pharmacy graduate school is completed in the last 3 years. During the graduate section, there are basically no breaks as the typical 4-5 year program is condensed into 3 years and there are cumulative tests every 3 weeks which have material from all 5 of her classes on one test.

She is currently on year 3 of the program (first year in the grad school) with 2 more years remaining.

**Crisis Background:**

My gf has been asking for career advice from the pharmacists at her workplace and COVID clinic (one of them is the president of the local pharmacists association) and they've all been telling her not to do pharmacy as it is a dying field and she is unlikely to get a job or residency and will likely be stuck doing retail. One of her pharmacists even had a residency and told her that it still took 8 months to get a job after. Her cousin is a retail pharmacist at CVS and has spoken to my gf and my gf's father and advised her against entering pharmacy as she is treated poorly by management and is not compensated particularly well, especially in comparison to other medical jobs. Her father basically said the cousin is stupid and told her to keep doing pharmacy. He works as an engineer and has no background working in any healthcare related field.

Some more info on my gf before I go into her crisis:

My gf has wanted to become a physician's assistant (PA) since high school, as her favorite and best classes are biology and anatomy, which cater more towards becoming a PA than a pharmacist, which requires more chemistry that she is not as good at.

When she was deciding on colleges, her dad told her that PA's don't make money and there was no point in working as an assistant to a doctor and she might as well just become a doctor. She tried to argue for it when she wanted to go to a state college but her father put his foot down and told her to accept the accelerated program or he wouldn't financially support her for college which locked her into pharmacy. This doubly sucked as he supported her 100% the first two years but suddenly decided that he would only be supporting her 50% financially for the remaining 3 years, which required her to take out student loans. She is currently $30k in debt with a projected additional $60k for her next two years. Her school is a private school that is extremely expensive but does not carry any reputation or prestige.

As far as school goes, my gf is very unmotivated since she does not want to become a pharmacist so it is difficult for her to find motivation to study. She doesn't struggle with the material but it's tough for her to find any motivation for herself to study.

**Crisis Situation:**

The current crisis my gf is having is that she is debating between leaving pharmacy school and switching to PA or sticking it out in pharmacy school. However before she decides, she wants to know:

\-How is the job market for pharmacists? All the pharmacists she has spoken to have said it is terrible and they are the only healthcare worker getting pay cuts instead of raises.

\-Is there any chance she gets a residency at all? What is the outlook for residencies?

\-Has anyone had a career switch or know anyone who had a career switch from pharmacy to something else and if so, how did it go?

Her school is not well known and many pharmacists that she has worked with have expressed disdain for her school as they believe the accelerated program is not very good.

For her right now, she's pretty much stuck with two scenarios:

**Scenario 1:**

She can drop out and pursue PA- however, this is where her unique situation comes into play. Should she drop out, she is unsure of whether her dad will kick her out of the house and continue to financially support her in any way. This means potentially losing housing, car, cell phone, and health/car insurance.

She also will not have an undergraduate degree and it is unclear how many of her classes would transfer over or if she would have to start over at a CC or local state school. Her work as a pharmacy intern would discontinue as she would not be eligible because she would not be attending a pharmacy school so she would immediately lose all of her income. She has told me many of the class requirements for PA do not overlap so she would have to redo 2-3 years of undergrad before doing PA grad school, which would potentially worsen her debt situation. Her dad is very deadset on her becoming a pharmacist and will likely refuse to financially support her.

**Scenario 2:**

She can stick it out (as she only has 2 more years) and then do retail/work for a few years and save up and then switch into PA school. However, her mental health is down the drain, she is extremely depressed and has anxiety and sees a therapist for it. A large part of it is due to the fact that she is stuck in an extremely fast-paced accelerated program that she does not even want to be a part of and is only reluctantly continuing as she is not sure how bad leaving it would make her life.

She is also unsure about career switching later as she does not know if she will be able to financially or mentally take returning to school to become a PA.

She has not brought up any of this to her parents, so no decision has been made.

Any advice or even words of support would be great!

TL;dr

My gf is in an accelerated program that is making her mental health decline rapidly by the day. She wants to leave and become a PA but is unclear how badly leaving will affect her family/home situation. She is seeking any advice on which side to take, whether to ride it out in pharmacy school or leave and potentially get kicked out of her home with no income."

Its mostly for education, but he will definitely be contributing to building the software/our product as well. We will be paying a hourly rate that he has agreed to, for 20 hours a week commitment.

My question/concern - whats the best way to hire him/which extra forms past the contract does he need to sign? 3 options I see: 

1. paid internship
2. independent contractor 
3. employee

This is the LLC's first 'hire' and I just want us and him to be covered on any tax front. Past the summer there is a high likelihood that he remains on in a part time role (during the college semester), but we can figure that out then, for now we are only ready to commit to a role for the next few months. 

(Also please don't comment on the risks of hiring friends/family, I am fully aware on that front. I just wanted to add that info as there is a fair amount of trust which I feel changes the dynamic a little compared to hiring a stranger)"

Ever since covid began we would spend almost every day together, since she’s not working right now and I work from home most days.

This week has been tough: I’ve been given more work than I should at my internship and have been feeling really stressed out because of a thesis I have to write in the mean time. I’ve been wanting to quit everything. I have a history of depression and suicidal thoughts that still occur from time to time. This week has been one of those times.

So for a few days I’ve been really sad/bummed out, leaving me to act really distant to my sister. Just the same week, she has started to see a friend of hers 24/7 (that, she says, she can’t see for too long or she gets annoyed), paying little attention to me.

Three days ago, we had a big fight about this and haven’t spoken ever since. I told her that I was hurt from her lack of consideration, and that my attitude was a cry for help she didn’t respond to.

I’ve been drowning in my thoughts ever since. I feel like I’ve been unfair to her, I know I’m not (and should not be) the center of her world. But I can’t stop alienating myself from the people I love when I feel bad. At the same time, I’m hurt by the fact that she wouldn’t even try to help me when I needed her to. 

I just feel so bad about this situation. Any insight would be appreciated."
n8oo07,3,2021-05-09,Need advice - third-year college student wanting to do PEN testing,PanisPuncher,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/n8oo07/need_advice_thirdyear_college_student_wanting_to/,"Hey everybody,

I am 18 and will be graduating this week with my Associates of Information Technology and am planning on studying Cyber Security this coming fall for my upper-level classes. I have already taken a few classes during my second year and have a good foundation in Java, HTML, CSS, and  JS. Currently, I am taking a networking class and plan on taking the CompTIA network+ exam (the class prepares you for it so I might as well).

I plan on looking for jobs in the coming week as I graduate with my associates and am hoping I can lock in some experience doing something in the network space (internship or part-time while I study) to help my resume look more appealing in the coming years.

My end goal is to be able to get a job as a PEN tester after I graduate with my bachelor's, however, I am not too sure what to do in order to get there. I assume the Network+ exam will help me out a little bit but what other skills are the most important for me to learn? Are there other certifications I can take? What else should I be learning in my free time to really set myself upright?

Any advice would be much appreciated,

Thank you :)"

And Penn State was a good 6-8k cheaper for me and my friends are going there too. The Penn State alumni network is also fantastic. Do you think I made a mistake by selecting UC Irvine? What exactly is the situation at UC Irvine? Will it help me get a good job? How are the research and internship opportunities. is UC Irvine a better option than penn state in terms of future jobs and internship perspective. I might also consider doing data science / analytics and UC Irvine is ranked in top 20 for it. Do this rankings really matter? Unless u go to a good school. Did I made a mistake by choosing uci over penn state."

&amp;#x200B;

I am 22 and a 3rd year student in a field of study I love to the death of me, but the univeristy and my internship have made me almost hate it. I have been losign motivation since corona started and I dont know what to do. I am currently behind on my internship progress and I am at risk of having all my work not count, and I actually want it to be so. The company I am interning in is not what I hoped would be. I am in a struggle now to call it a study delay and restarting my internship in september and delaying my study for half a year. I  have too much on my plate, I still work part time on top of my 9-5 monday to friday internship and it has made me even more burnt out than I expected, I have alwasy been known for taking punishment, but recently I have too many thing to be responsible for, including takign care of another person (my brother) since now I am mostly financially responsible for. I am scared to make a decision and its giving me massive anxiety and I am scared to even think of another study delay, I have already dropped out of a course and had 2 gap years. I am worried, should I take a study delay, should I destroy myself even more in an attempt to make my internship count? My close friends say I shoudl just take the L and take the delay and take care of my mental heatlh, but I have too much riding on this choice. I dont know if this is the right sub reddit to ask this in, but its the only one that came to mind.

The problem is that in all of the research opportunities I've had led to nothing being published, and they're probably not the best sources for rec letters either. When the work isnt super structured, I kind of struggle to produce results. I've TAd 2 classes and will have had 3 internships by the start of my 4th year. How much will my lack of research and good rec letters hold me back?"

I’ve only worked with Python a couple times, but I have tons of experience with MATLAB so I’m not exactly a beginner when it comes to coding. I was wondering what resources were available online to introduce Python and learn the syntax and code structure so I don’t come into work looking like an idiot. 

I’m mostly looking for help figuring out which MATLAB commands translate over to Python and how arrays and plotting and general math work, also I’m looking for a good IDE to work in. Any help would be great, thanks!"

- Numerous involvements in extracurricular activities (most of which holding leadership positions), internships, with some non-profit volunteer work

- 2 years of experience at a top multinational corp, with a proven track record of over performing 

I have not yet taken the GMAT. 

I know my GPA is only one piece of the picture but I worry that it might shatter my chances of getting into HBS (my top choice), Stanford, Wharton, Kellogg, Booth, LBS, INSEAD, etc. 

How realistic will it be for me to get in? Should I put in a few more years of work experience? I know for a fact that getting an above average score in the GMAT is a non-negotiable now, but I want to know what else I need. 

I am open to getting an admissions consultant but first I want to know if it is realistic for me to get in in the first place.

I am a student who will start a major in Math &amp; CS next term. Up until now I was doing a math major and I decided to change my program earlier in March. 

I have heard many people talking about internships and stuff, but I am getting really stressed out because for now I do not have much CS background except for Python.  

Therefore to save myself from having panic attacks and drinking problems, it would be great if some of you could help me out with the following questions. 

Do you think I will have a better chance at getting an internship after taking more advanced classes such as COMP250/206/251? Which COMP courses do you recommend taking to increase my employability? 

I am planning on learning some programming languages during the summer using online courses, which languages do you think is the most competitive out there jobwise?  For now I am deciding between R-studio, C+ and HTML. 

Other than MyFuture, Caps, and the McGill resources, what other resources did you use to find your internship?  

When it comes to networking, what did you do to build your connections? I have read about people having coffee chats but that sounds kinda weird to me especially during the pandemic. I have attended career fairs and workshops in the past, but are there more resources outside of McGill that could help me to meet more people from the industry? 

I don’t think I will get anything CS related this summer, so I was considering just doing internships that are offered in different domains such as social work and charity activities, do you think it is worth doing? (Of course I love the things that I have looked at, but just in case I do not have enough time to do everything, is it gonna help if I have experience in other domains than my area of study?) 

I am sorry for my long tiring questions, but it would be very nice if you could help me out. I will really appreciate it. 😄

Thank you in advance and have a wonderful summer!"

I plan on going into industry right after graduation but might go back to school (Master's PhD?) in the long term. Undergrad RAs at my uni are not paid but are compensated with academic credits while CS TAs are paid quite well comparatively. Research can take up a lot of time depending on the team while TA is 5-10 hours a week (more doable for me).

Internship is another story, I've only finished my first year of college so opportunities are a bit sparse to say the least... I was wondering if anyone can talk about how feasible doing an internship and school is.

1. How many people actually get to go on exchange programs? (if the covid situation improves) I heard that not all REP students go on exchange in Y3 (not too sure about this) and that for NUS, only 2000+ ppl get to go on exchange a year.

2. How are the internship opportunities like? Does the school provide internships to choose from or do you source for your own internships? 

3. Considering REP is $17.9k a year and NUS CS is about $8k, is REP worth it? (for REP, you graduate with a Masters in tech management and degree in engineering science) 

4. How is REP hall life? I heard that REP students can only get a double room with a Non-REP student. Is this guaranteed for 4.5 years or only the first year? 

5. As I want to specialise in CS in year 2 of the REP, is it possible to focus on let’s say computer graphics? or is it limited to AI? I checked the NTU CS webpage and it seems to be heavily focused on AI and did not mention anything else on other areas of CS like web/game development, etc."

I am currently a CS major and a senior in standing. I switched from biology to software engineering the end of my sophomore year, so I was very behind and in order to graduate on time and to save me thousands of dollars (from taking extra semesters) I took about 3 summer classes each summer on top of the usual 4-5 classes during a normal semester. I am about to graduate soon, but since I have been rushing and catching up with the large amounts of classes I needed to take in a quick time, I've had no time for internships or any real world situations. Graduating without an internship I feel like is going to make it super hard to get an entry level job, as employers would probably hire someone that has had an internship or CS work experience over me.

Has anyone here been in the same boat? Or has tips for what I should do to stand out as a good hire? I have a few projects on my github, and my senior group project is pretty decent (but is focused on cybersecurity not software engineering)."

In these unprecedented times, I don't know if this the right sub to ask this but if it is not, please direct me in the right direction.

Timeline:

1 April 2021 - I receive the offer letter to join a reputable MNC, let's call it **""P""**.  The DOJ on the job offer letter said

&gt;""If you acceot this offer, your commencement date with us will be on or before 5 May, 2021, or such other date as may be communicated by us to you in writing.""

2 April 2021 - I put in the resignation and started to serve a 1 month notice period at my then employer **""I"".**

During that month, I receive various emails from P regarding pre-joining tasks to be completed by me before my DOJ, 5th May.

3 May 2021 - The service period ends and I am expecting the mail containing joining instructions from P. But I receive no such mail, only mails regarding uploading more documents and formalities on their portal. I uploaded all the asked documents well before the deadline and was patiently waiting for the final joining call/mail.

5 May 2021 - DOJ according to the offer letter but no communication from P. I tried calling all the HR's who contacted me during the joining process. Finally, I got in contact with an HR and she told me that the hiring process was delayed due to Covid and it is taking them time to manually check all the documents of the new joiners as they did mass hiring this season.

6 May 2021 - I tried to contact the same HR by sending a mail and she told me the same reason for the delay and that my new DOJ will be 19th May 2021 and I will receive further communication regarding it.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, I am fairly new to the corporate world (graduated 2020, no internships before) and I have no clue about whether they are trying to trick/lie to me, is my offer cancelled, should I start looking for a new job or should I just patiently wait for their communication?

The situation is very new to me and I am a bit unnerved by it as I am unemployed as of now and in grave need of money and all this, is adding mental pressure which I could handle much efficiently if I had a clear cut answer from the organisation. But, that seems to be out of the question as their HR's mostly do not pick up the call or reply to the mails.

Any help is be appreciated and if you can help reach this post to an industry veteran or a seasoned HR professional then I will be grateful to you."

During the internship, though my position was called ""backend engineer"", but my duty was actually using AWS CDK to do IAC for our service, I had a great time learning cloud services and knowledge about internet, and the crew was really nice to me. But because of the company's lack of budget, they had to let go all the devs including me. After this short but awesome experience, I was almost certain that I want to be a backend Dev in the future, so I started to develop my own side project.  I am an admin in an English study group and we hold events every week, I decided to created a web app to optimize the registration process so I started develop it with something I haven't tried out yet. 

Right now the first version of my app is done on the backend, but because of my friend (she's in charge of UI designing), my side project is not ready to be deployed yet, so I thought maybe I could demonstrate my backend code and get into the job market.

After a week of browsing and applying some of the junior jobs, I feel a bit frustrated, I feel like I suit most of the junior job and still feel like I don't. I really don't know what should I do now, should I keep searching for the job? or should I learn something else? 

If I should learn something else, where should I go? should I keep optimizing my backend service, or just keep learning new things? My friend always tells me to ""master"" one thing, and I honestly don't know where to start, I am currently learning data structures, CS knowledges and algorithms when I am not searching for jobs, is that sufficient? I've been considering maybe getting a AWS certificate, but I really don't know if it helps since $150 is quite expensive for me at the moment..

I truly love this industry and the knowledge of everything about this, but I just feel so lost in this sea of tools, languages and knowledge..

I’m kinda second-guessing my decision, and I still can reply to ITMO until mid-August

&amp;#x200B;

Besides the cost, another factor is that I did USACO and now consider participating in ICPC in college. ITMO is top 1 for competitive programming, and their couch starts teaching you on day 1. Also, they separate freshmen by their math/cs proficiency into groups of 25-30, so that they don‘t have lectures with like 1000 students (it’s always 25-30), and all of your classmates are approximately your level. 

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, 90%+ of their students are national (like Russian alternatives to USACO Plat and USAMO qualifier) or international (IOI) math/CS Olympiad medalists. Idk, I just think it would be cool to have that kind of classmates, compared to those who major in CS just because it’s CS. And I also speak Russian (we immigrated from a Russian-speaking country only 6 years ago), so fitting in wouldn’t be that much of an issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

On top of that, JetBrains, Yandex, VK, and Uber Russia’s autopilot teams recruit directly from the Math+CS program, which is about 150 students total, so there shouldn’t be too much competition in terms of getting a job in St. Petersburg

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, it‘s Georgia Tech. Like, \~Georgia Tech\~. The main reason why I chose it initially and still partly lean towards is that I’m ~~a prestige whore~~ afraid I won’t have enough connections from ITMO to go back to the US and get a decent job here. But recently, I started thinking that a 120k+ job isn't guaranteed after GT either, but the 120k+ loan is, and now I just don't know what to do anymore

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, I spoke to some ITMO students, and they said that each year (excluding 2020) 7-8 students from the top group alone intern at Google, and a few other students had internships at Snapchat, Facebook/Instagram, Lyft, and Spotify; however, most of the internships take place in Europe and \*very\* rarely (0-2/year for freshmen and sophomores) in New York and the Bay Area

I'm currently pursuing a Master in Data Science after having obtained a Bachelor in Computer Science.

How likely is it to get one (probably in a *big* city) after a few months, given that I won't have any work experience (aside from an internship) ? 

I'm trying to assess the risks of being unemployed for too long. Thus, this is independent from the visa application process. Here, I'm assuming that I will have a visa without work experience, which is achievable according to my score. It means that the employer won't have to take that many risks to organise my trip. However, remote interviews would be mandatory. Is this an issue ?

Did I make the right move?,SwissBliss,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/n944bn/just_gave_up_a_first_job_offer_graduate_program/,"So I'm 24 and doing my Master's degree in International and European Business here in Switzerland, and on June 30th I'm handing in my thesis to be done.

The last few months I've been applying to internships, graduate programs, and entry-level jobs all over the place (home and abroad).

Got a call from Caterpillar that they liked my profile for a graduate program in Strategy &amp; Finance. Interview was set 2 days later. The next day I'm made aware that a second department (Aftermarket Solutions) is interested and that I'll have to do a second interview a couple hours after the first. Prepared well and both interviews went really well. The very next day I'm told the 2nd team wants to do a quick informal call.

Later in the day, I'm told I'm receiving an offer from the Aftermarkets Solutions position, but the Strategy &amp; Finance one wanted someone with a bit more finance experience. 13 month program, 60k annual (keep in mind this is Switzerland).

Here's the deal. I'm much more interested in Strategy and Development than pure Sales. So I send them an email saying that 1. The start date is difficult. It's literally the day after I hand in my thesis and in a different city. After a pandemic and a Master's degree I wasn't sure I'd be able to perform so soon. and 2. Inquiring about a potential Strategy role since during the informal interview one of the guys told me that if I was interested in that he could put in a good word for me.

Weekend went by and I just got a call from HR/talent acquisition where they basically told me that they were a bit concerned that maybe the role they offered me wasn't exactly the path I wanted to go down. And it's true, I don't really want to go into straight on the field sales, and they said that this is really a training program and that shifting into Strategy isn't really an option after the 13 months, you'd just keep going further into Sales. It was a very cordial and warm call, they thanked me for being transparent, and they asked me if I was ok with dropping this offer. I said Yes, which was difficult but felt right I think.

They told me that they can tell that I'd have done a great job even if it wasn't exactly what I wanted to do (and mentioned my transparency and professionalism) and the Talent lady said that they'd keep my profile very close and that she'd tell me if she sees a better fit for me at some point. And that if not, they encourage me to apply next time again.

So there it is. I turned down my first paid job after a really mentally difficult weekend. I hesitated whether to just sign the offer and contract, or whether to bring up my concerns. I opted for the latter. I think I made the right choice to not take this, allow me to focus on my thesis, maybe enjoy my summer, and hopefully find a great other opportunity a bit later in the year that's gonna set me up in a career I love. I hope I made the right call, cause dropping the chance for experience and 60k was tough, but I think I have a good enough profile to not kill myself mentally and go down a line I'm worried about/not fully happy with."

I'm a PhD student coming to the end of my PhD at a good University in the UK. When I chose the PhD, I was set on academia as a career, but like many people, I've realised I absolutely hate it. I'll finish the PhD, but then I want to jump ship. I wish I did sooner. 

My issue is that I just don't know *what* opportunities there are. Specifically, what **non-academic** jobs do people do after their PhD? 

My PhD was in HCI and Data Science; specifically applying unsupervised learning to an accessibility problem. I'm very comfortable with the accessibility side of things, but I don't think I know enough maths for a true Data Science job. 

I've had past internship experience as a software developer, but I've missed out on three years on paid software development work. That said, I have coded quite a lot for the PhD. Would I still be looking at a junior position if I went this route?

I would not be able to stop working to attend school only, however my full time schedule is only 3 12's a week, Fri, Sat, Sun. With the remaining 4 days, in your guys' experience, would I be overworking myself if I began going to school full time during the week? 

What kind of hours would you say you put in on a weekly basis between classes and homework/studying? As I work in EMS, I have the delightful perk of ""if nooone is dying, I can do whatever I want at the station"", which working in a rural area, I frequently have 6-8 hours of my shift free to do whatever, including homework. 

Also, to finish off my large list of questions, I understand internships are a thing in the world of computer science. Because I cannot leave my job to attend a summer or winter internship, would this seriously hamper my ability to land a gig, or could personal projects on GitHub make up for that?

Thank you for any suggestions and advice!"

I want to know which countries out of Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand, and those in Europe are viable options to look for new grad software engineering jobs in? I know it's a long shot but some countries have a more relaxed work visa sponsorship system than the USA. 

\- How likely is it for someone who has 9 months of internship experience to get a job in any of these countries as a new grad software engineer? 

\- Which of these countries are more likely to provide work visa sponsorship to new grads?

I'm sure questions regarding ""getting started"" have been asked ad-nauseum (and I've been reading several), but I am still feeling anxiety and confusion on what to do myself.

I have a bachelor's in elementary education and am one course (my capstone) away from my master's in education (I realized that I can't see myself in education, which is why I have not finished.) I have 6 years of teaching experience but no experience in any other industry.

Finding a new job in tech (specifically software engineering/developing) seems very interesting and lucrative, as I learned how to code in HTML and CSS back when I was in middle and high school to create websites. I don't know where to begin if I were to make this a profession, though.

I live in Arizona and relocating is not an option as I have a family; how likely will I be able to find a job? Is it worthwhile for me to pursue a post-bacc in CS and possibly a master's to follow? Relying on being self-taught seems risky for job prospects and employers; I would imagine a bootcamp-type program would be better, but how marketable is it? Is it possible for someone to shadow or intern to learn and gain experience, or would I seem bizarre starting to ask companies for this opportunity?

I'll also add that I have a good friend who earned his bachelor's degree in computer science and it took him a year to find a job. It makes me question if developers are actually in demand, or if the market is over-saturated already."

So I am currently on 2 weeks internship in a company. And my job currently is to take old webpages and give them a new coat. But I also have to find a way how to replace old file system that was writen in PHP into a new language. You click on a file and download it/open it in your computer.

And I want to use C# and .NET but I can't find any courses/videos/tutorials that show how to create a simple Webpage from scratch, with or without  simple file downloading, every course I found shows how to work with SQL databases with predefined webpage layout etc...  and how to create a simple Film/music database which I don't want as the file system doesn't use SQL database or any kind of databases, you basicaly drop the file into a folder and reference it in the HTML page, you than click on a link and it downloads the file into your computer.

If this is not possible to create in .NET, my other option would be to use Node.Js and I heard that it is slow.

So in short - Can I use C# and .NET to create a static webpage with links that lead to other webpages ? and are there any courses/videos that show how to do it ?"

My father is friends with the vice president and they are looking for someone younger who is willing to learn RPG IV and work on a large team with senior developers. Before hearing about this position I was planning on working at a Walmart or something that would just hold me over till the fall semester.

I'm a little worried about learning such an old language, but at the same time, I'm so desperate to gain some industry experience. I read a post from a few years ago that mentioned RPG and everyone commenting said that it was a horrible idea, but I still am not sure. They want to keep me on until I graduate and then offer me an actual position at the company.

Just to fill in some background here; I'm about halfway through my Junior year at college and working towards a CS Bachelor's degree. I'm sick of working at small jobs and I just want to have a job that correlates with my studies.

This is the only offer I've gotten and I'm not expecting to find another one until maybe next year.

Is this a bad idea?

Is taking a job in an obsolete language really that detrimental to my career? I figure that working with and learning from senior developers would counteract the negatives."

My organization is offering to pay for another certification including an in-person training camp and I am having trouble figuring out which would be the best for my situation. I am very interested in Digital Forensics/eDiscovery/Incident Response and want to grab a certification that will be worthwhile to break into the field. I plan on continuing my career with the federal government and in the foreseeable future plan to move into one of the above roles. I would consider myself an intermediate level digital forensic investigator and am concerned on the difficulty of the GCIH and GCFA having not taken any training past college and the small amount of forensic relevance in the Security+

All of the below fulfill some level of DoD 8570 Certification Requirements:

I'm (22/F) currently a 4th-year physiology student, also working on my minor in pharmsci. I still need 2 semesters to finish off my degree, as I made some major changes during my freshman/sophomore year that threw me behind. I am thinking about taking a year off of school to get my shit together and hopefully return with the drive to finish my last 2 semesters strong.

My current GPA is 3.1. Here's a little rundown of the hits on my transcript I've gotten over the past 4 years:

* Got a D in gen chem 1 my freshman year, retook sophomore year and got a B
* Got a D in biology sophomore year, retook sophomore year and got a C
* Dropped physio/anatomy 1 with a W sophomore year, retook junior year and got a B
* Got an E in ochem 1 junior year, retook junior year and got a C
* Dropped ochem 2 senior year, am currently waiting to fail my final and will need to retake a 3rd semester

I initially had plans to apply for pharmacy school after undergrad, but 1) unlikely that I'd get accepted with my bad grades and 2) I just don't think I want to pursue a career in pharmacy in the long run. I currently work in a pharmacy as an undergrad intern and I'm about ready to just put in my 2 weeks. All of my peers know exactly what they want out of their undergraduate experiences and I still have absolutely no idea.

I've realized I have a lot of attention issues. I'm impulsive and indecisive and it always kicks my ass. I forget about many things and procrastinate at absolutely every single instance I'm given the opportunity to. I've gone through this over and over; a normal person should use their screw-ups to better themselves in the long run and I obviously have not done that. It's not the content of the classes that is difficult for me to understand; it's the fact that I can't put in the effort to do well. I don't want to finish off poorly and then have no way to explain my consistently bad academic performance thus far. I think it's best I just stop for now and try to figure out what I'm doing wrong, or figure out a way to do things differently that will work for me when I return in a year.

I don't have the entire next 2 semesters off planned out, but there are a lot of things I think I could benefit from with the time off:

* I want to bring up my mental health to my doctor and give myself time to work with her for diagnoses/treatment if it ends up being the case that I need it (I exhibit a lot of the symptoms associated with ADHD and high functioning anxiety).
* I need the time to focus on my physical health. I want to learn how to properly meal plan and get into a gym routine. I'm obese and was diagnosed with hypertension at 18, have gained a lot of weight over the past 4 years. 
* I could find a new job full-time, rack up some savings over a semester and pay off a chunk of my \~5k in credit card debt and some of my uni debt.
* I'll have some time off to find shadowing opportunities in healthcare to solidify what I want to pursue after undergrad.
* Hiking to/from school will also be an issue for my family and me right now, as we only have 1 vehicle and have really adjusted to me working and going to school from home. I plan to buy a vehicle at the end of the summer but worry about making payments if I can't work as much because of school.
* I want to work on moving out really soon. My mom's a bipolar conservative that I fight with a LOT and I think this contributes a lot to my lack of attention and low moods.
* Last fall I launched orders for some digital art merch I made and ended up selling out, which was really exciting. I'd love to put some effort during my free time into bettering my art skills and possibly expanding my work into a small side business.
* Finally, plan to return either Spring 2022 or Fall 2022 to finish off my last year in undergrad with a 3.0+ GPA (assuming I do better lol)

I know taking time off of school isn't the end of the world, but it feels like I'm making a last-resort move despite all of these good things since I've already been in school for 4 years. My whole perception of the future has kinda revolved around school even though my performance is bad, so deciding to take time off is daunting. My mental and physical health really keep me from pursuing college opportunities that have been open to me since starting college. I'm embarrassed that I let my situation get this bad. I just do not have the motivation for school and I regret waiting this long to realize that what I've been doing is not working. I really hope my perception of school can change over the next year, and that I'll be able to finish off strong with a better idea of what I want in the future.

Thanks for reading if you made it thus far. :)

 TLDR; I am 4 years into college and am thinking hard about taking a year off of school to get my shit together and hopefully return with the drive to finish my last 2 semesters strong."

n9ec2t,1,2021-05-10,How to stop being indecisive and stop making stupid decisions?,corpsebride26,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/n9ec2t/how_to_stop_being_indecisive_and_stop_making/,"My husband 29M and I 27F married four months back after three years of being together. Initially, when we started out, he was the mature one and I was immature, careless, and irresponsible. But, over the course of time, I have grown up, becoming serious about my health, career etc. He has acknowledged it.

But, I'm finding myself in a difficult situation now, especially in the past one week. My husband's father (57yo) is terminally ill (which made him grow up earlier than any man of his age should), on immunosuppresents, and when he tested Covid positive, my husband has been under a lot of stress of taking care of parents, and also me. I try to be responsible and try to help him, but I don't know what to do. And in the cases when I know what to do, I'm scared of doing it, because whatever decisions I tend to take backfire. So, normally, I consult him and his views, even for trivial stuff like should I clean the room now or later? Etc.

Things blew up for good when today, after reading about the black fungus and how it affects Covid positive patients with suppressed immunity, I realised that I hadn't emptied the trash in my room, which had two week old, rotten fruit with fungus in it. It's not that I forgot. I had it in my mind that I need to empty it. But, a couple of times, I asked him if I should clean the room, and when he said not now, I was scared to nag him further about it. And given the vulnerability of my FIL to such situations, my husband got furious than usual, saying I need to own up to my decisions and cannot be depending upon his judgement, and need to start supporting him instead of being a burden. He even said that I cannot raise children if I'm ever this way.

Past experiences have showed me that I tend to take bad decisions, not purposefully but because I have had reasoning which convince myself that they are right. And the reasonings are always convoluted, not straightforward or what my husband would call, sensible. But, they have always felt sensible to me. This is the case even at work, eg., during my past internship, I travelled up and down 6 hours for an interview which lasted 5 mins, which my coworker said I was stupid enough to do.

I want to tell you that I'm not a below average person in terms of intellect. I have been a good performer at school and uni, and at my current job, where I am doing what I'm told. I'm still not very socially aware of how to behave or what to say to people.

I'm genuinely hoping for advice, because I do not want to let my husband down. Can somebody help?"
n9een3,6,2021-05-10,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (5/10/2021),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/n9een3/weekly_job_qa_thread_5102021/,"Hi all,

Here is the sixty-third installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

n9f40v,1,2021-05-10,"Accepted a post-graduate internship offer but potentially have a full-time offer coming. How should I navigate this in terms of short-term job-market considerations, long-term career considerations, ethics, etc.?",assbaring69,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/n9f40v/accepted_a_postgraduate_internship_offer_but/,"I am a master's student who formally accepted an internship offer from Company A (signed offer letter, drug tests completed) back in March as I felt risk-averse about my ability to get a full-time job right out of the program (I will graduate in two weeks) and felt that the internship would be a good safety net against complete unemployment for at least a few months, as well as an entry into a good full-time position. For a frame of reference, I think a solid 40%+ of my cohort still have not found a job. So this seems like it was a safe/smart decision to make.

However, last week, I received a potential full-time job offer from Company B, with which I had interviewed prior to accepting the offer from Company A. (I had turned down the offer earlier because B wanted me to start right away but I had to complete my master's program. However, now they say that their position is still open three months later so they are re-offering me the job.)

Here are some important details about the nature of these two offers:

1. Company A's internship position was not introduced through my school's career services, and I have not even registered my acceptance in the school's system, so technically my school and future students will not be negatively affected by my reneging and neither can they ban me from continuing to use the school's career and networking services.
2. I did not act in bad faith by continuing to recruit after accepting A's internship offer. B's full-time offer was the result of an interview conducted before I accepted A's offer -- an interview that I had good reason to believe was a dead end as B said it could not wait for me to graduate to take  the offer (something that B later changed its mind about).

So now I am currently considering the two choices from several different angles, and my pros and cons for reneging in favor of the full-time offer at Company B are as follows:

**PROS FOR JOB AT COMPANY B / CONS FOR INTERNSHIP AT COMPANY A**

1. Company B is a solid job at a solid company, with pretty much the same size and reach as Company A -- and the difference is that it is a full-time offer. **Security in the COVID job market is very important to me.** Out of the 100+ full-time jobs that I have applied to since January, excluding the offer at Company B, only two of them invited me to the final round, both of which rejected me. And the fact that a master's program still has 40%+ of students without a job two weeks before graduation is also not a positive number.
2. I can see it being a decent starting point for my long-term career aspirations.
3. I know someone who worked in the exact same position I will be hired for in Company B, and they said that even on the low end, **my hourly wage (converted from yearly salary) would be at least equal to that of the internship at Company A, plus it is something I will be earning for more than 3 months, unlike the internship.**
4. Company B has really good work/life balance.
5. Because I happen to have insider information on the job, and because the job entails guaranteed full-time employment, I have more certainty about the Company B job than the Company A internship.

**CONS FOR JOB AT COMPANY B / PROS FOR INTERNSHIP AT COMPANY A**

1. Through talking with both companies' managers, I have the sense that Company A is more invested in me.
2. Similarly, the internship is more suited to my interests and skills, and while Company B is not a bad place to start my career, **I can picture Company A, and the internship in particular, being better suited to my career goals.**
3. Reneging on an internship offer will burn bridges for me at Company A -- bridges that I have actually managed to maintain fairly well in the months between when I accepted the internship offer and now.
4. I am aware of potential worse outcomes such as **getting on an unofficial blacklist**. Recruiters may pass my dirty record on to other companies, or they get hired by some other company C and I end up on its blacklist as well. I've read stories that people who renege on offers have had this reach their new company, which promptly reneged its own offer as well. Ethically, this may have a mark on my professional reputation.

**TOSSUPS**

1. On one hand, **Company A has stated that they anticipate a very high likelihood that they will welcome me back full-time after my internship.** **On the other hand, my previous failure to get a return offer for an internship with 80% conversion rate** made me evaluate my interpersonal/personality flaws (that I don't want to get into for this post) and how even a very high rate of full-time conversion may still be a big risk for me. There is no such worry if I just accept the full-time offer from Company B.
2. Because I have more information on Company B's full-time position, this means that when I know, for example, that Company B has great work/life balance, I don't really have an idea whether Company A's work/life balance is just as good, better, or worse.

Given all of these considerations, I still lean towards reneging and taking Company B's offer simply because job security is so important to me and I am a risk-averse person, especially in the current job market where I don't know when another full-time offer will land, and since I have legitimate concerns that the internship might not provide a full-time return offer.

I am prepared to take the somewhat lower (but still decent) career trajectory at Company B and even the burning of bridges at Company A in exchange for that higher job security, but still worry about my reputation and blacklists and all the other not-illegal-but-still-detrimental potential consequences of reneging. Is this a legitimate concern (i.e. Is there a good chance that I will actually get screwed over not just by Company A but other companies as well if I turn it down?)?

And if I do end up reneging, what do I write in my email to Company A? Apologies would be empty and moot at that point, but should I still say some? Would it help to emphasize my reasons such as concerns about the job market, uncertainty from bad previous internship experiences, and that I am only accepting a full-time offer that was made before I accepted the internship offer and had been declined only due to a miscommunication?"

So I just got back from the first day of my summer ""finance"" internship. It's at a local and very reputable wealth management firm and to my knowledge before today, was a financial advisor internship. However, after my first day I found out that it's basically just a sales job. They label it as Financial Sales Consultant internship and all I was doing today was cold calling people off a list. 

While I knew that in order to build a portfolio of clients as an advisor, you had to cold call some people; I didn't know how hard it was going to be. I have somewhat severe anxiety and while calling people today I had a really hard time getting the words out and being articulate. It's something about calling random people that gives me severe anxiety on the phone.

So basically, now I am wondering if I should quit while it's early or stick it out. My gut is telling me that this isn't the right job for me, however I don't want to be that guy that quits after the first day. My anxiety will always be an issue however, and I am thinking that a job where I do more independent work might be best for me.

Anyways if anyone here has any advice or similar experiences to me I would really appreciate your input. Thank you"

I am also doing leetcode questions on the side. For this next month, these are the only two things that I will work on because I don't want to overwhelm myself and burn out.

n9i1pk,1,2021-05-10,Is there any way I can legally ensure that my sister and I are getting the funds that my dad is required to pay my mom?,Particular_Lobster51,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/n9i1pk/is_there_any_way_i_can_legally_ensure_that_my/,"
Excuse the long post. Just wanted to provide as much detail to receive the most help. 

Background:
     My parents divorced my senior year of high school. At the time I stayed with my mother and my parents signed papers making it a fairly seamless process for my sister and myself. In the decree, my father agreed to continue paying child support through 4 years of college. I am currently entering my last year. 
     Since the initial agreement, I have lived with my dad for the entire time except those first 6 months. My father is still responsible for: all medical, car maintenance, pretty much everything except basic living expenses for my sister and myself, which is what the child support paid to my mother is intended for. 
     My mother and father have since found new partners and remarried. I still do not live with my mom. Over the course of the past 3 years of college, my mom has withheld the vast majority of my college living expenses (only $300/$700). She goes on vacations, leaving me to work 3 jobs all summer to provide living expenses for school. 

My father, mother, and myself make agreements year to year on who is responsible for what expenses during the school year. 

This year my mom was responsible for my rent and utilities (which is the first time I have seen all of the $700 for my half of child support my dad legally gives to her during the entire time they have been divorced). I had living expenses and we also split the tuition costs 3 ways to ensure I hold some responsibility over my education. 

Currently:
     Over Christmas break, I got into some trouble and they said I would have to pay my rent for the next couple months until I worked and proved I could have it back. I worked every weekend, maintaining living expenses and rent money during the entire semester (December - May) 
    This past month, I have been had to stop working all together to finish school projects, focus on exams, and attend a couple friend’s weddings which I am participating in. Not to mention, I received a paid internship this summer which is also required with my undergraduate degree. 
     I asked my mom if I could start receiving the money back which would allow me to pay for the extra expenses of the weddings. She has paid for a couple miscellaneous items such as $160 for the suite for one of the weddings (which I am extremely grateful for). But it’s still not what was agreed to.
     Yet, every time I ask it’s another excuse. It was “I’m not responsible” every time I speak with her it’s something else like me “not answering or returning her calls efficient enough for her liking.” Then when we do communicate, she avoids the situation or text messages all together. 
     I am severely broke. I stay with my step sister so she could get evicted if I cannot pay rent. I’ve asked to not renew my lease next semester and find somewhere cheaper but that’s “unfair to her.”  My dad understand my plate is quite full. He fortunately paid my rent for this month while she continues to refuse to pay. 
      Over the course of the first 3 years, the same kind of situation occurred. I lived in the dorm, lived off cafeteria food and what little money I could make last from work summers and winters. Again, My dad covers most expenses when she fails to pay.

Resolution:
     I love both my parents but finances were one of the biggest reasons my parents divorced. My mom continuously hoards my funds and makes me live off my own expenses until I have non. Uses my living room expenses like a last resort and squeezes me dry then tries To manipulate me to come around more. Yet I cannot because I am always having to work to get by. 

Is there any way I can legally ensure that my sister and I are getting the funds that my dad is required to pay my mom? Or another existing remedy?

  My dad says his hands are tied with the initial decree and it would cost way more than it’s worth to fight it in court. He says he cannot just start giving the funds directly to me because the money legally has to be given to my mother (for me and my sister). I have bank statements that can trace every cent I have gotten from her from the past 4 years to prove the lack of support."

I just finished my first year as a cs student and after loads of trying I was able to land my first cs summer internship. The job description says I will have to develop an intrasite website with sharepoint and I will have to take content from existing content repositories and restructure them and move them to Sharepoint.

It is supposed to be a 3/4 month internship but the issue is that I feel like there would not be much coding involved. I was thinking in order to land my next internship I should maybe propose an idea that I can also code out (maybe like an add-on to sharepoint or some custom extension), of course after the main tasks/jobs are carried out. Any tips for what additional things (with code) I can do to make sure I can highlight some technical skills (coding) as well on my resume?

Rank: 10/566

Coursework: School didn’t allow us to take APs in our freshman year but took all honors and APs are: WHAP (5), AP Physics 1 (3) and this year’s APs are AP Physics C Mech, AP Physics C E&amp;M, AP Psych, APUSH, APES, and AP Lang

Next year, I plan to take AP Calc BC, AP Lit, AP Gov, AP Macro, AP Com Sci Principles

ECs:

* Tau Beta Pi - Engineer Honor Society, I helped found the first high school chapter in Texas in my Sophomore Year (Pres.)
* Student Council (3 yrs, Vice Pres)
   * I've organized a book drive that got a little over 400+ books for underprivileged kids in Houston with another officer in StuCo
* Mu Alpha Theta (3 yrs, Vice Pres)
* Speech and Debate (3 yrs, Team Coordinator, competes in Original Oratory)
* EngineerGirl; was accepted as an “ambassador” and in coordination with them and the National Academy of Engineering, started a club at my local middle school to encourage girls to become interested in STEM
* Habitat for Humanity
* SciNHS
* UCAN, I teach students in Columbia English for 2 hours once a week, I’ve been doing it since September 2020
* I also got a NASA internship this summer that I’ll be completing virtually, its also affiliated with UT Austin

Awards: I have a couple regional awards from S&amp;D, NCWIT Regional Affiliate Honorable Mention, and a grant for my Engineering Club but nothing that stands out a lot! I def think this is the weakest part of my application

Current School List: UT Austin, UT Dallas, University of Houston, A&amp;M, Rice, Northwestern, Carnegie Mellon, Olins

Helpful things in schools:

In-State or OOS is great, I currently have a list of mostly in-state schools because I have no idea where to start looking for OOS schools without fear I’ll overestimate my abilities

5,000-12,000 students

I would love a larger school with a city env but also with some nature! Some hiking or biking trails etc. (UT Austin like)

However, I don’t mind smaller schools, especially since I’m looking for somewhere that might give more merit scholarships? I am upper middle class so I feel I won’t be able to get much needs-based wise but my family is worried abt possible medical expenses so money is a slightly strong factor

n9j2zr,3,2021-05-10,"Should I take this offer? Second job, not sure how to handle it",aamiani,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/n9j2zr/should_i_take_this_offer_second_job_not_sure_how/,"Hello everyone! I needed some help with a career move that has got me a bit stressed

I graduated in 2019 with a degree in CS from a Kansas state school. I began to work at the same company I did my internship with (a very very large private corporation). Ive been there for about two years now and am leading a lot of development and architecture in my group as the lead has moved to a different team so the amount of work I have is substantially more than a year ago. I’m in south central Kansas so cost of living is pretty low. 

I have been getting a lot of recruiters messaging me so I decided to see what was out there in the market. 

After a few interviews, I got an offer from a large consulting company (considered big 4 on the business side). 

Now I want to lay down my situation and see if anyone has any wise words. I don’t have anyone in my personal life that I could speak to and could relate to my situation so I thought I’d ask here. 

Current Compensation: 77k (possible 5k raise by end of this month). 401k matching, full benefits. Full time, salary, rarely work more than 40 hours. I’ve really enjoyed my time here and enjoy the people I work with, although I would like to get out and experience more of the world since I was raised here in Kansas. There is also a strict business casual dress code and working remote or from home is very limited. 

New offer: 95K, full remote, option to work in DC or Austin, TX if I prefer to have an office. Similar benefits although the 401k matching is a bit weaker ($0.25 per dollar up to 6% vs 100%% up to 6%). This gives me the chance to own my life a bit more and flexibility to move to a new city in the future without having to find a new job. 

I am feeling very stressed about this decision and not telling my current employer about the situation. I’m worried that I could do poorly at the new job or be falling behind when at my current company I’m doing extremely well. I am nervous about having the conversation of leaving etc. 

I’ve never made a move like this in my professional career and I would really appreciate advice on whether I should take this offer or any advice anyone else can provide. 

Thank you all very much!"
n9jr3f,467,2021-05-10,My journey from $14 an hour to $67k in under 2 years,iH8stonks,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/n9jr3f/my_journey_from_14_an_hour_to_67k_in_under_2_years/,"Hey everyone, I hope this post does not come off as a brag but rather as a piece of inspiration and insight into my journey so far. 

2 years ago (July 2019)I quit my restaurant job to pursue a network technician internship at a local MSP for $13/h. I met this employer at a college job fair. At the time I was only about a year into a cybersecurity program. 3 months later, I was offered a full time position at $14/h (see offer letter for proof). During this time, I gained experience doing network installations in data centers, office buildings, and some plants/warehouse type facilities. It was a great gig at the time. I got to travel to 6 different states for jobs which was basically like paid vacations to a young kid like me (I was 22 at the time). I stayed in this role while still attending college full time. I received a raise to $17/h in May of 2020. I personally feel like this pay was subpar but the experience I was getting was invaluable. Fast forward to November 2020, I was moved to a network planning role in the same company. No raise. This role dealt more with the administration side of my previous role. I altered network layouts and created change requests to have these alterations implemented. It was a cool experience at first but I ended up not really enjoying it much. 

Fast forward to a few months ago. I started applying to jobs on LinkedIn just for fun and to see what was out there. I had a few interviews for some internships but didn’t land any of those. I applied to this Network Operations Specialist position and started doing their stupid berke FIT assessment as well as a technical test.  The technical test was mainly about windows 10 and windows server. They were pretty easy and I landed a zoom interview so I’m assuming I scored okay on them. The initial zoom interview was basically just a discussion about my background (everything I just explained above). I was then invited to an in person interview the following day. It wasn’t much of an interview but I was shown around the office and shown what my role would be in the company (it’s basically a combination of my last two roles). That was last week. Fast forward to today. I just got a call that I was being offered the position. I still haven’t really process everything yet. 


I really don’t know If I’m really qualified for the position or not. I always feel a little bit of imposter syndrome. Was I lucky in getting this role? Yes definitely. But I did put in a lot of hard work and dedication to myself and my studies/career. Going to school full time and working full time can induce burnout real quick if your time is not managed properly. I know some people have made much bigger compensation leaps in shorter amounts of time but this is mine. 

So the biggest takeaways from my journey so far is that it is super important to network. I know that’s repeated here a lot but it’s key to open up new opportunities. Second, have some discipline. I don’t mean work yourself to the ground but find a schedule that works for you that will continue to allow self improvement. Lastly, work on personal/communication skills. This helps network and show that you can be worked with. This was my biggest weakness when I first started college but since then, I’ve learned how to communicate like a normal human.


Sorry this post is long and poorly structured but if anyone has any questions, feel free to ask.

n9kmgc,15,2021-05-10,Internship wages,onlycarrotcake,udub,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/n9kmgc/internship_wages/,Curious as to how much compensation ppl have received for a summer internship and for what type of role. It seems to me that most companies pay around $20-25/hour. Maybe $30 for a tech role or big consulting firm. and obviously the most $$ for the big five

I am 34 years old. I've been a public school teacher for five and a half years. Currently I teach middle school science, but I've also taught middle school English. 

My background is in education and special education and I've also worked as a teaching assistant and as a high school registrar. 

I am not happy in the field of teaching and I feel like I get more and more unhappy in this field every year.

I am looking for a career change, but I also have a three year old child, so I need something that lines up with his daycare/school schedules (i.e. no weekends or odd hours). 

I will have some time this summer to devote to developing a new skill or earning a certification. 

I've started an online CompTia A+ course, for computer repair, but I'm not entirely sure if that's the best field to get into. 

I'm hoping to find something that I can get into quickly at a decent pay/benefits level, with opportunities for advancement. I need something that I can start earning in by September of this year. 

I have been considering something technology related, but I'm not sure exactly what would be the best fit. I'm also open to trades, but I'm just not sure if the hours would fit my schedule. I am also somewhat interested in jobs in the death-care/mortuary sciences field, but I am not sure if there is any education/career path that would allow me to start any kind of paid internship by September. 

I strongly wish to avoid anything involving children. I somewhat wish to avoid close, hands-on face to face healthcare jobs, but will try to remain open minded to it. (Note, I don't mind working with remains of the deceased, nor do I mind working with human waste, such as in sanitation jobs. I just prefer not to be in very close physical contact with living people, like a CNA). 

I am also good with and open to working with animals. I'm open learning how to operate or repair machines and equipment, like a technician job. I also have decently strong writing skills. 

Again, mostly I am looking for something that I could break into at a decent starting pay by September, with opportunities for advancement, with a schedule that accommodates parenting.  

I know that this is probably asking a lot but, I thought I would throw it out there in case someone might have some valuable knowledge or experience they'd be kind enough to share. Thank you!!!"

n9mqk4,2,2021-05-10,help reverse chance a south Asian female CS applicant,mcarina,ReverseChanceMe,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseChanceMe/comments/n9mqk4/help_reverse_chance_a_south_asian_female_cs/,"**stats**  
\- estimated weighted GPA between 3.3 and 3.5. probably the worst aspect of my application. the circumstances behind it are too personal to share with AOs, but they have ended, so from the 4th quarter of this year I expect significant improvement. likely too late to really improve my overall, but midyear reports next year would show great progress.  
\- pretty rigorous course load. two APs as a sophomore, four as a junior (current), three as a senior. I plan to self study a few as well, just for the sake of college credits. as of next year I will be enrolled in four languages, which seems like it might set me apart at least a little :D  
\- desired major: computer science and desired minor: linguistics  
\- 1580 SAT. the shining star of my profile :D. both section scores are 790.  
\- decent rec letters from a computer science teacher and a French teacher who I get along very well with and who have praised my work in the past  
\- average to decent extracurriculars, I think :') 160+ community service hours, a quite-selective math program outside of school at Brookhaven National Laboratory, board for two clubs, participation in three choirs and French club.  
\- not many awards. I'll be a National Merit commended scholar. a piece I wrote once received an honorable mention on the New York Times website for a summer contest.  
\- essays...hit or miss? I'm a decent writer, and I want to say what I have so far is really good, but I wouldn't know xD  
\- in terms of future action, I thought of doing some online certifications in different programming languages. I need more ECs related to computer science, I think...:')

**criteria**  
\- within around a 10-hour drive of Long Island. my parents' requirement, not mine. :')  
\- pretty library that has two stories (not a requirement, just..I really want it xD examples include the Sage library at Rutgers and the library at OSU, both schools are on my list)  
\- cost within around $30K, or that I could get down to that price with some miracles involving financial aid and/or merit aid  
\- decent for computer science. I'm not crazy about prestige, and I think I can do well anywhere, but the best options would provide decent opportunities or be in an area where it's easier to find internships later on.

**in-progress list**  
\- Tufts *reach, I had to have ONE*  
\- Northeastern *reach...again*  
\- Carnegie Mellon *the rejection letter every list needs*  
\- Vassar *one last reach, for good luck*  
\- Stony Brook *match, finally*  
\- UMBC *safety, but closer to a match*  
\- Rutgers *same as UMBC*  
\- Ohio State *solid safety territory, I hope*  
\- UMass Amherst *safety*  
\- NJIT *safety*  
\- Drexel *safety but I'm hoping they give me GOOD money*  
\- Rowan *same as Drexel xD*  
\- UAlbany *surefire safety, both affordable &amp; easy to get into*

any input's appreciated :DD"

This really makes me super nervous because I’m afraid of making mistakes.

I have to report it to my senior but the senior is kind of “crazy” because she screams at people who make mistakes. This again makes me anxious!

I don’t know what to do now. I’m kind of a slow learner, I need time to think and understand the work.

Also it’s my first official job out of college and thinking about that senior makes me feel sick :(

Any advice on how to overcome the feeling of failing? Or the anxiety of making mistakes?"
n9omhd,699,2021-05-11,Funniest CS intern take home assignment ever,Prudencia,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/n9omhd/funniest_cs_intern_take_home_assignment_ever/,"Ok so I applied for a full-stack developer intern position at some tech startup/consultancy company in Toronto and I got a response to do an assessment and send it back in **48 hours**. I thought ok, wont be too bad maybe like a leetcode thing or a small take home assignment. I open it up the next day and its a giant whiteboard of tasks I have to do. 

I applied for the fullstack internship so I had to do both the front end and backend assessments (WITHIN 48 Hours!). So I took a look at them and the front end assessment was to make a dynamic website with music playing in the background and dynamic cursor and a bevy of other bullshit. OK fine, I look at the backend assessment and it says to make a twitter clone API with user login, unit tests for each endpoint, creating and updating tweets, the whole shabang. And the wording of it was so aggressive too. They tell you to make the APIs for the user login first and they end it with ""These APIS MUST BE PERFECT, DO NOT MOVE ON TO THE REST OF THE ASSESSMENT WITHOUT COMPLETING THIS OR **YOUR ASSESSMENT WILL NOT BE SCORED**!!"" 

So yeah exited out of that assessment real fast. The egos on these toronto startups are legit through the roof holy shit. Like get a grip on reality asking an intern position that youll probably pay 20hr for to do all that shit in 48 hours"

I have lurking this subreddit since 2018 and I cant believe my time has come!

My background is that I am graduate from a small college in Canada majoring in CS. I always believed that you needed coop to land internships but I was clearly wrong. I sent over 2000+ applications and went on approximately 50 interviews. In the end I ended up volunteering for a company as a software developer. My CTO saw that I was hard working and putting in 110% of my work and decided to offer a paid position in the company for the summer.  I will be working Software Engineer Intern( though ill be mostly doing QA work hehehe)

My advice, don’t give up. Keep trying because when you give up you’ve admitted defeat. Also if you can’t get an internship or a FT job, work as a volunteer part time, you will make alot of connections and you gain alot of experience. If not you’re into that then work on side projects, they helped alot in making my application look more appealing.

My plan for the future is to get into my masters hopefully , grind Leetcode and DS and Algo and hopefully get another internship or a FT role.

Good luck everyone, you will definitely succeed.

I thought my individual projects will help me with getting accepted from companies of foreign countries but even for an internship nobody wanted to work with me.

I have dreams people, but it's almost impossible to accomplish them in my country for people like me. So what should be the steps that I must follow?

UofT is well known and better ranked, but high tuition fee (3x of UBC) No option for co op or internship. Has option to get emphasis in ELITE (could lead to more opportunities in management level?)

Waterloo has good reputation for CS, is is the case for ECE as well? Also no co op option for MEng. Fee is 2x that of UBC

More opportunities for UofT and Waterloo due to the location in GTA. But is it really worth the high tuition fees?

P.S. - I have a BE in ECE from India and around 5 years work experience as an SoC engineer. I'm taking the course based masters only (MEng), so not considering the research options. I'm not taking a loan, so fee is a deal breaker!"

   * Since the club is small (like basically 3 active members lol), me and the other members are expanding on a project we made in a hackathon by using Dart (on the hackathon we used Tkinter for the frontend lol) with a Python backend with Google Geocoding &amp; Places API where it calculates your risk of getting Covid-19 by inputting an address
* Model UN  

   * Didn't really do much as I only got to attend one conference (WAMUNC) because two of them were canceled due to COVID while the other conference was literally like a day before my ACT lol.
* Robotics Club
* Math Team  

   * Yet again COVID-19 messes things up so all I really did was compete in AMC-12
* Science Olympiad  

   * Attended a bunch of invitationals and competed in regionals (nothing special)

Awards:

* AP Scholar with Distinction &amp; AP Scholar with Honor

*In the summer, I'm probably going to work on some game dev projects and put it in the AppStore &amp; Google Play (hopefully I have enough time for myself to do that).*

Planning to apply ED to all the universities that offer ED (UCs don't have ED)."

I have also obtained an Advanced diploma in Game design and animation from the same institution.

The issue is that the institution is not really well recognized and there seems to be a very low or no chance of me getting a job from there. Also, I haven't done any jobs, internships and side courses before, so my  Résumé  is pretty much empty.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I:

1. Continue pursuing this degree?
2. Do an online course from a site like Coursera, Udemy etc. and add obtain a certificate so that it adds something to my Résumé?
3. Look for jobs in another country because with my qualifications, it seems hard to get a job here ( I am eyeing Canada)
4. Apply for Masters in a University?"

I like to know - 

1. Scholarship opportunities - does Penn state offer scholarships to international students who cross some specific grade or if they make it to the honours college. If yes, approx up to how much do they offer and how hard is it
2. Employment (Internships) - How hard is it to get summer internships as an international cs student and what kind of companies can I intern at and what are the avg salaries for this
3. Employment (after graduation) - What kind of companies hire from Penn State (FAANG?)m and what are the average starting salaries

I'd be really grateful if yall could answer these questions. Atm, I'm stuck btw choosing Penn State or Stonybrook. If the fees were the same, I would've chosen Penn state for sure but Penn state is approximately 10k more expensive than Stony Brook and thus scholarships opportunities are really important for me"

Currently a rising junior at a state school, not a top school or anything but decently well regarded in the local area. My stretch goal is to eventually join a company like Amazon/Microsoft or similar tech-focused company, but really I'm just aiming to end up at a big company with a good tech division in general - think Citi, Vanguard, Walmart, the phone/internet companies. I've got an internship this summer at a mid level Fortune 500 company and my current projects are something like this:

* Flask web app that does some web scraping, throws it in a database, and displays the output in tables

* Flask web app that basically returns information from an external API, or texts it to you

* Group project with the MERN stack. I only really did mobile development but do understand the rest of the stack.

* Hackathon project with more Flask that implemented a polling system using websockets

* Random class projects in C/Java implementing various data structures, not directly applicable to most app development

Would this be enough to get a few OAs/interviews, or should I do a true full stack project? I do think my knowledge would benefit from a project like that, but then again that's essentially what I'm going to be doing during the internship."

(CS),sarahsucks69,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/na4c9r/rea_to_stanford_or_ed_to_dartmouth_cs/,"Hello everyone, I have a dilemma. I cannot decide whether to apply early to Stanford or Dartmouth for Computer Science. On top of having one of the best CS programs in the country, Stanford fits my exact dream college criteria (other than culture). However, REA is insanely difficult. Dartmouth, on the other hand, has a small CS program that still is recruited by FAANG and such but doesn't seem like a ""perfect fit"" (although I know I'd love it there). I have several personal and familial connections there, and ED is not nearly as difficult as Stanford (21% or so this year). I don't know if I should play it smart, apply ED to Dartmouth, and live in wonder if I manage to get in, or shoot for the stars and almost certainly miss, wasting my opportunity at applying early. Here's my stuff:

**Intended Major(s): CS / Econ Double Major**

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:** No SAT yet, **1500 PSAT**

**UW/W GPA and Rank:** 4.0 UW / 4.6 W, Rank 1/300 by far at a decent public high school (I also attend a competitive STEM magnet school where I take DE classes)

12th: DE Computer Science (x2), DE DiffEq, DE Mentorship, AP Lit, AP Psych, APES, AP Gov, AP CS Principles (maybe)

**Awards:**

\- 1st place team OOP at state school programming contest

\- 2nd place team at another state school programming contest

\- 1st place team (of 3) in state at Lockheed Martin CodeQuest (2021)

\- 8th place statewide Math League, 1st in Region (2021)

\- 4th place Computational Biology in State Science Fair, 1st in Regional Fair (1 spot from ISEF, ugh)

\- 1st place 11th grade @ state uni math competition (2021)

\- Princeton Book Award (2021)

\- State Championship in Quiz Bowl

\- AP Scholar with Distinction (2020)

\- AP with WE Service Recognition (yearlong individual service project building GIS software from scratch for soil and climate conditions to create dozens of crop maps with the goal of reducing reliance on global food supply chains)

\- 3rd place PF debate at regional competition, states cancelled (2020)

\- Probably national merit finalist

**Extracurriculars:** 

\- Paid internship in investment securities developing software for scraping and algorithmic valuation at a small local firm

\- Yearlong (June-May) internship in computational fluid dynamics at NASA

\- Lifeguard at neighborhood pool

\- Gov School STEM Summer Residential Program

Economics Teacher: 8/10, known for writing excellent recs and likes me a lot (I'm very active in class and do well), just difficult to connect online

Counselor: 8/10, knows me reasonably well and we have a good relationship

**Schools:** Dartmouth ED or Stanford REA

In order of preference: Stanford, Princeton, Harvard, Yale, Dartmouth, Brown, Cornell, UPenn, Rice, Washu, GTech, Tufts, UVA, Emory"

TL;DR: The company I work for is adding additional roles, but not paying me for it. 

Here’s some back story if it help:
I (26F) have worked for this company for the past year that is in a field I am currently going to grad school for. It had started off as a full-time (40 hours/week) administrative assistant position where I would be able to balance work, school, and social life. As the months passed, the company had lost their executive assistant and I was soon promoted to fill that role. This meant now working around the CEO’s schedule and coming in 30 minutes earlier and now working 42.5 hours a week. This required a significant amount of work compared to the administrative role, but came along with a position bonus. Even though I had an additional half an hour longer than others on my floor, I took advantage of my 30 minute lunch break. The company continued to lose employees and soon the HR Generalist role was vacant. I was then approached by the company supervisors that I would continue my role as Executive Assistant, but now also take on the role of HR Generalist as well. While I am not fully integrated into the role, I have had a significant influx in calls, questions, duties. It also means that now I am too busy to take my lunch break and now fully work the 8.5 hours with no overtime pay. While I have been attempting to balance both positions, the company has not provided an answer to whether or not I will be compensated for the additional role.

With an increasing workload at school and internship, is it worth it to stay because it is a job in my field and with a promise to be offered a position once I graduate (7 months) or do the cons greatly outweigh any benefit?"
na4ijb,0,2021-05-11,"CS is saturated, 2021",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/na4ijb/cs_is_saturated_2021/,"CS is saturated. This is why standards have risen considerably. Entry roles at mid-tier companies require 2+ years of experience from fresh grads, or masters degrees or internships at top companies. This is laughable, but these standards exist due to the huge supply of those wanting to join this ""hot"" industry.

Some here will tell you there is a shortage of ""good"" devs. This is nonsense. Being ""good"" is relative. Every field on the planet could use more ""good"" people in it whatever that means. Others will tell you that work is plenty in lesser known areas and more unknown companies. This too is baloney, as these companies will use an agency instead, and won't risk hiring young/unproven talent because they lack the resources.

Then you have idiot media pundits hyping up fields like data science and AI and other crap like how software jobs will continue to grow. The people writing these articles are parroting what they heard, throwing around buzzwords like Python or TensorFlow, but they don't even know how to write a for loop much less what a cost function is.

There was a temporary period, circa 2015, when you could learn a tech stack on your own and make a good living. Since then, floods of people have entered the field, both fresh grads and as a second career believing the hype, to the point that it is saturated. CS is now like accounting and engineering, the top 10% of the class with internships get the work, the rest go hungry. And CS is more volatile, because it is in constant flux.

If you are entering the field, here are some steps in considering how ""hot"" this industry is:

1) $100k+ salary? Consider location, this is usually in a very high COL area, and is extremely competitive (ie. Stanford or MIT top of class grads get first dibs).

2) Good work-life balance. Nah, 40hr+ per week minimum, much more before product release, and continuous learning at home.

3) Can't get recruits off my back? Recruiters are doing this because they get a cut of your salary. There is incentive for them to spam invites in the hopes that someone gets placed. Also, more often than not, recruiters are merely inviting you to a series of technical interviews. Being invited to do 3-5 grueling tech interviews is not the same as being offered a job. So distinguish between an offer w/ a salary, and an invite to interview.

4) But this reddit post says how easy it is. Consider two things. When was the post written? In 2017 or 2021, big difference. Next, do you know the whole story? Did this person without a degree get their foot in the door through their own merits? Or were the connections / networks involved that they are reluctant to disclose? It is very difficult to land an entry job even if you have decent qualifications.

5) Outside of Apple, Google, Amazon, Netflix, Uber, or Microsoft, when was the last time you bought an app? Besides these, and maybe games and devices, coding just doesn't pay.

&amp;#x200B;

If you love coding, and can see yourself doing it for countless hours to the point of becoming really good at it, welcome aboard. If not, go be good at something else, the pay won't differ that much in the long term, I promise."

na68pc,5,2021-05-11,Friend is struggling to figure out what to do with her CS degree,cfarsoudi,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/na68pc/friend_is_struggling_to_figure_out_what_to_do/,"I have this friend that I met in college who has been struggling to find a job after graduating. She was dealing with some health issues earlier on, so she didn't graduate until her late 20s. By the time she graduated, her GPA was barely eligible for graduation, had no internships or work experience, and she had almost nothing to show on her resume. I worked with her to get some small projects on there to fill it out, but they're nothing impressive. I've been trying to encourage her to work on more in depth projects so she could have more stuff to put on her resume and actually gain some coding/ debugging experience as well, but that doesn't really seem to be an option for her. She seems to expect a company to hire her based on the fact that she has a degree and willingness to learn.

It's been almost been a year and a half since graduation, and she still has no leads. It feels like she has forgotten a lot of fundamentals from not practicing. I think her stuborness to practice programming and work on projects shows that she has little passion in programming, which is totally ok, but she gets really mad whenever I bring that up, understandably so. 

Obviously my friend has to make some adjustments to her attitude and expectations, but what do you guys recommend for someone who has a CS degree and little passion for programming. She's entertained the idea of becoming a project manager, but I still feel like you need some technical experience to manage and lead a program."
na7jhn,3,2021-05-11,"Need feedback/support - planning on giving my two weeks' notice in 3 weeks; no job lined up yet, enough savings to last into next year",Vredesbyrd67,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/na7jhn/need_feedbacksupport_planning_on_giving_my_two/,"I've had enough of my current job, and I think I have a plan to make my exodus from it work.

After reviewing my expenses and the money I have in my savings account now, I've concluded that if I leave in mid-June, I will have more than enough to cover my basic expenses until next February. The area around me is rife with cafes and bars, and the minimum wage in my city (Chicago) is high, so I think if I get a part-time job I can stretch it out even further if needed. If necessary, I can cut $300 worth of expenses for parking, gas, and insurance for my car by selling it. I barely drive anymore, and now that I've been vaccinated, I won't be avoiding public transportation anymore. If I need to get somewhere that isn't busable, I can hire a Lyft. I'll have extra money anyway.

My plan is to wait until June 1. I get paid monthly. I'm due to get a quarterly bonus then, so my second-to-last paycheck will be a big one. On top of that, I'll get paid for the two weeks in June that I work, plus my remaining sick days. All this will probably be paid out on June 30.

I will be immune from the coronavirus starting this Friday. My plan is to get a part-time job or contract work until I get a new job to stretch out my savings. When I'm not doing that, I'm going to be treating my job search like a full-time job. I'm going to get up at 8 AM every weekday, be in front of my computer by 9, and work on applications, networking, cold-calling companies - whatever I have to do - until roughly 5. I'll reserve weekends for social activities and self-care, just like I do now. Some days I'll work more, some days I'll work less. Some weeks, I'll work on weekends. Working from home has taught me my limits and how to manage my time better than working in an office ever did.

I recently completed an online portfolio that I made with Squarespace. I've shown it to a lot of people, including the career coach from my college with whom I've been working since September 2019, and the feedback has been extremely positive. I now have 6 years' worth of experience in my field, so getting entry-level jobs is no longer an issue (thank fuck). I have a lot of hard and soft skills that make me a competitive candidate, I've gotten way better at writing cover letters, and my resume is on point (again, according to the feedback I've gotten, though I recognize that what makes a ""good"" resume can vary depending on who you ask).  I've never been a stronger applicant in my field.

I've contacted the agency responsible for unemployment insurance in my state. Willingly leaving employment makes you ineligible for benefits, unless you can prove that they A) did something illegal, B) caused me physical harm or threatened it, or C) discriminated against me on the basis of race, gender, religion, or age (they actually have been mistreating me because of my age, but I'm in my 30s and it sounds like they only take it seriously if the issue is age-based harassment against someone over 40). They said that if I get denied unemployment, I can appeal the decision. I have several GB worth of screenshots of Slack messages, emails, and text messages on my computer showing my coworkers harassing me, being verbally abusive, making baseless accusations against the quality of my work and my character (I have separate screenshots proving their claims are untrue, like a shot of the edit history of a doc I worked on showing I objectively didn't do something I was accused of doing) - their unjustifiable behavior in these screenshots is blatant enough that anyone unfamiliar with me or my company would be able to easily see how dysfunctional and abusive my coworkers are. My plan is to show this to the appeals officer and connect them with my therapist to show that this job has been having a significantly detrimental effect on my mental health. Maybe it won't work, but it's the best shot I've got to get unemployment benefits if I don't get fired between now and June. If it doesn't work, I've still got my savings, and money from part-time work if I get one before I get a full-time job.

From everything I've been seeing, the job market is in flux right now. Summer is right around the corner, people are getting vaccinated, loads of people are leaving their jobs, and companies that have had hiring freezes since the beginning of the pandemic are beginning to hire again. I think I can do this.

I'm not stupid or crazy. I know this is a risky move. But the level of delusion, dysfunction, and abuse I've had to endure at this company, even before the pandemic, has been destroying my mental health even worse than the pandemic has. It's also affecting my work ethic and my productivity. It's getting so bad I literally cannot focus enough to do basic parts of the job, so I literally can't do the job either. 

I've spoken to my boss numerous times about the problems I have at this company, and he always responds by ignoring what I say and instead telling me how to feel. We have no HR department. It's a small company (I don't think there have ever been more than 8 people in the 3+ years I've been here, not counting interns and seasonal workers), but 3 core staff members have left in that time, including the former CEO and business partner of my boss - he quit within a week of being the CEO. I absolutely cannot stay here anymore. The only ones left are the old friends and family members he hires (this company is unrepentantly nepotistic in its hiring practices and those hires are treated with blatant favoritism - he literally conscripted his college student son to edit video after our camera guy quit and his replacement became a father in March).

I feel like I've covered everything, but I want to leave no stone unturned. I'm taking a big risk, so I need to know that I absolutely am doing everything in my power to make this work. I've been applying to companies with greater frequency now that I'm basically done with my portfolio, but I need more time and mental clarity to maximize my job search. 

Does anyone have any advice as to what else I should do/be doing? Please no comments telling me I'm an idiot. I know this is a risk, but after what I've been through in the past year, I'm convinced it's a necessary one. If you have no suggestions, I could use some emotional support. Thanks."

I want to get another job but most of my experience was just writing reports at a geotechnical firm and every job I want either wants years of experience or at the very least experience with specific fields/software. Should I just quit my job before I’m fired and really hunt for a job? Should I find another internship to get a little more applicable experience? Should I see if I can get a technician job at like a machine shop or something? Should I go back to school? Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

These posts were really useful for me as I was going through the application process so I thought I would share my experience and things that I think helped me get multiple offers. 

**General research interests**: pretty broad but mostly molecular biology with some interests in syn bio and biophysics.

**Stats:** 

* GPA: 4.0/4.0 as a junior, undergrad Biochem and Chem double major at a T100 State university in the US
* GRE: Did not take (not required for any of the programs I applied to)
* Research: 3 years in the same lab in undergrad, one summer internship at a T2 pharma company, one summer internship at one of the HPSYM schools, one semester in a different lab at my undergrad university. Mostly Comp bio work with very little wet lab stuff here and there.
* Publications: 1 third author in a very low IF journal (I had never even heard of it), and 2 in prep (1st author, I don't think this mattered at all).
* Awards: 5 small research awards through my university, mostly for research funding so I didn't have to hold an additional job (my lab didn't pay me).
* Posters and oral presentations: 6 in total, 4 posters (1 national conference, 1 for my internship, 2 at conferences hosted by my university and 1 at a regional conference), 2 oral presentations (1 at my department's seminar, 1 for my other internship).
* Rec letters: 1 from PI whose labs I worked in since sophomore year (1 pub from this lab), 1 from a professor whose class I took and whose lab I spent a semester in (they knew me very well and I actually think they wrote me the strongest letter), 1 from my PI from my internship at one of the HYPSM schools. 
* Activities: I don't think these matter at all, I was president of a club and was involved in 3 others. Nothing major though, raised some funds, organized a mini conference.
* Demographics: International student (from a very poor African country)

**Programs:**

* MIT BE: communicated with one prof who was very enthusiastic, they even reviewed my SoP and CV. 
* MIT Chem: Knew a couple profs here, regularly communicated with several of them
* Harvard BBS: No contact, didn't email anyone
* Harvard SSQBio: No contact, reached out to one prof who gave me the general 'apply and see'
* UW BPSD: communicated with 2 profs, talked about research with one
* Stanford Biology: met with 2 profs
* UChicago BMB: No contact, emailed 2 profs, 1 wasn't taking students and the other didn't reply lol
* BU MCBB: No contact, emailed 0 profs
* JHU BCMB: Contact with program director who was very helpful, emailed 0 profs about research
* Scripps Chem Bio: No contact, emailed 0 profs
* UCSF-UC Berkeley BioE: No contact, emailed 0 profs

**Results:**

Thoughts and Advice:

In all, I am very pleased with my application results! I was honestly so shocked because I was not expecting to get in at all, let alone get extra fellowships from my two top choice schools as an international student. I am incredibly thankful and I do realize the privilege that I had. I knew several faculty at many of these schools, although I am not sure if that helped, I am sure it didn't hurt. I also worked incredibly hard to maintain good grades and make progress in lab. I made a conscious effort to present my research at conferences and took advantage of all the virtual open houses available (that's how I met most profs I stayed in touch with). I spent an insane amount of time perfecting my SoP for each school and made sure that my goals were aligned with the program goals. 

if there is a *single piece of advice* I would give, it is to thoroughly research whatever program you are applying to! I would spend hours scrolling through program websites looking for any clues as to what they would be looking for in a candidate. I even incorporated mission statements in my SoP, my goal was to convince the reader that I was the perfect fit at the end of each paragraph, and then tie it together at the end. I would also recommend reaching out to current students in the programs you are applying to because I was able to get a lot of info, and some of them even gave me feedback on my SoP! 

I honestly had such a great time at all of my interviews and met professors that I am sure I will keep in touch with. The decision-making process was very hard but I am really happy with my decision. I learned so much about my field, had such stimulating conversations. Even though the whole process was incredibly stressful, the interviews really made up for it because I had an amazing time. Anyway, enough rambling, I hope this post can help at least one person as they go through application season. Feel free to PM me with questions!"

I had severe depression during my second year in high school and had to switch schools after an incident. I felt like I had recovered and cruised along onto college. My intended major was computer science then informatics, both of which were highly competitive and I simply didn't have the drive to make my applications stand out. I ended up graduating with a bachelor's in political science and a minor in informatics, but I hadn't done any internships or made any connections, let alone friends.

I think for the longest time I had this idea that I would just magically get a job, my own apartment, and a car once I reached a certain age. In reality I'm still living with my parents, not sure where to start applying for a job. I'm thinking my ideal scenario is working from home while teaching myself coding so that later I can apply for tech industry jobs. However, this feels like a dream and I don't really have the confidence that I can pull it off. I can't even enjoy things like video games right now because I can't shake off the feeling that I should be doing something productive, but whenever I start job searching I immediately get stressed out. I'm always waiting to eat or to sleep so I don't feel so paralyzed.

How do I get past this? Do I just keep trying until the mental block goes away? Is there somewhere I can go to for help? Do I need a therapist? I'm so sick of thinking about it on my own."

I'm a career changer (from M. Engineering) so one of my best bets at getting my foot in the door in a software position will maybe be through an internship.

The ""pursuing a degree full-time"" under internship qualifications makes me a bit nervous about the options I may have.

Can any of you guys/gals list the companies that were okay with the part-time student status?

I know you don't have to disclose that you're part-time but I do know some companies check transcripts so I want to know what I may be getting myself into.

It's been 6 months since I started applying for jobs. At this point, I honestly lost count of how many jobs I applied. I have gotten to final stages of a few interviews but got rejected because there were more experienced candidates.

I did all the right things in my university years or atleast I thought those were the right things. I got one of the top GPAs, I won competitions, participated in volunteering and organizing events, did so many projects, did multiple internships, self taught many skills and won quite a few awards. Nothing has helped me get a job. I didn't go to events or parties like my friends. I had to consistently work hard everyday because I told myself it would help me later on. All that hard work and time .... All wasted. Maybe I am overestimated my own value. I can't tell at this point.

naccpn,1,2021-05-11,[DC] Sudden silence from HR: Am I overreacting?,Red_Owl-GMU,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/naccpn/dc_sudden_silence_from_hr_am_i_overreacting/,"Hello,

This post is in regards to the proper expectations that I should have when communicating with HR at a large company.

For some background, I am a junior college student who just landed a summer internship with a relatively large healthcare company. About three weeks ago, I had an email exchange with an HR representative who gave me a heads up that she would be contacting me to set up a meeting and begin my onboarding process in early May.

Specifically, she stated that she would try to contact me before May 5th. You can see where this is going.

I did send her a brief email in late April regarding some paperwork that I need to file in order to intern for credit at my school. No response.

May 5th came and went, but I waited for another week, as I understand that unexpected things can pop up, and that I am probably only one of hundreds of interns who need to be onboarded.

It has been 6 days since the date by which she said she would contact me. I sent a very polite email to her yesterday to the effect that my final exams are now finished and I am open to meeting with her to review the onboarding process and ask any questions that I might have.

However, she hasn’t responded yet.

Per the offer letter I signed, the internship is scheduled to start on June 6th.

I am beginning to feel worried that they may have forgotten that I exist.

TL;DR Got an internship, HR seems to have fallen off a cliff. All my communications with her have been unanswered since our last exchange three weeks ago. Starting to feel a bit anxious about this."

&amp;#x200B;

(PS: Sorry for my bad English.)

&amp;#x200B;

I will start from the moment when things went wrong.

I was never a good student, I always went without studying, and oddly enough I went to a public college (it's something in my country).

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up taking an IT course. I took him as the school, doing just the bare minimum. At the end of 2019, I got an internship that was going well, so COVID came. As I was new to the company (I was still in training) they decided to dismiss most of the interns and only keep those who were already very trustworthy and about to be hired (they dealt with sensitive data that could not leak in any way).

&amp;#x200B;

I spent the year 2020 just taking online classes and praying for a vaccine. So at the end of last year, a professor came to offer me a kind of paid academic work (I don't know how to say it in English, but we developed a project outside of class hours). Not only would I be the ""leader"" so to speak I would be the best student in my class. He told me what the software and technologies would be and he disappeared for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

After a while, my classmate ended up getting a remote job and warned me that he could not continue.

After a few days, another student called me by a message saying that we were supposed to start the project (he was from another course at a different time, but in the area and already had some knowledge of the technologies used to develop).

&amp;#x200B;

We worked for about three weeks on this project without much help from our teacher (he should be more present and a norm). Then the holidays came, and I found out that this guy who was with me was graduating and could no longer participate in the project. He had already warned the professor, who said he said he would talk to another student to replace him.

&amp;#x200B;

Well the holidays here ended in February and I never touched on this project and I never went after anything, not even my professor, came to talk to me, this project should be in the final stage, I imagine but I barely started it and whenever I think about it I want to stick my face on the frustration pillow but I don't know where to start.

&amp;#x200B;

This year it sucks, my concentration is gone, I haven't seen anything in my area for months other than in class, which I can't focus on for more than five minutes. (Actually, I can't do anything for more than five minutes, whether it's watching a series or reading the books I love)

&amp;#x200B;

This snowball grows every second and I don't know where to start, I know I must reduce the size of the problems but I don't know what to do with this huge four-month snowball."

I tried applying to UF in fall 2020, but I was rejected since it was pretty competitive. In my rejection letter, I was told to try reapplying to UF when I have 60 credit hours.

I have 17 credits from APs, so after the fall 2021 semester, I’ll easily be past 60 credit hours. But is it worth transferring?

By then, I’ll be in UCF for nearly two years so is it worth losing all that experience in clubs, internships, and so on? I know that both UCF and UF have very strong CS programs so I don’t know whether transferring is worth it.

Are the opportunities at UF worth it? Or should I stick to making the best out of being at UCF?"

In Winter 2021, I  should’ve technically been on my final semester of a BBA. However, in all honesty I hated online school. I took an optional summer term last year to do 3 courses. I then did 3 more courses in the Fall and then 2 in the Winter. I felt burnt out and school just became tough to keep up with. Luckily, my degree allows me to delay graduation for up to 16 months. 

I decided when covid hit in March 2020 that it might be worth it to pursue a minor in Financial Math. I’ve always wanted to move towards the finance sector so I felt like this made sense. I didn’t have any of the necessary courses for this minor, however, so I needed to complete about 7 courses for it. And because many of the mandatory courses are prerequisites for other mandatory courses, I was looking at adding at least 4 semesters to my degree. 

I know I made the decision to do a minor kinda late into my degree, but I justified it by telling myself that covid isn’t going anywhere anytime soon and the job market probably won’t be too pretty if I graduated on time in Winter 2021 anyways. I also managed to find a summer internship as a Financial Analyst at a large insurance company for this summer, so I’ll be back in school in Fall 2021 with 4 courses left to complete for my minor. 

My question is this: is adding all this extra time to my degree gonna be worth it at the end? I’m kinda stuck between regretting my decision to put everything on hold for so long and also being unphased by the decision and knowing it’s what was right for me. I’d love to know the opinions of outside, objective parties on my decision so please let me know what you think"

1. Research Internship (11th &amp; 12th) - Worked at NIST since last summer (National Institute of Standards and Technology) to create an augmented reality training simulator for a nuclear reactor using the Unity Game engine. Good way of bridging my passion in Game Design to the STEM and research coursework I was familiar with. I described software I used such as Maya, Substance, C#, and the Microsoft Hololens.
2. School Club Founder (11th &amp; 12th) - Started Game design club of over 30 to teach &amp; use game design to create multiple projects on PC and mobile. One app is in development to be put on the Play Store and we participate in game jams and competitions.
3. Art (10th, 11th, &amp; 12th) - Worked on a personal art portfolio of digital 2D and 3D pieces (including animations) made in a variety of software. I submitted many of these pieces as a portfolio component in my college applications.
4. Engineering Competition (11th) - Worked in a team of 3 for the Source America Design Challenge where we pitched, developed, and engineered an iOS mobile app in a team of 3 to help a person with autism to manage a data filing system in his workplace. We organized meetings and had to reach out to the company to manage this. It was a good experience but we didn't win any prizes.
5. Robotics Club (9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th) - Was a member of our school/local FRC and FTC team to organize, direct, and make videos and animations for various competitions and outreach events. Won an award for an animation.
6. Volunteering (10th and 11th) - Worked hundreds of hours as a donation collector for a local food drive. I set up and managed the donation stands at local markets and events as well as approached and educated people about the organization and the cause.
7. Tutoring (12th) - I work as a private computer science tutor for middle school students. I explain concepts for Python, Java, and C++.
8. Foreign Language (10th, 11th, and 12th) - I self-taught and practiced Korean by reading writing and speaking as a hobby. I have no Korean heritage or family, I just did it for fun.
9. Science Olympiad (11th and 12th) - Participated in Engineering events at our regional science olympiad. Never placed high enough to go to States.
10. Sports (10th and 11th) - I was a JV runner for 800m and 1600m races in Track and Field. Practiced and ran the usual amount of meets in the season.

4. National Honor Society (11th &amp; 12th)
5. Mu Alpha Theta (Math Honor Society) 12th

**Letters of Recommendation**

Engineering/Research teacher (7/10?) - Had him for multiple years and he was the head of our STEM Magnet program. Never saw the letter but he knew about my internship and passion for computer science and art. Had good grades in his class and he had a favorable view of me.

English teacher (9/10) - Had her for multiple years and loved me. I tried incorporating my passions into projects like making a Minecraft video or animation for presentations and she included stuff like that in her letter. I got to see the letter and it really fit with my theme of game design and conveying stories with different types of digital media.

Counselor (5/10?) - Never really talked to her except for one time I got caught up in a sting at school and got questioned for stuff (didn't get in trouble though). I think she forgot about it and I wrote decently in my brag sheet so I think it's okay and the recommendation was probably generic.

**Interviews**

**UPenn: (7/10)** Pretty average interview, nothing too special. He asked me questions and had some follow-up but we didn't really connect. We were two different types of people but I turned that into a talking point about how I would be able to meet so many different types of people at Penn.

**USC: (8.5/10)** USC doesn't really do interviews (I wasn't a merit scholarship finalist either) but for their game design program in the School of Cinematic Arts, they interviewed the top 40 or so applicants out of 600 (I think) for their program. It went pretty well and we bonded and joked about different games that I thought he had never heard about. We talked about the design of the games and he asked me specific things about my portfolio pieces. It was really fun.

**Essays**

Common App (6/10 &amp; 8/10):

I had two essays, one was for my 3 EA schools and then I rewrote it for every other school because I thought it wasn't good enough. The original was about how I've always wanted to be a game designer and everyone I knew pushed me towards STEM but I found a way to merge my two interests through my internship. The 2nd one was about my 1-hour bus ride to school which was actually a metaphor for the crisis I faced between my passion and family expectations. I felt like it was pretty well written but idk lmao.

Supplements:

Spent around 1 or 2 days each on my supplements, they were all pretty genuine and kinda unique I think since I have a sort of uncommon major/discipline (Computer Science/STEM and Art/Stories)

Some were kind of stupid, like one I related myself to Aquaman since I felt like I was part of two different worlds (STEM and Art instead of human and Atlantean). I also had a lot of water/ocean puns as imagery.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* UPenn Digital Media Design (Attending, 70k scholarship)
* USC School of Cinematic Arts Game Design (60k scholarship)
* Northeastern University Game Design (70k scholarship)
* UC Irvine Undeclared (but they got more spots open for game design so I got that later) (20k Scholarship)
* RPI Game Design (37k scholarship)
* UMD College Park Immersive Media Design (my only in-state school I applied to and I got 0 scholarship)
* RIT Game Design (40k Scholarship)
* SCAD Game Development (17k Scholarship)
* Drexel Game Design (50k Scholarship)

*Waitlists:*

* CMU BCSA Design (Bachelor of Computer Science and Arts, specifically design) (56k Scholarship since they give the cost to waitlisted students)
* NYU Game Design

*Rejections:*

* UCLA Computer Science (my only non game design one lmao)

**Additional Information:**

* All the scholarships that I indicated were a mix of need-based and merit scholarships, I was giving the total for each school.
* UPenn and USC have been my dream schools and even though USC has the 3% acceptance rate #1 game design program in the world with the L.A. connections, I picked Penn since the degree is one in engineering and doesn't lock me down to just game design (since the industry is notorious for being sorta toxic) and it's cheaper (both are cheaper than my state school, uhhh wtf UMD) and close to home (plus the ivy league prestige lowkey). If I do want to go into game design, I can do my master's at USC. 
* I feel incredibly lucky in getting into these amazing programs, and after seeing most of my magnet school peers not have as much luck as I have had, here are my insights (they are guesses though) about getting in:
   * Have your application have a certain theme or story, especially around a specific major or field if possible. My application totally revolved around the story that I was a STEM-heavy student that wanted to combine my passion with the arts, particularly through game design.
   * I applied to specialized programs that allowed me to truly show a unique application. When it comes to Ivy and T20's, everyone has the 1520+ SAT and 15 AP's with similar EC's. Use a compelling essay, or better yet a portfolio if you have the opportunity (I am incredibly lucky to have an option for this to submit for my majors) to showcase what you've done and why you should have a place at the school.
   * School fit does sorta matter. I know it's a really weird word and it's confusing to even define, but admissions officers and interviewers want students that fit with the general vibe of the school while still crafting a class of unique people from different backgrounds and fields. So for example, UPenn is known for the preprofessional culture where everyone is career-oriented and might know what they want to do or is at least driven to have an overall goal in a specific field (like starting a company or research on a specific project). I'm not sure how it is for other schools but some research online could help you out. If you wanna prestige whore a bit lmao then fit your supplemental essays for the school you're writing and keep in mind the type of person you're looking for (Brown and Penn are probably not looking for the same type of student). Or just be genuine and the school(s) you do fit will accept you.
   * Don't do Comp Sci (jk). Almost all my friends applied for CS and didn't have much luck and my UCLA application for CS was my only rejection. CS is really hard and competitive (especially now) and since it's so saturated, if you want to go to a T5 CS school or something you have to have an insane resume of EC's and competitions and a bunch of valuable personal projects that prove you're a CS god.
* Finally, I made this post because over the past two years I've been on this sub, I've found like 0 posts about game design/computer graphics (maybe there have been ones now, I haven't been as active) and I wanted to make something that might help someone in the same position I was in.

Good luck with your applications!"

I'm in a pretty interesting predicament. I am about to finish a 3 month ""internship"" at a tech startup, and am looking for some advice before signing a contract. I am underclassman college student but have the skills and experience of a full stack developer with 2-5 years of industry experience (and have the resume to back it up), and have been working 20-25hr/wk doing full stack at this startup. For some more info about the company, you can think of it like this: we develop a hardware product (ex a camera) and I'm responsible for developing the platform for users to use once they've shot their photos (like photoshop). That's not actually what we do but you get the idea/structure/market. Here's the company breakdown:

- 1 CEO, pretty technical guy and gets his hands dirty doing hardware stuff for the product

- 1 COO, does marketing, funding, investor relations, etc.

- 1 Lead Data Architect (?), doesn't do much, mainly just extra hands where people need it, almost no technical skills, manages meetings and is technically my ""manager""

- 1 Engineer, responsible for design and manufacturing of the hardware product

- 2 Interns that work on the hardware and robotics software

- Me who does full stack and ML stuff, basically responsible for making their whole platform for users to use once they've used the hardware. I also manage the two interns below.

- UI/UX intern

- Frontend intern

Basically, my internship is over soon and they've expressed that they'd love to keep me on and but have offered me something around $10/hr or .5% over 3mo, or any linear combination of the two. I don't think that this is enough and don't plan on returning for that amount, but I also have no idea how to ask for more or what else I should ask for. If I were to get other jobs I could be making up to 100k/yr (depending on how much I work cause I'm still a student, $60k on 25hr/wk) instead of $10/hr. I can definitely answer more questions with details about the situation, but just looking for some insight."

Background:

I learned web development in college (India) and through paid courses. I'll be graduating this month.

During the lockdown I was bored, so I got a chance to join a local startup. There were only 3 people working there. I worked as intern for 3 months and I took a break (for 2 months) for academics.

I now joined as full time again. It's been 2 weeks.


Situation:

I am compelled to build stuff that are way out of my pay grade. I hate to work in here because of less people and lot of work for a junior developer.

I am not an expert programmer but I know how to get things done. I am confident in my skills. I can clear interview related to web dev easily.

Questions:

1. I'm now 2 weeks in work, shall I resign? I wish I could resign. How to do the resignation process?

2. Since it's only 2 weeks, should I stick for some time here? Should I suck it up and stay just for experience?

3. Anything you want to tell me as a fresh graduate.

naj84d,0,2021-05-12,Transferring from UCI to UCSD (ft. UCI sh*tty admin),sadcatbabeyy,UCI,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/naj84d/transferring_from_uci_to_ucsd_ft_uci_shtty_admin/," A little bit of context: We both graduated high school last May. Bf was accepted to UCSD (undeclared) and UCI (the impacted major he wanted) as a freshman, and ended up committing to UCI for the major. I committed to another UC. He decided that he wanted to apply for UC transfer around late July / early August, because 1) he didn’t like UCI’s campus or environment in particular; 2) some of the other UCs have better programs for his major; 3) he didn’t want to do ldr after covid is over and would rather go to the same UC as me. (The last part unfortunately didn’t happen, but we’re still both very, very happy that he got into UCSD for his major regardless.)

Before fall started, we had a talk and thought that only spending 3 years in undergraduate would be the most beneficial for both of us. We helped each other plan a 3-year schedule, asked upperclassman friends to proofread them and see if they were feasible. The answer was it would be very difficult but possible (we both had 20+ units technical courses per term in winter and spring), so we said to give it a try since first year will be online and very minimal social life.

Now fast forward to late September. UCI organized mandatory new student orientation, where they would meet advisors and pick classes / get class plans approved for the first quarter. Bf had a few questions regarding transferring (prerequisites, course selection, application &amp; petition for excess units), and when the advisor said to ask any questions, he was told that first-year transfer was impossible and he should stop thinking about all the petitions &amp; exceptions. The advisors were not willing to provide any type of support and discouraged transferring at all. He had one of the later enrollment dates, and by the time it was open, he barely got the classes he needed. Communication with the advisor was pretty much useless - no certain answer on anything, no advice, extremely irresponsive as well. There were nothing we could do besides cramming for classes, writing his transfer application, and trying to figure out what to do next on our own. We stayed up for weeks polishing his essays and re-planning courses just so he’d be able to finish all first &amp; second year weeder classes by the end of spring. We were both exhausted when the UC app was turned in.

Right before winter break, winter quarter registration was open and he immediately signed up for classes then submitted the excess unit request. It was very quickly denied, with the reason that he has not established a GPA. He waited and submitted a second request at the beginning of the winter quarter after establishing a GPA that was way above what was required. After a few back-and-forth emails with his designated advisor, who replied every other day asking questions that were clearly answered on the request's justification, we got impatient and he went to ZotChat hoped for a faster response. A different advisor did not even bother to look at the request, straight-up denied it again for no reason at all, telling him to push off one of his courses to summer sessions, which would disqualify him for transfer. After listening to his explanation that transfer requires all these classes, the advisor basically  said “f\*\*k you that’s none of my business” and ended the ticket. She proceeded to specifically find bf’s designated advisor and asked him to deny the request as well. This was a week and a half into the quarter. Bf emailed his designated advisor again, this time requesting 3 less units (excluding an intro to major class), which was approved on the last day of the second week. That was the last day to make any schedule changes - he was finally enrolled in the last class, two weeks behind on coursework, knowing that this could’ve single handedly ruined all of his chances to transfer out.

Similar situation happened for spring quarter, but we learned our lesson that ZotChat advisors don’t do anything but sabotage any plans that might not be “regular” for your major. We ended up spamming his advisor to check the excess unit request, which was approved around a week into the quarter. (Note: this is definitely the SAFEST option to get something approved in remote terms, it just takes time.) To this point, we were completely done with the advisors and never ever wanted to contact them again. It was so much additional stress on top of our already fully-packed academic schedule.

A few weeks ago, UC transfer decisions came out, and we were pretty sad about the fact that he was rejected from the other UC(s) he applied to, even knowing how low the chance is for non CC to UC transfer. On 4/30, the last day for decisions to come out, we were in the middle of a call when he said “oh let me stream something real quick”, I looked up, and it was his UCSD portal. We were both extremely nervous.

... And thirty seconds later, we screamed in the call when “Congratulations!” popped up on the screen, seeing that he not only got into his first choice major, but also for the college he wanted. He ran downstairs to tell his family, and I cried on my bed in happiness. I don’t think I was remotely close to being this happy when I opened my own decisions as a high school senior :’) We spent the rest of the night talking about pros and cons, planning his new schedule at UCSD to see what the workload would be like to graduate in two extra years (to keep that 3 year total), and everything that we’ve done in the past year. The excitement was beyond description - I felt so happy for and proud of him, that all of the hard work was worth it for all this time. Bf committed to UCSD this month &lt;3 Go Triton!

Tl;dr: Bf got accepted to UCSD as a transfer after a year at UCI. UCI admin sucked and were very unsupportive, but we’re glad that things all worked in the end. To anyone who wants to apply for transfer - take your shot and do it as long as you are willing to commit. We were told that you'd need a near perfect GPA, internships and research experience, etc, or else you'd have no shot as a UC to UC transfer, but that is not entirely true :) ""Fortis fortuna adiuvat"" \~"

# Choosing a college:
First of all, **School ranking doesn't really matter in CS**

It's easy to succeed in CS without going to a target school. FAANGs with big interview capacity interview tons of candidates from all around. The only potential issue you might have is with Unicorns and Quant trading that have smaller interview capacities and can be picky and only interview from target schools. Even for these you can get interviews by junior year if you start early and build up your resume with internship experience and projects starting freshman year. Also GPA doesn't matter for CS lol just try to keep it above 3. Even then it doesn't really matter, I had a 2.5 and landed a job at a FAANG

Since it really doesn't matter just **Choose the place you will be happiest**

# Min/Maxing Freshman Year:
## Applying to internships:
You won't really be competitive for normal internships freshman year unless you came in with some great project and experience. Target freshman focused programs such as Facebook University and Google Step. In addition, just apply for every internship role even if you're sure you're gonna get rejected. It's a numbers game. Applications open up in August so you have to be on top of your shit

## During Freshman Year
If you don't have much experience spend time freshman year making projects for your resume. It gives you something to talk about with interviewers and boosts your resume. If you don't get an internship (which is most people). Try to talk to professors about research positions or contact local startups. 

## Interviewing:
You're going to fail a bunch of interviews at first and get responses from even less. Failing interviews is pretty much the only way to get better at them. Practice mock interviews to prepare. Read cracking the coding interview and learn your data structures and algorithms. Practice problems on leetcode. People that did competitive coding in High School will have a massive advantage on interviewing. Interviewing is not just about getting the optimal solution, you need to practice communicating your thought process to interviewers

# Sophmore - Junior Year
From here you basically just keep repeating the steps taken freshman year and improving. Most people don't start competitively interviewing freshman year so you will have a massive advantage and should have a pretty stacked resume by the time new grad rolls up


Also don't kill yourself and try to enjoy college"

nao79n,33,2021-05-12,"FYSA - Everyone looking for an entry level position (and even you old pros), learn networking.",cokronk,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/nao79n/fysa_everyone_looking_for_an_entry_level_position/,"I post this advice a lot. Like a lot, a lot. I see a lot of people get frustrated when searching for their first IT jobs and when trying to break into this career field. I see people complain that they put in 100 resumes on Indeed and never got a call back. 

My advice to you is, learn networking.

Not switches and routers but people and opportunities. For every 100 resumes you throw at a job search engine, there are a 100 other people doing the same. Most of the times you're just a name on a piece of paper with some credentials and HR is playing Eenie Meenie Miney Moe trying to find someone to fill that entry level position. You have to make yourself stand out from everyone else and sending a pretty cover letter isn't going to matter as much as actually talking with someone and making an impression.

You have to use your resources. Did you recently graduate from a school for a BS, AAS, or even just a certification program? Keep up with your classmates and instructors.  Use your school's job placement resources, internship programs, and contacts to help you find a job. Go to job fairs. Use LinkedIn and actually participate in communities. Find other techs that are in your area and get to know them.  Actually putting a face/voice to a name and communicating with someone will give you a leg up over most of the other applicants. A lot of time that first job requires two check boxes: does the applicant have basic knowledge and will they get along with the rest of the team. By networking and using contacts to search for jobs, you'll greatly increase your chances over just blindly firing off resumes. And once you find that job, keep in contact with some of your coworkers. You never know where that will lead to in the future."
nap2w0,3,2021-05-12,Take offer as non-software engineer at big five as CS graduate?,KarlChinaski,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nap2w0/take_offer_as_nonsoftware_engineer_at_big_five_as/,"Hello!

**My questions:** 

*  Do you think it having a big five company on my CV will open up a lot of doors, even though it's not as a software engineer?
* Would you accept an offer as a non-software engineer at a big five company or keep trying for a software role at an unknown company?

**Some background:**

I'm graduating with a first class CS degree this month from a top tier UK university with zero internship experience. The only offer for a job I've got is as a data centre technician in Europe for one of the big five with a salary in the range £35-40k. 

The fact that I'm offered this job in the first place was a bit of a surprise as I've only really considered going into software engineering. My goal is to build a career in software engineering, but having lived a broke student life for the past 4 years, I'm very tempted by the idea of having a salary as soon as possible. My alternative is living off savings for the next 3-4 months after graduating and applying for software jobs while practicing interviews and personal projects. Another significant con of the technician role will require me to relocate to a place I don't really want to live. 

Thanks for your help!"

napow5,3,2021-05-12,Starting again...,AutisticCodeMonkey,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/napow5/starting_again/,"When my husband and I moved to the Netherlands nearly 10 years ago now, we had a few hundred pounds in our accounts. It was a difficult time, but as he’d just graduated and I hadn’t long moved back to Europe after living as a digital nomad in Australia and South-East Asia there wasn’t much option. At the time it felt like Theresa May (The then UK Home Secretary) had a personal vendetta against us as the day we were booked in to file our application for British residency, the rules had been changed and we no longer met the requirements. So, rather than give up we went to the next European country where both gay marriage was legal and we’d be able to survive in English while learning the local language: Enter, the Netherlands.

Living in the Netherlands was like a rollercoaster, I started 3 companies (each of which failed in different ways), my husband worked at restaurants, and we both did freelance jobs all just to get by. Then came an innovative start-up with big plans: Building a distributed datacentre where the waste heat was converted into useable hot water by replacing household combination boilers with silent immersion-cooled servers. My job: Work out how to link all the servers together like a university grade high-performance cluster computer. This project consumed me; I wrote drivers for switch hardware; designed regional fiber networks; modified VM orchestration software; trained 5 interns; led a team of equally driven engineers. After years of grind, we managed it, we’d built the worlds first 10G FTTH deployment, and distributed a cluster of around 50 (I forget the exact number) servers. Then the rug got pulled from under us, our investment round fell apart due in part to the entire team being burned out, but mostly because of a certain minority investor (who shall remain nameless) arguing with the members of the new round of investors over voting rights. Within a few days of the scheduled signing date where we were due to finalize everything it all collapsed and we went into receivership. We were hounded in the press as having “duped” our crowdfunding investors. My friends, colleagues, and I were exhausted - most of us are still recovering from the burnout to this day.

My husband and I were back to square one. No Jobs, Little money, and Brexit was looming on the horizon… We were finally eligible for permanent residence in the Netherlands, but if we were going to move back to the UK so that we could be closer to my family it was now or never. So we packed everything up and took a shot, we got on the ferry to London and started over. I got a job as a Senior DevOps Engineer at a start-up in the financial sector and finally, we were eligible to reside in the UK. At this point, I hadn’t recognised that I was still burned out (and in a way mourning the loss of my previous startup). I just couldn’t get comfortable. So I left, I got myself a job at a fortune 500 as a Senior Engineer working on their Blockchain project. After a year at the fortune 500, I got promoted to Lead Engineer on the project, this was a promotion that I’ll always deeply appreciate. I hope that during my time as Lead Engineer that I made things easier for the engineering team, and shielded them from as much of the overhead as possible. But the extra responsibility, followed by the pandemic, and compounded with the fact that I hadn’t recovered from the burnout at Nerdalize, led to me becoming deeply unhappy at work. I lost two of my grandparents that year which hit me hard, I couldn’t process it yet so it got buried, and ignored. Shortly after during a reshuffle due to the pandemic cuts, most of the people I enjoyed working with there had either left or were on the at-risk list, so while my job wasn’t at-risk I left voluntarily. 

Still apparently oblivious to my own mental state I changed jobs again. This time I joined another fintech start-up, it was fun, it had that special vibe that I was looking for. But the burnout was creeping up on me, exacerbated by the recent loss of two of my grandparents, and the shut-in of the lockdown. Then it hit me, my first ever negative performance review, and I didn’t know what to do. A month later I was fired - effective immediately.

So here I am again, starting over. 

It took me a month to write this, but it's good to put it out there. I'm happier now."

I’m studying business and marketing, and I’m in my final year. I know it might seem that it is a little bit late, but I suddenly realized that I don’t want to study business and marketing anymore. Besides, it will be hard to find a job in this field. However, there are a lot of job opportunities for those who have a degree in computer sciences.

&amp;#x200B;

I realized that the employment market is quite competitive at the moment, and it’s hard to find a job with my degree. There is tough competition even for a place in an unpaid internship. I have no idea why did I choose this pathway. My parents don’t have their own business, compared to some of my classmates. I think back in time, I applied for something that might be easier for me. Now, I feel like I’ve wasted my time and money. Perhaps, I shouldn’t have studied economics, and maybe I wouldn’t have even noticed my epic mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

I see that my mates from my dorm, that study IT, already found some part-time jobs in their field, and they are just in their 2nd year of study. They’ve learned everything at college, and now they can make some good money on what they’ve learned. While I’m struggling to find an unpaid internship with my degree, I will graduate with honors if I do good on my finals.

&amp;#x200B;

When I look for some jobs online, I see that almost every company requires an IT specialist and pays good money. While there are no offers for business and marketing graduates. I’ve reached that point when everyone needs some work experience, but no one wants to hire me so I can get one. This situation became so ridiculous, so I even found a meme based on it.

&amp;#x200B;

In the meantime, one of my friends sent me this link — [https://www.cardinaldigitalmarketing.com/services/seo/](https://www.cardinaldigitalmarketing.com/services/seo/) and told me that I can find myself doing SEO. I wonder what do you think about it? Is it possible to do something in the IT field with a business and marketing degree?"

What - if anything - is the company you're interning at shipping to your home? If they're shipping a laptop, state the specs (if you know), but feel free to be vague for other things. You don't have to state the company name if you don't want to.

If your company is living on the edge and holding the internship in person, what technology and swag will you be given in the office?

The confusion comes at what job I should look for for my first job freshly graduated with a BS in IT with a minor in C.E.T.  a lot of the times when I search ""entry level it jobs"" it's for people with no degree that took certs and almost always recommends a help desk position. The one post I did see about someone with a similar question has the top comment as ""I.T. degree with no internship = help desk"" is that really true? Did I pretty much just waste tens of thousands of dollars to get a degree when I could have taken certs and started at the same position except much earlier? What was the point of the degree then? If you can't tell I am feeling a little panicked so any insight or advice would be so much appreciated"

##Small Ideas: 
###Chapter Twenty Three- It takes two flint...


Bart sat in his chair by the sound booth, his knee bouncing as he watched the theater slowly fill with representatives. He sighed and looked at the schedule again. 

Cassandra had elected to have the debrief come from a pre-recorded report, followed by something just titled “Proposal” followed by a vote. It didn’t lead to any PDF or proposed project in the system… just the word. 
Glancing out into the audience Bart’s eyebrows raised as he noted that the front row was absent of Regina’s usual red hair and Ryan’s bald glare. 
His wrist display chimed and he activated the display, a message arriving in the group chat between the three of them. Scrolling past Ryan’s picture of different foods he’s had at the conference, Bart’s breath hitched as he read Regina’s message. 

&gt;**Regina**: Bart, stay for the end of this meeting, but begin to alert your Team. We’re activating Contingency 5.

Swiping away from the chat, Bart began to type a memo, his mind racing. 
Contingency four was for in the case of a kaiju assault. A very risky plan involving the Cleaning Bots for evacuation and the rail line as a makeshift rail gun. Contingency six was in the case of a disease outbreak and transferred authority of the conference into the hands of the Medical Board. Contingency five was… 

A Kaiju faction was traveling to the station because of the increased Gremlin activty. Prepare for breakdown and immediate conclusion to the conference. 

“Fuck.” Bart said, sending off the message. Immediately after he sent a supply request to the Tetley colony ordering another 10-pound bag of coffee. 

&gt; **Bart Kelley**: Send Priority 1, Subject: Moms home. 

&gt; **Operations**: Acknowledged. 

&gt;**Construction**: Acknowledged. 

&gt;**Guest Services**: Acknowledged. 

&gt;**#(*^$&amp;*#Connection Link$^#%**

&gt;**InterPal Tetley**: Acknowledged. 

Bart stared at the new recipient to who *he definitely did not send the message to.*

“What?”

____

The immediate reactions to the news that the Empire had at least a sizable group of humans building them espionage tools was not the most measured of responses. 

“Rescue them! They're being held captive against their will!” roared one representative, standing on their seat. 

“Traitors to the whole human race, we must hunt them down and declare any drifters to be suspected fugitives until their loyalties have been assured!” hollered another one from the second level. 

The underlying emotion of the room was base panic. While they had spent the last two months trying to decide what their place in the galactic community should be, the galaxy had seen fit to decide for them. 
Over twenty years ago. 

“The Empire has made an enemy of humanity!”

“We have to do something!”

Some wanted war, some wanted to splinter off, others wanted to act like the colonies were still deceased, the survivors' traitors. A common thread though was that no one wanted to act alone. 

“That preposterous-”

“You stupid narrow-minded fool!” 

“Think Mark! We can’t afford to”

And thus they fought. 

“Think they’ve had enough?” Regina asked Ryan dryly, the man standing at the corner of the stage. 

Ryan offered her a smile and tapped his wrist display. 

A loud tone rang out, shaking the theater as representatives covered their ears. As quickly as it started, it ended. 

In the silence that followed, the lights dimmed and a spotlight fell onto the stage. 

Onto Ryan Nakahara. 

“I understand your concerns, representatives,” his voice carried in the silence, the speakers echoing his soft tones. 

“ One of the names recovered on the splicer was of my niece. And knowing her she would never betray our colonies.” 

The monitor came to life again, showing a star chart, the boundaries of the Galactic Empire outlined in red.

“But I know that is not substantial evidence. Which raises the question: What do we want to do?

We have no holdings of our own. No independent colonies and at the very least five to ten years away from our own FTL ships. To try and participate in conventional warfare would be futile and ruin the gremlin reputation everywhere.” 

Ryan walked calmly across the stage as hundreds of eyes watched him. Listened to him. 

“Even my colony is an agricultural one. We are the launchpad for so many other colonies. Rarely on the forefront of discovery, though perhaps a bit more accustomed to comfort than other colonies.” 

He paused and looked out into the theater, the light from the spotlight reflecting in his eyes. His voice cold and crip, cutting into the silence. 
“Despite all of this I want to tear into the Empire. Storm their ships and their worlds until I find our people and bring them home.”

As quick as the cold quiet fury arrived it settled, the old man spreading his arms wide on stage. 

“But we can’t.” 

The monitor changed again, showing a list of agreements and proposals the representatives had voted on for the past month. 

“Last week, we decided on the Contract model of treaties for the colonies,” Ryan said, pointing up at the screen. “That as long as we all follow a shared baseline system of rules, colonists would be free to enter into contracts with both other colonies and with their Kaiju hosts if desired.”

Ryan Nakahara straightened up and stared out into the crowd. “As of today, I resign as Gremlin Manager for the Tetley colonies. I’ve appointed my replacement and they will take over for me at the end of the conference.” 

A few murmurs broke out at the information but were immediately silenced as he spoke again. 

“Now,  As a private citizen of the gremlin colony Tetley Prime, I would like to propose the following Contract with any colony or citizen willing. To form a mobile exploration colony team, composed of any ex settlers or individuals with comparable experience. This colony’s directive would not be to carve out home but to make our way into Imperial Space with the express goal of documenting what has happened to all the dark colonies in that region of space and locate survivors.”

The monitor flickered and began to rotate through the beginning of a project proposal. 

“This colony would conduct itself to the drifter bylaws that have been already agreed upon.” 

Ryan smiled as the lights began to turn on. “There are other contracts I’d like to propose in light of the recent information but this is the most pressing one. Any colony wishing to help is welcome to join the Contract, any who disagree or don’t have the resources are free to abstain.”
“What do you say?”

Cassandra watched as the representatives began to talk and tap at their wrist displays, the first actual use of the Contract system occurring before her eyes. 

“Not bad, Ry,” she murmured. “At the very least they’ll put you in the history books.”

Smiling, she turned her attention to her wrist display and began to navigate the new user interface, adding her agreement to the proposed contract.

“I understand the concerns.” Fleen Seeqwy repeated to the Academy Gremlins Department head, “And this is also a very sensitive situation. They’ve already agreed to the council’s request. I’d like to build a rapport with them before asking for more.”

“Be that as it may,” the Instoid on the screen said. “The fact that this is the first official talk recorded with a Gremlin colony is gathering a lot of attention. Inter-department-wise we have most of the science and engineering departments sending in their questions. Outside the academy, there are at least three governments expressing interest and several interested companies and groups that have contacted our offices as well.” 

Her mandibles clicked. “If we don’t give them something soon, there’s a high chance that they’ll arrive at the station itself to try to interject themselves into the situation.”

Fleen trilled in thought as her eyes wandered, one of them catching the blinking red light on her internship communicator.  “I’ll discuss it with the council and CIen,” Fleen said, reaching for it. “Once I get their perspective I’ll reach out again.” 

She ended the call and put the communicator’s small earpiece in. “Betty? 
What’s happened? I saw the red light…”


…

Oh! I see. How soon?”

…

…

“Give me… half a rotation. Okay... “ 

Fleen used two hands to activate her desk monitor, pulling up her messages. 

“Yes… I see the file. I’ll ask about the sensor. Alright. Talk to you later Betty.”

Fleen paused when the call ended, feeling a nervous kind of excitement rush through her body. She wasn’t sure why the Gremlin leadership had decided to not only immediately provide the data but also request an immediate follow-up on future topics, but she wasn’t about to ignore the good fortune handed her way. Opening several new windows she began to compose several messages. 

&gt;**Fleen Seeqwy**: Hey Rey-son. I have a trading partner that should be coming to the station to meet up with me from the Empire Border. Do you think we could shift one of the long-range sensors?

&gt;**Fleen Seeqwy**: Hey Cien, the Gremlins have provided the data. Could you comb through it and break it down for both the Council and the Academy.

&gt;**Fleen Seeqwy**: Babaroo, the Gremlins have proposed a Contract for the Tetley Council. Due to the shared interest in the future prosperity of the Tetley Station, the Gremlin Colonies would like to appoint a permanent representative to the Council with the understanding that they would hold a similar voice to a council member. Here’s a data packet with the specifics of their proposal.

“I realize that this is asking much from you,” Ryan said softly, handing Ben a glass of golden liquid. 

Ben didn’t immediately respond, his eyes still traveling over the extravagant building that the old man lived in. A group he hadn’t recognized was convinced on the patio, Regina Cardinal settled in between them all as they worked on datapads before them. 

“I don’t understand,” Ben admitted, looking back to Ryan.

The old man took a sip from his glass raising an eyebrow at Ben. 

“You’re a gremlin manager and you threw that all away. And now you want to work with me?” 

Ryan pauses, staring up at the makeshift chandelier above them. The structure is a braided knot of cabling with bulb fixtures installed onto the sides. 

“ You probably think the role holds much power.” Ryan mused, setting down his glass. “ Given that it's been gremlin managers who controlled how much you could interact with colonies. But it comes with many responsibilities.”

Ben listened to him quietly. Shrugging off old memories. 

“We hold much control but it ends at the limits of our colony. At best we can strongly request but our time is not our own.” Ryan’s gaze traveled over Ben’s shoulder to look at the Tetley Tree beyond the balcony. “ It belongs to our people.” 

They sat in silence for a moment, the muffled voices from the balcony the only noise before he continued. 

“My team is some of the best, two generations of agricultural experts, programmers, and engineers who’ve built 50 year-long plans for our people.” He gestured to the gathering outside. “ Children who do art contests and science projects that then decide the layout of our expanded zones. Tetley is self-sufficient now.” 

“And so you quit,” Ben stated, eyeing the old man incredulously. 
Ryan gestured to himself. “I’m sixty-six now. I’ll have another thirty to forty years but I’ll probably only be as active as I am now for maybe twenty of those. If I’m lucky”

Ben’s eyes took in the wrinkles and age hanging onto the old man, the weariness that his spirit seemed to fight against. 

“To build a program like this, to iron out all the bugs and kinks, to improve it and build a system for self-improvement… it’ll take 25.” Ryan leaned back, taking a sip from his glass. “I need someone who I can not just work with but also teach to replace me.”

Ben thought about it. Consider what it would be like to live in such a large house. To not just collect testimonials and keep them safe but look after people and their needs. Something that Nakahara did for thousands of people. 

Something that Mort and Rich did for him. 

“And that's...me?” he asked, looking into his glass. 

“Out of all the drifters you showed up and even held a talk. There’s been a total of nine drifters who’ve attended this conference. Some only stopped by. And others…”

Ryan’s face clouded over, his gaze looking at a section of his living room, eyes narrowing at something that only he could see. 

“... Others have their own goals and expectations of what they want out of the conference.” 

“But you,” Ryan continued, pointing a finger in Ben’s direction. “You’re the only one who raised a voice for all drifters. Even your work with the Medical Board. You’ve taken initiative.”

It was Ben’s turn to focus on memories, the frankly overwhelming experience of sharing hardships that drivers faced, only to be met with proposals and questions about the experience. 

“I just… didn’t want us drifters to be overlooked. I didn’t want to start such a fuss,” he said quietly. 

“You won't be,” Ryan promised. “With my proposal, we are essentially creating professional drifters. Creating a system that allows people to separate, gather, share information and then separate again as we try to follow those lost colonies. Colonies can’t turn drifters away with this system in place.” 

Ben nodded thoughtfully, looking at the earnest expression in the old man’s face. 

“And we’ll need help. We need to know not only what supplies and habits we’ll need. But we’ll need to know how to approach other drifters as well.” Ryan said softly. 

“Other drifters have made some agreements but I’d like for you to be a part of this. To use your voice to guide us and teach us.” 

The two looked at each other. The Gremlin Manager who founded the Tetley Conference and the Drifter who decided to go on a whim. 

“So what do you say?” Ryan asked. 

Ben took a deep breath and attempted to knock the drink back in one go. 
He immediately spluttered, coughing and splattering Ryan’s face with drops of fine liquor.

“Sure,” Ben answered sometime later. 

_______

“I’m Chris, I run most communications and general information gathering,” the tall androgynous person with green highlights said. “Here’s a brief overview of both how our system works and the information we’ve collected since the conference began. We had a security break some weeks back into our-”

Regina scanned through it and annotated sections for further investigation and follow-up. 

“Don’t ya worry about the plants! We’re building three more plots for all the seeds the colonies got us and the harvest is coming along nice and smooth. We had a brief kinda disease rush through the water berries but-” 

Regina commissioned a report requesting a database breakdown of the different nutritional benefits of the different plants and an update to the Settler Seed starter pack. 

“The mayoral council is gathering a report giving you an overview of the colonies for the last year as well as ongoing talks. Once you're ready they're prepared to meet with you for GM approval and to hear your thoughts on their proposals.” 

Regina sent the file to her inbox to read in-depth later. 

A chime alerted her to a message from Bart with a proposed clean-up timeline for her to read through and approve if it didn’t interfere with the several other projects being carried out. 

“What the fuck Ryan?” Regina asked as the Tetley personnel around her chuckled. “What kind of hell job did you drop me into?”

Most students in my program do the 2 semesters of post-bac classes and then 2 semesters of masters level classes before pursuing an internship but I was anxious to start getting some enterprise experience before deciding what the focus of my masters degree would be so I pursued an internship earlier and very fortunately received an offer at what seems to be a cool company with decent compensation. 

My programming skills are fairly good but I have spent little time immersed in the CS world so I am not sure what to be looking for in a job. I am of course grateful to receive an offer at all but I am curious what kind of skills I can expect to build and how marketable they might make me in the future based on this job description. 

The company essentially builds software for clients in the industrials space with a broad range in what this means project to project. They are growing rapidly and would like to standardize the development process across teams and projects. To this end, they are developing an app using Microsoft Dynamics 365. I would be working on this project helping to create a suite of tools to aid the development process. During the course of my internship, they said I would gain experience in the following:

\- Using windows power apps

\- Working on the low-code side

\- Working on the JavaScript side

\- Creating high-code solutions

\- Creating documentation to aid in the standardization of the development process

I am excited to begin but I was wondering what other people's thoughts were on the job description."

My GPA in undergrad was pretty terrible (2.5) in a stem major, however post college I feel pretty confident in my growth.

1. 2.5 Gpa, top state school, Majored in Computer Science and Engineering, with a business minor
2. 27 years old, started out doing data architecture post grad at a F500 company, currently managing a data architecture team with 5 direct reports and some offshore resources. Strong LOR from leadership I've worked with (VP level and directors)
3. Haven't taken the GMAT yet, but my GRE was 325 when I took it a year ago. I'm comfortable taking the GMAT a few times and studying for a higher score.

I'm mainly looking for an MBA to learn how to manage at an executive and higher level, and to continue my career growth. I'm comfortable talking about my low gpa, mainly due to not caring about my specific major, and working part time as an intern while finishing classes my final year and a half. I would hopefully begin applying next cycle in 2022, as I am signed into contracts and obligations until mid 2022. 

My main question is during this next year, what are things I can focus on improving over my next year in order to shore up my chances. I'm not targeting m7, however I would like to at least reach for Kellogg. My main target would be Indiana, Ohio State, Washington, and Ross."

I will give details about the job advert: 

4th grade CS or Maths Bachelor's

Join Quantitative Trading Team as a long term intern

Deep understanding of Probability Statistics ML

Proficiency in Python

Ability to deal with open ended problems

Working on real projects with experienced traders, researchers, developers

Apply ML techniques to derive novel findings regarding market behaviour from large datasets

My questions

1. So is this a research position or trader position? And what is the difference between a researcher, developer and trader?

2. What is the work life balance in general comparing to software developer positions. More working hours? On call? 

Also how common work from home, I heard it is rare because the company wouldn't want me to access my tech, data from home?

3. If I work in this position for a few years can I get into Software development or Data science if I don't like it. Would those two years be considered as two years experience in Data science, Software development? Since I am close to 30 this is really important for me.

4. Can I use the systems I developed in the team for my personal trades, investments?

5. Is there any short online course, tutorial I can try to be able to understand what this job will be like? And also to gain some knowledge before interview.

6. When I asked this in r/quant my post get removed and the mod messaged me a long post talking about how he quit his quant job and says I will quit too because this area is not beneficial to society and it will die after the big crash of today's financial system. There is no job security. What do you think?

But behind the scenes, I desperately struggle to get things done and I spend long nights catching up on what my peers could finish in a fraction of the time. I ask for extensions every week, I use every accommodation I can get, and I often neglect my own needs (mainly sleep and exercise) for the sake of attempting to get my brain to literally! just! focus! on the tasks I'm likely already behind on. I'm embarrassed to tell people that I spent hours on what they thought was easy.

Yeah, I know that (for the most part) I've earned my grades because I putting so much time into school, having people assume you're just ""smart"" means there's a big risk that one day they'll realize how damn slow my brain really is. They'll realize that I bomb every practice test and the only reason I do well on the real ones is because I have accomodations and I spend hours going over the simplest of things, doing what they'd consider to only be hard if you're stupid. They'd see that I'm the one asking the dumb questions everyone rolls their eyes at on the anonymous class discussion boards.

I've built my identity around overachieving and others have shaped their perception of me around this, which is unhealthy, I know, but the whole ""eldest daughter and burnt out gifted kid with multiple psychiatric disorders"" will do that lol

I would be failing out of college right now if I didn't have meds or accomodations. I actually did get an F in the fall and I took the quarter off but I got lucky and retook it and my GPA is like nothing ever happened. On paper, my achievements are ""perfect"" so why would anyone question that?

For example, I feel like I conned my way into an internship for this summer. It's a super technical data science role, but I have only taken one data science-specific class in my entire time so far in college, and I haven't coded in over a year. Maybe I'm just good at interviewing and I tricked these people into thinking that I'm fluent in things that, without a doubt, I would need to google. Even though I got an A in that class, that information completely vacated my brain within months. Honestly, I would've barely passed in the first place if it weren't for one of my friends and the internet. I'm terrified of the moment when my new boss realizes that he hired someone terribly underqualified for the position.

Does anyone relate to this? Have you figured out a way to beat the perfectionism?

**TL;DR:** ***High-achieving on paper, severely impacted by ADHD behind the scenes, yet no one really knows (yet). Probably a case of imposter syndrome and a fear of failure in general***"

This summer, I don't have that many plans. Despite good grades in my classes (A- to A in Algorithms, Computer Structures, and Databases), I haven't been able to find a paid internship this summer. That being said, I do have a few offers for internships that are basically unpaid (equity/&lt;=200 dollar compensation) as well as an offer to continue in the research lab im in.

I know that I will need to improve my leetcode even though I can knock down most lc mediums as well as my speaking skills to stop choking on the interviews, but is there anything else I can do this summer to make myself more employable?"

CompSci during the beginning of the pandemic. I didn't have any work experience other than being a volunteer tutor at our school's compsci club and working part time at school as an IT assistant. Most of my projects are from classes that had a semester long deliverable and a senior year capstone project were we worked in a group with PMs and sponsors. The few personal projects that I have is a discord bot, a barebones path algorithm visualizer website, and a few web scraping applications for stocks and covid information. I didn't start applying to jobs till after I graduated (which is a mistake for sure) and I applied throughout the summer using LinkedIn and Indeed. Couple of friends gave me their referrals for companies in my area but never heard back from the company due to the lack of actual work experience, ie. internships/co-ops. I got demotivated from the job hunt in september and was getting anxiety from not hearing back from companies and family members lecturing every other day about not finding oppurtunities. The pandemic also made me demotivated from starting new projects and doing leetcode problems without getting even a phone call from companies made me demoralized. I started only applying to jobs every now and then. Fast forward to now, in the past month I started some online courses on udemy, cs50 from harvard, and freecodecamp to learn more about web dev. Put the things I learned and started working on more personal projects, started applying to 10+ companies a day but still not hearing from anyone. I need advice on whether I should hit up a bootcamp and try to network there, in hopes of landing a job or keep doing what I am doing right now. Another option would be going back to school for my masters. My asian parents have been pushing me to work at a family member's restaurant out of state and saying I should make money instead of sitting at home on the computer. My family is a traditional Chinese family, my parents are first gen immigrants and I feel like I'm a failure and on top of the weekly talks about what I'm doing with my life, where I explain that I'm trying to learn more skills, do more projects to put on resume. My life has been getting pretty toxic and depressed and I don't know what path to take and wanted some opinion on what I should do since it feels like I'm stuck on island.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Graduated last year as a CompSci major, have no internships and co-op, started applying after graduation and throughout the summer, never heard back from any company. Started to get demotivated after spending so much time on applications and doing leetcodes daily. Started to apply in staggered amounts spread throughout the months. Started applying 10+ applications a day this past month and picked up motivation to learn a new language in Javascript and did a few online classes and crash courses on web development. Getting pressure from parents to get a job (even though I am trying and applying every day) and feel so lost on what path I should take. Need some opinions on what I should do."
nb5lej,0,2021-05-12,Employer Quarantine Rules Legal or Not?,Ted_CruZodiac,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/nb5lej/employer_quarantine_rules_legal_or_not/,"My gf has an internship with a company in Michigan and they had been very shakey with what exactly their rules around covid are.  Now they have told her that if she comes into contact with ""anyone outside of the company"" she has to quarantine for 10 days.  They said this is because they have people flying in from all over the US to work there, so they have to be extra safe.  Basically if she leaves the facility for anything non-essential, she will then have to wait over a week before she can start working again.  I'm already fully vaccinated, so is she and so is her family, which are really all she was hoping to be able to see.  I know you can still get the virus even if you're vaccinated but I really don't see how they can force her to not be able to see me or her family for the whole summer unless she wants a week out of work.  Any advice on whether or not this company can do this or how we should go about this issue without putting her job at risk?"

I'm currently a 10th grader. I'm hoping to get some tips/opinions on what I should do over the next year of high school. 

&amp;#x200B;

For some reference: 

\- Good grades, all A's with the exception of one B+ (Honors Biology). 

\- School doesn't offer ***ANY*** AP/IB classes, the most advanced classes provided are honors, which honestly, aren't much more difficult. 

\- SAT prep tutor for math, looking for an English one as well.

\- A few ""EC's"" (Looking to get involved elsewhere too!)

* Pursuing a bachelor's level diploma for iOS Development, currently on Project 5/11, aiming to complete this program by August/September. (Goal is to use the knowledge/qualification I'm getting to land an internship &amp; create my own apps)
* Have been working in the family business since I was 10 years old. I've learned ***a lot*** about the management/technical side of business - invoicing, writing professional emails, managing documents, graphic design, collaborating with adults on projects, etc.
* Volunteering at community mosque (nothing special really).

&amp;#x200B;

The universities I'm interested in are: 

University of Washington, UCLA, UC Berkeley, NYU, Stanford and virtually any Ivy League school. I'm super interested in medicine &amp; business, however, I've been looking into computer science &amp; finance as well.

And yes, before I get bombarded with criticism, I understand that the schools I've listed are extremely competitive, nonetheless, these are all schools I've visited and envisioned myself being there for 4 years of my life. 

**Ending Statement**

I guess what I'm really hoping for is a little bit of guidance and information about what I can look into from someone who was in my same situation not long ago. I'd ask someone personally, but I'm not necessarily sure ***who*** to ask and even then, ***what*** to ask...

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

The electives and courses at GWU is a lot more and is under the Math and Statistics dept whereas the one at Boston University is under the Comp Sci.

I wanted to understand the internship opportunities at Boston U and how are the job opportunities for graduates?

Can anyone share their experience at Boston U in MS ADA program? How is the curriculum and the networking opportunities? My focus is Data Science and I am wondering if this is the right school and program.

Thank you in advance!"
nb87lb,6,2021-05-13,Graduating in 10 days. What the hell do I do now?,Krimson_Prince,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/nb87lb/graduating_in_10_days_what_the_hell_do_i_do_now/,"So my Biological engineering curriculum at UH Manoa just chewed me up and spit me out like all of its other graduates. This may be a bit self-incriminating, but I hadn't reviewed graduate opportunities during December 2020, which is apparently the time you are supposed to look into those things. No one told me, I didn't know enough (and was so suppressed by my capstone project and credit load), and the situation is that I am kind of at a loss as to what to do after I get out of this bull\*\*\*\*. I feel like I haven't learned anything. Seriously. Most of my learning has been in the one internship I did back in 2017 with the Navy, and the two lab jobs I've had on campus, and the capstone. Everything else was...a waste of time.

I really just want to work at this point and not have to enroll in another bull\*\*\*\* degree at UH Manoa. It honestly sucks as a school and its so sad that hardworking students just dont have the opportunities to succeed because were on a damned island. The few internships that ARE offered are sorting out papers for project managers, or running errands, or taking pictures of renovations on campus. Everything else that I've looked into just sort of feeds fresh undergrads into slaving away in a graduate program that isn't even relevant to engineering. Now, I'm NOT opposed to a graduate program, its just that now I can't get into one until SPRING of 2022 and...what the hell do I do until then? I'll be damned if I take more useless classes that don't add up to anything. Don't get me wrong, I value education very highly, but not the type of education that lines the university's pockets with their shitty online courses, 0 lab work, 0 networking opportunities, and just wastes students' time when they could have instead taken a community college course and read a textbook and gotten a stronger grasp of the content AND paid less AND had more time to commit to projects that are actually valuable.

Anyway, is anyone in this situation? How are you managing it? I'm just applying for jobs at this point. I would do anything to get the \*\*\*\* off this island.  The one professor that I do appreciate and have done several CAD projects for just told me today that he can't pay for me as a graduate student, can't hire me privately as a technician, and told me that I would have a ""gap"" through the fall semester. Can anyone point me in the right direction? Are there other universities that are still accepting applications? I asked my advisor all these questions and he pointed me to my engineering professor...who then told me to talk to my...advisor?! That's some \*\*\*\*\*\* up loop process if you ask me.

I really apologize for the rant. Just feel like the last 3 years have been an utter waste save for my job working as a student researcher. If anyone can offer any advice, I'd really, really appreciate it. Hell, I'll send you a souvenir from this blasted island. Thanks and best of health to you all."
nb8rxk,0,2021-05-13,Meraki Internship Question,ComputaGuy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nb8rxk/meraki_internship_question/,"Hello people of r/cscareerquestions,

I recently accepted an offer for network support engineer internship (virtual) @ meraki. During the short call, the recruiter went over the usual stuff such as compensation and timeframe. One thing that stuck out to me was that meraki sends you the equipment straight to your house which includes a laptop along with meraki stuff.

For those redditors who have virtually interned as NSE's before, do you get to keep the equipment after the internship ends?

 Judging from all the money that meraki throws at you, I am assuming that they might as well let the interns keep all that stuff for themselves, but that was the one question that I did not want to ask.

TL;DR: If you are a virtual intern, do you get to keep all the equipment that meraki sends you after the internship ends?"

nbb61p,1,2021-05-13,Study abroad vs Internship,Robbfucius,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nbb61p/study_abroad_vs_internship/,I'm currently a Computer Science student and my goal was always to get at least one internship. But given how much credit I already have I realized I have two free semesters to do whatever the hell I wanted. So I decided to study abroad in Tokyo for two consecutive semesters.  I'm extremely excited but what sucks is that Spring semester in Japan runs from April to July so I won't be able to get an internship if I do this. I think a year long study abroad in Japan is a once in a lifetime chance that I have to take it. I feel I'd regret it if I don't. The question is how much harder is it going to be to find a job with no internship experience? Am I making the right choice here?

I am an International Relations major pursuing a certificate (sort of like an advanced minor) in Computer Science and Global Management, and a fairly strong student (just based off of GPA haha) at a prestigious university... but I feel like there is this giant wall in front of me and I am going to go no where in the future. Going to a good uni, and coming from a lower performing high school, I feel so out of place... especially because I got in through an appeal. Almost like I am drowning and I'm not smart enough to save myself. On top of that, finding internships feels harder and harder after each application and rejection, and especially with my field, I don't know where or what I could perform well in. I can't even seem to land a part time job for the summer. I feel really lost that if I can't get any of these roles, who is going to want to hire me in the future? 

I guess my question is this:

How do you overcome a sense of imposter syndrome, and this fear that you are not good enough for any role? I feel like I have really gotten in my head that there is someone better fit for a position then me and it is seriously affecting my confidence. I have pulled away from pursuing certain opportunities because of it and I don't want this to overtake me.

I'm at the start of this crossroads where I know I want to move on and that I will but am uncertain how to best do so. I spend almost all of my hobbyist time programming in C#, and it's something I really enjoy.

I am conditionally admitted to a Computer Science M aster's of S cience program; meaning I would need to take approximately 24-30 hours of the core classes of their Computer Science BS degree, which would take me a full year before formally enrolling in the M aster's program. This path would, thereby, take me at least the end of Fall 2023 or Winter 2023 s emesters.

I have immediately enrolled in the first of these core classes for the Summer to orient myself back toward academia; I would imagine I could land some form of internship, part-time or full-time, during this time to support myself, right?

Any thoughts on this 3 year M aster's pathway? Would it be worthwhile relative to a 1 year bootcamp or just otherwise trying to be hired in with self-taught knowledge?"

It's been alright so far and I've been pretty switched on during the whole process. The only downside is that since I'm just an intern, I don't have any real responsibilities and find myself doing a lot of grunt work with not a lot of meaning or value. My company does have a graduate program (mid-year intake) for starting engineers which is a lot more structured and higher responsibilities. I applied to it but just found out that I didn't make the cut (3 available positions out of the 12 final applicants), which is quite disappointing and shocking since I was an internal applicant and thought my interviews went pretty well. 

I'm just a bit lost now and unsure how I should go about tackling my future within the organisation. Should I be looking at applying for other engineering roles elsewhere? I was initially thinking of having a conversation with my recruiter and manager about my options for the future and positions that are available for me, but a bit unsure as I'm not sure if they have any graduate engineering roles left and don't want to look too desperate.

My contract  (6 month placement)  with this company ends mid-July so still have a bit of time left. Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated.

nbjk0o,13,2021-05-13,Waitlisted...Now What?,MBAPrepCoachcom,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/nbjk0o/waitlistednow_what/,"Hello to all those waitlisted! I realize this wait is agonizing and putting your life on hold. My hope is that you do what you can to put forth a great update letter and then let it all go.

I really like how Cornell-Johnson has outlined the potential weaknesses and recommended strategies in their waitlist information letter. I want to give you a bit of insight behind each item.

* **GMAT/GRE or TOEFL/IELTS score below the median:** Retake the exam and send an updated score report
* **Limited exposure to quantitative coursework or tasks / Low GMAT/GRE quantitative score (below 65%):** Improve your GMAT quantitative score and/or complete quantitative coursework such as a course at your local university or online courses through [**Coursera**](https://www.coursera.org/). Additionally, you may consider supplementing with [**mbamath.com**](https://www.mbamath.com/default.aspx)
* **Communication skills:** Join Toastmasters or a similar public speaking group. For non-native English speakers: read English literature, watch English television shows and interact with native English speakers as much as possible
* **Planning a significant career transition without prior preparation:** Network with individuals in your desired industry and consider refining your goals; read *The Two-Hour Job Search;* consider a viable Plan B
* **Limited career experience:** Demonstrate significant achievements and leadership successes by sending updates and/or obtaining an additional recommendation - this can include activities/experiences outside of the workplace
* **Fit and commitment to Johnson:** Contact [**current students**](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/programs/full-time-mba/admissions/community-search-tool/), faculty, staff, and/or alumni to learn about Johnson and how you could contribute. Provide an updated statement about why Johnson is the best MBA program for you

**Low GMAT**

This is published and becomes a factor in rankings: competitiveness signals the “cachet” factor and therefore the value of the education they are offering. This goes for both student and employers recruiting there. So, if they have to take a hit to their average GMAT in order to bring you into the fam, something has to offset that. This is usually some aspect of diversity (ethnicity, sexual orientation, industry, life experiences) that will add something unique to the class.

The GRE is less often published and thus, a bit of a back door in some circumstances. If you are overrepresented but have an interesting application, it might be a good idea to go this route.

If you end up applying this upcoming year and there is a test waiver option, apply for it if your score is below the posted average.

**Quant Woes**

The quant score is also frequently published in the class profile and signals the same perception of value to employers. Johnson states 65%+ and INSEAD asks for 70%+; I would say 47 seems to be the minimum for M7 if you have other mathy data points (but – GRE, less published and a wider range).

But the main thing here is, they do not want you to flunk out because 1) it looks bad for them, 2) opportunity cost of the lost tuition, and 3) bad juju for the school. While this rarely happens, they guard against it vigilantly. I generally recommend MBA Math because its online and self-paced; it has a long-standing reputation.

If you submit an update letter, it’s not a bad idea to consider other ways of proving numeracy. Call out the B or better grades you got in quant subjects. CFA is another really good way to do this. I have had a lot of success getting CFA students into schools when their test score did not work out. Rotman accepts the CFA in lieu of the GMAT.

**Communication Skills**

To be very straight with you, I think the Toastmasters recommendation is unlikely to work out as your lone strategy for getting off the waitlist, but it is good to mention as a bonus. I believe retaking the TOEFL or upping your verbal would carry more weight. If you are applying this coming year then yes, Toastmasters is not a bad idea, but with COVID times it will take on a bit of a different form.

**Job Change**

“Planning a significant career transition without prior preparation” is likely to be a big pain in the butt for the people in the career management center. I ask all my clients who are changing function or industry to do a substantial amount of outreach – meaning, writing something compelling to people doing what you want to be doing and cold emailing. A lot. Big numbers. There is an art to this to get a good response, but you will get responses.

Here is why. The school wants to know that you have a realistic plan and you have thought this out, NOT that you dream to be XYZ, plan to drop that in their lap, and then pitch it over the fence to the CMC. I know this because I was one of those people – wanting to go from finance to advertising of all things with zero groundwork laid. While I lucked out and it was all self-initiated, I think they felt some anxiety towards the end. I had to report to the principal’s office a couple times.

TLDR; they safeguard that “employed within 3 months” number like Gollum safeguards The Precious and they really do not want you to muck it up. If you have no background in the post-MBA job, you have less value to that prospective employer, and it might be hard for them to get you off their hands.

Do the research and outreach to show you know you have what it takes to get the job you want, and speak to that in your update letter.

Or better yet, get some data points moving in that direction. Line up a pre-MBA internship, volunteer…do whatever it takes…for free…to get a foot in the door and show you are serious. I have never read *The Two-Hour Job Search,* as Cornell suggests, but I can deduce they are signaling for you to create a firm plan to get the job you want. So that is something to work on and stick in your update letter.

**Low Work Experience**

If you haven’t already, scan your background for times you made a positive impact. I really encourage community service because often, this gives you the ability to take initiative and show leadership abilities before you are entrusted with anything important at a F500 firm.

As noted below – update them on career achievements that show you can get things done and make an impact. Getting a promotion is ideal. Additional recommendations if allowed; letters of support from alumni that illustrate your ability to make a positive impact are often welcome if you cannot submit another recommendation.

If you need to apply for the upcoming year, get a jump on this. Pick a hobby or something you know a lot about and try to get on a committee or a board; even virtually is fine. Or something related to your post-MBA goal to both show impact and lay groundwork for a career shift.

**Fit and Commitment**

Schools want to know if they pick you, you will pick them back (yield), which is not a hugely important issue for HBS and GSB but super important for schools that are often a back-up. They need to feel there is a good value proposition for you at their school, you know what you are getting into, and you will be a satisfied customer.

If you failed to network with students and alums prior to submitting your essays, and the essays require a “why this school” question, do that research now and be on the lookout on how you can contribute there. And put this in your update letter.

Do not take the lazy way out and say you will start a bunch of clubs. Understand what they have going on and how you can support what already exists. Almost no one actually starts a club in MBA programs, let’s be serious.

Also articulate that you would immediately put down a deposit if you received an offer, and that this school is your top choice.

Good luck and I hope you get off the waitlist!"

nbko8c,3,2021-05-13,What to do on my first attempt to buy and build a computer ? Any advice is welcome,Araly74,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/nbko8c/what_to_do_on_my_first_attempt_to_buy_and_build_a/,"Hello, I'm finally out of school and I recently moved to a new country and started a job. I have money left over from a good paying internship, I'm not planning to move again any time soon, so I can finally start planning to buy and build a computer. It's the first time I'll buy something that's not a laptop, and I need to buy everything, including peripherals and such. I currently have a 3 or 4 year old laptop that I play games on, a cheap mouse, as well as a 1080p monitor and a standard keyboard that work gave me to work from home.

I'm planning to get a computer that I'll maintain and upgrade when it needs it. I'd want the computer to be able to run VR (will probably get the Valve Index or similar later). I run Linux as my daily driver, play my games on it and such. I play things like Factorio, Rainworld, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, Risk of Rain 2, Horizon Zero Dawn, Hades, Guild Wars 2, Elite Dangerous, League of Legends, Legends of Runeterra... I'm not necessarily good at the games I play, I just want to have a good time really, have fun with the movement, be amazed by the sounds and the visuals, get attached to the characters. I've kept a Windows partition too (Windows AME) to play anti cheat games with friends from time to time like Fall Guys, Rainbow 6 Siege, Due Process, Planetside 2, and Totally Accurate Battleground.

On my current laptop, I have a GTX 1050 with 2 GB of VRAM, and that's probably my bottleneck. I usually have to keep textures to Low on games, even if I can add some effects like anti aliasing on high. I also have a HDD that I suspect is dying, that's where I have my windows partition, and it's very slow. I have my Linux partition on a recently bought SSD (NVME, M2, 500GB, probably the only piece I can move to my next computer).

I don't know what pieces to build with, but I know I probably want to go with AMD for both CPU and GPU. Nvidia has been a bit of a headache, even if the drivers are now properly handle by package managers (pacman on Linux through Manjaro, and chocolatey on Windows). I'm stuck on Xorg on my laptop because of Nvidia, and having an optimus laptop has been quite annoying to work with (I rely on optimus-manager on the laptop, but I mostly just keep the GPU always powered on anyways, as it's always plugged in to the power, and the battery is kinda bad). I know a lot of people have told me that Nvidia is more optimized, has better drivers, but I'm not sure if that's worth the headaches, and it seems to be only really relevant on Windows. For the CPU, going with AMD makes sense to me to pair with the GPU, but I don't really have any reasons for it.

A thing I want to try is get rid of the Windows partition and instead use VFIO to play Windows games. I know some people have 2 GPUs but that sounds a bit overkill. Maybe I can go with a single GPU passthrough but that sounds like functionally it would be the same as just rebooting on another partition. I'll have to see about that, the ideal thing would be to be able to do everything on linux, and when needed boot up a windows VM while keeping discord on linux for example. I don't know how realistic this all is, especially as anti cheat games like to ban people playing on VMs, but it's nice to think about. Here comes the part where maybe I want an integrated GPU in the CPU, but maybe if I have a dual boot on an SSD it's just easier and faster to reboot instead.

I know the GPU demand is very high right now, and offer is very low, so I know that I shouldn't expect to be able to get all the pieces I want quickly, but I'm patient, I have a working laptop, I've waited for months to get a job and be able to move out and get a home for myself, I can wait a couple others months to get the nice computer I want to get. I'm good with software, but I don't know much about hardware, so please don't be afraid to explain things, I'm ready to learn.

I'm not sure about my budged, I want to buy the computer, but also a monitor, mouse, keyboard. I imagine the budget might climb to 1500€ quickly, more than that sounds a bit much though. I'm also a bit confused because I've been on websites like https://pcpartpicker.com/guide/2sQzK8/great-amd-gaming-build, where the price shown is 1700$, but the description talks about 1100$ price target. Then the sidebar talks about how even 1000$ in a computer is pointless and way too much and to just spend 700$ instead. https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/diqq9/your_thoughts_on_future_proofing/. So I was leaning towards trying to get something in the latest AMD CPU and GPU lines, but maybe that's just stupid, and I might be better off with buying parts from last year instead.

What would you guys recomend I do ? Where should I start, what is good to keep in mind, what are strategies I can use to choose the right parts, and then to buy the right parts ?

nbkrc4,2,2021-05-13,Start Intern Apps Now With Rough Resume or Later With Better Resume... or Both?,FunkyGroovin,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/nbkrc4/start_intern_apps_now_with_rough_resume_or_later/,"Hey, all! I'm only taking 1 class this summer semester and am putting as much attention as I can into bettering my resume/interview prep. 

Today I had the idea of just applying to any internship positions I can find open. I figure now is kind of a weird time of year to do it, but maybe it's worth a shot.

My worry is that I may apply to a company right now with my not-so-good resume, and then that company may have a summer internship position I will want to apply for again later this year. However, because my previously submitted resume wasn't good enough, will they throw out my second one once they see indicators that it comes from the same person?

What do you guys think? Am I being paranoid with that scenario? Also, do you think it's worth it putting a little time into sending out some applications now? I'm not talking 100s, just if I get tired of grinding leetcode/projects and want to do something a little more mindless but productive, I could just do some appplications.

Thanks for your help!!"

I graduated in May 2020 just when corona was in full swing. I had around 100 application out at the time just shotgunning for an entry level job, and got 2 responses back both negative. Everyone dropped their summer programs, like half of my college friends were fired from their internships before the first day. For a few months I bounced between doing resume stuffer projects and sending out applications. I was approaching around 200 applications total when I finally got a response from some IT contract position at the local school system. This was really sub-optimal but at this point I was desperate and was willing to work anywhere as long as it was with a computer. It was a good temporary job but I was really dissatisfied with it since the work was repetitive and really easy, not to mention the poor pay. I started applying more on linked in near the end of the contract, and by some miracle an honest-to-goodness software role wanted an interview with me. The interview was almost devoid of technical questions, was obviously just a means for the contracting agency to steal someone's paycheck, and I was hired within 3 days. The pay was not great but is was enough to where I could pay rent and get by. Fast forward 5 months of working remotely doing interesting but underpaid work and developing my stack, some college buddies recommended I try messaging a recruiter for a growing fintech company in my area. About a month of pestering the recruiter finally got me a interview, and I passed with flying colors. Now I have a full-time career with perfectly acceptable pay for a newish grad with great benefits. 

Lesson being: life is shitty and unfair but if you keep trying you can get lucky and land a career starter. 

Progress overview:

\- 5/2020 with a BA in CS from UNC-CH

\- 5/2020-8/2020: no job and on the application/learning grind

\- 8/2020-11/2020: contract helpdesk job at local school 15/hr

\- 12/2020-5/2021: low wage contract research dev with the government 22/hr

I am moving to Texas for an internship this summer. I will arrive a few days before my internship starts and get settled in my apartment, and when my internship ends I plan on staying there for a few years at least. I will not come back to the state I am currently living in, which is Virginia.

However, right now I am still in my old state filling out the background check. Can I say that I am a resident of Texas, since I will be when I move in the next few weeks?

I am asking for tax purposes. Virginia collects income tax, but Texas does not. I do not want to pay Virginia state income taxes when I will never be living here again, and when I will not be starting the internship until after I move to Texas. I also do not want to mess up my chances with this internship by accidently lying, so I am confused.

As the title says, I will be starting my internship for a software engineering position this upcoming Monday but have recently developed a wandering left eye (strabismus) due to poor vision or partial vision in my left eye. I have a brain tumor which has caused me to have bad vision in both of my eyes for the past 4-5 years but my brain definitely has favored my right eye over my left eye. Whenever I focus on things my left eye drifts down. It only happens when I focus on things hard. If I am talking to someone or moving it isn’t apparent and doesn’t drift down. My question is should I tell my employer so they can accommodate for me(like bigger screen, use bigger font on programs, etc) when I start on Monday during orientation? I feel like I have to because whenever I program on my laptop now my eye drifts down and I don’t want that to be an issue when I program. 

If anyone has had or is having vision issues like mine please share your experience on how you have dealt or deal with it. I’m not gonna let a lazy or wandering eye hinder me from programming since it something I love to do and enjoy a lot."

nbolct,1,2021-05-13,Being managed out of the job?,brightstar0908,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/nbolct/being_managed_out_of_the_job/,"Hi Folks, I would appreciate your view on whats going on here, as initially I thought I was a victim of bullying in the workplace, but it seems like now I am being ""managed out"". 

We were a sales team of 4 (3 employees + 1 boss), very good set up, I've been there for almost 2 years. Due to the pandemic, the industry I work for went downhill and as a consequence my boss has been sent back to the mother company and the other employee was fired. Among this whole drama, I took maternity leave for 3 months and returned last november. Now it is just me and the other colleague who is now actually my line manager (he has more experience on the job and is now a senior). He reports directly to the CEO. 

Ever since he became my boss my life is hell, he is a controlling person, micromanages me, shouts at me in front of other colleagues, gets annoyed and rolls his eyes at my questions. But sometimes he is very nice and says all I need is a bit of self confidence. I spoke to my former boss, who vouches for me, and he said I am underutilized. I said I feel like XXX's assistant, which I am not and he agreed that I am also not paid to be XXX's assistant.

In addition to this, we have one employee who also reports to the CEO and works very close to our small sales team who decided to make my life hell. She undermines me, indirectly says my work is not good and that I make mistakes, that my communication is bad, etc etc. All very subtle. She has gone out of her way for at least 3 times to talk to the CEO about our pet peeves. I am not a bully and have always been nice to her. Her actions and words make it clear she thinks I am not suitable for the job. 

I can't help but wonder if I am just terrible at what I do. My former boss(es) gave me good reviews. There is one big problem with me which is I SUCK at company politics and I think this is what is happening here (again). 

Today, after meeting with my new line manager and our CEO, line manager says he is working on project Z, which is very time consuming, he doesnt have the time, etc. I actually would like to take on the project because it is my area of expertise, but he never spoke to me about it. He went straight to the CEO and said we could benefit from a short term intern for this project. The CEO loved the idea immediatelly. I know line manager has his godson lined up for this job, he told me. 

I am usually not paranoid folks, but I cant shake the feeling there is a plot to get me out of my job and replace me. I don't think i will be directly fired, but i feel I am being managed out. Am I seeing things? I can't help but to feel a failure and guilty that maybe my performance is horrible and my former bosses were just nice guys to give me good reviews. I don't know what to think of this whole situation! 

What do you guys think it is going on here? 

many thanks"
nbomcd,1,2021-05-13,Another PM vs. SWE Post,metamaniac551,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nbomcd/another_pm_vs_swe_post/,"I know this question/topic has been brought up multiple times on this sub, but I wanted to ask it again in the context of my personal experience. I'm currently going into my senior year at a top 10 university (top 10 overall, not necessarily for CS), and I'm studying CS and EE. After a few business/consulting-focused internships, I'm looking to go into tech as I feel it would be a waste not to apply my technical background, and I really am interested in the industry. I have some solid programming skills and projects (mostly from CS classes I've taken), so I think I would fair well as a SWE if I work hard enough, but I don't ever see myself being the ""best"" SWE, or even among the top 5-10% of developers. Thus, I am already planning on going into SWE for a few years, then transitioning into something else, like PM. 

I also know that PM roles are extremely hard to come by, and the best time to snag one would be right after graduation. I think I would enjoy a PM role and my skill set is more aligned for PM, but I am concerned about getting into a leadership-type role in tech straight out of college. Again, I will have a CS degree from a great school and have some decent programming experience, but I'm certainly not the best programmer around or someone who codes for fun in their free time. Thus, it seems like I would be out of place starting off as a PM right away and being tasked with leading a team of engineers who are much more skilled than me. 

I feel like if I start out in SWE and gain some legitimate technical experience, then I would be a far more effective leader and PM, but on the flip side, getting a role in PM after working in SWE is harder than getting one right out of college. Am I misconstruing what a PM really does or overestimating the technical ability required? I've always felt that my leadership style is most effective when I am as knowledgeable about a task as the people I am working with, but perhaps that is not how I should be looking at PM roles. If anyone has any advice on the decision between going into PM right after college vs transitioning into it after a few years of development experience, I would love to hear your thoughts. It's all really just a big bag of imposter syndrome, but I wouldn't want to start out in a career that I'm not yet suited for."
nbonvz,4,2021-05-13,Advice Needed- How to respectfully withdraw from Research Project/Internship,tallguyfromstats,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/nbonvz/advice_needed_how_to_respectfully_withdraw_from/,"Hi! 


I am in a situation where I have recived two Internship offers , one in Academia where I'll work with professor on a Research Project and one at big corporate giant.

I have decided to take the offer at Corporate Giant and waiting to receive their final offer letter. The problem is that I already had a verbal agreement with the professor to start the Internship yesterday ( He hasn't contacted yet) and I don't know how to inform him that I won't be able to work with him on the project.

The last conversation with the professor happened a month ago where i informed him that I'll start in May after my exams get over. He had specially mentioned to me to take time (2-3 days after receiving offer) and decide about the offer as he may not be able to get another intern if I back out after starting the project. 

Honestly, I was looking forward to start working with the professor but all out of a sudden I recieved the call from the corporate giant 2-3 days ago and they wanted me to join as an Intern on a project. I had earlier interviewed in March for another position at this corporate giant. I missed out very narrowly but recieved a great feedback. I believe I was referred for the current position and they decided to take me.

What I feel is that it is unethical what I am doing but it's not as if I went out of my way to interview for other positions after accepting the offer from the professor. 
The internship offer at Corporate Giant is really good and I don't want to miss out on it as the project here also is research focused.

What's the best way to inform the professor that I'll have to back out from his research project? 



PS - There's another intern with me on that research project.
And the professor is very young."
nbp9tb,0,2021-05-13,MBA from Tech,metamaniac551,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/nbp9tb/mba_from_tech/,"I'm currently a rising senior at a top 10 undergrad pursuing a CS &amp; EE degree, and I'm deciding on going into tech (SWE or PM) or consulting full time. I have a few consulting/business-focused internships under my belt, but I'm leaning towards going into SWE as I want to continue gaining some more technical/programming experience. 

I'm aware that there exists a sort of pay ceiling in the tech industry after about 5 years, and that it is very hard to progress past that ceiling within most companies. If I ever reach this point, one option would be to pursue an MBA and jump to a more managerial position. Is SWE generally regarded as less attractive by adcoms than something like consulting? Are there certain tech companies (i.e only FAANG) that would give me a far greater chance of admission to top schools over other companies? 

I'm not even sure if I would end up getting an MBA at that point (or if I would even need to), but I want to set myself up for success in the event that I do. If there is anyone who has gone down the tech route, reached that comp ceiling, then jumped to an MBA, I would love to hear your insight. Or, if anyone has any advice at all, that would be greatly appreciated."

So HR called me asking me if I wanted to apply for a internship they have open. (I was in their database already because of a program I did with them). I did and she scheduled me a meeting with the team the next day. At this company the application process is pretty extensive with a bunch of exams and aptitude tests so I was surprised to get an interview/meeting that fast.

So fast forward, I thought I did good in the interview maybe they did too. Felt like a conversation and it was a pretty soft convo.

The senior manager told me I will hear back from Bill from HR(not actually their name and they invited me to apply) and how nice he is. 

I'm actually really excited, but I'm afraid I'm setting myself up for disappointment and I hate being ghosted.

I am trying to find the best way to spend my time to get a job. I was thinking spend an hour a day applying to the lowest positions I can find on LinkedIn. Then 2-3 hours before work working on python projects and grinding coding interview problems. 

Is this a good way to get things moving. 

What projects would you guys be working on?

Should I focus more on just the native Python stuff or should I focus more on web development (Django) because there are more jobs for that?

Am I gonna have a hard time finding a job in the next year? I applied for hundreds on internships my senior year and didn’t even get an interview.

right now i’m computer science. why? because it pays well. I would most likely hate my life if I was a software engineer but growing up in an impoverished community, I feel like this degree would great to fall back on. but my real love is music. I have a small music career and i would love to study music business in college and have the opportunity to intern at record labels, etc. 
but if another pandemic were to happen, would a music help me get through? probably not. and even when I read about record labels ceo’s, etc, they all went to school for business, economics (which I also love) etc.

I spent high school at a prestigious school hating it. when I could’ve went to an art school and loved it. i’m afraid I could do that again. I really want to enjoy school and enjoy what I do everyday. but I also want to be able to have something to fall back on.

Demographics: East Asian female, competitive high school in northern VA (sends 30+ kids to T20s every year from class size of 500), upper class, hooks are prob won’t apply for aid (heard this helps for OOS UC’s), maybe woman in STEM, and Duke sibling legacy

Intended major(s): Computer science for most schools including Cornell, ECE/applied math for some 

ACT/SAT/SAT II: 1590 (790 EBRW, 800 M) second sitting, 1560 (780 both sections) first sitting

UW/W GPA and Rank: 3.93/4.0 UW, 4.47/5.0 W, slight upward trend here (B+ in 7th grade geometry lol, few A- freshman and sophomore years, all As junior year), school doesn’t rank but borderline top 5% I’d say 

Coursework: all honors/AP, APCSA(5) &amp; APWH(5) sophomore year, currently taking AP Psych, BC Calc, AP Stats, AP Physics 1, AP Lang, expecting 4s and 5s

Senior year coursework: Multivar/matrix alg, AP Lit, AP Gov, AP Physics C, AP Macro/Micro either going to take APCSP or CS course at local university 

Awards (definitely weakest part): 

* 1510 PSAT, likely national merit finalist
* AP scholar with distinction
* NHS, science national honors society, mu alpha theta
* Not much other than that, hoping to do science fair in the fall or win some minor research award this summer

Extracurriculars:

* Paid data science internship at the National Institutes of Health, 40 hrs/week for three months
* Geoinformatics research internship at local university this summer, might get co-authorship but idk, 35 hrs/week for two months but may be extended into school year
* Internship at a startup writing code for their app, 15-20hrs/week for two semesters
* Kode with Klossy mobile app development track this summer, not prestigious or anything but hoping to make something cool 
* Application-only summer volunteer program at children’s hospital, did 100+ hours over an 8-week period
* Volunteered with my dog in nursing homes before covid, did about 100 hours total
* Involved in CS-related clubs (girls who code, cyberpatriot, tsa, etc.), probably going to get a VP/officer position next yr 
* Leadership program at my school, basically just meet with a group of freshmen once a month and bring them snacks
* Track and xc before covid, will probably go back senior year
* Have worked part time at a boba place since 2019, probably doesn’t count for much but I plan to keep this job through high school so maybe shows commitment or something 

Essays/LORs/Other:

* Pretty solid writer, 8/10 essays 
* Planning to get LORs from current calc (8/10) and lang (7/10) teachers, not super talkative in class but I work hard and they like me
* My counselor is meh so 6/10 for his LOR

Schools

* ED1: Cornell (College of Engineering), also considering NU McCormick so please lmk where you think I have a better chance. My high school has had about 40 Cornell applications and 10 acceptances each of the past two years, while 20-25 apply to NU every year with 2-4 acceptances. Not sure how many of these are RD vs ED
* ED2: UChicago

And if so what are good hands on certs that are suited for more entree level.

I am currently enrolled for a A.S for IT | Cyber Security, and I really want to take a cert this summer. The only problem is I dont really know whats worth it. I am heavily considering Security +, I have a book about it and have been reading off and on. I also know this would be a good cert for a internship or just a entree job, since its recognized and somewhat respected.

I just really find it hard to pick between the Sec + and a more hands on cert. I like really like try hack me, its just hard for me to stay motivated because you get no reconsideration for the boxes you do. I understand I can talk about it on my CV but I know a good hands on cert like OSCP is infinitely better.

Dont get me wrong I know im not ready for the OSCP yet, but I am looking for something that is a little more hands on than the Sec +. Just not as hard as the OSCP lol.

Ps. I am 2 years in my degree I graduate next summer and still have to do a internship in my fall 2021 semester. I have has classes based on A+, Net +, My SQL, Visual Basic and a class on Windows Server 2019 / Active Directory. I have had more classes but there are like gen ed's or just weird Windows classes that I can barely remember."

I wanted to ask reddit for their opinion since I asked my brother and dad and their opinions conflicted.

If relevant, courses of interest would be something in the social sciences or business field, like History, Global development studies, International relations, or something of the sort.

nbxhzc,291,2021-05-13,I connected to the Dark Web from a deserted island. Now I have to play the game or die.,WendigoRoar,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/nbxhzc/i_connected_to_the_dark_web_from_a_deserted/,"The island was so quiet. I could hear the wind blowing through the leaves of the trees that covered the land and the sound of the tide rolling over the small beach, but there were no animal sounds. No human sounds. Just auditory emptiness. Every step I took sounded like a thunderous crunch, disrupting the quiet. It reminded me of being at a funeral; there’s no rule against functioning at regular volume, but there’s this presence in the air that seems to mute sounds, leaving you with the feeling of being inappropriate if you speak above a whisper.

When Daphne had told me she wanted us all to go check out a deserted island just off the coast, I had some mixed feelings. On the one hand, partying on an island sounded like a lot of fun. On the other, probably a great place to get tetanus. So I was hesitant. Daphne had anticipated that, which was why she made sure to tell me, over and over, that Ted would also be coming. So of course I said yes, like the young, dumb, and in love person that I am.

Ted rode in front of me on the boat to the island and I couldn’t help sneaking glances at his rugged profile catching the sun on the horizon, a halo of sea spray making him seem to glow. We’d picked him up from his internship at Douglas Motors and on the way over, he’d changed out of the mechanic’s uniform with the “Monica” name badge he hated so much and into a surf shorts and a polo that screamed “I’m a bro.” I’d have detested that in anyone else, but on him, I’d have found a paper bag fedora attractive. I was so smitten it hurt.

Leo and George rode in the front of the boat, because of course they were sitting together. I try not to take my single lady angst out on everyone, but they were still giggly and always holding hands and they’d just had their one-year anniversary. It really feels inappropriate for them to be so happy in their relationship while I’m still sleeping alone. I mean, seriously. But obviously my jealousy is only on the surface. George has been in our friend group since middle school, and he’s never been happier than since he’s been with Leo. We’ve all met Leo a number of times, but this is our first big trip with him. I think he’s nervous, but he hides it under his academic attitude and posture.

Ted was sitting next to Daphne, who was the one who started this whole adventure. Daphne is working on her engineering degree and is super serious 90% of the time. Her lighter side comes out when it comes to going on crazy adventures. Exploring an abandoned island is so much up her alley. And I have to admit, we’ve been on some really cool trips that I wouldn’t have gone on if she hadn’t pushed me out of my comfort zone. She was a born leader and took the reins of our group without hesitation or disagreement. She was our benevolent ruler.

I was sitting next to Syl. Syl and I are roommates. While I’m at school or internships all day, she works from home during the day and takes care of our puppy, Thadeus. Weird name for a dog, I know. Syl works at the local strip club Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights, and manages her OnlyFans page the rest of the time. I didn’t know indie porn was an industry before I met Syl, but she has a great head for business and is more financially stable than I am. More than I ever will be, with the student loan debt I’m carrying. I love makeup, but this time at school for makeup artistry is really going to need to pay off well in the future if I’m going to survive when the student loan people come knocking.

The boat ride was pretty short, about half an hour on an old speedboat we had rented for the day. Daphne kept looking at me and nodding in Ted’s direction, desperate for me to finally make a move, but it was hard to do too much chatting over the engine noise. It wouldn’t land quite the same if I screamed “I LIKE YOU, TED” with an undertone of diesel engine. I was biding my time and totally not stalling at all.

There was a small dock on the island, but it looked half-rotted away. We tied the boat to it before very gingerly climbing onto the dock and walking over to the island, one at a time. I slipped clambering onto the dock, and Ted caught me by the arm. We paused for a second like that, looking at each other, and it made the whole trip worthwhile.

“Um..you gonna get over to the island so I can get out of this boat?” he asked.

“Oh, shit, yeah, going,” I said, all in one breath.

I scrambled down the dock and onto the island.

Besides being crazy quiet, the island was an awesome picnic spot. It was so peaceful, far enough from the bustle of the bigger cities that you couldn’t hear all the boat traffic, and the weather was fantastic, a gentle breeze making the warm sun pleasant rather than overbearing. With time, we got over trying to whisper to each other, and shortly after that we were laughing and caterwauling like usual. Leo brought some wine, which I’m sure helped. It was fancy wine left over from a showing at the art gallery he interns at, but none of us were wine connoisseurs. We just liked the buzz.

After some food, some wine, and a fair bit of flirting, we started wandering around the island. I was hoping to get Ted alone somewhere so we could talk, but it seemed like right as we were about to, someone would come tramping through. It wasn’t that big of an island, I suppose.

After a few hours of tramping about, we decided to head back to the boat. On the way over, though, Daphne stumbled and yelped.

“Damn, I smacked my toes on that bush,” she said. She was grimacing and holding her foot.

“Are you ok?” Leo asked.

Instead of answering, Daphne’s eyes got larger. She shuffled over to the bush and started moving branches of it out of the way.

“What’s up?” I asked her.

“I saw some metal under the bush. I think that might be what I stubbed my toe on.”

My mind went back to my tetanus concerns from when Daphne had first suggested the island trip. But Daphne dug under the bush and I saw the metal she was talking about.

George went over to help Daphne clear away the dirt that was covering the metal, and it was a surprisingly thin layer. It seemed like this metal had been covered relatively recently. Perhaps the wind had been slowly blowing dirt over it. The pair kept brushing away dirt and exposing more metal. Ted joined in the removal. As the three worked, a large metal rectangle began to appear.

It was George who found the handle.

“What the hell…” he mumbled. From my perspective, I could see it better than the three who were on top of the metal and removing dirt.

“It’s a door,” I said.

“Holy shit,” Daphne said.

“This is bizarre,” Syl said, nodding.

“George, Ted, move off the door. We have to check this out,” Daphne said, excited. The pair moved off the door, but there were a number of incredulous looks going around the group.

I decided to be the voice of reason.

“Look, Daph, this is super weird and everything, and I know that’s totally up your alley, but this seems sketchy at best. There could be all sorts of venomous spiders and snakes and stuff in there, not to mention the risk of cutting yourself on rusted metal. Or falling through a weak floor and breaking a leg. This seems like a really bad idea.”

“Please,” Daphne said, “let’s just open the door. We don’t have to go in, but let’s at least see what’s inside.”

No one said anything.

“Come on, just one peek. That’s all.”

Everyone looked at each other before Syl finally stepped up.

“Alright, wild girl, I’ll help you open this door, we take one look inside, then we head back on the boat.”

Daphne smiled and nodded. Together, the two of them grabbed the handle and began to pull. It was heavy. George ran in and put his hands under it, pushing while they pulled. Finally, once the door had passed the ninety-degree mark, Daphne and Syl jumped out of the way and with a final shove from George, the door swung over and slammed onto the ground. Dirt flew up into the air and the metal in the door reverberated, disorienting everyone for a moment.

When the air cleared, Daphne was the first one over to the open entryway in the ground. She pulled out her cell phone, turned on its flashlight, and directed it inside.

It was...anticlimactic.

The cell phone illuminated a set of stone steps that led down, but whatever was at their base was beyond the range of the light.

“Huh,” Daphne said.

It pretty much summed it up.

“Look,” she added, “I know we said we wouldn’t go in, but only seeing stairs is so unsatisfying. Look at them. They’re made of stone or concrete or something, so it’s not like they’re rusted out and going to break off. Let’s creep down a bit and look. Seriously, how can we just stop when all we see are stairs?”

“I kinda get what she’s saying,” said Syl. “That door was heavy as shit, I want more of a reward than this. Now I’m curious, too.”

I hated to admit it, but I agreed with them. I nodded my head, and Daphne grinned. Perhaps it was their enthusiasm rubbing off on me, or maybe it was just natural curiosity, but I was riddled with a need to know what lay at the bottom of the stairs.

“Screw it, let’s go,” said George. Leo nodded, although it wasn’t enthusiastic, and Ted grunted his assent.

“But we be careful. Everyone has lights on, don’t touch any bugs or snakes, and definitely no metal. If anyone sees live wires, we get out immediately. Okay?”

Everyone nodded.

“Thanks for staying level-headed,” Daphne said with real gratitude. “Now, let’s go exploring!”

The stairs went down what felt like about ten or fifteen feet before reaching a landing, then turned and went down in the opposite direction. It was like a set of stairs from an office or an apartment building had been sunk down underground. Moving past the first landing felt a bit scary, as we couldn’t see the door anymore after that, but with the whole group together and all of our flashlights on our cell phones turned on, it wasn’t terribly dark. We went down three flights of stairs before we reached a larger landing. We walked out into it and, as our lights moved through the room, we were able to see the outlines of a large room. There were computer consoles and screens on one side of the room, with a door on the right side wall. The left side wall had stacks of boxes alongside it.

We walked into the room, splitting up a bit as we explored different parts of the room. Ted had gone towards the computer consoles and I tagged along with him. The computer towers had a thin layer of dust on them and when I blew on them, a cloud puffed up into the air. I waved my hand in the air to try to disperse it.

Ted was wiping dust away from the fan vents and pressing buttons on the front of one of the towers. With a low whir, the light on the front came on and one of the screens came on.

“Hey, whatcha got running over there?” George asked. He and Leo came walking over. “The boxes are just a bunch of supplies. Tools, PVC, zip ties, that sort of thing. Pretty boring.”

Using the hem of his shirt, Ted wiped the dust from the screen. A logo I wasn’t familiar with popped up on the screen, followed by the boot up menu. It wasn’t the usual desktop layout I was used to, but a command screen.

Daphne and Syl came over to see what was going on.

“The door over there was locked. There isn’t a handle or anything, but there’s a keypad. Doesn’t seem to be active. Whatcha got there, Ted?” Syl said.

“Thought I’d explore a little on here, see if we can learn anything before we take off. I guess the curiosity got to me, too,” he said with a laugh.

The command screen was pretty basic, black background with grayish-white text. All it said was, “Enter command prompt.”

Ted stared at it for a minute, then typed in “Run.”

A string of text ran down the screen faster than the human eye could follow. Tons of subcommands and file destinations flew by. As the process continued, the lights in the room kicked on. A fan in the corner of the room started to slowly oscillate, and the other screens flickered on, showing camera images of empty gray concrete rooms.

A creaking sound came from the stairwell, and everyone turned around to look at it.

“What’s that?” asked Leo.

There came a massive metallic thud.

“Was that the door?” Syl yelled.

“Stay here, I’ll go check,” Geore said, running off.

“Not without me,” Leo added, already following him.

The pair took off up the stairs. I was looking around the room again, taking in all the details now that they had been fully illuminated, when I noticed a single string of words had appeared on the screen. I nudged Ted, who was still standing next to me, and pointed to the words.

“Welcome to the Compound. The challenges are being prepared. The door will open when it is time for you to begin.”

“What does that even mean?” asked Ted.

We showed Daphne and Syl, but before we could begin talking it out, George and Leo came back, panting from their run up and down the stairs.

“The door is locked,” Leo said through hard breaths.

“Felt like it was bolted in place,” said George.

We showed them the message.

“What challenges?” asked Daphne.

“Can you type in questions and ask?” asked Syl.

Rather than answer, Ted started typing.

“What challenges?” he typed.

More words began to run across the screen.

“You will find out soon. They are designed to test you mentally, emotionally, and socially. If you fail, you will not leave the Compound. If you succeed, you can continue on your journey. All contests will be recorded for eventual distribution. Videos may be edited for length.”

“I don’t even know what to ask about next, this is all so messed up,” Leo said.

“What if we don’t participate in the challenges?” Syl asked.

Ted typed the question in.

“Then you will be taken to our termination facilities. Your body will be processed to see if your meat serves further purposes.”

“Dark,” I said nervously, trying to counter my own anxiety with some understated humor. It didn’t work.

More words appeared on the screen.

“The challenges are ready. The door will open momentarily. Go through the door to reach the first of two challenges. Stay here and you will be transported to the termination facilities.”

With the grumble of stone sliding against stone, the door on the right wall slid into a recess in the wall. The room beyond was dark at first, but overhead lights crackled on a quiet hum.

“I guess…” I began, before hesitating.

“We gotta give it a go,” Syl said. “I don’t want to find out what these termination facilities are.” She took a deep breath, then walked through the doorway.

“Damn it,” Daphne muttered. She followed Syl into the next room.

The rest of the group started to walk through. I brought up the rear, with Ted right in front of me.

“Hey, Ted,” I said.

He looked back at me and smiled for me to continue.

“Look, this is super sketchy, and maybe before we step into whatever insanity this is isn’t the best time to say it, but I want to tell you just in case this goes totally awful--”

Ted stopped walking and turned around.

“I know, Beth. You’ve been shyly flirting with me all day, it wasn’t subtle,” he said, laughing. “Can I kiss you?”

“I...wait...for real?” I have a real smoothness with words.

“Is that a yes?”

“Well, yeah, of course,” I said.

Ted leaned over and kissed me. It was gentle and soft, but not short. When he pulled away, I felt my cheeks flush.

“After we get through this, let’s plan our first date,” Ted said, grinning.

All I could do was nod.

Ted reached over, gave my hand an encouraging squeeze, and then headed through the door. I followed.

Right after I entered the room, the door grated shut behind me.

Inside the room, there were six seats set in front of six monitors. The only available one was on the far left, next to Daphne. Everyone else was already sitting, except Ted, who was headed to the seat between Leo and Syl. I sat down, and Daphne leaned over to me.

“I’m so scared I think I might pee my pants if something startles me, but that doesn’t mean I missed what just happened.” She gave me a high five. I laughed.

The lights dimmed and the monitors turned on.

Across each one ran the same words.

“Welcome to the first challenge. There will be two challenges. Make it through both to leave the Compound. All challenges must be completed through typing, as the microphone system is down. This first challenge is called ‘Truth or Dare.’ You must select either ‘Truth’ or ‘Dare’ on your screen by typing in the word. If you select ‘Truth,’ you will be asked a question. If our scan of all of your records determines you are lying, you will be sent to the termination facilities. If you select ‘Dare,’ you will be given a task. Fail to complete the task and you will be sent to the termination facilities. You will go in order from left to right, and all screens will show all text. You will not be allowed to type when it isn’t your turn. If we see you speaking aloud on camera, you will be sent to the termination facilities. The challenge begins in thirty seconds.”

We all looked at each other. No one wanted to say anything because of the threat of the termination facilities, but I could hear George whimpering down the line. I reached my hand out to Daphne, and she took it. We both squeezed, desperate for reassurance.

The long block of text shifted up, and new rods appeared.

“Contest One: Truth or Dare?”

The prompt had said left to right, and I was stuck in the far left chair. I was Contestant One.

I let go of Daphne and, with shaking hands and jitter fingers, typed in, “Truth.”

“What do you feel guiltiest about?”

I didn’t have to think. The memories came flooding back. The words of kindness, the soft touches, feeling terrified, the pain, the threats. How he shoved a sock in my mouth so if I screamed no one would hear me.

“Not reporting my dad for what he did to me,” I typed.

“Why is this what you feel guiltiest about?”

I took a deep breath before typing again.

“Because, when I got too old for him, he started hurting me sister, instead.”

I could feel the tightness in my throat as a sob broke out of me. My dad had just been convicted and sentenced last year. It was still so raw.

Tears ran down my face. I had to blink them away to make the new words that appeared on the screen less blurry.

“Contest One has passed this challenge.”

I looked over at the rest of the group. There were smiles, but also sad eyes full of sympathy. Only some of them knew.

“Contestant Two: Truth or Dare?”

It was Daphne’s turn.

She typed, and on my screen I saw the word “Dare” appear.

“Slap Contestant Six in the face as hard as you can.”

Left to right, we were arranged in this order: Me, Daphne, George, Leo, Ted, and Syl. So, Syl was Contestant Six. Daphne needed to go slap her.

Daphne froze in her chair. I looked over at her, only to see her staring at the screen and softly shaking her head. I nudged her, and she looked up at me. She didn’t have a choice, she needed to go do it.

On shaky legs, Daphne stood up. She walked down the line to where Syl was sitting and looked her in the eyes. Syl nodded and took a deep breath. Tears running down her face, Daphne put her hand back and then slapped Syl. The smack of flesh on flesh cracked like a whip, and Syl almost fell out of her chair. She kept her head hung down, and a dribble of blood dripped a few times onto the floor.

Daphne didn’t move, just stared at Syl. Slowly, Syl righted herself and sat back up. There was a red handprint on her face and her lip was split, still oozing blood. Her eyes were full of tears.

Daphne broke. It seemed like she couldn’t stop herself.

“Oh, Syl, I’m so sorry,” she wailed, hugging her. I could hear Ted and Leo shushing her, but it was too late. Hopefully whoever was watching this had missed the slip-up. Daphne squeezed Syl one last time, then went back to her chair.

New words streamed onto the screen.

“Contestant Two has completed this challenge.”

I breathed a sigh of relief, until more words appeared.

“Contestant Two has violated the no speaking rules and will be sent to the termination facilities.”

I looked over at Daphne and she looked back at me, terrified. There was a strained silence. I started to reach over to her.

There was a roar like a giant vacuum. Suddenly, Daphne was gone. A hole had opened up beneath her chair and a great jet of air sucked Daphne and her chair straight down into it. I heard her scream piercing the roar of rushing air until it was cut off by a panel sliding in place over the hole.

George, seated on the other side of Daphne, screamed, “Daphne,” and jumped as if he was trying catch her before she was sucked down, but it was far too late. He landed with a thump on the covered hole.

The cover quickly opened again, and with a roar, George was sucked into the hole, as well. I saw Leo jump up, but Ted tackled him and wrapped both hands over his mouth, holding in his screams. The cover of the hole slid shut again.

Leo stopped struggling and patted Ted’s arm. He let go and they both went back to their seats. I was in shock. Two of my friends had just been ripped away from me in a matter of seconds.

I saw movement out of the corner of my eye and turned to look. It was more words on the screen.

“Contestant Three has violated the no speaking rules and will be sent to the termination facilities.”

I could hear Leo moan, but he didn’t say anything.

“Contestant Four: Truth or Dare?”

Contestant Three had been George, who wasn’t here to participate. Contestant Four was Leo. How was Leo going to get through this without breaking down, with his boyfriend taken away like that?

I saw him sob as he reached out to type.

“Truth.”

“How many times did you cheat on your boyfriend?”

Leo gasped, and began sobbing. He cried and cried, while Ted did his best to calm him down. Finally, Leo reached out his hands and typed.

“Once.”

“Why?”

“I was scared. George is the first man I’ve dated. I came out to my family and my friends. They told me I was living in a sinful life. My spirituality has always meant so much to me, and here were the people who helped support me in my beliefs telling me I was going to Hell for being with a man. I was so terrified, because I couldn’t win. I came out after I’d been with George for six months. I knew I loved him. I was horrified to live a life without him. But I was also terrified of Hell. So when one of my friends kept pushing at me one night, telling me if I just had sex with a woman who knew how to give a man the night of his life I’d realize what I was missing, I did it. I had sex with her. I was almost hoping she was right, that we’d fuck and I’d realize I loved women and I wouldn’t go to Hell. But I cried the entire time we were together. I hated it. It felt so wrong. I never told George. I didn’t want him to hate me.”

“Contestant Four has completed this challenge.”

Leo kept sobbing.

“Contestant Five: Truth or Dare?”

Ted nodded to himself, then started typing.

“Dare.”

“Break Contestant Four’s finger.”

I watched Ted’s face. His eyes were huge. He slowly turned and looked at Leo. I could see Ted shaking his head. Leo took a deep breath and nodded, holding out his hand. Ted stretched his hands out and took one of Leo’s fingers in them. Ted was taking a bunch of deep breaths, trying to hype himself up, but then he shook his head again and let go. He just shook his head at Leo.

Without hesitation, Leo reached out, grabbed Ted’s hand, and wrapped it around his pinky finger. Holding it in place tightly, Leo wrenched his hand sideways. There was a snapping sound, like a stick breaking under foot, and Leo screamed through clamped lips.

Ted looked horrified. I wanted to speak soothing words, but all I could do was go over and give them both a hug. Syl did the same. We stayed this way until I noticed more words on the screen.

“Contestant Five has completed this challenge.”

We all made our way back to our seats, knowing what was coming next.

“Contestant Six: Truth or Dare?”

“Truth,” Syl typed.

“What’s the most traumatizing thing that has ever happened to you?”

Syl shook her head, but immediately started typing.

“The last guy I went on a few dates with apparently started dating me because he thought, since I was a stripper, I must be easy. But that’s bullshit. He tried to rape me.”

“Tell us more details.”

Syl growled. I get it, who wants to share their trauma with strangers.

“We were in his car making out. He started trying to pull my clothes off, but I shut that down. I don’t need a public indecency ticket, so no car sex. But he didn’t care. When I kept pushing him away, he punched me in the head. I was dazed, and he started tearing my clothes off. Literally tore them. Having a thong ripped straight up until it tears is an exceptionally painful experience. I had bleeding tears in my ass from the friction burn. But before he could do anything, I was able to dig my mace out of my purse. Blasted that asshole in the eyes, and when he screamed, I shot the rest straight into his mouth. He had to go to the hospital, his throat closed up and he almost died. He deserved it. Being a sex worker doesn’t mean it’s ok to rape me. So fuck him.”

I was shocked. I hadn’t heard about this before. I knew Syl had dealt with some scum in the past, but this was awful. I got up and gave her a hug. While I was hugging her, I saw words appear on her screen.

“Contestant Six has completed this challenge.”

Syl and I kept looking at her screen, and Ted and Leo huddled around us, watching as well. More instructions were coming.

“Please move to the next room. The door will open momentarily.”

The lights came back up and a door tucked in the corner where I hadn’t seen it slid open. The four of us stood up and walked over. Ted grabbed my hand on the way, and I held on desperately.

The next room had four raised platforms, each sitting on thick cylinders with a set of stairs taking you onto them. On each was a screen and a keyboard. Assuming it was a similar system to the last room, each of us stepped up onto a different platform. Once I got up there, I had a bit of vertigo. I’m not a huge fan of height, and the platforms were about six feet above the rest of the floor. I closed my eyes for a second and grabbed onto the keyboard for balance.

Deep breaths.

I opened my eyes again and looked at the other platforms. Everyone had taken their position. I looked down at my screen.

“Welcome to the second challenge. This is the final challenge. Make it through to leave the Compound. All challenges must be completed through typing, as the microphone system is down. This second challenge is called ‘Election.’ You will be given one sentence of information about each of you. After reading all four sentences, you must vote which person should be sent to the termination facilities. The person with the most votes will be sent to the termination facilities. Failure to vote will result in being sent to the termination facilities. If we see you speaking aloud on camera, you will be sent to the termination facilities. The challenge begins in thirty seconds.”

I looked up at each of my friends on the pedestals. Leo, who I was still getting to know, but who made George, poor George, so happy. Ted, who I could see myself having a future with. Syl, who had been my friend for over a decade and who inspired me by her willingness to not be afraid or ashamed of who she was or what she did.

How could I do this?

But it was too late. The sentences were appearing on my screen.

“Someone A stole $100 from a friend. Someone B kissed their best friend’s dad. Someone C cheated on a final exam and let someone else get expelled for it. Someone D left someone bleeding in an alley. You have fifteen seconds to vote.”

I glanced up in shock. Fifteen seconds. These were my friends.

I knew I was someone B. It was an awkward thing where I wasn’t paying attention, thought I was standing next to my then-boyfriend, and kissed him, only to realize it was my boyfriend’s dad. Who was also his sister’s dad, obviously, and his sister was my best friend at the time.

Were all the rest of these like that, too? Misunderstandings? I didn’t have time to debate. At least eight seconds had to have passed. I scanned the sentences again. Bleeding in alley seemed worst. I typed in D.

A few seconds later, there was a ding. More words appeared on the screen.

“Voting is now closed. Someone C did not vote and will be sent to the termination facilities.”

There was the roar of air again. I looked up at my friends just in time to see the platform below Syl open up. She was sucked down and the platform closed again. She hadn’t even screamed.

Syl hadn’t voted. Now I felt like a coward, voting for one of my friends to die.

More text on the screen.

“Someone D received the most votes. Someone D will be sent to the termination facilities.”

“No, no, please! It wasn’t like that,” Leo screamed.

He tried to run off his platform, but before he could, it opened up and sucked him down.

It was just me and Ted.

I started to leave my platform, but I saw Ted shaking his head and pointing at the screen. I looked over at it.

“One final round of ‘Election.’ Someone A stole $100 from a friend. Someone B kissed their best friend’s dad. You have fifteen seconds to vote.”

I looked up at Ted. He smiled at me and nodded. Then he put his hands down to his sides.

Ted wasn’t going to vote. I wasn’t really surprised. He had always been so selfless.

But I was scared.

I typed in, “Someone A.”

I didn’t look up. I knew I wouldn’t be able to bear the hurt on Ted’s face.

There was a ding.

“Voting is now closed. Someone A received the most votes. Someone A will be sent to the termination facilities.”

I couldn’t help it. I looked up. Ted was crying. He looked at me and waved. And then he was sucked down and disappeared from my sight.

I started sobbing, but through my tears I could see more words on the screen.

“Congratulations. You have made it through the challenges. You are welcome to leave. Before you do, know that we have all of your information. If you tell anyone about what happened we will kill your entire family. A boat is waiting to take you to the mainland.”

Through the haze of tears and horror, I stumbled down from my platform and through a newly opened door. At the beach, there was a fancy-looking boat with an enclosed cabin. I got on and tried the cabin door, but it was locked. The boat started up, and took me back to shore.

A week later and I hadn’t left my apartment. Hadn’t gone to classes. Hadn’t gone to work. But I didn’t care. I was barely eating. I had no idea how I was going to get my life back together. As I sat on the couch for the third straight day, I heard my phone start vibrating. It happened periodically, but this time it didn’t stop. It just kept buzzing non-stop.

Finally, irritated, I grabbed it. I had a message from an unknown number. I opened it and gasped.

It was a picture of my friends. Leo, George, Syl, Daphne, and Ted, together in a dingy concrete room. There was text below it.

“Your friends are awaiting termination, but you can win their lives. It’s time for Round Two.”

nbzbg8,24,2021-05-13,9-5 is a big fat lie in Cybersecurity?,PhoenixOfStyx,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/nbzbg8/95_is_a_big_fat_lie_in_cybersecurity/,"So, I was recently accepted into a rather prestigious and very difficult internship with a very large Cybersecurity company. The hours are 8-5. Technically.

Except, we are also expected to be available at 7am; we are given excess homework to do off the clock which adds on an additional 45 hours a week. 

So this $15 an hour internship has suddenly become a literally below minumum wage internship. But hey, some don't even get paid. My issue isn't the money, it's the time. They say things like, ""You're gonna have to work outside of the 8-5....IF you want to succeed."" So it's technically *not* ""mandated"", but they basically mean, ""You have 90 hours of work to do, and we're only paying you for 40."" I mean that 90 hour literally, not hyperbolicaly.

Of course, it's not all about the money. It could bloom into a permanent position, as well, which is worth baseline $70,000 for an entry-level role.

The general theme I've seen in the company is the marketing/CSM'S/Regional sale's reps are very, ""YOU MUST HAVE PASSION AND BE IN THIS FOR MORE THAN MONEY!""

Meanwhile, the techs and CSEs seem to face more of a, ""Yeah bro, I'm just here to work on software, so I can provide a better life for my family, and I'm willing to work 8-12 hour days to do that, because the compensation is spectacular.""

Now. To my question. Is this the commonality of the Cybersecurity field? You never stop working? I am currently, as an intern, working 11-14 hour days, including Saturday and Sunday. 

As it stands, this company is literally my whole life. I do not want this, but I need to finish the program for valuable certs. And I will. I'm VERY grateful for the opportunity, but am also like, ""....I'd like to see my family.""

I don't know how people could even manage basic hygiene like this, let alone exercise, hobbies, or families. Or sleep.

Is the 40 hour workweek replaced by the 80-100 hour workweek? 

Do doctor-like restrictions need to come into place mandating a maximum of 60 hours a week?"

I just finished my second interview for my first ever software engineering internship. It's unpaid and will require about 30 hours a week of work on my part for the next 12 weeks if I accept the opportunity. It is a frontend role and the company uses Vue.

I really wanted a part-time internship that dealt with the backend (preferably with Rails or Node) but I would also take a front-end position (especially if it involved React/Redux). 

Although I lack professional experience, I have 3 projects showcasing my skills (React, Node, Rails) and went through a boot camp (got a certificate, not that this makes any difference).

It's also worth mentioning that I'm about to be a senior in college.

Am I expecting too much for my first ever development internship? 

If they do end up offering me the job, should I take it?

Thank God I will be leaving soon and starting an awesome paid internship with a respectable company. The only thing is, I have to finish this this current build by this weekend. I think I can do it, but I guess what I'd like to ask from the community is...

How do I leverage this experience? I'm a Software Engineer Intern on paper, but I'm really the only one that's working on the app, and the progress I have made is considerably more sophisticated than what they had from the start through another person (intern or not, I'm not sure). When I interview again for the internship seasons next year, should I be shy about telling interviewers that I had literally no support or guidance? I'm afraid that the experience will seem less valuable if I didn't learn much from an expert.

I'm happy to receive any words of advice as well. (Don't worry I will never again consider an unpaid internship, haha)"

I'm doing computer engineering, but I really want to get into web dev, so I've been doing courses on the side of uni. In the past I've worked on 2 hackathon projects (highschool) using Ionic and Angular, but my knowledge is pretty limited to the hackathon stuff(my main interest was C/C++ until like 8 months ago.  


Getting to the main point, I started learning and in the meantime sending out CVs to local companies for webdev internship positions. Now, I'm not a complete beginner, as I'm pretty comfortable with JS, and getting my way around HTML and CSS. After sending out 40 something applications, taking 12 technical tests, and participating in 5 interviews for 5 different companies, I finally landed a frontend internship position with React.   


Initially, I was so happy. Getting a paid position in my first year means a lot to me, as all my work seems to have paid off, but right now I'm dealing with a lot of anxiety. I don't know react. The interview from this company was mostly them asking about my hackathon projects and about box model and flex box stuff. Nothing that I consider part of a ""technical interview"". I feel like I don't deserve my place there, and as the date of the internship is approaching, me receiving my work laptop , I'm feeling more and more as an intruder. I knew the company beforehand, and their techstack and projects are so appealing to me, but I just can't help feeling like this.  


How can I make this feeling go away? Or, at the very least, how do I approach diminishing it?"

After completing an internship last Summer, I was given a job offer letter 7 months ago to which I signed. The job offer was for me to work full-time upon graduation (which I had already established with them would be May 2021). They told me in the months closer to graduation I would have more information about starting and they would continually reach out to me.

April 2021 came and I had not heard back anything from them or any updates. I began reaching out myself to HR and was told they are going through changes with their departments (promotions, retirements, etc) and still are finalizing where to put new hires. I then was told they'd be interviewing me for one department to see if I would fit there. More time goes by goes by, again no response, and I am now graduating with no idea on the status of this job. So I personally reach out again asking about any updates on the interview. Then they respond with a date, I do the interview that date, and am told I will be updated very soon with more information/decisions. 

I have graduated, done the interview, and still have not heard any updates. I sent a follow-up email asking the HR manager about the status once again and verifying if I am guaranteed a full-time position as I was under the impression of that when I signed a job offer letter. It's been a few days and I have received no response from that e-mail.

It has been 7 months since I signed the offer letter and it is not clear what is going on, and I feel as if constantly reaching out to them for updates is creating tension/pressure. I did not like for any jobs this year as I was under the impression I had a job lined up when I graduated. I have told my family/friends I would be working with them, even choosing to move to an area that would be closer to this job. My anxiety is a wreck now because I am fearing that they truly do not have a job ready for me.

 I'm not wishing to start any drama/tension with them, but is there not any contractual agreement from the job offer if this goes further south?"

Just want to make people aware of what's going in at Bytedance in China.

There is [this thread](https://bbs.pku.edu.cn/v2/post-read.php?bid=99&amp;threadid=17984461) that has been popping up a lot in Chinese programmer forums / groups. My Chinese is getting a bit rusty so I might have missed a few details, but this seems to be what happened: 

There's this intern from Peking University who worked Jan - Apr and told her leader that she wants to leave in April because they're busy with graduating. The leader said no because she didn't find a replacement for her position and told her to keep working. After May 1st, a junior of the leader's joined the team, so OP wrote a 10,000 character transitional document and asked to quit on May 11th again, but the leader said that OP still couldn't leave because the backup wasn't found by the OP. On top of that, the leader said to OP that their working skills are really bad and they have to find two backups (replacements) to fill the holes in her work and questioned OP why they couldn't find a replacement when everyone else could. 

OP's post then goes into detail about legality (no mention of needing to find a replacement before leaving), violence at the workplace (OP's roommate's leader told the roommate that ""leaving without finding a replacement is irresponsible"", and when OP brought this issue to HR, HR said that OP was arguing about semantics / denying that the leader had said such a thing), why they needed two backups (was she doing two people's work?), and double standards (a roommate of hers didn't need to find a backup to leave, so why would she need to?). 

Hope we can have a discussion about this here."

i graduated from biomedical engineering with a gpa of 3.2. my first few years of poly were hard on me - i was struggling with mental and physical health issues and it significantly affected my gpa. well at least i did something about it, got help and got myself back together again but by then, it was too late. i had been scoring &lt;3.0 for 3 whole semesters. i managed to pull my gpa back up in my final year though, with a 4.0 for my internship and a 3.6 for the 6th sem. nothing impressive but it was a massive feat for me. 

my gpa isn’t something i’m proud of especially since my a lot peers and classmates graduated with diplomas with merit. i think i was at a disadvantage and couldn’t perform my best; i was struggling with depression and was admitted to hospitals frequently, only to figure out i had a genetic disorder. i might have been able to do better if my circumstances were better but then again my gpa is my fault and my responsibility. nevertherless, i do want to try my best to secure a place in a local uni. 

i applied to sit’s diagnostic radiography and that’s where my interest and passion mainly lies. (also applied to ntu’s bioengineering but i knew that wasn’t possible anyway). unfortunately, no news from them. no interviews. nothing. 

at this point, i’ve considered that as a rejection as an interview now would be unlikely. 

i’m considering 4 options:

1) work for 1 year and reapply next year 
- im looking at jobs working with medical imaging equipment bc i heard that the more specific and relevant the work experience, the higher the chances of landing an interview

2) SAT exams/specialist diplomas
 - i do not know much about these, any info would be appreciated 

3) A-levels as a private candidate
- i think i’m in a better place mentally and physically to consider this option although i know it will be incredibly hard. ive looked through some of the syllabuses but im still unsure

4) a combination of 1&amp;2

my portfolio as of now: mediocre 

what would be the best option for me in your opinion. any advice would be appreciated!"

This isn't my first time doing an informational interview, but I'm nervous. Here are some questions I already have:

1. What do you enjoy most about your job?
2. How did your company deal with COVID?
3. What do you look for in new hires?
4. How do you personally maintain a work-life balance as a *job role* at *company name*?
5. What do you wish you knew before you started working?
6. How would you recommend I network for opportunities?
7. What does career progression look like at your company?
8. What makes a successful *job role*?

Slightly more personalised questions:

1. Are there any jobs that I may not know about at your company that you would recommend to me based on my interests (writing, programming)?
2. I've emailed your HR department but received no response on my speculative internship application. Is there any other way to get in touch for some sort of opportunity?

[https://bb.wd3.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/Student/job/Ottawa-Ontario/Software-Development-Student----Project-IVY---4-Month-Winter-Term\_20210792](https://bb.wd3.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/Student/job/Ottawa-Ontario/Software-Development-Student----Project-IVY---4-Month-Winter-Term_20210792)

But it's not listed on Linkedin, 'm wondering if I'm missing other listings from big companies"
ncjpgt,0,2021-05-14,Process of getting into Jane Street as a junior engineer,kool_guy_345,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ncjpgt/process_of_getting_into_jane_street_as_a_junior/,"Long time lurker here

My dream company to work for is Jane Street Capital in the New York office. I'm intrigued by the fact that they primarily use OCaml for the sake of code clarity and from what I know the culture seems pretty good. I do also know, however, that it's notoriously hard to get into. I'd like to know if anyone has any insight on how to maximize chances of getting in like what to put on my resume, what things to study and practice before the interview, etc.

A bit about me, I'm a math major with a CS minor with 3.7 GPA from an alright-to-decent school. My work experience consists of one data science internship where I didn't do much and I currently work at Amazon and approaching the 4 year mark so I want to switch to something else once I get all my stocks. I don't really have any side projects and wouldn't call myself a super good programmer, I am only particularly comfortable in Java and Python and don't know many software engineering tools other than tools internal to Amazon. To be honest I think I lucked out on my Amazon interview because my raw programming skill is kind of weak. However I am decently good at puzzles/riddles and so I think I can understand complicated algorithms conceptually but I would need to practice a lot to be able to code them out. I never did competitive programming or anything like that but I did well in advanced algorithms courses which were based on pseudo code and proofs and diagrams. Also, as a math major, I found big O to be pretty easy compared to the kinds of math I did in my program. I don't think I would have any trouble analyzing the run time of programs and finding places where there could be optimizations.

I'd be super interested in knowing what my chances of making it to the interview are and if anyone has any ideas for things I should practice or improve on to maximize my chance of getting in. I heard that Jane Street doesn't usually interview people who failed an interview with them before and so I'd like to get it right the first time. And while I went to a pretty good school I don't think it's a target school so that also hurts my chances, and I'm not sure what their GPA cutoff is or if there even is one. But I think my math background could be appealing to them. Any advice would be super appreciated, thanks!"

\-I am interested in bioinformatics/computational biology, and I was wondering if anyone had any ideas on places (biotech companies or other places) to look into for the future. I would be looking for an entry level position after I complete my B.S. in Computer Science, but I could potentially squeeze in a spring 2022 internship.

\-Also, I was wondering what kind of education makes for a successful bioinformatician/computational biologist. I am completing my B.S. in Computer Science. I was looking into going on for a masters focusing on machine learning; however, I feel like focusing on bioinformatics either as a masters or PhD would be something I am more interested in and may be more helpful in progressing in a bioinformatics/computational biology career. Obviously my interests could change, but I just wondered if a B.S. in CS would be sufficient for a bioinformatics/computation biology entry level job or if progressing for a masters or PhD would be better. 

I would appreciate any thoughts. Thank you!"

nclecn,1,2021-05-14,Torn between Sandia National Lab and Costco internship. Has anyone had experience as a DBA?,yeeeeeetkk,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/nclecn/torn_between_sandia_national_lab_and_costco/,"Throwaway because my main has my name on it

Long story short, I received a Software Engineering R&amp;D accepted offer from Sandia National Laboratories back in January and I recently interviewed with Costco and received an offer for Database administration internship, even after the interview, I'm still not exactly sure what a DBA actually does, would a be doing any development as a DBA? I'm really torn between these two.

Background: I'm in my senior year graduating in about 1 quarter. I want to go into a Software Development path in the future.

**Costco**

Pros:

\-Good benefit

\-Located in Seattle (Where I live, and to stay in)

\-Fortune 500

\-Good work life balance

Cons:

\-Heard Costco is not a great place for CS?

\-Not sure if database administrator is what I actually want?

**Sandia National Labs**

Pros:

\-Stuff they do seems really interesting

\-National Lab, possibly government job in the future?

\-I'll be working on database too, which is what I am interested in.

Cons:

\-Located in New Mexico, I might not actually want to move there

\-Seems like it's an internship meant for freshman/sophomore

Thank you for your help!

ncllc9,1,2021-05-14,[CA] Filing for Unemployment after a 10-month internship,Duckduckgosling,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ncllc9/ca_filing_for_unemployment_after_a_10month/,"I graduated last year and accepted a year-long full-time internship. I'm 10-months in and it's been an awful experience. I don't know if I will even get a job offer, but I don't plan to accept. (There is a 10-year veteran of the company who hates me and has put the blame on me *yes, blaming the intern* for things I can prove weren't my fault thanks to version history.)
I've been talking to others in my industry who have advised me that it will take some time before I am able to find another job. (I'm guessing 6 month+ optimistically.) 

1. Will I be able to file for unemployment even though I was an intern? I am considered an employee of the company and was not hired through an agency.

2. Will I be able to file for unemployment if I quit early before the internship ends?
*I've been encouraged by my mentor AT the company to just leave because the it isn't worth the treatment I'm getting.*"

My options have come to about $1000+ a month which is equal to what I'm paying at the same time for my apartment at school (12 month lease, can't find a sublet) and with school I transferred to my university the semester before covid so without the GPA cushion after 3 semesters of online BS my GPA is shot no matter how hard I try, and I'm at a point I will have to give up my internship. Oh, and during all this I got scammed out of $300 trying to find housing for this internship. I am so confused on what to do because I am now contemplating dropping out of school because I don't want to put the extra 50K in debt when I don't think I'll find a job with shit GPA, no network, and no experience. I've looked into technician jobs, because I do have an associates degree but everyone wants you to have years of experience even for entry level. It has been super stressful and I already have a mood disorder and depression and everything lately has had me contemplating suicide a lot more often because it feel like there are no good options, and I ruined my life by going to school or not ending it in high school."

I have an inoperable brain tumor that is growing rn as we speak and has caused me to have partial permanent blindness in both eyes. The tumor has also caused me to have strabismus (wandering eye) in my left eye. To make matters worse I will be going this Sunday to the hospital to get an emergency MRI to see if surgery will be needed which will likely happen as my oncologist was telling me. She said that we will need to act quick to stop the tumor from growing and to reverse and or stop my strabismus from getting worse. Then I will be going on some chemo which will be used to prevent the tumor from growing back. 

I have been thinking about this hard since my lazy eye happens just about every second of the day when I focus on things. Idk if it will be debilitating to me in the future or if it will go away with surgery but I have already signed a lease for my apartment where the internship is located and I have the money to pay for it but I don’t know if I should ride the internship for as long as I can or not because the internship is necessary for me to graduate from college and is considered a class. 

I just need some advice on how to proceed. This is a touchy subject and I don’t know how or what to do."

I graduated last year In the middle of the pandemic and fortunately enough got a job as a DBA, (tbh, I never wanted to become a DBA but joined anyway because the offer was from a really good company in my country anyway.)  


a year into the job, self reflection hits and my desire to code kicks in ( I don't have any development experience except writing Python scripts or solving ad-hoc problems on leetcode).

&amp;#x200B;

Now the blocker is, I can't make a switch within my country because of one reason

* If I switch from current company to any other I'll get down to 50-70% less salary of what I am getting now (Yes, it's a huge dent)

  
Now, I am thinking to go to Europe (primarily, Germany) to complete MS CS and alongside do internships that would help likely to get a development job. (There's no other motivation to do master's than to get into development route and besides extra knowledge wouldn't hurt)

Or  
should I try getting a DBA / DevOps role again at Germany (visa relocation)  and try to figure out my way from there on?"

I have an upcoming internship that’s scheduled to start next week. As my internship is remote, i would probably need a work from home desk setup.

Most of my internship will utilize the following: MS Excel, MS power BI and TABLEAU.

Is it viable to buy an All in one desktop computer or should i just buy a desktop along with a HDMI cable to connect it to my pc?

On a side note, this is my first internship ever."

I am thinking of applying to PhD programs in Fall 22 cycle in computer graphics/computational geometry in US.

**Profile:**

* Btech in computer engineering from an Indian University that is not an IIT. CGPA 3.7/4,
* Research experience of 1 year in a different CS sub field under an IIT Bombay Professor. Planning to submit a paper next year.
* 1 summer REU at a top US University lined up.
* 1 SDE summer internship at a recognized company + will be joining there as a Full Time employee after the REU is over.
* GRE 335

**Questions:**

1. Is it possible to get a direct PhD admit with my profile?
2. Some universities allow you to apply for masters as well as PhD in the same cycle. Are there any pros or cons in applying for both at the same time?
3. Some posts here have been mentioning 'Fully funded PhD offers'. I was under the impression that all PhD positions are fully funded. What does 'fully'/'partially' funded mean exactly?

Be admitted for Fall 2021 L&amp;S as a transfer student. I want to declare the CS major but have some questions about the declare process.

1.Everyone says that the cs61 series is hard so I want to take a slower path. Although I have some programming experience, I still want to maintain a high GPA and build a solid foundation by reducing my workload. My thought:

Summer 2021: Go through 61A and 61B as much as I can by myself using online resources

Fall 2021: CS61A, EECS16A, Data8

Spring 2022: CS61B, CS70, EECS16B(or should I take it in Summer 2022?)

Summer 2022: focusing on internship or research

Is this schedule workable?

2. In addition to Data8, what other courses(including upper-division) do you guys recommend taking in my first two semesters?

3. I plan to graduate one semester later. Can I apply for it as a CS major transfer student?

4. Is it possible to finish all the upper-division courses and meet the graduation requirement in three semesters?

5. Will delaying graduation (graduate after the Fall semester) affect my application to graduate programs? (such as MEng)

Thank you."

Some info about me:

- I am studying 5 alevels
- I got a 1550 in the SAT (with mediocre essay scores though)
- I’m interested in applying to social sciences related majors
- ECs: mostly service, teaching job (paid), media internship, courses, speaking a few languages, very mediocre overall...
- honors: only some miscellaneous prizes... I fear that I won’t be able to fill the common app  :(
- hooks: my high school is on a Mediterranean island... if this counts lol

So far I’m thinking about ED1 NYUAD because 1) I need good financial aid; 2) I like the international community and study abroad opportunities; 3) I feel like I have a reasonable chance of getting in with my international experiences (not only living on an island but also some exchange programs)...?

However, I have this wild dream of applying to Stanford because I just love this school so irrationally... I am planning on making an art portfolio over the summer to increase my chance even though I am not a great artist (just self-confidence coming from nowhere lol). Stanford is not need-blind so I will need to get a loan for Stanford.

So basically I am thinking about:

1. ED1 NYUAD; and if I don’t get in which I hope it won’t happen I will apply to as many lottery schools as I like
2. REA Stanford —&gt; ED2 NYUAD (but I am worried about my chance getting lowered by applying ED2 since I heard many Ivy applicants apply this round)
3. REA Stanford, no ED (this is because I am also considering schools in other countries where I don’t have to request financial aid; however I am a bit reluctant to forgo the ED round)

Any advice for me? I will appreciate any thought on it(&gt;_&lt;)"

Now that things are calming down I'm finally looking for a CS job only to find that my programming skills are a bit rusty and I have no idea how to actually get an entry-level job since every single listing I see requires several years work experience (how is requiring you to already have work experience ""entry-level""?) or only want people who just graduated.

I am quite close to graduating with Mechatronics Engineering Honors / Information Systems double with a decent GPA, and by the time I graduate I would have worked \~ 4 years in the IT world while studying, and done a fairly high level internship that I have just locked in. 

While getting a graduate job alone is going to be full on regardless, I have been weighing the options to go spend a season working a ski field overseas (technically my home country that I haven't properly \*lived\* in since we left, well before I went to school) and on return getting into a graduate position/work.  


While not a full year break, it would end up being closer to 9 months from graduation before until I am back home. The pros of this being, life experience and taking the opportunity to do these things while I am young still, while the negs are obvs missing out on grad positions, employers not wanting someone not right into industry out of uni / gap in resume and the general job market being volatile these days. 

Im worried that for the sake of me ""living my life"" I will make it infinitely harder to land a position I would want to be in, but at the same time, I will only get this opportunity to do these things while I am young, and I am only getting older. 

Some other things to note, is I am based in AUS, I would have work until I decided to actually leave the country after I graduate (same IT position happy to have me after internship) or the internship having the option of a paid role after the initial time is completed. I would also be getting a job while overseas  to support myself, so it wont be a clean disconnect and bludge nearly a year away.

As a lot of you have seen both side of this or even done it yourself, I wanted to ask what is your stance on this, and what sort of effect it would have on my prospects if I decided to go ahead. Cheers Guys"

**Undergrad institution:** Outside of US, top 300 public university  
**Major:** BSc. Computer Engineering

**Research Experience:**

Around 3 months of research experience at my university, came to a halt once the pandemic hit. No publications  
Currently working with a known research scientist and lecturer at an R1 university on a deep learning library geared towards educational use, and for his book. The closest thing I will have to a publication will probably be chapters I may contribute to on his book, and my software which will be used in his book, and for his coursework at said R1 uni.

**Work experience:**

2 throwaway internships at local companies (SWE and NLP), 1 decent internship at local company (Deep Learning, Computer Vision), and upcoming internship at Big Tech company (Deep Learning, Graphics). TA'd Introduction to C, and was a Developer mentor at a local hackathon (the team I helped mentor got first place).

**Honors:**  
High Honors for 2021 Fall.

I was &lt;3.0 GPA for my first two years because I didn't care enough, along with some personal issues which made it harder. Got a 3.7 last semester which boosted my GPA, and currently doing the second semester.

**No GRE yet**

**LOR:**  
None yet, but hoping to get one from my current RA mentor and Big Tech mentor

I work in the quantitative group for [CreditSights](https://www.creditsights.com), a financial research firm in New York that specializes in the corporate bond market. Three of our group members are graduates/students from OMSCS/OMSA so we know your background and the quality of research that you’re capable of. 

It’s a paid full-time summer internship that can be done remotely. You have to be a US citizen or if you’re an international student you need an OPT/CPT from the university. If you know pandas and basic statistics then you’re a good candidate. If you’ve taken Machine Learning, Machine Learning for Trading or Data and Visual Analytics then you’re a good candidate. If you’ve done EdTech and know how to outline and execute a research project then you’re a good candidate. 

The group is looking for help on re-estimating some of our quantitative models: company default probabilities and relative credit scores. For example, what is the probability that Gamestop will default on its debt? Is Intel a safer company then NVIDIA? Think logistic/linear regression but also room to explore random forests, neural networks, etc. 

I’m also working on market liquidity projects—see the below papers from the European Central Bank and Federal Reserve. My job is to replicate, improve and apply those ideas to corporate bonds.

There will be a lot of data cleaning/processing/engineering before you get to the modelling step but that’s part of the territory. We’re looking for someone that will help build out research pipelines that make research faster and more efficient -&gt; data acquisition, cleaning, formatting, modeling, then a whole lot of standardized reports that delve into the model outputs beyond just reporting an R\^2. Your specific role in this process will depend on where we are on the research when you start and your technical strengths.

The firm has around 1,000 institutional clients around the world, including banks, investment advisors, mutual funds, pension managers, insurance companies, hedge funds, private equity firms and corporations. 

Our New York office is looking for an intern to work remotely with our Quantitative Credit Strategy group. The candidate will work closely with our modeling team to support model development. The successful candidate will have the following skills/experience:

·  Strong oral and written communication skills

·  Experience with Python/Pandas and SQL

·  Experience working with large datasets

·  Knowledge of Statistics and/or machine learning

·  Knowledge or interest in finance or economics

The intern will be expected to work in the following areas:

·  Build Python code and SQL queries to build modeling datasets

·  Construct data validation tests

·  Build Python scripts to run our models

·  Develop methods to store model outputs

Should I move out in September, January, May, or when I find a big girl job?**

I'm a bit torn tbh. I'm in my last year of my bachelor's degree (MIS), and I really think I can move out and become completely financially independent right now.

In college, I've worked two internships (fully paid) directly related to my major and got great reviews and contacts. I've also had a part time job with my school since Sept 2020, completely unrelated to my major but have gained a shit ton of employable skills (marketing, web design, event planning, management, etc.). I am still working in that part-time job, just got promoted, and will now be getting a higher hourly rate with a bit more hours, making approx. $1400 a month. The real kicker is that next summer (May - Aug 2022) I will switching from part time to full time in the same job (since I won't be in school anymore). This gives me 4 months of a job where I'll get over $2500/month, and 4 months to look for a permanent big girl job in my field while rolling in lots of $$. I was talking to my dad about the job market right now in IT (he works in IT, I'm planning on working in IT), he said there is a really high chance I'll be able to secure a job during the summer months after graduation, especially since the pandemic is dying down.

I currently have over $13k in my savings. There's currently a couple of ways this can go:

1. If I move our in September 2021, I'll have approx. $5k in my savings by the time I get a real job.
2. If I move out in January 2022, I'll have approx. $8k in my savings by the time I get a real job.
3. If I move out in May 2022, I'll have approx. $13k in my savings by the time I get a real job.
4. If I stay with my parents until I find a big girl job when I graduate, I'll have around 20k in savings.

Now I know $20k is a lot and $5k is so little, but since the spread of covid is slowing down due to vaccine rollout (it's looking really good in Ontario, Canada), I'm having 50% of my courses in person next year. Plus the fact that I work on campus, and all my friends and my boyfriend are downtown, and that's where I'll be all the time, it seems like a good idea to live there, making my commute easier and no one to answer to, and overall independence that I've been craving for so long. If I stay at home, I won't have a car (since my sister's school is an even further commute, she'll get the car) so there's very limited hours I can be out of the house, and even when I do go out I have to get their approval (aka 4th year of constant sneaking around cause of how strict they are, but sneaking around gets really tiring), which will be infinitely harder because of covid (they hate it when I go out of the house at any time). I am not a fan of being a home owner within the next 5 years, so I don't need the money for a down payment, and I have a TFSA that has a couple thousand dollars. If all else fails, I can always move back in with my parents, but that defeats the entire point of this decision. I want to move out and never have to move back in. So what do I do? Do I move out in September, January, May, or is that dumb and I should wait until I find a big girl job?

Edit: My parents also recently bought a big ass house that we've been living in for 4 years now. Even though it's really far from downtown, I'd feel so bad leaving after my dad put all his money in to it for our family of four :/"

Now I know $20k is a lot and $5k is so little, but since the spread of covid is slowing down due to vaccine rollout (it's looking really good in Ontario), I'm having 50% of my courses in person next year. Plus the fact that I work on campus, and all my friends and my boyfriend are downtown, and that's where I'll be all the time, it seems like a good idea to live there, making my commute easier and no one to answer to, and overall independence that I've been craving for so long. If I stay at home, I won't have a car (since my sister's school is an even further commute, she'll get the car) so there's very limited hours I can be out of the house, and even when I do go out I have to get their approval (aka 4th year of constant sneaking around cause of how strict they are, but sneaking around gets really tiring), which will be infinitely harder because of covid (they hate it when I go out of the house at any time). I am not a fan of being a home owner within the next 5 years, so I don't need the money for a down payment, and I have a TFSA that has a couple thousand dollars. If all else fails, I can always move back in with my parents, but that defeats the entire point of this decision. I want to move out and never have to move back in. So what do I do? Do I move out in September, January, May, or is that dumb and I should wait until I find a big girl job?

Edit: My parents also recently bought a big ass house that we've been living in for 4 years now. Even though it's really far from downtown, I'd feel so bad leaving after my dad put all his money in to it for our family of four :/"

I'm currently enrolled in both CS61C and CS188 for this summer and trying to decide which class to take. As for my schedule, I have a remote full-time internship during the summer that is known to work their interns about 80+ hrs/week (Note: not a SWE/tech-related internship), but I've been pretty good at BSing work assignments in the past and I'm not worried about getting a return offer for this summer since I have already got an offer for junior summer. In terms of my math/CS background, I got an A in 61A and will be getting at least a B in both 61B/70 for this past semester. I dislike long programming assignments which makes me concerned about 61C, but that's also the reason why I want to get this class out of the way ASAP when things are still P/NP.

Overall, I think 188 would likely be easier to get a C- in than 61C for the summer given my tight schedule, as I heard 61C has many time-consuming projects. Neither class matters at all for what I want to do, but 61C would open up more options for CS upper divs like 186/161. So I'm wondering, how doable is it to take either 61C and 188 this summer along with a full-time internship? What type of preparation can I do beforehand?

Again, my goal isn't to get an A/A- in those classes, as I'm merely trying to get a C-; nonetheless, I do understand that it's going to be a tough summer and I'm willing to push through it to make things easier when P/NP ends this fall. Would appreciate any advice especially from those who took those 2 classes during the summer before."
nd4ww6,12,2021-05-15,How to advance my career in terms of salary in Europe.,BriteOrange123,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nd4ww6/how_to_advance_my_career_in_terms_of_salary_in/,"I realize this thread, and most of reddit, is US centric but I'm hoping there are some kind, wise sages browsing this sub reddit from Europe or that at least the advice of the kind, wise US sages also applies to Europe. 

Given this crazy 2 years I am grateful to even have a job but I find myself seeming to be a bit stuck in my career and I am hoping to get some advice about how I should move forward from people with more experience. I have a bachelor's degree in Software Development (4 years full time) and about 4.5 years of experiences between 3 companies (1 was 5 months internship).

During the last 2.5 years of my career, my salary has actually stayed flat and then decreased slightly and is now hovering just ever so slightly above the median average of the country I am in (Netherlands).

I dont see a future with me sticking with the same company who only increase the salary by 2.4% every 15 months. To be honest, the only reason I want a higher salary is to be able to afford a home. If I already had one, I would be more interested in quality-of-life aspects but alas.

The current average salary that I am on enables me to either rent in a single room apartment/studio with little savings building up (if im even lucky enough to find such a place to rent) or to live in a house share, saving for at least 50% of a house as the max mortgage i could get wouldn't even cover 50% of the average house price. At this rate it would take me 22 years of living in a house share until I have enough to buy a house at the prices of writing this in 2021.

And so, I find myself wondering how it is possible to better position oneself and increase one's salary as a software engineer/develop in the Netherlands?

I had 2 ideas so far Im hoping to get some feedback on.

**Idea 1: Get a master's degree in something that will pay well (Data science, Security, computer science, AI/ML).**

Now I realize this idea isn't as simple as, do master's degree -&gt; salary goes up 30%. As I understand it, doing a master's degree in anything other than computer science/software development will be going down a specialization path which means that the general software jobs are no longer really open to me.

Its possible my salary would go up a good bit but the number of jobs I can apply for will be fewer. In addition, there is a risk involved as to do a full time 2-year course I would need to apply and win a grant, quit my job, spend another 2 years in education and afterwards deal with having to apply to compatible positions after graduation until I get lucky enough to find something, not to mention that the landscape could drastically change in 2 years (feeling the effects of covid recession for example).

Doing something general like computer science/software development might increase the job opportunities even more than doing a specialization, as in opening up higher paid developer jobs that have higher standards/requirements but im not sure how big the pay raise would be, its possible that its not even worth it.

Im not sure about this idea, it may be possible to do a part time masters and still keep my current job as a safety net but it doesnt look very realistic.

**Idea 2: Become a Fintech developer.**

Doing a bit of looking around, I noticed how much higher the salaries are for fintech developers, about more than double of what im on. It could be feasible to research what it takes and what it requires to get a role in one of these highly paid positions. I would imagen its incredibly difficult and maybe I do not have enough IQ for it.

I would also imagen its very competitive and there would be many seniors who would want these positions but maybe if I take the time to study/education and make contacts and do some side projects/learning it could be possible to eventually break into this field. Anyone with experience of getting into fintech?

**Conclusion:**

So right now, these are the only ideas that I have and im not 100% sure how realistic/feasible they are. Maybe someone has more ideas about what I could do?

If im just going to be stuck on the national average all my life then I don't really see the point of continuing. Id rather become an English teaching Buddhist monk in Thailand than be a 50-year-old house sharer who rented all his life, put off having a family and now is responsible for taking care of his aging parents.

Thank you for reading this and potentially giving some advice. I could really use some guidance from people with more experience."

Ended up sending something I feel embarassed as I ran out of time, because I was doing an internship Mon-Thur and then on the weekends an actual job, so I had little time.

I had a breakdown yesterday. The stress is dragging me down, I laid in bed for an hour, not doing anything, instead of joining my friends for a birthday in time. When I did get there, I barely felt happy. 

I quit my weekends job last weekend. I felt exhausted. I was working without a contract, got mad at my boss and just ""ragequit"" to not deal with his crap.

I love my FWB but he doesn't love me back, not as more than friends, despite us spending every single weekend together. I realised I was showing too much interest on him (I'm 95% of the time the one initiating conversation over text, showing interest in meeting up...) so I decided to let him be the one to text me. I can't believe he hasn't, since Tuesday. We talk DAILY. All of a sudden we don't, and he doesn't care to say anything? Last thing I told him was I was having a job interview. Why didn't he ask me about this? Rethorical question: He does not love me, he does not have much interest in me. He will keep waiting for me to feel like making a plan with him. I won't. I quit.

Oh, about that job interview, felt good, I was going to work at a new place today, but I realised I can't take another job and I'd end up exhausted like before at my other nightmare job, so I ghosted the employer, sigh...

I thought I wanted time for myself, but I hate spending the entire day at home. I'd go somewhere but as a result of not having a job, I barely have any money to spend that way. I only wanted to have time in the weekends to meet my friend, but now he doesn't care to talk to me. I feel needy and dependant on him, yes, and he feels the opposite thing. Unbelievably miserable, that's me."

I spent most of my time self-study to catch up with my classmates since they had a pretty ""heavy"" history with computer science (doing BS in CS, some internships, etc.) versus me who has just written my ""Hello World"" program when I got in the program.

That also means that I did not have much time to implement any personal project that is closely related to my interest (data science), and the projects that I have done are class-related (security, scraping data, etc.). My full-time work experience is in researching with different department professors (finance, accounting, economics, etc.).

I am confident in my knowledge of stats (this is what I have worked with while doing research), machine learning, and probably algorithms. I will even graduate with a 4.0 GPA - but still, I feel like, without any internship or projects, I am most likely bringing a rusty knife to a gunfight.

I’m currently struggling to choose between CWRU and Pitt Honors. I don’t have a set major because I want to take courses, internships, etc. at college to fully decide on my career path. Right now, I’m thinking about pursuing medicine, but this could change to business/finance or something else entirely. My decision also comes down to a question of fit vs. cost.

CWRU
Pros:
- Better fit (smaller, closer community, nerd culture lol, greater diversity, more academic)
- University circle (free access to variety of museums, botanical garden, more green space that I like)
- Cleveland music institute (scholarships for lessons since I love playing music/instruments)
- Many, many opportunities to be involved in medical internships, research, etc.
- Probably better for finance if I ever choose to pursue it
- Probably a safer environment than Pittsburgh (from what I’ve heard)

Cons:
- COST (~51k per year) - my parents say they can cover half the total cost, but I still don’t know if it’s worth it (especially if i choose to go to med school)
- Mediocre/bad and expensive food and dorms
- I’ve heard courses can be especially difficult, which could lower my GPA (important for med school)


PITT
Pros:
- Cheaper (~36k per year)
- Honors college - priority course registration, smaller community
- Also has great opportunities in medicine
- Good study abroad programs

Cons:
- Larger, more sports-focused school which isn’t a great fit for me (could be overwhelming with the amount of people)
- City environment, lacking green space
- Could be more dangerous
- Lower diversity
- Probably worse for finance


It’s a pretty tough decision for me. The logical side of me thinks I should go to Pitt, but I feel like I’ll have regrets about not going to Case. Also, my family wants me to go to Case because it’s a better school, but they never dealt with student debt and loans. Thoughts? :)"
nd7h1l,1,2021-05-15,Coding Bootcamp Prior to Beginning CS Major?,highlvlproblemsolver,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/nd7h1l/coding_bootcamp_prior_to_beginning_cs_major/,"Hello there,

I'm in the midst of making a career transition from Digital Advertising (SEO/SEM) to a subdiscipline within software engineering, (perhaps Web Development or Cybersecurity). Thus far, I've taken two introductory Computer Science courses in Java (the prerequisites for the CS major).

I completed the starting Web Developer course on FreeCodeCamp + done about 50% of the Web Developer Career Path in Codecademy. So I'm pretty familiar with HTML/CSS and some beginner/intermediate JavaScript.

In 2021, (because I was playing around with wanting to get into Cybersecurity), I was recommended to focus on Python and gain a deep, vertical proficiency in the language because of its wide range of applications and how relevant it would be for getting into Cybersecurity, as well as it's applications in Web Dev, where I also have an interest.

So I've focused on Python, and gotten pretty good in the fundamentals of the language, and am at the point where I can start building small applications, away from my books and tutorials where I initially did the bulk of my studying. I've also spoken to my employer (an Advertising Agency) and upon beginning my CS program, I'm going to be able to split my time in my current role + a software developer intern role in that department. So I think that much is good.

My program begins in Winter 2021, and I'm honestly a bit frustrated.

I can only allocate about 1.5 hours per day during the workweek + 3-4 hours per day on the weekends to study, and it's beginning to be upsetting because I can't really make huge progress because I simply can't give all my time to the discipline.

I'm considering doing an immersive coding bootcamp, so that I can accomplish two things. A) At the time that I begin my CS major, I (hopefully) will be able to have gained enough skill mastery to work a part-time Web Developer job, and B) I'll be able to truly hit the ground running in my major.

Does this sound like a good idea to you all? Why or why not?

Because of the way I live, very frugally and saving/investing, I have over a year of living expenses saved up and wouldn't have any issue with pausing working in order to really upskill.

Let me know what you think!

Thank you,"

However I’m stuck trying to figure to what extent I should be learning Python and SQL and was hoping to know what parts do you all use on a daily basis. By that I mean I’ve already learned basic sql and Python, understand fundamentals of data structures like stacks queues, linked lists, search trees etc but is it necessary to keep going into algorithms and further? I guess I’m just tryna to figure out what should I optimally be spending my time on to learn to get the most out that I would practically use. Also should I learn pandas, are there any courses on how to actually code data pipelines. Sorry if this is just me rambling I’m pretty nervous and just to be able to make an impact

For  three years I worked sports analytics ""internships"". COVID was brutal. I  was furloughed for 7 months, almost homeless, living off taking out  loans or unemployment. After hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of job  applications, presentations, rejections, etc....last week I finally got a  job. My first real job with benefits, security, etc. Turning 26 next  month, I was scared to death of having no healthcare. The sports jobs  were ""full time seasonal,"" I had to move for a new assignment every 8  months. It was awesome when I was in my early 20s, but I'll be 26 this  year and I want to have a livable wage, settle in for a few years, start  dating and meet friends. New priorities without the ""dream"" that  required $8-$12 an hour, extensive travel, etc.

Anyway,  I just got a job offer for 50K. I'm single and it's an affordable part  of the country...so it's something. I'm not super jazzed. But, it stops  the bleeding. Over the past year on unemployment, I began grad online in  CS. It's been hard. But, I like doing hard things. It's where I want to  be one day, both in terms of earnings potential and day to day work.  This is an entry-level associate role, and my responsibilities do seem  to be telling stories with data. Some tools like SQL and proprietary  tech. But, it's also more business management. That's my undergrad. So, I  kind of have the best of both worlds.

As  I'm in grad I'm still unsure what route I'm going. I'm a year in and  done with my intro (to make up for my non-relevant undergrad) and my  foundational by the end of next Fall. I lean toward DS but also like SE.  The company does have branches for Data Analytics and Software  Engineering. I didn't bring up my interest in interviews, I only spoke  to the current job and not so much the future. They have good  development plans, but I'm unsure if I can sort of branch away from this  once I get my degree in 2023. I guess I'm just nervous that I'm  destined to be in this spot and never get a real full CS job. This has  data analysis implications to it, but nothing super in-depth. And after  how traumatizing the past year has been, I worry about being boxed out  of possibilities once I get my Master's in CS. And at $50k at 26...I  don't know. I just feel kind of like a loser.

I  know I should be happier. I spent holidays alone, the road work of my  last career was awful, I finally have healthcare.  I'm just scared I'm  paying out the nose for my MS in CS and by the time I get it, I won't  have really other CS jobs and nobody will bring me in for a better wage  and more fulfilling in-depth work. Kind of scared. So, I know this is  all over the place, just wanted to see if I'm done for, if this is it,  how to navigate my path, etc. I do struggle a lot in my CS program but I  do enjoy it and I'm dedicated to learn. Plus, I'm nearly halfway  through. So, even if it hasn't been perfect, it counts for something I'd  hope"

I never had an internship, except for a program I did my senior year of high school with Texas Instruments, which was basically an internship but mostly focused on electrical engineering (I was part of an engineering academy program at my high school before majoring in CS.)

My current strengths are Java, since that’s what most of my college courses used, and I have decent experience solving easy and medium LeetCode problems (in Java) (solved 100+ easy and 100+ medium so far).

My GitHub doesn’t have anything extraordinary, but I have a lot of the LeetCode problems I’ve solved on there, many with an explanation of how I approached the problem. I have some repositories I made while learning a programming language or while taking a Udemy course that just has basic code, and I have 1 personal project I made with Java. I’m also planning to add some stuff I made in the past (2 games while in high school, 1 thing I made on my own, and another one I did in college in a group). www.github.com/21david is my GitHub.

I don’t know what to do. I’ve been considering a bootcamp called App Academy. Should I do App Academy? It is 4 months long and teaches Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and other tools for full stack web development.

Before considering this, I was learning android app development (using Kotlin) on Udemy and was just planning to do that, make a few apps, also learn iOS development and cross-platform development, and then try to find a job as a mobile developer.
Should I keep learning app development until I’ve made a few apps? Should I just apply now for whatever jobs I can for Java or Kotlin jobs? I think pretty much all job applications that I see have requirements that I do not meet. First of all, many require 1 or more years of experience required, which I don’t have, and second, many require things I have no experience in. Things I never tried out, some quick examples might be Java Spring, database stuff, other tools, etc. 

I honestly don’t really know what to do. Maybe this is a good reason to do a bootcamp, because they will guide me and teach many things college didn’t. I feel like doing a bootcamp makes up for not having had a relevant internship.

But I feel like I’m taking a risk. What if I don’t like the technologies I learn, or what if I don’t like full stack web development? Although I did enjoy the web development courses I took earlier (like last month or before). And I did want to learn JavaScript. Ruby is meh though, I don’t think I enjoy learning and using it as much as Kotlin and Java.

On the other hand I was enjoying learning app development with Kotlin and I feel like this kind of interrupted that.

Sorry if this was a long post.

Tl;dr
Graduated college 5 months ago, 3.34 gpa, no internships during college, some stuff on my GitHub, nothing extraordinary. Considering a boot camp, or teaching myself app development until I find a job. Not sure where to go from here though."

Began my Master's last March with a Grad ETA of Winter '22.  Previously in business. Worked sports analytics ""internships"" - low pay,  not sustainable. Due to COVID, I was out of work 7 months. Almost  homeless. Finally got a job. It's on the business end. Some SQL,  data-driven insights. $50K. Feel sort of like a loser. But it stops the  bleeding. More management than CS. Just upset about it. Feel I'll never  make it in CS, do what I want (SE or DS), make what I want. The company  does have analytics and software dev teams, but I'm not in it. I just  need advice how to traverse this so my dream to be in CS isn't dead,  mid-degree. I don't have time for tons of projects either - working full  time and being in school. But, I feel I should be happy yet my dream  feels dead. 

I had a longer, more detailed version of this, but it kept getting rejected. Nonetheless, I need help."
nddnoa,15,2021-05-15,Request: Tips for finding first job without a College degree?,TrulieveIsAnMSO,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nddnoa/request_tips_for_finding_first_job_without_a/,"So my wife has been studying for the past year+ Front end development trying to break into the career from a nanny and I'm rediculously proud of her. I'm a Java dev myself and it's been amazing watching her learn and study. She made this beautiful website: [https://kesineep.github.io](https://kesineep.github.io) which frankly blows anything I've ever put on my public ""github show and tell"" out of the water (spoiler I have nothing).

I think she's completed all the front-end FreeCodeCamp courses and earned the front end certificate there and works with a coding club on other projects and constantly in latenight zoom meetings practicing Leetcode and discussing other topics but is still stuck landing that first job.

I really think her skills are finally at the point to land that first gig but she's having trouble breaking the barrier and it's especially more difficult as she doesn't have a CS degree. She did go to college in Thailand and has an International Relations degree however I don't think that counts towards anything imo.

Wondering if you guys have any tips on landing a first job with no CS degree. From my understanding it's aready difficult enough for new entrants. She's currently considering some unpaid internships as a possibility to get some experience on the resume however that would obviously eat into time she could be applying for a paid job.

**TLDR: What are some tips for breaking the first job barrier with no CS degree and would an unpaid internship help here?**"
nde1zg,48,2021-05-15,Getting into the IT field with a CIS degree? Basically trying to get into the field with absolutely no IT skills/experience but with a college degree?,jchukwuxii,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/nde1zg/getting_into_the_it_field_with_a_cis_degree/,"Hello. So here’s my situation 

I’m currently a college student that will graduate in December 2021 with a degree in computer information systems. I chose the major because I was interested in computers and wanted to learn more about them and become skilled in the field. The major mainly focused on the software aspect but over the past year I’ve been leaning towards the IT infrastructure side. The problem is that I want to get into the IT field but my major has really only covered software, java programming, algorithms, etc. but I have no desire or interest in trying to get a career in those areas.

Like I said earlier, I’ve been leaning towards the IT infrastructure aspect like managing networks, cloud computing, desktop management, etc. I’ve attempted to try to land some type of internship or learning opportunity during the upcoming summer, and I’ve applied and cold called/emailed a lot of companies (mainly small and medium sized companies). But last week, I cold called an IT company about an internship and I actually got to speak with the company owner, and then today he scheduled a call with me to discuss where I’m at with my schooling and technical skills and after speaking with him, he says that he won’t be able to bring me in because I’m very “green” in the IT field and he wouldn’t have time to train me and my school didn’t provide me with the proper foundation needed in IT. We spoke for about 35 minutes and he was suggesting that I try to get certifications like CompTIA A+ and do some self learning. I’ve always thought about the CompTIA A+ certification but I feel like if a spend $200 on it and complete it, wouldn’t my whole college education be a waste? I want to feel like that my college education was worth it. I was just hoping that I could find some company that was willing to be patient with me and train a total newbie as I’m a very willing learner. I’m currently still making cold calls/emails and applying for any internships that I see fit.

Since I’m graduating in December, this is really my last summer to try to gain some real life experience (almost landed something last year but COVID ruined it) and I know it’s not impossible to get a job without an internship but I really don’t want to end up in that situation.

Anyone have any suggestions on what I should do?"
nde4fj,1,2021-05-15,Recent Computer Science Graduate looking to go into IT,rexdude99,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/nde4fj/recent_computer_science_graduate_looking_to_go/,"Hi, I recently graduated with a Bachelors degree in computer science and was hoping to get some advice on how to break into the IT industry. My college had a very small computer science department, which basically consists of online adjuncts since all of the on-site professors left. Most of my courses focused on basic application and web development, but I’ve realized that I would prefer to go into more of an IT role.
I had an internship at a small IT company, but I basically just did administrative work like taking inventory and documenting client’s device configurations.

I am currently looking for an entry level helpdesk position, but I am not sure that I have enough qualifications to land even that. I could really use some suggestions on how I can teach myself the skills necessary for basic tech support. I am thinking about trying to get a COMPTIA A+ certification, but don’t know the best way to go about it. I have started a free course on Alison.com, but I’m not sure how comprehensive it is. Any other online courses or certification recommendations would be greatly appreciated."

I don't have a CS background; I took a lot of CS classes in undergrad but I never actually had a CS internship before, and most of my experience comes from doing ML-related academic/research-level programming.

I am wondering if there are guides/tips/books that people would recommend in terms of what to get familiar with first. I know data structures and algorithms pretty well (which is why I got the position); I am thinking more so about SWE best practices, what to expect in terms of development, what to be familiar with, etc."

ndf3hk,2,2021-05-15,How hard will it be to land a Business Analyst/Data Analyst,raisedbynarcs123,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ndf3hk/how_hard_will_it_be_to_land_a_business/,"I graduated in May 2020 and no luck finding a job. I am an IT major and I am bad at IT stuff. In fact, I lack IT experiences anyways. I went for Business Development jobs getting endless interviews and endless rejections. I realized that my interviewing skills for BDR/SDR roles are not good since I do not have the personality of a sales person. Now I am changing my career path for Business and Data Analyst roles. I tailored my resume to those positions and I even started an wireless testing internship where I have to work 12 hour shifts. Will it be easy to get a full time Business/Data Analyst role with benefits this year? I really need the job, I need to get away from this 12 hour shift role, and my family is looking down at me for not having a full time job with benefits, while my mom spoke to people my age who all have full time jobs with benefits. It's so unfair my life is turning out the way I was expecting it to be due to the covid recession."

Had a troubled upbringing here and ever since I've been trying to run away. I know the US is huge and it's better to face these kinds of things, but I don't care. I just want to start over somewhere else.

Right now I'm about to be in my last year of college. I'll be graduating with a computer science degree. I've had three internships as well as project and research experience, so I feel like getting a job won't be too difficult. I'm considering getting a master's degree, which I feel would be a great way to get out of this country and a start a new life elsewhere. I'm just hoping that my GPA jumps up this semester so I have a chance at some good graduate schools.

I have a dual citizenship (EU and US) and I'm open to learning other languages. I'm honestly open to whatever country in Europe would take me. However I would really like it if there is good public transportation wherever I go, since I don't own a car/can't afford a car. I also have always liked Australia. Please help, what should I do/what can I do to make this work?

I probably should also mention that I'm broke... lol"
ndh4o2,1,2021-05-16,Seemingly ghosted after being courted for a role,McGhostFace,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ndh4o2/seemingly_ghosted_after_being_courted_for_a_role/,"So here is my story of a very recent experience which has left me somewhat down and upset. Throwaway account and some details left out.

TLDR: Company engaged me after I reached out to them about roles I am suitable for. Had two video chats with top brass who seemed interested and open to me coming on board. Ghosted since second video chat after THEY suggested how we should proceed.

\- - - - - - - - - -

Recently I reached out to someone on LinkedIn who is a Manager (M) at a leading firm. He suggested that I submit my CV for his firm's internship programme. I am career changing and have just finished my qualifications for my new career. I also have a lot of prior experience in my previous industry.  It turned out that I wasn't eligible due to already finishing my studies BUT he reached out to me afterwards to set up a video call to discuss how we might be able to ""collaborate"".

We had the call, which also included the COO of the firm at the suggestion of M, and it was extremely insightful. We discussed my background, career interests, and how they aligned with the firm. In the end they informed me of three possible roles within the firm. Role 1 was under the purview of M and more business related, whereas Role 2 would be in a different department but more suitable to my career aspirations, and Role 3 which hadn’t been fully defined yet but had the biggest potential to positively impact the firm. All of which I was interested in and qualified for. This chat went on well past the hour that it had been scheduled for and I felt positive coming out of it. This was on a Friday and I arranged to have another video call with the M the following Thursday. In this call we agreed to discuss Role 1 in more detail as well as Role 3.

The second video call also went on beyond the hour it was scheduled for, until M had to leave for his next meeting. He did most of the talking in this call, describing his team and their roles, as well as the role that he thought would be ""perfect"" for me. In the end we didn't have time to discuss Role 3 but he did spend time at the end telling me that I should be clear about what I want to do. He also told me about the department head he could set up a chat with if I wanted to pursue Role 2 (the role which aligns best with my career aspirations). I took this cue to ask if it would be ok to be connected with the department head for Role 2, thinking that it would be the prudent thing to do based on his advice. He agreed, saying there was an ""80%"" chance that he would be very interested in meeting me. I asked M how he thought we should proceed. He first offered another video chat between he and myself, but then later changed to suggest a lunch to discuss Role 3 and other roles after the semi-lockdown conditions have eased here (we currently can't dine in restaurants). This was the day before a long weekend and the department head of Role 2 had already left for his holiday home in a different city and M said that he would contact him after the long weekend. At this point we said out goodbyes. I followed up this chat with a thank you email on the same day which M did not respond to.

That second video chat was a little over 2 weeks ago but since then there has been radio silence. I used the time in between to reach out to my network to find out more about the industry here and the roles. There were two long weekends between the last video chat and now so I waited until last Wednesday to write a followup email to M. In it I mentioned that it seemed like the semi-lockdown conditions don't seem to be easing anytime soon and whether the lunch meeting was still feasible. Also that I remain enthusiastic about Role 1 and asked him what his timeline was regarding the position.

Now it's the weekend and only been two full working days since I sent that follow up email but given his tendency to respond within a few hours to a day in previous conversations, and coupled with the radio silence since our last video chat, I am beginning to feel that I might be being ghosted?

I also want to add that during the second video chat he mentioned, in an off-hand kind of way, that if I were to get back to him the next day saying that Role 1 was all that I ever wanted to do and I was going to move away from the area of Role 3 then we would be discussing salary and benefits.

My main concern is that I maybe didn't show as much interest in Role 1 within his team that he was looking for. Or perhaps by asking about the other roles (despite they telling me about them and being told to consider my motivation) have damaged my chances? Others have also suggested to me that since M was offering me Role 1 after I had initially contacted them about an internship, by not taking Role 1 immediately I was somehow offending him.

In retrospect I perhaps should have jumped at Role 1 from the second video chat and seen where it would take me with this firm (who are one of the leading firms in their sector within this country). But I thought that by asking about the other roles that they described to me I was doing my due diligence and following their recommendations."

 I am a junior/senior CIT major and recently accepted a paid intern position at a large university.

I was hoping to get some clarity on the possible paths I can take with my IT career based on the role my position has. 

From what I’ve gathered I will be:

-using a Configuration Management Database to manage IT assets/inventory. 

-monitor and update assets through tickets.

-prepare for inventory audits 


Thanks for any input. I am excited to start !

Edit: the duration of the internship is until graduation, however I have the opportunity to extend if I was to go on to my master’s."

ndioeu,230,2021-05-16,Incredibly Rare. Ultra-Violent.,Edwardthecrazyman,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ndioeu/incredibly_rare_ultraviolent/,"I'm Scientist #1— the *reasonable* or *concerned*— and ever since they brought in the newest specimen, things have been strange. Staring at it through the reinforced glass, the creature— if it can be called a creature at all— seemed to refuse examination at every turn. In the large, dark concrete room it writhed, twisted so that it never took a permanent form. Sometimes it reminded me of a childhood friend. Sometimes it possessed gnashing teeth and metallic blades for fingers. And still, no matter the change, and even in its most docile-seeming manifestations, it kept with it an air of danger. Something was inherently wrong with it.

Sitting in the rolling chair with a Styrofoam cup of coffee in the subterranean office, I had but only one thought: this thing needed to be either terminated or, if that proved fruitless, contained indefinitely. The pitch-dark office echoed beeps intermittently through the small monitors lining the walls of the room so as to lull any unsuspecting scientist into a false sense of security. This happened while I took a stirrer round the edge of my cup to mix the dry creamer. Just as I’d brought the cup up to my lips, the creature lunged at the glass, meeting it with a plastic-sounding thud and forcing a yelp from me. “Dammit!”

An even chuckle escaped the shadows to my left where the outline of a figure stood in the threshold to the hallway. “Nothing’s breaking through that glass. Hasn’t happened in more than fifteen years.” They said. Scientist #2— the *apathetic* or *observer—* moved to sit in the chair by me, unfurling a sub sandwich from its wax paper before bisecting the poor thing over a desk and inspecting its innards with a plastic knife.

I stole a napkin from their take-out bag and attempted to soak some of the coffee I’d spilled down the front of my lab coat. “What are you doing?”

“They keep putting jalapenos on my sandwiches. I think the boy behind the counter has a vendetta against me.”

“What do you think?” I nodded towards the specimen; the creature on the other side of the glass looked more like a childhood friend than ever before. Blankly with either two or seven eyes, it stared into the office viewing window like it knew we were on the other side.

“That thing? Only one thing to do. Wait and see. We take its vitals, see what it’s made of— the suits— they’re the ones that decide what’s to be done with it regardless of our findings. Been that way since I started. Our data works as a mere footnote in their decision.” 

It was true to say that if ever there was a natural scientist, a true unparticipating member, Scientist #2 was it. Scribbled notes, photographic evidence, cortisol levels, that’s what they cared about. I’d always allowed my humanities to get in the way. Sometimes I would stay awake nights thinking of the things that happened under our supervision; I do not believe Scientist #2 ever had this issue.

“Where did it come from?” I asked, relaxing into my chair once more.

“Space, they tell me. Most of them come from space. Never seen anything like this though. Most living organisms have a certain rule system. A way of communicating or at least understanding. This one though.” They closed their sandwich and proceeded to cut it in half with the plastic knife before taking a bite. A loose string of tomato skin caught around the corner of their mouth. “This one seems exceedingly volatile. It exhibits the most anti-social behavior and seems disinterested in consuming any organic matter we’ve attempted to feed it.” They wiped their mouth with a napkin. “Looked over the X-rays earlier and it seems it has no digestive system or internal organs to speak of. Quite fascinating. It should not exist.” They followed this up with another bite into the sandwich that made me feel as though they thought it was anything but fascinating.

A shuffling came from behind, forcing a sudden jolt from me as I spun the rolling chair around to face the culprit. “It has no desire to consume.” The voice was ecstatic. Scientist #3— the *enthusiastic* or *mad scientist*— stepped from the shadows and leaned over Scientist #2’s shoulder. “It feels hate and nothing else. What a magnificent creature indeed.” #3 wore a smile, one that made me habitually uneasy. They pressed their glasses up on the bridge of their nose before erecting themselves upright and crossing the room to touch the viewing window. A shiver ran down my spine. “Beautiful. I wonder what would happen if one were to let such a thing loose on the world. It should be only natural, after all.”

“Natural?” I spat the word out. “What exactly is natural about that thing?” I shook my head. “Ridiculous!”

\#3 spun on their heel to face me. “#1, you know as well as I do that humans are a mere blip in the cosmos. Don’t suffer at the hands of trivial human indignancies. You wind yourself up about them far too often. Your hair will gray all the faster for them.” They snickered. 

“It killed ten people when they captured it near the impact zone.” Said #2 through a bite of sandwich; although they offered this information, it felt like less of a defense to keep it contained and more of a fact they’d decided to recite.

I gritted my teeth in frustration. “It should be obvious— and I can’t believe I must argue this— it’s self evidently good to kill it or put it away from the world.”

“That’s what the data suggests.” Said #2.

“If you say so.” #3 shook their head. “Would be something to see it roam free though.”

\-

Later, at home, haunts of the creature’s amorphous face blinked through my dreams while I slept. When I awoke, I felt that it intended to do the world harm and letting it live on was a grave mistake. Perhaps my finger could slip, and I could pump its chamber full of poisonous gas.

Entering the elevator with my briefcase in tow, I hit the number to my floor and listened to the smooth jazz, finding myself doing a small one-two step in time with the rhythm. As a fresh-faced intern stepped into the elevator I coughed into my hand and shifted to lean in the corner as though I’d never been doing anything at all.

“Where are they sending it?” Asked the intern.

Rubbing my tired face, I idly responded. “Sending what?”

“That new one they brought in? I hadn’t thought your team was finished with examination, but a transport team showed up last night to take it away. I was sure they sent you a message— they said they had.” The intern raised an eyebrow. “That’s where I’m heading right now. Your department, #1. I just needed someone with the proper clearance to fill out this paperwork so I can finally go home.” The intern meekly held up a clipboard.

I shook my head, feeling the beginning of a migraine coming on. “This place is going to the dogs.” Snatching the clipboard from the intern’s hands, I looked it over.

“S-sorry.” They said.

“Not your fault. Go home. Get some rest. I’ll handle this from here.” As the elevator doors came open for the bottom floor, I offered them a smile. As the door shut and I stomped down the sterile hallway, the smile was gone, replaced by a frown as I read the name of the person who’d authorized the transport.

\-

“You went over our head?” I asked Scientist #3.

“That’s right.” They nodded nonchalantly while careening back in their office chair with a big grin. “I knew you couldn’t listen to reason. Something as wonderful as that needs to be examined in the field, in the wild as it were.”

I swiped my hand through my hair. “You’re kidding me.” Clenching my fists, unclenching them. I wanted to throttle them. “It killed ten people! It will kill a lot more. And for what?” #2 sat in the corner, skimming through an ancient copy of Teen Vogue. I turned to them instead. “Say something!”

\#2 looked up from their reading. “These quizzes in here are flawed.”

“That’s all you have to say?”

Tossing the magazine to the side, they stood, straightening their lab coat. “What’s done is done. There’s no fighting it now.”

Slack jawed, feeling an angry thump in my temples, I paced back and forth. “So that’s it?”

“That’s it.” Said #3.

“You’ve released an unimaginable evil on this world.” 

They nodded. “Yes. Exactly as intended.”

\-

Machinegun fire cracked and echoed through the wooded valley, illuminating the night’s tree line in brief splashes of yellow while we circled overhead in the helicopter.

“Amazing!” Said #3 as he watched the POV camera of the creature on a laptop.

It felt like anything but amazing. They— the suits— intended to send #3 alone as an advisor, but I refused to let that happen.

“You look so dour. Come on.” #3 clapped me on the shoulder and pushed the laptop over to me. “Look at this. It doesn’t only kill them. It seems to take away their personhood. Quick too. Oh— you’re being such a spoil sport about things. They let me have my way one time in all these years and you’re going to pout over it?”

I couldn’t watch it. Even from the corner of my eye, I could see the thing stalk in the tall foliage only to burst from its hiding place to shear a rebel fighter into two pieces, then ten.

“I must say, I don’t believe military contracting has ever been this fun.” Said #3.

“This is why I left the public sector in the first place.”

“Oh!” They pointed at the screen with visible excitement. “They got another one. Look at that. Took their eyes clean from their skull.” The burst of viscera covered the lens; static followed. “Damn!” Shutting the laptop, #3 shifted in their seat. “Is there a way we can catch it on the ground? Up close?”

I bit my tongue so hard I swear I felt blood.

The pilot obliged.

\-

Thick mud clung to my boots while we slipped through the compound lot. Drug runners. They told us it was full of drug runners. I don’t believe that. Metal-sheet buildings with wooden beams forced black shadows against the moon, sprouting ideas that that thing might decide to turn on its handlers. As small a defense as it might be, the only thing that made me feel better was the pilot leading the way, AR held out in front with a beam that cut through the shadows.

Another cry echoed somewhere ahead, followed by a series of gunshots. I flinched; I couldn’t help it. This was much different than the office I was accustomed to.

\#3 strode with confidence alongside the pilot. Not an air of worry.

“We should’ve terminated this thing when we had the chance.” I said.

The other two ignored this.

We pushed further into the compound, past the rundown housing and into the walled gates. Dead bodies strewn the place; intestines so far spread that it became impossible to tiptoe over them. Innards like wet sponges beneath our feet.

“Oh!” Said #3. “There it is! See? Just as I thought. They’d not killed it! It was only a surveillance malfunction.”

I froze dead in my tracks. In the center the compound, nearest its epicenter, stood the creature; with no glass between it and me, I could finally see it with extreme detail. Bullet holes riddled its body, but it treated this like a triviality as it stood fully on its three legs, heaving its chest, and exhaling exhausted white breath. The pilot stepped forward with their rifle.

The thing tore into the body of a dead soldier near its feet, popping ribs loose and scattering them around.

“Look at it.” Hushed #3. “Look at it.”

I did, but I felt something very much different than the admiration #3 so obviously felt for the thing. My stomach dropped into my feet and I couldn’t hold it back anymore. Doubling over, bile launched from my mouth onto the ground. Wiping my lips, I turned back to the creature. “Enough.” I said. “It needs to be terminated. Warfare is one thing, this another.”

The creature, seeming bored with its job, lingered on a foot then transformed into a thing with eight long, chitin-shining, appendages and skittered away into the compound’s main building.

\-

“It’s broken free.” Said #2 while we sat in the break room. They said it like they might say the temperature.

My hands shook as I tore into a pack of sugar, sending it across the table.

“It was bound to happen.” #2 shook their head.

\-

On my way home, in the deep evening, I drove. Wanting to put anything besides that creature into my head, I listened to a pop station.

I was freed from my spell as I pulled into the driveway. Just as I was about to exit the car, I looked up and saw a cat sitting on my front porch. It lingered a moment, licking the inside of its paw, before shifting its gaze to me, watching me through the windshield. Orange and white, it seemed abnormally plain. Except for the long spider leg protruding from its head like it pierced clear through reality.

Immediately, my fingers fumbled to dial base. “It’s here.” I said into the receiver. “It’s at my fucking house!” My voice shot out in a panic as the cat stood on all fours, flicking its tail back and forth on approach. “Quick!” I shouted.

I stayed unmoving even as the thing pounced onto the car hood, circled a few times, then sat. We watched one another through the glass and with each blink, it changed form.

In the ensuing gunfight with the creature, it ran through the unit they sent like a hot knife through butter, barely giving me enough time to escape.

\-

“I’ve been forced to relocate.” I said in the office. “I don’t like it knowing where I live.”

\#2 offered an idea. “Perhaps it knows your smell? Some animals are exceptionally good with that sort of thing.”

I would like to try networking, being a cloud practitioner and cyber security.
Regarding finances they are both similar, but I’m more concerned about professional/career growth and flexibility for exposure within IT and will subsequently then specialize in the choice of my chosen field.

I am currently hunting for a new job, since my current one seems to wear me outand have flashed a bunch of red lights lately, but the biggest one being my own psychical health...

My current job is IT field tech, junior grade... And I am one of 2 people responsible for a major area, where i for 2 years kept 4 of the biggest clients satisfied alone for the onsite tasks, at a age of 26...

I am also the kind of guy people come to for help or waypoints in some problems, yet the only thing they measure for is billed hours...
They also dump major projects onto the guys who already have plenty to do... ( 40-50 user related tasks with a week's deadline, where there are at least 1 hour work per user)

Pay is also pretty low for me despite what i have done for the firm, and my geographic area... So I think it's time to jump the boat after 3 years..


So over to the new job that I'm interviewing for; It is a internal IT Support tech for about 400 users in different departments, i have similar experience from my 2 year internship period at Norway's largest high school, with 2100 students, and 450 teachers... And 44.000 kvm² area

I also have a MS900 certification, Which i believe will be a good thing for them, as well as broad experience with setting up and managing different systems...

I see myself as pretty handy, and tends to find creative ways to solve new problems that people have not yet encountered....

During my internship time, i was responsible for maintaining the schools iMac lab, where i also helped out creating a OS deployment system for, which we used to redeploy them over Ethernet each Christmas, so i do have some rare experience

What they are primarily looking for is a help desk person, with a growth potential, and i believe me to be that kind of person, i love to help people, and maybe teach them something along the way, i would call myself passionate about the profession, and i have a resumé proving work experience from 12 years back, with more than 5 years relevant experience as a IT professional

I believe that i might be slightly overqualified, but at the same time not, what do you think?

However, back in college I interned there for a couple summers and semesters. In total it’s been three years since I very first started working there. If I left now would other employers view this as job hopping since I’ve been full time for less than a year or would they take into consideration the time I spent as an intern as well?

I accepted this job during the height of COVID because they gave me an offer before anyone else did, and I was worried about the job market. However, long term I just don’t think it’s a good fit for me. For reference, I’m an electrical engineer."

Need your advice / opinion.

I am granted 15-20 hours per week for next 6 months by current employer (I asked for this) to learn something new; so I want to use the time wisely; and stay relevant (*read have a job, not necessarily the same employer*) for next 10 years for my family.

\---------------------**Where I'm at:**\---------------------

Two kids, my age 39, excellent WordPress dev (*custom themes from scratch, or page builders like Elementor*).

Self taught developer.

**I love:**

* Books, reading (mentioning it as it explains my degree choice)
* Linux
* Solve problems (*anything that piques my interest --  from fixing a kids' toy, to figuring out stereo wiring for my car --* it's super easy *--  to being one the first users of WP REST API in my local dev community*)

**My journey so far:**

School teacher **==&gt;** IT clerk in a college + Bachelors in evening **==&gt;** HTML &amp; PHP internship **==&gt;** Joomla project as trial **==&gt;** Freelance job as Joomla developer + Masters in Library Science in evening **==&gt;** Library Automation job in a University (automated a manual library using Koha and DSpace) for 2 years **==&gt;** Job in a Digital Marketing agency as a WordPress developer for past 5 years (ongoing)

Linux as main OS since 2006 Jan. Red Hat -&gt; Mandrake -&gt; Debian -&gt; Suse -&gt; Ubuntu -&gt; Mint -&gt; Slackware (for years) -&gt; Arch (since 2014)

650 USD per month salary at present company (I'm in SE Asia). Was the sole developer for 4 years. Have a junior dev now for almost a year who is really good and I've taught him so that he can do a website project start to finish in a quality I'd approve.

Uncertain situation worldwide as you know.

Two developers in a small company. Senior one (me) with double the salary of the junior dev, while the junior dev can now do the work that I used to do.

Tried Upwork to build a raft for myself. For a 2 month consistent effort (starting at $5 jobs) I made $200.

Out of 6-7 Upwork jobs, I think 2 were WordPress. Rest were GCP, AWS, and Linux server setup or once  troubleshooting NGINX. Moodle set-up on Digital Ocean and Koha setup were two projects.

\---------------------**Where can I go from here?**\---------------------

I never learned algorithms, data structures etc -- formal CS education. I just learned to write and understand code as much as it's required for a good WordPress dev. Did a 3 months JS free course back then to know enough JS to get basic things done.

To recap, I'm good at:

* Linux servers on the cloud (but no CI/CD though, never learned)
* Doing things by just reading documentation, a book, a video course
* Enough PHP for WP themes from scratch (but no advanced stuff like Namespaces)
* Enough JS to handle basic events or manipulate DOM to do stuff
* Very good with CSS (Flexbox, CSS Grid, media queries)

So the time I'm given in the next 6 months. What would you suggest I do? There are so many technologies, frameworks, paths out there.

Please advise."

I’m 24 years old and I turn 25 in August. I barely made it out of high school, I even had to repeat a year, but I actually enjoyed it because I made some very close friends and helped me mature significantly. After high school I went to my local community college where I got my associates degree in liberal arts with a subpar GPA (under 3.0) which also took 3 years. During this period I spent a lot of time traveling which I’m very thankful for. After that I took a gap year and did two marketing internships and some more traveling. Then I went for my bachelors for a degree in marketing from a college in NYC (a more fashion focused college). I wanted to go this school because they had a good marketing/business program, I liked the artistic side of the school since I do photography, it was an easy commute and affordable. It was also at this school that I fell in love with learning. I’m graduating this month with a 3.86 GPA. 

However, finding a job is very difficult right now. I had an internship lined up last year but fell through because of Covid. And now I’m just not sure what to do with my life. It sucks seeing all my friends have decent jobs and moving on with their life. I have had a very good part time job all while being in school which helps me survive, but it’s not at all a career. 
I want to get into a marketing agency or do marketing within the automotive industry. But lately I’ve just been thinking about learning coding and switching to that since it pays more. I’d want to learn coding now because I don’t have a full time job to distract me, and I have my part time job to keep me financially supported. I’ve been applying to marketing jobs and internships, but they don’t get back to me, and if they do it’s just a rejection. 

I feel like I wasted so much time not being career focus and just living for short term rewards. I feel like I jumped around a lot and took my time and now it’s biting me in the ass. I’m worried I won’t find a job in my career and if I do it won’t pay well. I feel like I’m doing the whole “keeping up with the Joneses” kinda deal. It’s such a weird, confusing age. 

I’m not sure what the point of me writing all this is, but I guess I just wanted to vent and see if anyone feels the same way or has any advice. I apologize if I kept jumping around, just wanted to get my thoughts into words."
ndpohw,16,2021-05-16,[University] Entrepreneurship in University (Which Uni to Choose?),ns_enlistee,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ndpohw/university_entrepreneurship_in_university_which/,"Hi Readers. 

I am a polytechnic grad from an IT/Engineering background. I have a very keen inclination towards entrepreneurship and I'm crystal clear that I would want to build a technology startup in the future.

I am posting this to seek advice from seniors and fellow students and facilitate some discussions about Entrepreneurship opportunities in Universities. 

I believe that no school can truly ""teach entrepreneurship"" and you will likely learn best by trying to build your own business. However, I trust that Universities in Singapore are providing great opportunities to aspiring entrepreneurs like myself.

Currently, I have 2 scholarship offers - an SUTD STEP Scholarship and an NUS Merit Scholarship.   
For SUTD, I have received an offer for their STEP Programme and these are the reason why I think SUTD is great for Entrepreneurship

* Design-Centric Curriculum (which I believe will make students more innovative and hands-on)
* Hands-On / Project Heavy Approach (which I trust would make students better at solving problems)
* (Close-Knitted) Builder Culture (creates a very innovative and exciting environment)
* Flagship 1-year global immersion programme in US (8 months) and China (4months)   
\[Guaranteed for STEP Students\]

For NUS, I have received an offer for the Information Systems programme and the following are reasons why I believe NUS is also ideal for Entrepreneurship

* Strong Reputation
* Strong Alumni Network
* NOC Programme (6 months - 1-year programme in various countries for students to intern in Startups)  
\[Not Guaranteed - and I believe location such as Silicon Valley are highly competitive\]
* Reputable Entrepreneurship Centre - NUS Enterprise is quite known to help grow NUS Startup ([https://tracxn.com/d/startups-by-alumni/national-university-of-singapore-(nus)-alumni](https://tracxn.com/d/startups-by-alumni/national-university-of-singapore-(nus)-alumni))

Overall, I believe both schools have their pros and cons. I am by no means looking for the ""perfect one"" because I am quite certain it's completely a matter of give and take - and what do one value more.

I would like to gather some feedback, advice and opinion of students regarding your understanding of both universities, which one would you pick and why?

Thanks for reading the long post, cheers mate.

TLDR; Would you pick NUS or SUTD for Entrepreneurship?"

I haven't done much related to CS in all that time until very recently, so I've been considering applying to a web dev bootcamp for summer. 

I'm considering it because

* I think it'll get my up to pace, or even get ahead in class (in some areas), while pursuing my degree
* I'll be in europe the whole summer on a visitor's visa so I can't find some work to do afaik, so I intend to do some form of formal studying while there
* It might provide the opportunity to work in tech/help acquire an internship, while I pursue my degree part-time when I return to the states
* I'd be far better equipped to pursue personal projects on the side than to go about those on my own
* cost is no factor

I think I'm overlooking something important about bootcamps as I'm still reading up on what people have to say on their value and what they offer, so I was hoping to get some thoughts here. Any advice would be much appreciated"

I am in my early twenties and have three credits left towards a bachelors degree in urban planning. As an undergraduate, I focused on more legal and social studies based classes because I wanted to focus on a career in community development, and housing in particular.

However, after multiple internships working in the field, I have come to the conclusion that this work is not for me. I work better with “things” rather than “people”, and simply do not have the emotional stamina to support others in difficult situations day in and day out.  I am looking for a way to change careers to something that suits me better and is more sustainable.

I have always been interested in science and technology but mistakenly thought I was too dumb to pursue it, as I did not get good grades in high school. (I have a average/good university GPA, however)  It is not financially viable for me to go to graduate school at the moment but I was wondering if there was still a way for me to make a career change soon.

I have some beginner-level python programming experience, as well as experience in R and ArcGIS from undergrad. I would say that I am able to complete small projects with these tools if I have clear instructions, but would not consider myself proficient enough to the point that I am employable. 

I am very interested in working in GIS because I find it interesting and liked using it in undergrad. It also seems to be a very stable career choice, which attracts me to it. 

I see a lot of GIS jobs also like to see experience in Python and SQL, so I am also interested in developing these skills.

I was wondering if anyone knew of resources to help me develop a higher level of proficiency in ArcGIS and Python, as well as to begin to learn SQL? In particular, I am interested in resources that would help me create projects to put in a portfolio or have some sort of certification at the end, as I feel like that would help keep me motivated to complete it and it might be helpful to be able to put something on a resume.

I am not opposed to paying for a course or program as long as it is helpful, high quality and relatively inexpensive. I think I may still have access to ArcGIS from my university as I am technically still a student. I have been thinking of receiving a two semester GIS certificate at a local community college as I knock out my last remaining credit requirement but would like to explore cheaper, more DIY options first, especially since I will be working full time. I am a bit frustrated looking for courses online because they seem to assume you are a complete beginner to coding and many don’t let you skip ahead. 


Would building a portfolio and brushing up on skills with online classes be able to help me get my foot in the door or am I better off getting the certificate at college or waiting until I can go to graduate school? 

Thank you in advance for any advice or suggestions!"

The year was hard as hell due to the pandemic and getting sick a lot, once even with covid but honestly I am much much luckier than most. I feel sick knowing I basically wasted Freshman year, I didn't do as well as I could. I'm taking a full load next semester but I'm worried that if an internship application needs my transcript after seeing freshman year I'll be instantly rejected. I had an awful professor for an essential class and failed it, but I'm retaking it over the summer with an equally awful professor who curves. I just feel so demotivated. I know I'm an awful student but the kicker is I was really getting better and doing well at the beginning of the semester. I'm wondering if I'll ever get that back.

Most of my coding experience comes from college projects, which I did last minute for the grade and they usually ended up alright and ""good enough"".
 I feel very anxious about not being good enough of a programmer and it interferes with any learning that I try to do. 

Everytime I sit down to code or learn something, my mind sounds an alert that I'm not doing enough or stuck on basics. I'm just looking for any advice on how to build my skills and not feel like all of the things above. Basically, getting over that stage of feeling like you're not doing enough. 

I have some experience with Java, basic web development (CSS,Vanilla JS), some c# and SQL. I recently got into python as well just because I wanted a fresh start with a language and learn it properly, build projects and stuff but it's the same thing. 

I have to apply for internships in a while but I have nothing to show for the work I have done and not to mention that online school hasn't been much of a help. 
I like programming and I have loved building most of the projects I have had so far and I really want to make a career out of this and I do feel like this is something I can be good at but I just need some direction to get out of this mess. 

Sorry if this sounds like a rant more than a question but any notes and help is appreciated. Try not to discourage if you can ( quit coding, do something else, or stuff like that). Thank you."
ne21vw,82,2021-05-16,Leave a Light on for Remus,alexdionisos,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ne21vw/leave_a_light_on_for_remus/,"If you've been active in the Disney fan base over the past year, you'd know that Disney has announced plans to rebrand Splash Mountain at Disneyland to a brand new attraction based on the film The Princess and the Frog. 

While this has been touted as a way to bring Tiana and therefore diversity to the parks, some of us, people like myself who have worked on the ride, had a feeling there was a different reason for the change. A much darker reason. 

If you didn't know, Splash Mountain is based on the 1946 film Song Of the South, which has effectively been banned by the Disney Corporation, despite being the source for Splash Mountain. 

While the film never got an official VHS release in the USA, it was released overseas. Since it never got a release here, the only way to watch it was in a Movie Theater, which only happened twice, on a foreign release, or a bootleg copy of the movie. 

One particular bootleg was smuggled in from Japan in 1990, the year after Splash Mountain opened, by a Cast Member named Remus George. Remus was on a trip with his school, when he smuggled the tape out of a small market, and was confronted by the owner for the theft. Eventually the owner decided to let Remus go with the tape, but without Remus's knowledge, put a curse on the tape. One which was designed to bring about the downfall of any thief. 

Upon returning to the US, Remus and two friends watched the tape in his dorm. One of those friends recalls that the film seemed to have an affect on Remus, and he could be heard whistling songs from the movie during his shifts at Disney the day after watching the tape. This was odd, since Remus had before been a very quiet individual, but his behavior changed even further. 

Remus worked in Fantasyland, usually at The Matterhorn. However, in the days after viewing the film, he would either leave his post early or skip his shifts all together. Whenever this happened, he would quickly be located at Splash Mountain, standing at the entrance, almost in a daze. He didn't seem to care about skipping work, but Disney certainly did. 

Not even a week after his behavior changed, Management had enough of his actions and fired him. Despite being fired, this still didn't change his obsession with Splash Mountain. He still stood by the entrance daily, yet never going on the ride. 

One day he actually managed to get on the ride, but was so overjoyed at the sight of the animatronic Song of the South characters, that he jumped out of his log and tried to join them on the bank. Unfortunately, he jumped out right when his log was going down one of the drops, and he was flung onto the bank at the bottom, killing him instantly. 

While Remus' death was ruled an accident, the two friends who had watched the movie with him had a feeling it had to do with that tape. After all, he had only started acting odd after watching it. They rewatched it, only this time the audio in the  Laughin Place segment was silent, and all that could be heard was a voice saying ""The thief has met his downfall"" over and over again, until the segment ended. The two left Disney shortly after.

All seemed back to normal, until 1992 when 25 year old Michael Nelson got off Splash Mountain claiming to have seen one of the Br'er Rabbit animatronics on the ride staring directly at him while singing ""How Do You Do? Mighty pleasant thieving! How do you do? Soon we'll be a-meetin!""

Michael was so unnerved by this he tried to leave the park, but was eventually found by the night crew in the Laughin Place section of the ride, lying on a fiberglass mushroom. He had taken his own life, while writing the word REMUS in his blood on the walls of the scene.

That wasn't the end. By the end of 1999, the ride's tenth anniversary, over 100 people had reported hearing disturbing cries of ""Remember Remus"" and disturbing laughter throughout the ride.

Park officials had no explanation for this phenomenon, other than to lie and tell the guests they had been hearing a test audio effect that had recently been installed. Eventually, a priest was called in to inspect the ride for spirits. 

The priest was so shaken by what he found that he ordered Disney close the ride immediately. There was something that no person should be exposed to on that ride, was his answer. Something not of this world. 

Disney obviously refused to close the ride, so the priest thought of a plan. Drawing a cross in holy water on a mushroom in the attraction, a light was ordered to be left on the mushroom at all times to keep the spirit at bay. 

This brings us to 2004, when I started working on Splash Mountain. The first night I was doing my walk through, my supervisor Tom told me the whole story of Remus and the light on the mushroom. I thought he was kidding. After all, workplace ghost stories aren't exactly rare. I figured this was just Tom pulling the new guy's leg. We were about to leave the Laughing Place section,when Tom called into the dark tunnel, ""I left a light on for you Remus"" He then turned to me and said, ""Always leave the light on for Remus"". 

I made pretty good on that promise, until about 2 years later, when for whatever reason, I forgot to leave Remus' light on. 
The next day, a child climbing out of his log slipped and got his foot caught between the log and shore, causing his foot to be ripped off when the log suddenly moved.

Every night after that, I made sure to leave the light on for Remus. Over the next few years, every now and again some intern or College Program student would forget, and an incident would always occur the following day:

Charles Davis fractured both his arms leaping out of a boat during an evacuation 

Dennis Johnson became hysterical and tried to climb off the ride, only to fall and be struck by an oncoming boat. 

Zoey Fannie managed to get off the ride vehicle and climb a fake tree, eventually falling and breaking her back.

By the time I left in 2011, I had either seen or heard of twenty seven incidents occurring on or around Splash Mountain. I can only imagine how many have occurred since then.

Of course as you know, Disneyland and Splash Mountain were closed for most of 2020 and early 2021 due to the pandemic. A group of higher ups who were aware of the curse did some research into paranormal activities. They found out about the connection between Remus and Song Of the South, and deduced that was what was dragging the ordeal out. 

Nobody knows when Disney will actually go through with removing the Song Of the South theme. It could be months, years, even decades. Until they do, I only hope that whatever Cast Member closes the ride leaves a light on for Remus."

I was wondering if you guys can help me out by reviewing my Background and Personal Statements, I really want to get into OMSCS and I am trying to get everything as good as I can get it. Every recommendation will be very appreciated! Thanks in advance :D

&amp;#x200B;

**Background Statement**

I graduated with a score of 94.18/100 from the University of Monterrey (UDEM) in Monterrey, Mexico with an Engineer in Computer Technologies Degree. I had the best grades of my class and the best capstone project of my class. In university some of my favorite subjects were Analysis and Design of Algorithms, there I analyzed time-space complexity of algorithms and learned how to optimize my programs, Operating Systems, where I programmed a Kernel simulation with thread interruptions, and Usability, where I co-authored a research paper involving the use of VR for CPR training, this paper is still pending acceptance for JCR Q1.

For my university’s senior capstone project I worked with a team of two other classmates to create predictive Machine Learning models for a microfinance company using data from the Mexican Credit Bureau and microcredit applications of 2019. The objective was to reduce the company’s loan giving risk, and improve response times. My contribution for the project was the data preprocessing and writing of the code for training Logistic Regression and Random Forest models. This project sparked my interest to pursue Machine Learning courses while working full time as a Software Developer.

Working at Crediclub as a Software Developer for the past year I’ve developed backend services for an automated microcredit giving website, and also created a pipeline for a machine learning credit assessment endpoint. Finally, I have taken a Machine Learning Engineer with Microsoft Azure course, where for the capstone project I used the Mexican government’s Covid-19 data and created a predictive model that calculates the probability that a patient enters an Intensive Care Unit based on their sex, age, comorbidities and lab test result. All this experience with Machine Learning has led to my desire to study in the OMSCS program because I want to strengthen my foundation in Computer Science and build my knowledge in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

&amp;#x200B;

**Personal Statement**

I am applying to the OMSCS program so that I can learn more in depth knowledge about Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning and apply that knowledge to my job functions and later pursue a research position in a university or a tech company.

I graduated with a score of 94.18/100 from the University of Monterrey (UDEM) in Monterrey, Mexico with a degree in Engineering in Computer Technologies. I had the best grades of my class and the best capstone project of my class.

While attending UDEM I did various projects for some of my CS classes. 

For the Operating Systems class I programmed a Kernel simulation with thread interruptions.

For the Usability class I co-authored a research paper involving the use of VR for CPR training, this paper is still pending acceptance for JCR Q1.

For the Analysis and Design of Algorithms class I analyzed time-space complexity of algorithms and learned how to optimize my programs.

Also, while attending UDEM I was for 1 year the president of the Student Council of the Program, here with a team I planned various events, including tutoring for various CS courses. As a student I interned at the company “Crediclub” for around 5 months working as a Software Engineer Intern before accepting a full-time Software Engineer position in the same company, while attending the final 2 semesters of university.

For my university’s senior capstone project I worked with a team of two other classmates to research predictive Machine Learning models for a microfinance company using data from the Mexican Credit Bureau of more than 297 individuals and microcredit applications of 2019. The objective was to reduce the company’s loan giving risk, and improve response times. The models analyzed were Logistic Regression and Random Forest, each one with variations using the Scikit-learn and XGBoost libraries. My contribution for the project was the data preprocessing and writing of the code for training for the 2 previously mentioned models.

After graduation, I still work full-time as a Software Engineer with “Crediclub”, here my job consists mainly of programming backend services in Microsoft Azure with languages such as SQL, Python, C#, but I have also done robotic process automation (RPA) work with C# and Java, and also I have done some Data Engineering for Machine Learning projects in the company.

Regarding to courses that I have taken, I finished the Machine Learning Engineer with Microsoft Azure from Udacity where for the capstone project I used the Mexican government’s Covid-19 data and created a predictive model that calculates the probability that a patient enters an Intensive Care Unit based on their sex, age, comorbidities and lab test result.

I want to enter into OMSCS because I am interested in transitioning my career from a Software Engineer to an AI Engineer/ ML Engineer, and by taking the Machine Learning specialization along with other courses related to Artificial Intelligence, Human-Computer Interaction, and Software Architecture and Design, I am sure that I can take my career to the next level.

I am sure that the experience and knowledge from my CS degree and my work experience makes me a great candidate for the OMSCS program.

&amp;#x200B;

**Career Objective**

My objective is to be an Industry Researcher in Machine Learning in a university or a tech company, pushing the field forward with new discoveries."

nebycz,2,2021-05-17,Parents are overprotective and worried about COVID,woahuwugang,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/nebycz/parents_are_overprotective_and_worried_about_covid/,"Hi y'all,

I need some advice please. I've been basically living in the garage for almost a year now with my parents. At the beginning of the pandemic, my parents wanted my older brother to tell them exactly where he was going and shower immediately when he comes back. My brother refused and arguments broke out. The family relationship wasn't well to begin with because of trauma from childhood and since both my parents and my brother are stubborn, my dad ended up forcing both my mom and I to live in the garage. When this first happened, I agreed to it because of threats they gave me. Now, I feel that I'm at my breaking point.

When it comes to COVID, my dad is on the extreme side of things. Besides from wearing latex gloves and double masks when he goes out (nothing wrong with that), he also restricts where I go too. I'm not allowed to go anywhere near my brother because he ""might've caught the coronavirus."" I'm not allowed to go walk on the trail behind my house because I might catch COVID in the air. I'm not allowed to eat anything from outside because I might catch COVID that way too. I'm not allowed to get the mail either and everything has to be put outside under the sun for at least a day before we can touch it. He wipes down everything with baby wipes and sprays everything that comes home with alcohol. I'm told to immediately shower when I come home (from the research group at school), even though I have class in literally &lt;5 mins. My mom is not allowed to go out either and he would be the one who is buying all the groceries. I mean getting the groceries is fine, but he refuses to get food from certain places such as Asian markets. The experience living at the garage sucks even more because the food is so unappetizing and plain. I feel so isolated and restricted. While I find their concerns about COVID to be valid, I just want a room to myself and have my own privacy. Whenever I brought all these things up, my parents would claim that they're doing it for my own good and to hold it in for another \_\_\_\_\_ month. I'd also like to mention that they are worried about the COVID 19 vaccines. They're not anti vaxx since I've gotten all of my vaccines before, but they do not want me to get the COVID 19 vaccines until things settle down. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHEN THE HELL THAT'LL BE.

Fast forward to this week. I need to go to a university that's like an hour away from where I live because the research group is visiting their lab. Now, because the professor doesn't know when the group would be leaving because we might end up leaving in the evening, noon, afternoon, who knows! I thought it would be a good idea to carpool so that it wouldn't be a problem, (I don't drive yet, I'm planning to get my permit soon) so that I won't have to keep on thinking about having to update my dad during the day instead of focusing on the research project.

This became an issue. I first told them that I was considering carpooling. My mom began to guilt trip me by saying ""if you do this, and we leave you..."" and similar things. I do admit, when she said that, I snapped. I pointed out she was threatening me over something so small and that they couldn't figure out the issue with my brother so they're putting pressure on me. She immediately called me ungrateful and that if I do decide to carpool, I'm ruining my own future. The next day, my parents were talking about this since I haven't asked my dad yet. My mom said that my dad is talking about selling the house and that I would have to live with one of my friends. This is not the first time they've used this as an argument to try to prevent either my brother and I to do something they don't like. They've said things related to divorce, selling the house, etc. If I carpool, they said that I will have to move everything I have in the garage to the house in a day, since I will be going in 1 day. I would also have to clean the entire house in the front since my brother hasn't been cleaning at all. 

Now, I'm not sure what I should do. I need some advice for this situation. I'm not sure if I should just take the ride with my dad and just avoid the argument or if I should carpool. I'm probably going to go to the house during the summer anyways, because it is way too hot during the summer in the garage. I have an internship and I need a workspace where I can complete everything. I'm not sure if I should just rebel and just carpool. I feel like I've been stuck for almost a year doing whatever they wanted me to do. Whenever I bring up my feelings, they would tell me to consider their feelings instead and see their perspective. That literally doesn't make me feel any better and makes me feel even more isolated. I've been crying over the past few days because I feel so stressed out from school and family situation. This is not the first time this has happened ever since I moved to the garage. It feels like I can never fulfill what they want. The option they gave is literally to just stay inside for another year before I transfer out for school. If they have at least talked to me nicely about it and giving me an option, I would feel more comfortable. But I feel like I'm just always going to be under their control, if I just follow whatever they want from me. PLEASE HELP ME. Any advice would help"

“One of these days someone is going to slip through the nets if administration doesn’t up their strength” an officer had exclaimed near the entrance just this morning. Hunak could do nothing but exhale through his mandibles and shake his eyestalks in agreement.

It had only been five days since the first run on the banks, but the Human situation already occupied all of Hunak’s professional attention. He entered his office from the lift and tapped a floor panel with a claw on his forefoot twice in quick repetition. The wall across from him became a vidscreen. It was playing a news report on the Economy and Good Governance channel.

“Despite the protests of the Minister of the Economy the markets have spoken. Galactic credit ratings are falling like stones, while the value of the Human currency continues to rise. Economists are stumped, and with reports like the one submitted by the opposition party to the central bank this morning, the government may have no choice but to…” Hunak tapped the floor again and the vidscreen closed abruptly.

He sighed and hesitated before risking a look at his portfolio. He closed it just as quickly as the news vid. He did not bother opening the account for his retirement fund. Just as soon as these Humans had appeared on the galactic stage they had been eager to open their markets. And as soon as they had the galactic market had reeled so sharply that the reverberations were still shaking the economy to its foundations. Hunak wished he could speak with one of those damnable bipeds at the Human Central Bank and get a clearer first hand picture of what exactly was wrong with their markets. It was the most researched topic in the galaxy currently but despite that nobody seemed to have the faintest idea how the Human economy actually worked.

Hunak jumped a few channels to Foreign Affairs and was stunned to see what appeared to be an Ookrov riot. Throngs of those gangly aliens were forming into a mob. Protestors shouted catchy anti-human slogans while a group ahead of them dressed all in black stormed the doors to the Ookrov Central Bank. Riot police lobbed canisters of teargas and beat at protesters with batons held in all four arms. The chyron read, “Ookrov States halt superluminal trading, disconnect ansibles.”

“It’s all such a chaotic nightmare” Criida said from outside Hunak’s door. 

Hunak startled slightly to see the intern so suddenly outside his office. He hurriedly dusted off his shell and gestured back towards the vidscreen which was still playing images of that ghastly scene on Ookrov Prime.

“And it’s all for what?” Hunak said, “The Ookrovs must realize that until the bond situation in Human space calms down halting interplanetary trading won’t fix the problem. They’re putting gauze on a split shell.” He shook his eyestalks and huffed out through his mandibles. 

The Ookrov government clearly had no idea how to fix the problem, but then again neither did his own.

“Human messaging on the subject is as inconsistent and confused as ever.” Criida said while she straightened out rocks on the periphery of Hunak’s office floor. 

She chittered in frustration and suddenly seemed to snap back to the present, “I am also here to inform you that your request for a meeting with the interior minister of the Human Central Bank was declined.” Hunak glowered at the predictable rejection but Criida was not done talking, “However, I managed to snag you a different meeting through a back channel. The good news is it’s with one of their larger private lenders and they’re even paying for the ansible time. The bad news is that it is scheduled five standard minutes from now.” 

Criida patted her shell apologetically, “I know you haven’t been checking your private feeds. I ran here as fast as I could”

&amp;#x200B;
*“Then why are we making small talk about Ookrovs”* Hunak began to say, but he caught the thought in his throat before speaking it. 

He made the gesture for deep appreciation in one claw. The gesture for please leave my office with another. A third claw made an inappropriate gesture behind his shell. A fourth began clearing his floor hurriedly to tidy up as fast as possible. 

As Criida left, Hunak cleared rocks from his floor, smoothed the sand under his claws and dimmed the windows to a pleasing hue. He knew Humans were not accustomed to his species. One had once remarked to him that offices in Hunak’s species looked more like “Zen gardens” than places of work. Hunak had later looked up a picture of one of those gardens and he agreed readily enough. They were charming. He had not spoken his thoughts that Human offices looked more like morgues.

The human who appeared on the vidscreen was identified by AI narration as middle aged, male and dressed in formal wear. The AI added discreetly that he was starting to lose his hair. He sat in one of those incredibly uncomfortable looking Human chairs seated behind a large wooden desk. 

Hunak rattled his back mouthparts to make the Human throat clearing sound, “You must be Jung-in Park, from Deutschbank”

The Human smiled, “Richard Park actually. You may have an outdated form, though it is of no concern. And you must be...” 

And truly the Human tried his absolute best. Though the sound that left his mouth resembled nothing close to Hunak’s full name. Hunak was amused to find the Human banker even tried to do the clicks that other species couldn’t really ever make properly.

Hunak’s species could not physically smile but he relaxed his shoulders, “My turn for corrections, you can simply call me Hunak. Thank you for your courtesy.” 

He and the Human exchanged formalities a bit longer and then got into the more technical details. Above all Hunak hoped this call could finally clear up some of the confusion. But as the conversation began to unroll Hunak’s hopes flagged.

The Humans just had so many incomprehensible buzzwords. Mr. Park had started with an explanation of Humanity’s general economic outlook. He panned through slides of the various assorted projections and future outlook indexes for their nations and off-world trading companies. But nothing he was saying lined up. The market fluctuations had strongly implied that the Humans possessed economic strength far above what had been projected, but Mr. Park’s slides seemed to mostly match those original projections. The markets were treating Humanity’s economic outlook as vastly better than it seemed to be. 

Then Mr. Park said something that made Hunak’s shell feel brittle.

“The Human Central Bank released a report today stating that Galactic currencies are seriously undervalued given economic expectations. Some have argued it might deliberate currency manipulation, but the HCB believes it is a clear sign of hyperinflation.”

“Stop” Hunak said. “A clear sign of what?*”* 

The human looked startled. AI narration agreed that he was.

“Well, any currency is subject to both inflationary and deflationary forces. The amount of currency in circulation affects this value. In a situation where a monetary supply is rapidly increased a currency may become debased, and undergo rapid devaluation over time that we term hyperinflation.”

Hunak nearly choked. The sound brought the Human’s explanation to a halt. 

Hunak gathered his thoughts. “I don’t understand. Why would Humanity’s sense of their currency’s value rise so quickly? What prevents Human currency from conforming to its objective standard value under current conditions?”

Now it was the Human's turn to look puzzled, “Conforming to it’s what?” The banker cleared his throat over the protest noises coming from the back of Hunak’s throat.

Hunak recalled the first paragraph of Economics 101, ""Any sapient species possesses a sense of objective standard value. This allows accurate pricing of goods, and allows a species to agree on a set value for its currency and assets. These values may change based on conditions, but the whole species necessarily agrees on them. It's a basic law of biology as well as economics""

Now the Human looked positively shocked. He accidently launched a pen he had been fidgeting with off his desk. 

After a false start he cleared his throat, “It’s not a matter of current conditions, *Human currency is purely fiat. Its value is a reflection of public faith that it has value*."" 

That statement might as well have been a plasma torch held to Hunak's beloved economics textbooks. ""The current central bank is attempting a ninth round of quantitative easing that involves the purchase of government issued bonds. We are attempting to increase the relative level of inflation to minimize the negative effects of our current market volatility on the galactic markets. It has come to our attention only recently that such acts of monetary policy do not, er, exist in other galactic economies.” 

The Human straightened his tie, ""Though I personally had not been informed about this concept of objective standard value""

Hunak was sure that his shell was now a shade paler. No matter that such a change required many days. He dared to ask the question that had been forming behind his mandibles. 

“The Human race has no sense of objective standard value?”

“Correct” the human banker stated bluntly. “And because it never occurred to us that such a thing could exist, I suppose we never bothered to ask. We may have done less than what was required to limit the effects of our market speculation on the galaxy. It did not occur to us that our economy would be the only one with the possibly of a limitless rate of growth. If what you've told me is true, compared to your currencies the potential value of ours is essentially infinite. It will likely require a major reorganization of the economy to put a stop to these fluctuations.” 

The Human now also looked pale. “While we will all likely come out ahead, it could still take decades for this approaching recession to end. And it hasn’t yet been officially declared.”

Hunak gathered his thoughts. He calmly flexed his legs. He dislodged the mandible in the back of his mouth that he had nearly choked on in shock. The ramifications were enormous. A species that lacked a sense of objective standard value could price its assets at arbitrary amounts. Its currency could wildly fluctuate. Interest rates could be made artificially low or high. Canny Human traders who realized galactic economies could not do these things could take advantage of them. Galactics who realized they lacked the ability would overvalue Human economic power. Which would of course devalue galactic currencies. Objective standard value wasn't fixed, it could drop when a species collectively realized it was being outcompeted. Which was already happening. 

Hunak thought back to the Ookrovs, and then to what Mr. Park had said. Hyperinflation. It was a realization so simple but so impossible Hunak shuddered. 

Their economy was not limited by biology. Humans were not constrained by the most basic economic force in the galaxy.

Hunak took many deep breaths. “Thank you Mr. Park. It has been a pleasure but I’m afraid I must cut this meeting short. I hope you understand.” The Human banker nodded politely and the vidcall ended. 

Hunak yelled for a full five minutes. A sound like coins being thrown into a frying pan reverberated around his office.

What could he do? His species couldn’t just abandon their biologically fixed assessment of value. They couldn’t compete. Human traders would wreak havoc on galactic markets unopposed. Nothing their central bank did would abate their inherent advantage. Hunak instructed his AI to divest from the market but knew there was little point. After pacing around his office he sent his supervisor his resignation. He carefully arranged the rocks in his office and groomed the sandy floors to perfection. Like the black sand beaches of his birth. He stepped out of his office and tapped the wall to call the lift. He spoke the command.

I delayed applying to college due to the pandemic and would like to apply this fall. I'm looking for some advice on which colleges I should target. I'm concerned due to by problematic upbringing. My parents are not educated and could not really bring me up as most people are brought up. I studied in an indian state board school due to financial constraints, I did not have access to AP, or clubs, or anything really.

**Demographics**: Indian, Male, grew up in a low class household with uneducated parents.

**Intended Major**: Computer Science

**GPA**: Not exactly sure about GPA but I got a 92% in 10th grade board finals and 96% in 12th grade board finals

**ECs**: I started self learning CS in the august of 2019. So far, I've worked with multiple programming languages and tech stacks, worked in 2 startups as a software engineering intern, and made several projects that have gained somewhat decent traction on github. More importantly, I've explored my passion in computer science and understood exactly which parts of it I enjoy, and want to pursue research in. Apart from that, I've also been sent to almost every competition my school participated in (mostly local, state-wide), to represent my school, throughout my middle and high school life. I've won a few of these for my school.

**SAT**: 1460, plan to retake and target a 1510+

**LORS**: My math and science teachers would love to write me LoRs. I also have an LoR from the CTO of a startup I've worked at as a software engineering intern.

Are there any genuinely good CS research focused universities that I've a chance in? I'm particularly interested in compiler design, computational type systems and performance analysis research. I've done some work to prove my passion in these fields and I'd love to share them with the university I'd be applying to. But I don't think I can just drop a github link in an application letter."

I know I royally messed up, and regardless of if I get fired or not, just wanna own up to the mistake and grow from it. 

Hello, I’m really in need of some advice. 

I really messed up and told my coworker/mentor during our scrums that I was making progress on a small function/class that needed to be added before we started testing the entire app. It honestly could have been done in a day or two by my mentor but I extended the story points by 5 days since I’m very inexperienced. (This is my very first SWE job, 5 months in, no internship, no experience with Java at all but was expected to learn it immediately, which I was initially fine with) 

But I ended up getting completely lost with how to even build and run the project as I wasn’t used to the build system and was missing all these other dependencies. On top of that, I spent too much time trying to understand the existing code and Java. 

I was coding features prior to this project in C++ without too much struggle (still taking a lot of time but to ensure my code is properly reviewed), so I thought after getting that experience with a lot of good feedback, I could transfer over to this without too much worry but I feel even more confused.

And now my mentor/team thinks I’m done with my task when I’m not and I’m not sure how to bring it up. I understand I’m now setting back the progress and I feel extremely guilty. I should have asked for as much help as I could, but I kept pushing it back until days past and felt I still couldn’t ask for help. Additionally, I possibly feel I’m not as motivated as I should be. It’s hard to be productive when I can’t figure anything out and I’ve been dealing with a lot of anxiety from all of this. (Sounds very common of this sub but I’m also part of the club that thinks that I’m maybe not cut out for SWE) 

I was planning on telling the truth tomorrow about the progress and hoping to get advice from both my boss and mentor on how to better prioritize my tasks, since I’m still going over the estimates a lot. But I’m not sure how to bring up the part about being unmotivated and my personal issues with anxiety."

Here is the sixty-fourth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

I was trying really hard to find a job since the beginning of my Masters. I was not able to land an internship. But I got to work on a really interesting project with a professor at my school. I worked on it for 8 months and was able to resolve one of the major problems of their product. It reduced the operational cost by 40%, removed dependency on external software which was charging money. Along with that, I was able to interface a UI over the web (like being able to interact with a VM using a GUI). There were a lot of other components in the project which involved pricing strategies, application monitoring and he even wanted a conversational AI for the users.

I took a judgment call in developing the infrastructure of the product before adding the other features. The professor wanted me to continue working on the product even in my final semester. But due to health issues and the need to find full-time employment weighed heavily on my mind, so I declined.

I used to frequent this subreddit and saw people post getting jobs after applying to 700+ companies. On the other hand, I did not even apply to 200 companies. I applied using referrals and still was not considered for an interview. This all affected my mental health which caused me to stop applying altogether.

One of the hiring managers from the big tech saw my profile on LinkedIn, was interested in me, and set up an interview with me. Long story short after 5 rounds of interviews. 

The great thing is that I will be working with a team that is trying to build a similar product but at a much larger scale, and involving physical machines as well. 

Also due to my experience, instead of offering me a new grad offer, they bumped me to a higher level.

I having trouble thinking about whether I am good enough, could I have done better, Was I just lucky in landing this job.

What are some tips the senior developers would give someone starting out new?

Also, do I need to work with the professor again to complete the unfinished components?  i don't think he would be vindictive, but is there a possibility of me losing this job because I did not finish everything that was asked of me ?

TLDR: I found a great job in one of the big tech companies on the basis of an interesting project I did as a Research Assistant. Dealing with imposter syndrome and feeling of inadequacy."

I'm not sure where exactly to post as they are general-ish questions.

Finally finished up my last semester of gen ed classes and pre-reqs (?) to finally begin taking classes for my CS major! Whoo hoo! The only issue is: *I never really thought of what's next*. I'm very much an in the moment person rather vs a 5 year plan sort of person but I guess I should have some sort of rough plan! I also decided to go back to college after taking a few years off to work so I never really got to give my education much thought.

I figured over the summer I'd begin to teach myself the basics to prepare for my first CS class but after looking in a few threads, I have no idea where to start.

Anywho, I have a few questions and I am hoping to get a bit of advice or guidance from here! TIA

1.**Where the hell do I start?** I have absolutely 0 coding knowdlege. (I've dabbled in it many years ago but not enough to actually retain any knowledge) Should I start with codeacademy or should I learn the basic fundamentals? Where should I learn that? There's so many choices that I'm getting decision paralysis. Not to mention, I got very lost and confused when I hear the words frameworks, etc.

2. **Internships and are they necessary?** I live in CA (not a major city though) and I wouldn't be against internships, but I don't know if I can just uproot for a few months as I have to work, I live with my s/o and have things I need to stay home for... like my cat lol. Is it possible to find an internship that I can do remotely or is it something I'm going to have to consider?

3. Should I figure out what I want to do first before starting or is it okay to dabble in everything? I'm leaning toward software engineering front end, but back end interests me as well! Do these determine the languages I should learn?

4. Should I wait to work on personal projects until after I learn a decent amount? I don't want to give myself tunnel vision by teaching myself only what I need to know for a project I have in mind but I also have

I'm sure I'll have more questions in the future but for now this is what I have written down"

Up until last night, I had never fully grappled with the idea that my academic career was coming to a close. I feel that many, especially during this pandemic and through virtual learning, have been trying to focus on our degrees and classes in a manner that distracts us from ever having to acknowledge the fact that we're actively missing out on so much along the way to the finish line. 

I have personally never posted on this sub, but I have been passively observing the comments of others over the prior months and years. As a sophomore year transfer student, my time at RU (physically) was brief, but important. While I too used, my immersion into academic work as a pseudo-distraction, it's equally important that we use the time we have now to reflect thoughtfully, and express how we genuinely feel for the sake of others, as well as for our own mental well-being, now that our journey has come to an abrupt end.

So, I have decided to share some of my ""lessons"", to hopefully encourage those who will have an opportunity to physically engage with RU in the near future, to make the most of their oh so limited time. 

1. **Focus on your Social Life:** Your classes are priority #1, and there's no denying that. Ultimately, we're at RU to prepare us for the next stage of our life, meaning that our performance in the classroom certainly matters. However, focusing on your school work too heavily, will leave you isolated. Trust me. As somebody who just graduated *Summa Cum Laude*, my biggest regret was constantly making excuses as to why I *only* had time for my school work. Yes, my GPA probably helped me to get interviews with various companies, and ultimately land a job, but you know what? 99% of my talks with recruiters revolved around explaining my experiences; internships, extracurriculars, meaningful collegiate endeavors, etc. Your grades definitely matter, but for most jobs and occupations, they aren't what will land you a job. Join clubs, club sport teams, build genuine relationships with professors, go out on that Thursday night. In the end, it is what your time at RU is all about. Focus on the entire pie rather than just that single slice.  Like me, you'll regret leaving here if you don't embrace everything RU has to offer, even if it means you have to dig to find it.
2. **Do the Things that Make you ""Uncomfortable"":** It's really easy in college to become entrenched within a routine. wake up, quick breakfast, wait at the bus stop for 20 minutes, stand squished next to 500 other students while on the bus, find your class building, sit in lecture, repeat steps 2 &amp; 3 about 3 more times, get lunch at some point, eventually make it back to your dorm/apartment, have dinner (maybe?), rinse and repeat. There's comfort in routine and repetitiveness. The monotony doesn't seem so bad when it's leading to ""success"", right? But if you're getting A's on exams when operating in this manner, are your genuinely leading a successful life? Similarly to how GDP isn't a strong indicator of a country's success for the sake of serving each and every individual properly, receiving A's on your transcript doesn't mean that you're doing what's best for yourself, with regards to all facets of life. So, get ""comfortable being uncomfortable"". Do the things you aren't sure will fit into your schedule...trust me, they will. Humans, and especially college students are constantly forced to adapt to unexpected circumstance, which means that it's not a matter of ""if you have the time"", but *will you* make the time. This obviously relates back to my first point, but your social life and extracurriculars shouldn't be perceived as ""extra"", instead they are essential, in the same way spontaneity and flexibility are when cultivating a meaningful college experience.  
3. **Take a Deep Breath &amp; Enjoy the Micro-Interactions:** As students, we are systematically programmed to constantly operate with chronic foresight. This means always looking ahead, rarely enjoying the current moment, and certainly not reflecting on the past. However, with each new respective phase of life, I find myself idealizing the future, yearning for the past, and never enjoying the present. The problem with this is inevitably, our present becomes our past, whether we want it to or not. And, what will stand out above all else, are the random and seemingly obsolete past moments. Sitting at a dining hall table with a few friends, that time a buddy made you spit out your drink with a hilarious comment that then becomes an inside joke, a couple of mental screenshots from that ""crazy night"" last weekend, heck, even walking along College Ave on a spring afternoon. Our ""memories"" only exist, because whether we're aware of it our not, they represent something valuable, and often, they're unsuspecting. So enjoy these moments, no matter how insignificant they might seem, before they become memories. 

To the rest of my class of '21 graduates, I know this was a less than ideal way to wrap up our time at RU, but be thankful for some of the times, memories, and friendships that you did make, because it's better to have experienced some joy along this journey, than to leave with nothing at all. 

Thanks"

Buckle up, long story.",Powcakes411,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/neqs3h/not_sure_how_much_longer_i_can_keep_up_buckle_up/,"I currently work for a small rural community bank as the IT Security Analyst and have been for a little over a year. ***(Sorry for the length of this post).***

Here is some backstory:

Small IT team of three people. I was brought on as an Intern in summer 2019 to push about 150 workstations from Windows 7 to Windows 10 and be application support. At this time I had just completed my associates degree in Computer Networking Security and continuing my IT bachelors degree. I also have A+, Security+, Network+, and CCNA certifications at that time as well. 

I was intuitive enough to build a base Win10 image with bank applications on it and pushed it out with an open source PXE boot deployment system with 0 experience. They saw extreme value in what I did as I saved the banks butt from the next FDIC audit for having out of date operating systems and software on some servers. They decided to offer me a full time position when the current IT Security Analyst was going to retire (gentlemen with 40+ years experience). I even came back over winter break 2019 to help them get some time off over the holidays.

Of course I was continuing my education as a junior and 2020 came around and hit like a truck. Just like other rural businesses, the pandemic was a very rocky transition for the IT team and wanted me to come help out. I gladly accepted to come back full time so I could get some money rolling in and there aren't many other places close (within 30 minutes of home) that was hiring for what I wanted to do. 

All university classes moved online and all dorms closed ( I was an assistant housing coordinator for the university so I had to make sure everyone got out of the dorm as well as get my own stuff out of my dorm apartment ) Myself and my Fiancée (now wife!) fortunately was closing on a home and was receiving the keys to it the weekend of the start of pandemic so I didn't have to move in with my mother again (YAY). We had lots of trouble finding basic necessities (LIKE TOILET PAPER) since we had almost 0 of anything going into our home.

The guy I was replacing who is about 70 years old and was very susceptible to the virus worked from home from March to May. He came back into the bank and traveled nowhere else and we shared the same office. He was teaching me the ropes of all the systems and devices that I would have to manage. Taught me everything he knew to the point where he was just playing solitaire while I did everything. He even gave me life advice about the industry and told me to always watch my back and keep learning. The field is growing too fast and he no longer wanted to keep up with it nor had the patience to. He thought I was satisfactory for the bank and dropped a one week notice of retirement after being in the office for 2 weeks. He is now happily drinking bourbon and playing golf just how he likes it. 

**But his last years were real lazy as he was fed up with the formalities**

I had learned a lot from him, but the network got real messy, other systems I did not know about were **years** out of date and he just ignored them. To much of a hassle. He was at the bank for 5 years and knew he was finishing his career. But he handled things and paid attention when stuff started to become noticeable. Again, he was a great guy and a great person to learn life experience from. **I had A LOT of cleanup to do.** 

***Today***, I primarily maintain bank network configuration / disaster recovery / VOIP systems / IPS/IDS reporting / solutions implementation / group policy design and implementation / firewall policy adjustments / IP Camera Maintenance / Storage server maintenance / Backup maintenance and implementation / **the usual security stuff I like doing.**

I also help out with end user support / maintaining end-user tickets / printer administration / application problems / mail courier / mail postage / I moved furniture for weeks during a remodel process / general maintenance / other ***little*** **miscellaneous things that run me up a wall.**

When I was first hired on full-time spring 2020 I was doing the things in my job description and I was happy and had a wonderful, full, manageable workload. I started needing to pickup more support calls when the end-user support guy went on lunch / had to work on physical issues away from his desk / leaves early to go coach ball games. 

By the way he is a great co-worker and friend with a lot going on right now, things might get a little better when ball season is over but doing everything I do and keeping up with closed-sourced outsourced software **is a pain.**

Mail got pushed onto the IT staff (Just myself and the end-user support guy) so some mornings and afternoons during the week I have to spend 1-2 hours moving mail and posting it to send it to the post office. Moving inter-departmental mail between branch locations up to an hour away from HQ.

My boss (The IT Manager) volunteered us to maintain support tickets for maintenance related items like restrooms and water leaks and other stuff.

***I am just so tired keeping up.***

The guy before me didn't do this stuff, so why do I? **I'm young and fresh and exploitable.**

Working around 50-60 even up to 70 hours a week (I'm also salary) and doing online school 10-15 hours a week. I had trouble finding time to breathe and eat, let alone having a social life, spending time with family, and having a minute with myself to think and relax. Planning a wedding last year was a nightmare, but when the day came I was so happy. I've been getting about 2-4 hours of sleep a night for the past 6-7 months.

I finally graduated with respectable A's couple weeks ago. I have never felt so relieved to not have to write several papers a week and have some time for myself. I am still catching up on sleep but not near rested or well rested. 

***I don't hate my job, but I don't like it either.***

I make median wage for my experience / location / age (I'm 23 with about 1 year full-time IT experience with a couple years of on/off IT related work elsewhere) But my predecessor made about 2.5x more than I do and I have done way more and have shown lots of improvement to our core systems and have results for it which I have shown my superiors and board members things my predecessor would never of done. I am putting in 3 times the work than my predecessor ever did. 

**But its not enough it seems.** 

I do not want to be a general IT manager (especially here, its to long gone with how my boss has just kept grabbing responsibilities left and right. Literally the lead-maintenance guy and vendor manager for maintenance related tasks. He is literally **invaluable** and **irreplaceable.**

I would like to do something security related in cloud and virtual environments. My problem is if I leave this position I have *nowhere* else to go right now as jobs in the area want 3-5 years related IT experience. It appears I have to just hold out until the opportunity arises for me.

I will probably in the near future (I need a little break from university) go and get my masters degree, not sure the best degree to get for the future I want.

Any comments or feedback would be appreciated. Not sure my best steps to lead a happy, balanced career life. 

***Not sure how much longer I can take it before I mentally break.***

**TL;DR: I am young and wore out of doing things outside my job description and am working way harder than the person before me, making just decent money for what I have going on right now, knowing I want something more but not knowing how to approach it.**"
ner4as,2,2021-05-17,LinkedIn connections,sbsbsbsvsv,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ner4as/linkedin_connections/,"I've been stalking a bunch of CompSci students from different universities on LinkedIn. I noticed a ton of them have 500+ LinkedIn connections. Those who don't have that many have 100+ connections at the bare minimum. I could only find a small handful of people with fully fleshed out LinkedIn profiles that have less than 100 connections.

So to all you CompSci students here with 100+ LinkedIn connections, I've got to ask - HOW? 

If you added your friends, family, and co-workers from internships as connections, I could see you maybe having 50 connections at max. Even if you did intern at a large company like Google, I highly doubt you'd interact with every other intern and full-time employee there to add them all as a connection on LinkedIn (assuming they have a LinkedIn account). You'd probably only add your managers and people you work with closely as a connection.

I can't wrap my head around how some of you have 100+ LinkedIn connections (and ESPECIALLY 500+ connections). Enlighten me on how you do it please."

The position was an internship in front end development. 

""Thank you for following up on your interest in CompanyName!  We appreciated the opportunity to discuss your unique talents and how they align with the opportunities for employment here.  We were all impressed with your background and experience and we thank you for taking the time both to speak with us and to go through our recruitment process.

Although your talents are impressive, upon further review the team was unable to select you as an ideal fit for the position based on our current needs. To be candid, we felt as though you had good skills and personality, but that you might be more comfortable in a corporate setting in the future.

As one of the leaders within our industry, we receive many qualified applicants.  We consider you to be among the best and we are sorry that there is not currently an opportunity here for you.  

I was very impressed with you both as a person and as an applicant, and I wish you the best in your career pursuits.""

I honestly don't what ""corporate"" means in this context. For what it's worth, I thought the interview went incredibly well with at least 2/3 managers. The last one I felt was neutral but maybe I was wrong. 

Have you had any jobs deny you over a description like this?"

nes4z0,1,2021-05-17,Should I take the offer for a job I'm unqualified for?,Parapurp,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/nes4z0/should_i_take_the_offer_for_a_job_im_unqualified/," I recently graduated college a few weeks ago. I've been looking for a job in my down time since September 2020. I was able to secure a job offer from a pretty big/ well known company, as a software engineer.

Here's the problem. I'm not very good at coding and I really don't code at all if I don't have to. Earlier in college, I tried to be a computer science major. During that time, I took some introductory programming courses earlier in college, two of which I failed.

After going through rough mental health patches trying to stay in Comp Sci, I decided UX/UI design would be a much better fit for me. I switched to something related to computer science, that involved game design/ development, animation and a little coding. I even struggled through those coding classes. I've been trying to get a UX job, but that requires a lot of knowledge I didn't learn in school and a portfolio I'm still working on.

I had an internship as a programmer/ analyst in 2019 that I know helped me get this job. While I got good reviews at the end, I could tell throughout the time that my manager at that job was expecting me to be better at coding than I was, and to know more than I did. Eventually he picked up on my lack of skill and gave me assignments that focused more on web design than development. There was no bad blood but I didn't get a return offer.

So when I was contacted about this job, I was reluctant to do every interview at every stage, but I went through with it because I didn't want to regret it later. I just talked about my relevant experiences but I got along with the interviewers. And now I've been offered a position.

I'm afraid of accepting because I think I would be an impostor. I've never built software and I largely would not know what I'm doing. I'm considering learning as much as I can, but I doubt I could get anywhere near the level of the other engineers I'll be working with. I'm also just not very passionate about programming either - my goal is to be an experience designer. I'm considering taking this job and eventually pivoting into the field I want, because I know the first job is the hardest to get.

Is it better to just take any job while you can get it, even if you aren't very qualified? Or should I decline a job I don't think I'll be good at? I don't want to tarnish my reputation by being incompetent."

net5tl,4,2021-05-17,Is my progress average or better?,supremeblack,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/net5tl/is_my_progress_average_or_better/,"I've graduated back in January and since last December I've got interested in frontend development so spent all my time self teaching myself about basic web development technologies (JS, HTML, CSS, React). I've mamaged to create a few cool projects and published on my github. During my time as a student we only learnt backend technologies..

Two months ago I've got a frontend dev job at a local company with fairly good salary. We are working on a really huge web application which is used by clients all over the world (US, Europe mostly). It has 60-70 repositories in our bitbucket just for this app.

The first few weeks was hard to get use to the code base and building methods, dependencies etc. I had to ask a lot and my code reviews always had a lot of issues. But now I can work on my own with only asking a few times a day. I am doing tickets on my own and I can finally understand the whole pipeline.

My boss gave me a feedback last week that I improved and learnt a lot and he is satisfied with me and after the 3 months trial period my salary would be increased a bit.

Does this mean I am doing it well and don't have to fear of getting fired after the trial period? I'm asking this because I don't have much confidence and self-esteem..

What is the average learning curve for junior devs? Although I've already worked during school as an intern but it was backend and C# only so I'm not truly a junior dev but junior in frontend stuff.

Edit: my daily tasks are usually: implementing new features, fixing bugs and writing unit/app tests."
net880,2,2021-05-17,"I wasn’t ready for uni and I regret going this soon. Now I am depressed (20F, London).",FunFaithlessness2367,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/net880/i_wasnt_ready_for_uni_and_i_regret_going_this/,"I have been depressed for the past 3 years which coincides precisely with the beginning of my studies at uni.

When I was in high school in France, I was a high-achiever. However, being a high achiever in France is very different from being a high achiever in the UK (or US). Because school hours are really long in France, there is no room for extra-curricular activities and, frankly, no one cares about them. 

For background info, I went to a bilingual French/English school which sent most of their students abroad. I thought it would be an enriching experience since I wanted to go to a prestigious institution while doing a degree I really liked (instead of doing a prépa i.e. intense preparatory courses to business schools in my case). I think didn’t get advised well since I ended up applying for a Bsc Management degree (when I knew I wanted to do a business related masters later on, so no need to do it straight during undergrad) which isn’t that praised in the UK (but it was from LSE so who cares right?). I ended up switching for Philosophy and Economics after a year out because I didn’t like it. At the time, my advisor told me to « get my Management degree and move on with my life ».

The other reason I didn’t get advised well was because I had no idea how important internships, insight programs or societies roles were before coming. So I didn’t apply to anything nor explored my career interests when I got there for several reasons. The first one is that when I arrived I was 17 (so not very mature anyway) so my career was not my focus. The second one is that I got horribly depressed during and after my first year which discouraged me from doing anything (even the things I liked) and made every single application process excruciating. I am now at the end of my second year with zero experience and zero extra curricular activities.

In addition to this, I ended up hating the social life there and couldn’t really get along with many of my peers. 

My depression has been going on for 3 years and I need to get out of it. I wanted to know if there was any activities (volunteering or other) that could improve my resume and make me do something a little enjoyable. I am terrified of taking a year out after my undergrad and not accomplishing anything and not getting the masters I want...

TL;DR: Depressed LSE student with an empty resume. I need support and tips please :("

====================================================================================

Hello, I'm an incoming junior in CS and I wasn't able to land an internship this year as a sophomore for the summer, so I have a few questions and reflections I wanted to ask you guys.

I think I wasn't successful because I didn't feel that I was ready for it yet resume-wise since I changed majors after my freshman year when I found out I liked programming. I have a few side projects (one full-stack website is the best I have + some other projects nothing fancy) built outside of school that I can explain well and show that I can program but weren't enough for me to land any interviews. I know my resume needs work.

I'm a student who will get really good grades in school (college at least haha, not in high school), but nothing interesting in the side project/extra-curricular department. I see a bunch of the peers of my same year landing internships left and right from really nice companies. 

I've heard that it's not that cost-efficient for companies to invest in sophomore interns since they have a higher chance of not remaining at the company, so I'm assuming the bar is higher for sophomores. I know it's never great to compare myself to others, but I really can't help it and I'm so worried that next year will be the same story of no internship for me while my peers gain more experience and land more internships.

Of course, I will work hard this summer with interview prep and more interesting projects to increase my chances of getting one next year. I would love an internship at a well-known company, but I'm perfectly fine with smaller ones, as long as I can learn important skills."

I wanted to enroll in a coding camp before I attend university. Does anyone have any good online coding bootcamps that start at beginner and move to advance that I can do in 2-3months? I also hope the camp would have some fun projects I could add to my resume for a future internship. Let me know! Thanks!"

I knew applying to CS programs would be hard, but didn’t expect it to be soo grueling in areas beyond the applications. In these last 6-8 months, I have doubted everything : my undergrad, my projects, my GPA, my recommenders, my essays and HELL, even my luck. 

Everything stopped when the mail notification popped up and that feeling of extreme frustration while reading those generic rejections from schools I thought were “safe”. UNTIL, that one glorious day - when its actually a “Congratulations” mail and from your dream university &lt;3. HOLY SHIT I’M GOING TO GRAD SCHOOL. Its been the hardest journey as all members of my family were battling COVID-19 at the same time, so this moment was truly special.♥️

I saw a post couple of months ago which said that “its the hope that kills you.” I totally agree with that, its just that its also the hope that made you begin in the first place and the hope that will eventually rescue you. :)

For those who are going to try again next year, keep your chin up and be proud of the strength you’ve gained! The margin of difference b/w accepts and non-accepts was extremely slim and y’all will end up with great accepts next year!

Stats : okayish top 50 undergrad, &lt;3.5 GPA, 330+ GRE, 3 internships + 1 yr research + 1.5 yr work exp (all relevant), 1 patent, good recs.

nf1366,1,2021-05-18,I've had my job for a day and I already want to quit.,No_Definition6092,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/nf1366/ive_had_my_job_for_a_day_and_i_already_want_to/,"First off, apologies for any spelling/formatting errors, I'm on mobile. Also, yeah, this isn't my main account. Privacy. I'm also not sure about if this is entirely the right place for this? But I'm generally at a loss so I figured this is as good a place as any.

 A TL;DR will be included at the bottom. 

I (18F) recently got a job at a food chain. I already want to quit. To be frank, I didn't want the job in the first place. I'm living with my parents (mid 50s) up until I graduate college (I attend a semi-local college about 30-40 minutes away) and they made me get the job. I don't actually need it to support myself; they pay for my food, and they don't charge me rent, which I'm thankful for. I just have to pay for my own leisure activities/items myself, which is fine because honestly I don't even really want a lot. I want to add, I genuinely did try to get a job in the past. Both last summer and the entirety of my senior year of high school were spent constantly applying to places and hearing nothing back. But honestly I feel bad applying for a job that I likely won't keep when I go back to school in the fall. It just seems like they'll spend all the time training me and then turn around and have to train someone else.

Regardless, as soon as the semester ended they told me they expected me to get a job. The next several days were spent with them constantly bringing it up any time I was in the room with them. They didn't provide a reason as to why—I already have a bit of money saved up, since I don't tend to spend birthday/christmas money and also got a good bit of money from family from graduating high school. They just kept talking about how I'm guaranteed a job this time because ""everywhere is understaffed"". I was extremely unenthusiastic about it, but applied to some places to get them off my back. I am very much not a people person, and all the jobs locally hiring are very much ""take drive thru orders and remember them and make sure the customer is happy"", which is just very much not my speed. My mom is regularly frustrated because I can't remember details of what someone told me, because even though I genuinely was trying to listen my mind just blanked half of the information out. This feels like a major problem for food service to me. 

Anyway I went to the job interview of the place that called me back, and was literally hired on the spot after maybe 4 questions, two of which were about my availability. I spent the rest of the week getting the clothes I'd need for my uniform and such, and started bright and early today at 6 AM (further context: I tend to be a night owl when I'm not forced to wake up for something. I wake up in the afternoon and going to bed after sunrise. Standard sleeping/waking length, just at different times than most people.). I was ""trained"" by fellow standard employees, and I overheard one of them mentioning to someone she had only been there two months. I don't know how long the other person I was with has been there, but I also doubt it's been long since she seems to not know the answers to some of my questions. The day was spent with me basically just making drinks and trying to clean up after everybody without getting in their way. I didn't take any breaks (6 hours from 6 to 12) and a lot of the time was spent with people sort of just ignoring me while I tried to be helpful. Sometimes they asked me to clean something. My biggest concern was probably the general lack of care they seemed to have? I don't know how typical it is, since this is the first food service job I've had, but for example the work stations were regularly covered with huge puddles of coffee/milk and at several points workers just straight up didn't put the milks back in the storage fridge when they were done, instead just leaving it on the counter, even after I put it back multiple times. Several showed a strong disdain for wearing the latex gloves that are apparently required for handling food. I can count on one hand who all was wearing their mask correctly (I was one of them) (we're still required to wear ours here for the next week or two at least). Sneezes weren't adequately covered with an elbow or even a hard, just sorta half-heartedly directed sort-of away from food (no real attempt made tbh). My interactions with customers weren't awful, but I spent the whole 6 hours in what I can best describe as a fog. I literally cannot imagine myself taking orders, I have to check to labels on the cups repeatedly every single step of the process of making the drinks and I still messed some up. I'm not a good people person at all and I don't even fully comprehend why I went through with this in the first place because it just feels like such a mess. It's extremely fast paced and I'm the sort of person who likes to double check every step I take to make sure it's right and when I don't have time to do that I panic. 

My parents are pleased with this turn of events and my dad heavily insinuated at dinner that this was the reason he was pushing so hard for me to get a job; it's not so I can save money for after college, it's so that I have a motivation to FINISH college. He wants me to experience this so I go ""I don't want this to be the rest of my life, better get a degree."" He said that every college student should have a job for that exact reason, because too many college students go ""this is too hard and not worth it, I'll just drop out"". I wasn't going to do that in the first place. Between my junior and senior years of high school I worked at my mom's place of employment doing more or less assembly/production type work for $10 an hour, full time. Every day I got home with my hands scratched and aching and my back sore from hunching over the table and sometimes I wasn't even able to shower before I passed out in bed only to wake up the next morning to repeat it. I'm already motivated to get this degree. 

I've spent the time between getting off work and now going back and forth on trying to figure out how to deal with this. I don't want to quit after my first day but I can't imagine spending the next 2 months at minimum doing this for 6, possibly 8 hours a day. I wanted to use this summer to work on and monetize my hobbies instead. I've got the groundworks for a story I'd like to write (English major). My parents don't know, but I've been streaming on Twitch since about December (stopped in April) and have 50 followers, qualifying for Affiliate, but I'd need my tax information (which my dad has). I told them I was ""thinking about"" doing it during the time I played with my friends normally, because I knew they wouldn't take well to hearing I'd been doing it without telling them, which I was right, they were both extremely skeptical. I told my dad about the requirements for Affiliate (50 followers, certain viewer counts, etc) and he said ""Do you really think 50 people would want to watch /you/?"" They more or less said they'd ""think about it"" and then started pushing me to get a job shortly after that. I've stopped streaming since then, since I don't want them to find out I did it without telling them initially so I'm trying to keep my followers at 50 and not go too much over until they approve. 

Overall I'm just really unhappy with the situation I'm in right now. I'm considering maybe trying to find a job at somewhere like a local game store or even an office supply store, somewhere that's a little more my speed, but I'm afraid I'd hate that too, and I doubt it would look good on my resume if I quit a week in. I don't even know what my reason for changing jobs would be, since I don't think a lot of places would pay me more than what I'm being paid currently (about $8.75 an hour). 

Also, if it matters, I'm also pretty much guaranteed a job after college, since I've got an internship built into my degree and my advisor informed me that they pretty much always here the intern after they graduate. My parents know this and are content with it and actually reassured me about it when I was rambling about it to them, so I know this isn't a ""build your resume"" scheme.

I think I ended up going on for a bit; this is the first time I've actually been able to sort it all out in writing since I don't really wanna dump it all on my friends. I tried to clean it up for clarity as best I could. Even so, if anything is clear or needs more elaboration I'll do my best

TL;DR
I got a job in food service, and I hate it already and don't think I'm particularly good at it. My dad let it slip he made me get this job so that I'd hate it and be motivated to finish college. I'm extremely unhappy but my parents are pleased and I don't know what to do from this point."
nf1q85,1,2021-05-18,Question about recommended career path,eamonfitz,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nf1q85/question_about_recommended_career_path/,"So for context I \[25\] am transitioning away from working in the front-of-house restaurant industry after eight years. My eventual goal is to land a database developer position related to primarily data warehousing and I have been studying independently since COVID hit. I have attended university as a comp sci major for two years but never finished due to reasons both within and out of my control, so I understand that reaching such a position would require demonstration of competency suitable for such a role along with the certifications to prove it (working on Oracle 071, AWS Solutions Architect Associate, and possibly Snowflake Snowpro Core). 

Onto the substance of my question, I'm presented with a dilemma where I can:

* choose to work part time (prob only 20-25 hrs a week) that pays well in a completely unrelated field that allows me time to essentially be a fulltime student with the materials I have been using to study thus far
* or work as an IT intern getting paid $12/hr doing 40hr weeks, allowing me significantly less time to study on my own terms

My concern with the latter option is that while it is much more closely related to my eventual position, the internship is for a purely IT focused company where I wouldn't necessarily be able to learn anything related to my end goal. Personally, I feel confident enough in my ability to study independently to continue working towards my certs so I'm leaning towards the former option but I'd imagine that many other developers in the field that I eventually want to reach have started from IT positions so I want to get a second opinion on the matter since I feel that I may have some bias preventing me from making an objective decision. Thank you so much in advance for your input r/cscareerquestions !"
nf1y1q,1,2021-05-18,"To senior developers, project managers, and CTO's: how to get a job with a record?",Zdragon1,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/nf1y1q/to_senior_developers_project_managers_and_ctos/,"INTRO:

To begin this question, guys, I want to beg your forgiveness. I know that Reddit users - much like all Internet users - want succinct questions which allow people to easily understand the problem and get on with the question before moving on to other posts. However, there are intricacies in this particular question, making it impossible to answer unless you know the background. I also want to take this moment at the very start to think everyone who does post a response. This is especially true if you are somebody who's legitimately trying to point me in the right direction and not just trying to dissuade me from asking my question (or in what form I ask it) in the first place. This can be difficult to talk about for me and leaning on more experienced IT professionals is the only thing I know to do at this point.

So, with those preliminaries out of the way, let me explain. I'm going to format this question to make it easier to skim and quicker to understand so that you can get to the answering. The question is going to be a bit longer form but I'm going to separate the question into five (hopefully short) sections, summing up with what I really want to know. If you find this format annoying, then know that I am separating everything like this so that individuals don't have to go through everything to get a gist of what I'm asking. Trust me, I have asked this question in enough forms in my time to know that if you don't know enough about the background of my particular problem the answers you give will not be accurate.

CRIMINAL PAST:

To begin with, I have a felony past. The event took place 13 years ago and involved a fight with an ex-friend of mine while at a party. The fight got heated, we were young and stupid, and knives were eventually drawn. For the record, he drew a knife on me first but in the end, I was on his property, at his party, and more witnesses were arrayed against me than in the opposite direction. My guilt or innocence in this, however, is not important given that I pled guilty to the act at the time. My involvement at all, therefore, is what's important. With the advent of age and wisdom I deeply regret my actions, but likewise sometimes regret isn't enough to make a difference in the present.

I was put on trial for a range of charges which included the very hefty charge of assault with a deadly weapon. While that sounds really bad, it cannot be stressed enough that it was an example of the system trying to make an example of me. This is not a victimhood statement. No one was cut with these knives on either side. They were only brandished. Therefore there was no true ""assault"" necessarily. These fine details however did not seem to dissuade the prosecuting attorney's office that they needed to amend their original charges.

Eventually, after a year of struggling through the court system, I took a plea bargain which got rid of that more hefty charge and found me guilty of only the lesser charge of general assault. This is the only run-in with the law that I have ever had. Both before and since the event I have never had any criminal involvement, up to and including drugs or arrest records. This was my one and only slip-up in my entire life and consistent with who I am, I decided to produce a lifetime of mess-ups in one moment.

 I don't draw your attention to my lack of repeat offenses to take up for myself. This is an important detail for you to consider in helping me find a way forward in my career. You see, if you haven't already figured out where I'm going with this, I'm having a hard time finding a job because of my record. While more minute details will be shared as to why as this question rolls on, one of the things I want my potential employer to consider is my lack of recidivism. Essentially my message is: I messed up one time in a big way but this is not indicative of my general personality nor way of life. 

STATE LAW:

At this point, I want to take a moment to preemptively answer a lot of well-meaning suggestions which tend to come up when I ask questions like this. Under my state law, the kind of crime that I committed cannot be expunged for the rest of my life. Now, this is both true and not true. I say this because the first suggestion that always comes up is, ""have you looked into expungement?"" Well, yes I have. In fact, I have been engaged in a legal fight to have my records expunged and sealed for about half a year now, but COVID has interfered with this process because the courts are not entertaining motions that are not considered ""essential"" right now. From that statement though, you might take it to mean that straightforward expungement is allowed under my state which, seemingly, invalidates my first statement. This is not the case.

Technically, my state does not allow assault charges to be expunged, so we have to overturn my entire conviction. Given that I pled guilty this is not an easy legal fight and even my lawyer has not given me a promise of 100% success. I am fighting in the courts at a cost of thousands of dollars to myself and because the fight is so nuanced, for any measurable success to take place this fight will probably go on for months or years to come. Therefore, expungement is neither a remedy to my immediate problems nor an option that I am not already pursuing in my own way.

Another thing to consider is HIPAA requirements and my own state law regarding working in the medical field as a convicted felon. Under my state law, I am not allowed to work in a host of industries due to my conviction. These include, but are not limited to: hospitals, long-term care facilities, home healthcare facilities, daycare facilities, and the like. It should be noted that this law does not reflect the nature of my crime itself. My crime technically included a victim. My crime neither included the disabled nor children but because my crime included a victim of any kind, restrictions are placed upon me in these fields. The HIPAA requirements in particular mean that I cannot necessarily qualify to work with HIPAA-sensitive data either, even if I'm not working directly with people. As I am a developer this last point means that even though I cannot work as an IT in these various industries I also cannot work developing web apps or apps for these industries.

It is possible to petition regulatory agencies in my state to attain something called a ""good cause waiver"" to be granted the right to work in these industries even though I have the foregoing conviction. I petitioned my state agencies for this good cause waiver but this was a recent development (2 weeks ago) so my application has not even shown up in the state databases yet. I estimate that this process will also take months to a year to play out.

 It should also be considered that I live in one of the reddest states in the country. This is a fact which I do not relish but it is nonetheless true. As such, this state has no laws which protect people with criminal pasts at all. There is no salary cap for instance, which would preclude my employer from looking into my past, as is the case in other states like Texas and Colorado. There are also, no laws stating that an employer cannot look further back than seven years in our state. This means that a conviction that someone received at age 18 will show up on any criminal background check in my state when a person is 65. This will always be true so long as I live here. 

PRO DEV: 

Finally, we come to the main event. Several years ago I decided to improve my chances for employment by going back to school. I have only this month graduated with my bachelor's degree in computer science. I wanted to become a computer programmer. Before Covid, I had received my first programming job, against all odds, at a small resale company. This was going well but ended last year in March due to COVID. I had only had the job for about eight months. Prior to that, I had picked up a few freelancing gigs in my local community but nothing which would qualify me as a mid-level or senior developer.

During the pandemic, I was able to draw unemployment which kept me in my family going throughout the crisis. However, my state's governor has recently decided, with a host of other red states, to cancel unemployment benefits for all people under the state citing a labor shortage. This means that the extensions just passed by the Biden administration will not count for me after next month. Now, I have been applying for and pursuing employment since midway through the pandemic but I have not been necessarily in need of employment until now. The problem is that rather than slowly but surely developing my skills and entering the job market as a more well-rounded and prepared developer, the government's decision to cancel unemployment benefits means that I need to enter the job market less prepared than I otherwise would be.

Even if I had the extra three months of benefits, however, there's only so much work I could actually do on my own. After all, I just graduated this month and no matter where I go I would qualify as a junior dev only. Most junior developers are up against the experience wall as it is. Most employers want experience and most junior devs need to be given a job to get experience. In my case, it's even worse, because the industries that I can work in are extremely reduced. Of those industries that are left to me (resell, e-commerce, etc.) you are up against the HR wall.

Only some businesses will hire felons at all and often they are only in labor positions. Most businesses see it as an insurance liability to have people who have been convicted of a felony in their past working with their customer data, this is true whether or not the crime in question had anything to do with financial fraud. Therefore even amongst those industries which I technically can work in, the number of companies which will give me a chance is even more reduced.

If I was a senior dev, this perhaps would not be as big of an issue as it is, but I'm not. My technology stack is extremely limited, my experience is, all told, less than a year, and I'm at a point in my abilities where I'm a jack of all trades and a master of none. With all that said, it would seem the answer is obvious: sit tight and develop my professional skills. But again, that would be fine if I had the money and time to make that a reality. As it is, I do not. 

While all this is true I have not sat idle during the pandemic. On top of going to school, I have also reckoned with the fact that I will be unable to gain any real meaningful internships, and have thus attempted to create my own. I hired a coding coach (who himself is an employee at Microsoft and a senior developer) which I work with on a weekly basis. His job is to help me grow accustomed to what would be expected of me in the professional field, as well as expose me to technologies that are currently being used in big corporate industries as we speak. In time, I feel like this kind of training would be helpful because it would help me hit the ground running.

For all of my attempts at trying to develop myself, however, I still feel like the system itself is arrayed against me. I feel hopeless because there doesn't seem to be an entry point where I can actually become a developer in my state. I'm not experienced enough, or valuable enough for anyone to want to move me out of state, and the cost of doing that at my own expense would be enormous. I and my wife have managed to save up enough money to live for the next year, but that's our entire life savings. I want a job so that I don't have to spend that money but I lack direction, ability, and experience. My coding coach tells me regularly that I'm actually more experienced than the average junior dev coming in off the street, as much as I appreciate that praise, given my past and all the things arrayed against me I don't know if it has any meaning. I still feel like there's no hope for me being hired anywhere.

SUM:

 

In coming to the end I ask a very open-ended question: knowing my story, how do I put a roof over my family's head?

I'm addressing this question to senior developers, project managers, and CTO's in particular. What can I do to find a job?

I don't want to make a million dollars, I just want to make a fair wage and have a good job where they know I regret my past and want to work hard to make up for it. It'ss hard to tell that story to anyone, least of all hiring managers who have a stack of more qualified people behind me. If I can find a job I would work every day as hard as I could for them because I know that they gave me a chance where others wouldn't but the issue is getting my foot in the door.

Between HR, my past, my lack of experience, and a host of other business concerns which I'm not qualified to speak to, I struggle and will struggle to find employment. My question is, am I even barking up the wrong tree here? Is there just no room in this industry for me?

I apologize again for the length of this question and want to express appreciation to anyone who made it to the end. Thank you

Post note:

The first thing that people often suggest when doing this is to freelance but they don't take into consideration how hard it can be to compete on freelance sites when you are not established and when you lack practical industry experience."

**In the 4th tier, you're basically a DevOps, and working with Puppet, AWS cloud formation  and then move to system engineering team or specialties like Networking or DBA.**

**During the internship, the chosen candidate is supposed to have access to all 4 (I haven't had the initial interview yet) to confirm. I've read some reports that NOC is just a glorified version of help desk position that work with networking, but most times you're not doing much networking at all, which worries me. That brings me to the 18hr position that isnt an internship and I'm moved onboard automatically (if they were to choose me, not saying they will or will not).**

**I also want to ask how to prepare for the NOC initial interview? I've seen two reviews from past candidates that said the interview wasn't hard but they weren't offered the job. I can see that both were asked about projects dealing with AWS or their experience with it.**

**The people who are interns (2 for NOC ) have already graduated college a couple years ago. Have certs mainly in Azure and in cloud computing.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Others that aren't interns -**

**One worker is now a cloud associate after years of experience plus azure certs. The other with azure certs and years of experience (6),  (used to be a IT support admin level 2) is now in a NOC contracting position for the company but has been there for 10 months already.**

&amp;#x200B;

***I don't know why I'm writing all of this- I guess I just want to know where I stand (am I skilled enough)  before I invest into anything and I want to know if they're serious about interns. I don't want their hopes to be so high that they're comparing me to current interns and I won't be able to reach the standard.***"

I have been given an assignment to compile and analyze invoice data for transports from our warehouse to the customer. This data includes A: Transport company , B:Month, C: Country, D: Order No, F: Number of orders, G: Price.

I have put together all the invoice data for all months from January 2020 to April 2021 in one big databank sheet.

Basically, it looks like this:

DHL; January 2020; USA; LP1231231231; 1; $10

UPS; February 2020; Germany; LP2434242; 1; $14

Deutsche Post; January 2020; Germany; Bulk; 3000; $4500  etc etc

So what I want to do are three things:

1. I want to compile all the data so we can get a quick overview of how many orders with what services we have to different countries and the cost of those.
2. To be able to compare all the orders in January 2020 with January 2021 or Germany with Finland etc.
3. When we add more data into the data bank for May 2021 etc, I want all the calculations to be updated automatically so all we have to do is crtl+c/v the invoice data into the databank and then excel will do the rest.

What would be the best way to accomplish this so that the end result will allow us to quickly compare data for various countries and time periods? It would be awesome if I could have drop down lists that would let me select country 1 and 2, time period 1 and 2; transport company 1 2 and service 1 2 then get sums for costs and number of orders and comparisons etc."

On May 10 they emailed me again and finally let me know everything was complete. They had finished working with their legal team to finalize contracts. She also informed me that she apologized for the delay, but they are a small team. She told me to let her know when I would be able to start, so she could send contracts over to sign.

nf9fzx,6,2021-05-18,"Just a rant. Long-term Unemployment resulting in severe depression, hopelessness and suicide (Disclaimer: VERY LONG post with no TL/DR)",Ok_Bike239,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/nf9fzx/just_a_rant_longterm_unemployment_resulting_in/,"I'm in the UK and I graduated in the summer of 2020 from a London university with a First Class Honours undergraduate degree (a 4.0 GPA), almost 12 months ago. I have struggled to find employment at the graduate/degree-level ever since. I know there has been (still is) a global viral pandemic that has not only cost many lives but also many jobs and severely impacted the jobs markets in probably every country.

I've submitted hundreds of applications and mostly been ghosted or automatically rejected (not even making it to first interview stage) - but I have had a number of interviews over the phone and via Zoom. None of them have taken me anywhere. Actually, interviews are something I just cannot perform in (I know a lot of people are bad with interviews due to nerves and anxiety, but I have autism which makes interviewing extremely debilitating and paralysing - a thousand times more so than people who just feel ""dreadfully nervous"" during interviews). On reflection, my best hope of getting a career, I suppose, was to attempt somehow to convert one of the three internships I did whilst at university into a full-time paid position (then I could have got myself a career without having to put myself through the utterly paralysing, disabling process and experience of interviewing).

My story is a rather sad one (I hate to sound self-pitying and I hope not to come across this way, but if I do, then oh well). I got rather good grades at school (I loved education and still do, I'm a very erudite and academicy-type person); I did well in my A-levels and when I was 18, I went to university. However, I dropped out after just a few months as I loathed the course I was on. I ended up getting a low-level, low-paid menial job working in a warehouse. There I stayed for the next 10-years until I was 28 years of age. I do not know how on this Earth I managed to stick it out for so long. I was never content with life, I was living life as a slave - I was worked to death in the picking department of the warehouse where there were daily targets to be met ....I was micro-managed by nasty supervisors and team leaders who would approach me every single hour with a sheet of paper in their hand with my pick rate on it - ""Can you explain to me why you've only picked 150 items this hour, when the pick rate is 160?""....being timed on how long I spent in the toilet was awful, too. I'm just touching on the best of it here, believe me they were horrid people managing me in that warehouse.

Anyway, as a direct result of the micro-management and bullying from the warehouse supervisors and team leaders (they were awful bullies who cared for nothing but their precious pick rate), I suffered from severe depression and anxiety - I dreaded waking up every working day and my stomach was in knots every single time I walked into that warehouse. The management had made me a timid, nervous wreck. I even broke out with a chronic long-term skin condition that baffled the doctors and was ultimately put down to how stressed and anxious the supervisors/team leaders in the warehouse had made me. So, basically, working in the warehouse was HELL. And oh boy, was the job so terribly grueling. So, so, so physically grueling beyond belief. I believe due to the hard manual nature of the job and the extreme depression and anxiety that I experienced, I began aging prematurely. And all this I endured for a low wage (when compared to the national average; but actually a ""good"" wage by the standards of my small exclusively industrial town).

Now, I'm someone who is rather intelligent and loves what some may like to call the finer things in life. I love reading (mostly non-fiction); watching educational documentaries (history, geographical, politics); going for long walks in the countryside. I'm also very aspirational and ambitious in my character and have always longed for a ""career"" rather than a ""job"". I didn't know anyone else in the warehouse who had the same interests as me or who liked the finer things - no educated people or erudite people or aspirational/ambitious people. Just people who wanted to slave away an 8 or 12 hour shift in the warehouse, collect their small wage and go home. Once home, they would open up a few cans of beer or go to the pub and drink lager whilst shouting at the TV watching football games. If I was to be very judgmental, I'd say they were all alcohol-obsessed, blokey oafs. Whereas me - I'd go home and start reading a book or articles, start writing on my own blog about politics or something.

Anyway, as I approached the age of 30, after 10-years in Hell (the warehouse), I decided enough was enough and that I couldn't do this life anymore. I wanted to better myself and improve my life situation. I wanted to finally have a career - something I had longed for all those years. So, I decided to return to university and get myself a degree. This was what I saw as the best option to better myself. I would have done this a lot sooner than I did, however I had financial commitments before (a car purchased on finance and other things) but by this time I was now in a position where I could do it. I quit the warehouse and I moved to my capital city (London!) where I studied a really great degree.

For the first time in my life, I was truly happy. I made friends - true friends - people of various different cultures, ethnicities and nationalities ... people from all over the world (where I come from is an exclusively white town); people who shared the same interests as me; who wanted to make something of themselves and had ambition; who were not judgmental and did not have narrow ""small town"" mindsets. I also did three really cool and exciting internships (unpaid) for organisations I'd loved to have ended up working at. I was living away from home and independent for the first time (yep, a whole lot later than everyone else!) and paying my own rent and living my own life. It was just absolutely amazing. Between 2017 and 2020, I actually lived life for the first time. Before then, I had simply existed, but I had not lived. The three-years I spent in London were the only three-years of my life when I actually knew, for the first time, what it was to be happy. I realised I had never experienced happiness before in life. I had only ever known anxiety, depression and loneliness. For the first time in my life I was happy, *truly happy*. I felt like my life was going somewhere; that I was on to something and that I had a future ahead of me.... a positive future.

June 2020: I graduate with top marks (4.0 GPA/ First Class Honours) and after staying in London until all my money ran out (and searching for work but unable to find any in London), I return back to my small, depressing, industrial town. There, I continue the search for work (mainly, but not exclusively, in London, as I am eager to go back there and live permanently) but I find nothing. Ghosting, and ""sorry to inform you we will not be progressing with your application"" become the new normal for me. Oh, and I then, after a time, begin to get plenty of ""pre-interview telephone screenings"" and some interviews via Zoom. All come to nothing. I do some rare intermittent work through an industrial staffing agency at some warehouses in my town (warehouse and factory work being the ONLY type of work available in my hometown). And this situation remains my situation to this day.

I'm now in my early 30s; an unemployed graduate; no technical skills (which seems to be the most important thing to get a graduate/degree-level career these days); still living at home with my mum; no savings; no income; no prospects ahead of me and what appears to be a very bleak future indeed; but still with aspiration and ambition deep within me.

I'm depressed again. After the three-years of finally knowing happiness and being positive and optimistic in and about life, I am now back to being in a state of severe depression. I cannot ""do interviews"" and wish I had contacts, connections and networks that privileged upper-middle-class people in the UK have. How lucky they are that they can just ""get into a career"" by having a word with someone or a family friend or connection being able to ""sort something out"" for them. I do envy them very much. I try not to self-pity. We are all dealt a hand /cards in life, and we have no say in what hand we are dealt with. We have to try and make the most of the cards we are dealt. I suppose, for me, it means accepting my limitations and coming to terms with the fact that I am just destined to be a low-level warehouse worker on low-pay for the rest of my life, never knowing what it is to have meaning and fulfillment out of a good, rewarding career.

But then, instead, I could just end it all. Everyone finds their meaning out of life from different things. For me, it's the need for a career. It's just how I'm minded. I want to be in a professional career making half-decent money at least and really giving back to society. I've never had a career but it has always been what I want. It's what always drove me. I think I now need to accept it just won't happen. I don't think I can go back to the industrial world - and endure the bullying and harsh treatment; and the grueling physical nature of the work. If I do, I think I'll end up eventually committing suicide. So, why not do that anyway?

I know my post sounds self-pitying and I absolutely hate that. I really do. I hate self-pity. But oh well, I can't help that, I'm sorry.

There's no purpose to this post other than that I want people to read my rant, I need to get this off my chest."

Profile:   sat was cancelled thrice until now in India but 1320 in psat  january(improved a lot in recent months scoring 1450-1500 in mock sat  now) hoping to take one in august ,CBSE Curriculum - 83% in 9th ,85% in  10th and 86% in 11th(11th was hard and I really worked for it). Decent  ecs, was one of the few representatives of India at the japan art mile  which is gonna be presented at tokyo olympics, few cs internships and  state level olympiads and some volunteer work. Also am a US-Citizen btw  so ig am in a unique situation as most cbse students ik who applying  abroad are indian citizens and most us citizens ik in india follow  international curriculums.

College  list: CMU USC  Tufts NYU  Northeastern  Carleton College  Grinnell  College  Boston University  Boston College  CWRU  Macalester College  Lafayette College Lehigh University  Kenyon College  
UNC UVA  UMich UIUC  
NCSU  U of Utah Iowa State  U Mississippi

I  also wanted to know if I literally have any chance at ivies like yale,  cornell,dartmouth, and even stanford(lol) even cmu ,gatech,umich  ,uiuc,etc to some extent or would I be better off not wasting my time  applying to them. Now I actually realise this post belongs in [r/chanceme](https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/) and [r/reversechanceme](https://www.reddit.com/r/reversechanceme/)  but since I would like to take all the help I can get here u go.

I was wondering what methods you guys use to gather marketing data and put it into excel files, or if you use another way completely.

What process do you take from start to finish from gathering the data from emails, social media and newsletters to excel worksheets and pivot tables?

nfaixp,433,2021-05-18,"[Uni] a comprehensive guide to accepting, rejecting, and appealing uni offers 2021",rGedos,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/nfaixp/uni_a_comprehensive_guide_to_accepting_rejecting/,"Hi, after seeing the recent influx of appeal queries and stuff about accepting offers, I've written a short guide to accepting and rejecting uni offers. This information may not be complete because I didn't personally apply to some schools, so please let me know if I've missed anything. Information is accurate for the 2021 uni apps cycle.

**Acceptance Windows**

**First window:** ends on 24 May 2021

**Second window:** ends on 17 June 2021

**Edit** It's been mentioned that SIT only gives offers in the first window. Could anyone confirm this?

**I have an offer for X but am waiting for Y in the second window, how?**

Any offer you don't accept in the first window will be withdrawn. If you have any offers at all in the first window, accept an offer first. This is to make sure you aren't left high and dry in the event you don't get anything in the second window. There is no penalty for withdrawing in the second window (if you get an offer you want more then).

**If I get another offer in the second window, do I have to email the original school?**

No, all 6 autonomous universities (NUS, NTU, SMU, SUTD, SIT, SUSS) use the [JAP](https://jointacceptance.edu.sg/pls/webexe/joint_accept.login) and are notified through that portal if you take up/drop their offer.

If the new offer you're taking is from a school outside of the 6 local universities, you must let the original school know and request to withdraw your place. As long as you have not matriculated, there will be no penalty. The two windows are far before matriculation occurs, so don't worry.

**I'm holding an offer for X and am appealing to change it to Y (within the same school). If my appeal is unsuccessful, do I lose the spot in X?**

No. Your JAP will show your most current offer from the school. If you successfully appeal to another course in the same school, your old offer is replaced on the JAP. If your appeal isn't successful, your old offer stays.

**I'm holding an offer for X in one school, Y in school #2. If I appeal to course Z in school #2, can I still choose between X and Z?**

Yes. The courses between schools are independent of each other. The only time a course will outright replace another course on your JAP is when they're from the same school. You can still choose between your successful appeal and a course from another school. You are not locked into the appeal course.

**UK schools how?**

I actually wrote in to the school that gave me an offer and asked for an extension of their deadline. They said no. (Jokes on them I nvr get scholarship I'm not going\~) UCAS fixed deadline is 10 June 2021, so if you are still waiting on your local offers to get back to you past that date, just accept your UCAS offer first. Do not pay the deposit until you are sure you're going, and you can withdraw without penalty.

**I have a health condition, how?**

If you declare a health condition to the school, it takes longer for your application to be processed and for you to receive an offer. This is because admissions needs to process your health-related documents and make the necessary accommodations. Thanks /u/97gguks for pointing this out.

**What happens after I accept my offer?**

You will not receive an email acknowledging your acceptance. Go and submit your photo for student card and book your health checkup since you're done.

On the JAP, you'll get a screen that looks like this. (Sorry for the bad quality it's a screenshot of a screenshot.)

https://preview.redd.it/t16jrokt4h171.png?width=758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03aa0ecc2b5ad545acf4165770acf3cd0b481dee

The next time you log in, you'll have a screen that looks like this.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8vzb8e7z4h171.png?width=534&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1e06aca3c3bfd4a0770dd6f45376c5958ec75df

And when it's registered in the school's system, it will look like this (for NUS at least.) Note that it might take time for it to appear; the schools advise waiting 4 days from the first window (so 28 May) before checking for the acknowledgement of your acceptance.

&amp;#x200B;

**How to appeal?**

NUS: Appeal through the [UAS](https://myaces.nus.edu.sg/uasonline/Login) portal from 21 to 26 May 2021. ([Here](https://imgur.com/a/FjhLZgu) is how the appeal page looks   
like.) Maximum 1000 characters. You cannot appeal for Architecture, Dentistry, Industrial Design, Landscape Architecture, all Law-related courses, Medicine or Nursing if you did not get shortlisted for the initial round of interviews. If I'm not wrong, you cannot appeal until you are rejected. **NOTE!** NUS actually recommends appealing for courses that weren't in your original application. NUS: ""Therefore, appealing for the same choices would be highly unlikely to change the University's prior decision. You are strongly encouraged to appeal for courses other than your previous choices.""

**NOTE #2:** If you receive your outcome after May 26, it is still possible to appeal. With reference to this user's email to NUS: [**https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/nhkti2/uni\_do\_i\_appeal\_to\_nus\_if\_my\_application\_status/gyx92dl/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=ios\_app&amp;utm\_name=iossmf&amp;context=3**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/nhkti2/uni_do_i_appeal_to_nus_if_my_application_status/gyx92dl/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3)

NTU: Appeals are open now through the NTU admissions portal. Deadline is 26 May 2021, but you **can** appeal even after the appeal exercise closes because NTU is strangely kind. Max 250 words (roughly 1000 characters). You can appeal at any time, even before you get rejected. Supporting documents uploaded via [Google Drive](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduate/admission-guide/singapore-cambridge-gce-a-level#Content_C095_Col00) (link is to NTU website).

SMU: Appeal through the [Self Service](https://admissions.smu.edu.sg/admissions-requirements/applicants-self-service) portal from 3 May to 19 July 2021. Max 1000 words. You cannot appeal until you are rejected.

SUTD: Appeal through the SUTD admissions portal from 11 May and 24 May 2021.

SIT: Appeal through SIT admissions portal from 25 May to 1 June 2021. Approx 200 words. You can upload documents via the portal.

SUSS: Appeal through SUSS admissions portal from 1 April to 31 May 2021. Max 500 words. You cannot appeal until you are rejected.

**How likely is it that I'm successful in my appeal?**

Admittedly, it's not a rosy outlook. Both NUS and NTU state that the chances are slim, as you've already been considered thoroughly for your course. Doubly so for interview courses, apparently. With that said, here are things you can include in your appeal, according to SIT, SUTD and SMU:

1. **New information** that supports your candidature. I guess this could mean courses you've taken since applying, new community work, new internships. Anything that changed from then to now, tell them. SUTD: ""Your appeal must represent significant and compelling new academic and/or personal information that was not present at the time of application and which brings merit for reconsideration.""
2. **Your passion for the course** should be shown in your writeup. If all else fails, just spam your love and passion for the course.

Appeals can and do work, so don't give up, just appeal.

**When will I know if my appeal was successful?**

SMU, SUSS and SIT aim to reply to you in 21 days. Also, it's known that NUS and NTU take their own sweet time (officially their outcomes will come from mid-June for NUS, end-June for NTU). There have been cases where people were offered a place in the course the day before class started.

**I got rejected from everything. How?**

This year's uni cycle seems to be a lot harder than most, and it feels like the IGP has soared. I haven't figured it out yet - last year was also a pandemic year, so shouldn't the IGP remain the same? But anyway, in light of this, you may want to consider

1. Reapplying next year, taking the time in between to beef up your portfolio
2. Retaking A levels / taking A levels
3. Attending a private university. You can look to SIM GE, Kaplan, or PSB Academy. If you're interested in psychology, JCU is a good option.
4. Applying overseas e.g to Australia
5. Applying to poly, check out /u/Eurito1's comment below

**Is no news really good news?**

Really. It is. It means they're still considering you, and that you still have a chance. Better to take a long time to be accepted than a short time to be rejected. You might not get an offer until the second window because the course was waiting for offered applicants to drop their offers.

**Some personal speculation**

In courses where applicants tend to favour one school, I think it's even better to appeal. e.g in the case of NUS and SMU Law, most law applicants apply to both, but tend to favour NUS. In that case, if you were on the waitlist or rejected by SMU Law, it's a bigger chance that your appeal's successful since people will drop their SMU offers at the end of the first cycle. Apparently the same goes for CS and Medicine, where people prefer NUS/YLL to NTU/LKC. Then again, this is just speculation, so take it with a pinch of salt.

That's all the FAQ I've seen floating around the past few days. Let me know if I missed out anything so I can add. Thanks

Edit: Added NUS deets, NTU and SIT deadlines, NTU additional info, information on applicants w special needs, pictures of NUS appeal page and JAP messages, thank you to those who DMed me!"

This internship will be my very first experience in real life. Im still a second year vocational student and I applied for it because its in the summer, and will be a great experience for me as I have had none.

Thank you very much :)"
nfcb8b,0,2021-05-18,Experience is overrated,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nfcb8b/experience_is_overrated/,"There are people out there working \~4 years, who think they are senior devs, but they probably know less than a fresh CS grad. They got by checking Google for every task they did, don't know how to write maintainable code, and know squat about DS/A. Depending on what you did, where you did it, and what you actually contributed, experience can be a useless metric. Internships are equally useless is most cases because interns do more tech support than they do coding, all an internship does is show the person was a good student to get it, not that they gained valuable experience.

Then there are those who've been coding a long time, always working on their own projects, and probably have a degree in something else. They probably studied a lot of ""useless"" subjects like compilers, memory management, and functional programming, but know CS and computers inside out. These are people who probably contribute to open-source and can innovate, learn new topics quickly with their foundation, and are able to handle novel situations. Unfortunately these types can be overlooked because ""no one creates a server from scratch using C anymore and we need someone who knows Django"".

I would always hire the later over someone who is ""more experienced with the relevant technology"" because if that's all they know, I'll be stuck with them when they encounter a problem they can't Google their way out of."

nfe853,0,2021-05-18,Systems Analyst Position at a Health Care Company vs Searching for an actual SWE job?,Pavilion75,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nfe853/systems_analyst_position_at_a_health_care_company/,"TL;DR - Got CS degree, job hunting for entry SWE, got an invite to the final round of interviews for Systems Analyst position, want to know if it’s worth it and if there’s experience that can be transferrable to a future SWE job?

Hey all, I have been lurking on this sub for quite some time and I just wanted to know if some of you guys have been put in a similar position. I graduated this past weekend and have been job hunting for entry-level/new graduate/junior SWE roles since the beginning of the year with little progress. I got some call-backs and even got to the technical portions of the interviews but never made it past that. Recently, I got invited to go into the final round of interviews with a health care company for a newly graduated Systems Analyst position. I have read on this sub that the position is just a title and the work depends on what company it's for, but this position is basically to automate some redundant internal tasks like setting up servers and whatnot. When I asked about the possibility of career growth in terms of coding, I was informed I would only be coding some scripts for maybe 30% of the time, while the other 70% of the time would be focusing on ""other things,"" whatever that means? My ultimate goal in this job search is to look for experience that I can be transferrable to my next potential job, which I’m unsure this Systems Analyst position can provide given the description.

I want to be able to eventually work as a developer, but I have been hearing that taking a Systems Analyst role would make me rusty when it comes to programming and ultimately I should just focus on applying for SWE positions. That’s great and all, but the problem is I’m not sure if I should pass up on this offer; that is if I get past this final round. Maybe it’s imposter syndrome, but I feel as though my coding skills aren’t where they should be as a new grad, especially because I wasn’t able to land any internships while I was still in school, which I regret. I have some interesting class projects keeping my resume afloat and plan to keep tweaking them just to teach myself new things, but I’m wondering if that’ll be enough as well. I also still plan to grind Leetcode problems, take Coursera courses for certifications and apply to other SWE positions until I hear the final decision for this Systems Analyst position, but I am feeling anxious. I keep thinking that it’s too soon in the job hunt to accept the first thing that comes my way, but at the same time when will that next interview come around?"
nfezzt,4,2021-05-18,How do I politely put my cards on the table?,Lumenatrum,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/nfezzt/how_do_i_politely_put_my_cards_on_the_table/,"Hey, Reddit I'm looking for some advice.

I am high functioning autism spectrum and I was referred through my disability agency to a call center that takes government projects. 

I am a senior at my university in Cybersecurity and I would argue I have a somewhat impressive resume (e.g., 4.0 GPA, high technical knowledge, etc.) I was told to ask about a potential internship, and read off some of my credentials and the interviewer told me that he felt there was a much stronger position open for me, because it was geared towards people with high IT skills.

Today, I found out that the job pays the exact same amount, and the hours are slightly more ambiguous in terms of operation (i.e., there is no set schedule and I may have to work weekends). It seems to me this is a similar job; however it is for people with better IT skills who can effectively navigate through a lot of software (both proprietary and non-proprietary) It is also ostensible to me that this position has no pathway towards an internship, and I am getting paid the same for a subjectively harder position.

I have an interview set up tomorrow, but I am fuming because I feel like I was misled. I do need a summer job, but I basically do not want to work weekends in regards to this position. How would I go about telling them this in the most respectful way possible?

Edit: just wanted to clarify. Originally this was for a call center job. I was told by my disability agency to ask about internships, so I did and I was essentially shoehorned into an interview for ""applicants with an IT background"" that turned out not to be an IT position, just a call center job for those with higher IT skills at the same pay and weekend hours."

After many rejections from internships, I don't have a good summer plan at this point.

I signed up for a summer CS class at my school with a light workload and an unpaid internship, but I'm not sure if these are the best opportunities to get involved in to turn things around for the next recruiting season.

I'm hoping to work in SWE after college, interested in front end dev. Picked my major late so I only know ds/algo &amp; basic CS stuff now. I completed some projects with mobile dev so am hoping to learn web dev. On the side I've long been interested in ML and might even consider grad school/research if I really like it.

Overall I honestly don't have much experience at anything and am kind of hoping to devote this summer to explore something new as well.

I have always been very unforgiving to myself for mistakes, and I never really feel happy or content with my accomplishments because I expect myself to be perfect. I focus so much on my shortfalls that I just always feel that I am stupid and lazy.

Career/money wise I am pretty ok, I am finishing up a post-graduate program, I have some internships in my field under my belt as well as a full time offer after I finish school. 

Personal life wise, I have a sense of humour. That's pretty much it. In my free time I just journal or watch Netflix or watch educational videos on youtube and I have the most boring existence.

I don't have a lot of friends, I don't have a family that really cares about each other, I don't have a cool sense of style or ""aesthetic"""", I don't have any hobbies or passions because I lose interest in them quickly and I always feel like I kind of wish I was never born because I always feel dull.

I have goals and ideas for things I want to do (e.g. dance, art, volunteer, get a refreshed sense of style, etc.) but when attempting these things it just never feels good enough. I'm imagining myself sitting in a park painting the trees and I feel like I would be sad while painting, and then sad on the way home, and then still sad. I would think to myself, well I have found my new passion, but what good is it if I still don't have any friends and nobody cares about me? Once I did yoga in the park and thought, well what if I became a yogi and learned how to go upside down and all those funky positions? But I just didn't want to. I was just tired and I thought about how ridiculous and mundane my life would be, if I went to work, went home, went to the park and started randomly doing yoga, and repeated that. I feel like I have nothing and nobody to live for. I never learned how to bond with people properly and I feel like there is no point to my life. 

Last year I got a new job and it really boosted my confidence and it was one of the happiest months of my life, but it was almost a fake happiness because at the end of each day I still had to live with the fact that I don't really have much going for me and I don't really have an interest in much. I feel like a deadbeat but with interests not money. 

How can I get out of this feeling that there is no point to my life and what can I do about not really having much going for me?"

1st year of college took Data structures and Algorithms as well as Object oriented programming and got a C both times. Since then have taken a couple of MOOCs on those topics and did much better. Took 5-6 total programming classes in college and software/systems has been my job ever since. 

I want to do the OMSCS to challenge myself and I want a deeper understanding of how I can develop technology that interacts with the world in a safer way and creates less bias. I’d really like a career surrounding that (I plan to take the Interactive Intelligence route, MBSE actually requires a lot of the same ideas just phrased differently. I also have a cute story on how technical bias is a major reason I didn’t start out feeling prepared for a role in computers that I might put in my application)

My recommendations will be my current employers and I’m still thinking through my essays. I’m open to any feedback about my chances. I’m very nervous of course, but it’s worth a try."

How to go from here?,GreenCarpetsL,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/nfrl9m/so_i_finally_got_a_job_how_to_go_from_here/,"After 1 month of treating applications as a job, putting out 340 applications between April 14 to May 15, I finally got a job in Manufacturing.

While my credentials are not suited for the role, it almost pays pretty well given the economic times that we are in(30% more than minimum wage + an afternoon shift differential) right now before July. The supervisors are pretty nice, fairly strict in their expectations because they have suspension targets but are pretty decent in terms of their attitude toward me. I have to go through 25,000 lbs of steel for 10 hours at 1000C, which is strenuously difficult but on the other hand I needed some entry level work experience for an Engineering education. Most jobs require work experience for entry level positions and where I live jobs in my field are non-existent so I have a plan to work toward and this gains some PR for other prospective employers(51% of employers look at temporary jobs as full-time work).

The problem I see with the company is that they will give a raise typically every \~3 months, and benefits kick in after 6 months. For me I don't believe that is good enough, let alone the paygrade being lower than an Engineering internship. I believe that it is a good idea to have this job however because the supervisors have a general liking toward me and taught me basically everything about the company from its structure, to its operations, to its lines, production and CNC processes.

While I'm applying to other jobs which pay better and are within the realm of Software development, I'm wondering how I would be able to nudge the company into giving a raise within a more reasonable timeframe. They have a high turnover which goes from \~30-40 hires to \~2 remaining after 1 month of work, with many people who just quit on the spot. To me it seems that asking for a raise after 3 weeks while looking for other Manufacturing jobs and internships is appropriate. I am willing to lose this job given that I've been interviewed by other companies with a similar workload and better pay, but I'm wondering what the best approach would be in this position.

Also, how would I sell being in Manufacturing to Software companies? My guess is that it shows I'm willing to work hard in difficult settings, which translates into a very strong work ethic in a remote/office setting. I have a few other projects that I'm working on and I'd definitely appreciate some input on it."

Unfortunately, both of these positions are unpaid. I have a pretty good amount of experience with CS, and the roles I'd take on at both of these startups would be pretty technical, and I think I'd learn a good amount - I'd be directly working with the founders on ML/IOT type stuff which is pretty interesting. They also told me they'd teach me a good amount of entrepreneurial/business heavy stuff which could potentially be helpful for me since I do plan on getting into the startup space myself.

I've read countless posts and comments on this thread advising people to stray away from unpaid internships and I largely agree with the sentiment - I feel it's unwise to dedicate my time(and brain) towards a position where I'm not monetarily compensated, when I could potentially use those same skills to make money. However, I don't really have any paid positions in hand I could do over these, and my only real option to make money in the traditional ""job"" sense would be to get a minimum wage type job. I am planning on doing some form of academic tutoring and potentially tech consulting for local businesses during the summer alongside whatever else I do, so I do plan on making at least some money regardless.

If I don't do an internship, I'd likely take an additional class over the summer and work on further solidifying my algo skills(LeetCode or something of the like), and maybe dabble with a few personal projects.

What makes the most sense from a future recruitment perspective? I plan on applying to programs like Google STEP/Facebook Uni etc, and just generally field for high tier internships next summer, so would doing an unpaid internship help with that? I got rejected from Google CSSI this summer, so I really want to optimize my chances of getting something good next.

Are there any last ditch resorts I could do for making money this summer through tech(besides the volatile consulting stuff)? Bonus points if they're also optically good from a recruitment perspective.

Finally, is there anything else you guys would recommend I do this summer or even early in college given the information I've provided thus far?

I was a web development student but got an internship in data analytics just on the basis of a few riddles, mental ability questions and a good HR round...Let's just say I got lucky...
There's a rule in our college that doesn't let you sit for further campus placements once you've been selected for 1 particular company...So I had to take it up...the salary was pretty good so I thought how bad could it really be....I just felt lucky to find a job in these trying times of covid
Since it started and they began training us in excel I knew it was not for me...it's been almost 3 months and I still haven't been able to feel better better about it. I am the only intern who is not familiar with any data analytics technologies. I don't see myself doing this job even in the next 2 years and feel like it's not for me.Sometimes when you know, you just know... After 2 months, I was put into a team that requires quick logical reasoning and good math and I suck at both of them. I am a visual and a creative person and find data analytics boring and hard. I am not excited to learn. Maybe something like Ui/Ux would have been ideal for me and I'm thinking about transitioning into it as soon as this internship is over through a course or a postgraduate program because I am not very bright at coding...but this internship is making me doubt myself every step of the way whether I'll be good for any field...

I have MAJOR anxiety and broke up recently(1 month into my internship).It was a 2.5 year relationship which ended up in him cheating on me and it just added to the problem. I am severly depressed and I feel like this internship is consuming my life. I am not able to cope and put in proper work to even make it till october.I feel this weight on my chest 24/7 and I drown myself in negativity everyday no matter how hard I try to stay optimistic. I am always low on energy and positivity. I have tried to workout in the morning and tried meditating but it only seems to work momentarily. I don't know if I'll be able to get counselling. I think even this huge paragraph can't fully explain the wreck I am right now...My mom does understand my anxiety but she also thinks I am afraid and don't have the ability to cope with it. Which is true but I feel helpless. I am not even able to plan my escape. I clearly suck at taking decisions(took CS even when I should have gone into fine arts or animation, and now took a job that is clearly not for me). I know I am directly responsible for my own choices but I don't know what to do...I dont know how I'm going to transition into ui/ux effectively, I am not able to decide for the course I should be taking and how to go about it...I feel like I am stuck between the past and the future and unable to work for my present...I am the only new intern in this team among my peers, and having a hard time since I am a slow learner and I panic when all the other senior members try to test my knowledge...it is annoying my manager. I am not smart enough for this job. I am not able to communicate to my peers about my mental health and lagging in progress. 
 
My anxiety has worsened with time....I think it also has to do with the fact that I'm not doing what I'm passionate about since highschool (and its common in india) and it has just killed me from inside. I find myself making excuses to my team regularly and I wish sickness upon myself just so I can get a break from it and its only been a week in the team after the initial training..Everyday I decide to do better, I feel mentally exhausted in the end. I try to be hopeful and enduring but fail...sleep is the only peace I know but that also often includes nightmares.. I dont feel like making art or even watch a show that might make me feel better..

I would really appreciate someone sharing any similar experience or just your thoughts on the situation...please, I feel alone and hopeless... I took me 3 hours and alot of tears to write this post.."

I was born and raised in a small farm town. The high school was a joke(didn’t offer AP classes/credits) but my family couldn’t afford to put me into private schooling. I learned nothing and graduated top of my class. 

My idea of studying when I got to college was completely wrong. I simply did not study enough my freshman year and performed poorly. As I was getting my grades up, the pandemic sent all students home and caused my grades to take another hit. 

By the beginning of junior year I had a 2.6 GPA and was behind on credits. I knew I still wanted to go the banking route, so I started doing everything I could to get my grades up. 

Realizing my grades are well below average, I aimed to do my best at improving my GPA and to excel in every other area. I have taken several modeling courses that have taught me how to develop and analyze 3 statement models, M&amp;A models, DCF, etc.

I started networking as if it were a full time job. I began reaching out and scheduling networking interviews with alumni to brief their experiences and offer advice. I have done this now for a little over a year averaging 3 new calls/meetings a week. 

I am actively fine tuning my interview question responses so that any opportunities I get can be well capitalized on. 

My internship/work experience is as follows:
(Freshman Year)
Commercial banking intern

(Sophomore/Covid) 
Co-Founder/COO/CFO of startup that helped brick and mortar businesses stay open by selling online. 

(Junior Year)
Intern under CFO at a large automobile/transportation company 

I will be graduating in May 2022 from a small liberal arts college with a finance degree. (GPA 3.1, semi target). 
What else can I do to improve my chances of getting an analyst position at a solid BB/boutique bank? I am afraid my GPA will hinder me from getting to the interview process at BB. 

Any thoughts, suggestions, critiques would be greatly appreciated. 


tl;dr 
I am rising senior at a semi target school looking for advice on how to make up for a below average GPA."

I want to quit my job that literally makes me so miserable and burnt out but I'm worried. I would have enough to live but the idea of not making money is just making me feel worthless.

Has anyone ever attended Hdip at UCC?

I am an international student entering this year and I am hoping to switch to a Masters in Computing through the HDip program as my undergraduate degree is not in Computing. I am facing a few issues as follows.

1. The requirement for progression to Computing at UCC is a first class honours degree i.e. 70% or above, I would like to ask if this is difficult and what percentage of students will be able to meet this requirement?

2. Can I apply for a Masters in Computing at other Irish schools after studying HDip at UCC?

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to this, I have also been offered a place at UL ，Master of Science in Software Development: International Systems FT. I am worried that there are not many internship opportunities in the area so I am still hesitant.

No social skill - when someone starts talking to me most of the time I don't know what to answer. I don't know how to start conversation and break the ice. I'm not the best in reading the mood and what other people might try to imply.

I’m a third-year (currently 6th semester) computer science engineering student from South India(Kerala) aspiring to be enrolled in any of the following programs.

I want to know my chances of getting into MiM programs: LBS, LSE, Imperial, UCL, INSEAD, ESCP, HEC Paris, Ross.

Moreover, I’m also seriously considering the deferred MBA programs of HBS, Stanford, MIT Sloan, Yale SOM, Kellogg, Darden, Columbia.  


Please let me know the other B-Schools that I should apply to after reading my profile. I’m open to suggestions. 

**Career goals:** want to make my way into PE/VC/HF. That's the end goal btw.

**Academic grades:**

10th Grade: 100% (Full A+ in all subjects)

12th Grade: 99% (Computer Science major; got 100% in Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics)

Undergrad: B.Tech Computer Science from APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University, Kerala.

CGPA: 9.67/10 (up to the fourth semester) 

**Internship experience:** 

None. Although I’ve done a Campus Ambassador Internship for the International Model United Nations(don’t know if it counts) for about a month. I’ve also done some virtual experience programs on a platform called Forage (formerly InsideSherpa) from Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, KPMG, and Citi.

**Achievements:**

Awarded with Full Fee Scholarship for excellence in academics by AICTE, New Delhi.

Awarded with Central Sector Scholarship by Govt. of Kerala for excellence in academics.

Won Rashtrapati Scouts &amp; Guides award certified by the Honorable President of India.

**Volunteering Experience:**

Volunteered as a fundraiser for Youth NGO in India aimed at the betterment of orphans.

**Certification courses:** 

I got the following certifications from Coursera.

Building Your Leadership Skills - HEC Paris

Blockchain Transformations of Financial Services - INSEAD 

Finance For Everyone: Value - McMaster University

International Security Management - Erasmus University Rotterdam

**Expected GMAT score:** 760 (prep in the beginning phase)

I come from a really low socio-economic background. But I don’t want that one factor to stop me from achieving my goals. I’m well aware that the reputation of the university that I’m attending is going to put a dent in my application. It’s not even close to the reputation of any premier institutes of India. But it’s fairly popular in Kerala. 

The second would be the internship experience. Again, coming from a non-target school does have its major downsides, and as a cherry on top COVID made it almost impossible to get an internship. Even if I managed to get it, my academic terms are pushed to the semester breaks. So, it would be like doing an internship while balancing the entire engineering coursework which is impossible especially if you have classes from 9 AM to 5 PM. 

P.S: Even though I'm attending a tier-3 university, the engineering coursework is more or less the same and comparable to other state universities within the country.

Please provide me with valuable insights into my profile and areas of improvement."

With all the politics and economists talking about the ""jobs of the future"" and how millions will lose their jobs, 4th industrial revolution etc, i ended up enrolling in one of those government programms to reskill people from other fields. 

The bootcamp is complete, about 6 months, around 100 hours HTML+CSS+JS, around 75 SQL, around 275 C# and then about 200 hours of everything together.

Now im waiting to start working as an intern for 3 months, as part of the bootcamp conclusion. Starting around June 1st.

The thing is, i dont like this enough to study on free will, i always have to force myself. I finished with a just below average grade. When i complete something or solve a problem, im relieved, not happy or even excited for the next problem.

I just want to earn a decent living, but im not inclined to write code for 8 hours straight. 

Has anyone felt like this and kept going? 

Or found something in the field more to their own liking?

Im afraid i may not be cut out for this, but im 35, not much time left for another change."

* three-month-long internship in finance is the only internship experience I have --&gt; no tech internship
* Have two semesters left till (early) graduation (I only have about 20 credits left to fulfill, so the two semesters that are left will be pretty chill --&gt; lots of time to work on interview practices/portfolio)
* decently interested in NLP that I'm willing to stay at school for extra 2-3 semesters for a masters in NLP

My goal is to land at one of the **big tech** companies so that I can apply for **green card** asap. Following are the two options I have in terms of graduation and getting a job: 

**1)** graduate early (in three years) as planned, but take one semester off before graduation so that I can get some internship experience in my home country + work on personal projects and leetcode, 
*OR* **2)** graduate in 4 years like everyone else and get internship experience in the US + a concurrent masters

If I choose to follow option 1, then I would have more time to work on my personal projects and leetcode while *still* getting some internship experience (which I heard is important when trying to get a job), but I wouldn't be able to do an internship in the states at big companies like my classmates do (due to visa issues). 

If I choose option 2, then I *would* be able to do an internship in the states (which def would be a plus for jobs), but I would have to stay at school for two to three more semesters for a degree that I'm not 100% sure I need/want. But I guess even if I do the master's I'll still graduate in four years, so not much I'm losing here, except money. (I have an external scholarship lined up that would partially fund me through my master's, but it would still hurt me a lot financially)

Here are some questions I have:

1. Does any of you know if non-US internships (most likely at a start-up) ""count"" at all and hold similar significance as internships at big companies in the US?

2. Is it realistic to think that I can get an offer at big tech without an internship in the US but with a great portfolio of personal projects and interview performance (+ decent GPA at a top 10 school + referral)? Or should I be safe and just follow the traditional route of doing an internship and graduating in four years?

3. Any advice?

I'm desperate for any advice and help. Please let me know if you need more info on my situation. Thank you!"

I recently (like \~1 week ago) graduated from college with CS and Applied Physics degree. This is an excuse but during my senior year of college COVID hit and I pretty much wasted time. I did well in school (3.92/4.0 GPA), but I haven't been practing on leetcode/codesignal/hackerrank/etc. Now that I've graduated, I've pretty much been working on them nonstop for almost every day, but I'm still hesitant on my qualifications. Thankfully I had 6 month of internship in the past, but these coding challenges are really demoralizing and makes me feel like I haven't learned much in college. I've been looking around and applying to entry-level jobs but I'm honestly, really scared for the coding challenges.

So my question is should I still be applying to jobs while I'm practicing coding challenges? Because if I do get some anytime soon, I would just fail them right away.

Thank you for reading and sorry for the rant."

I pretty much have been in love with computers and technology since I was a kid. Everyone came to me to help fix their issues and I'm not going to lie, some of my resolved issues came from Google which I have then learned over the years. I had a big senior project of which I chose computers where I would take apart a computer and put it all back together and made sure it worked. After I graduated high school, I was given the opportunity to join an internship with the county's IT service and learned a lot in the short 3 months I was there (how I wish I had that job again). I then decided it was time to use that money I saved up from my internship to build myself a nice gaming computer back in 2013. So, I can pretty much build and take a part a computer with little to no troubles. I also attended a community college for IT but only successfully completed one year on the dean's list due to depression hitting me hard my 2nd year. I can pretty much fix software issues and I understand a TINY bit of coding (which in college, was my favorite class out of them all). Years later of being unhappy with any job I had, I decided to finally go for my A+ because I wanted my dream job. However, I am stuck. I do not have very much experience in Networking or Security, so of course they are my weakness. I was told by a former coworker to check out Professor Messer and I did. I took a week to study 1001 using Professor Messer's notes and videos and now I'm taking practice tests. I have noticed that some of the stuff on the practice tests, he did not cover in his notes/videos and I'm having to learn those things via those practice tests. I'm curious now if these practice tests are even accurate. Not to mention, I am terrible on the Networking and Security questions. I have no idea how to better prepare myself for these questions. I also browsed this reddit beforehand and I've noticed some people are saying there are PBQs and I went to the COMPTIA website and tried a sample and sure enough, it's networking related, my weakness. I have no idea what I am doing or how to do it. So, I need advice on getting more accurate practice questions and help with PBQs that contain networking and security.   


TLDR: I suck at Networking and Security and I am stuck trying to advance in preparation for the A+ exam. Any advice/help?"

This is a follow up to my previous post today and I wanted to share my experience with the community who have tremendously helped me in this journey. 

A bit of background: I am a second year university student studying computer science. I am currently on an internship with a Cyber security firm where I got introduced to this industry and basically fell in love with it to say the least. The internship also prompted me to for the Security+ certification. 

I have been studying on and off for a couple of months now and started to concentrate more the past few weeks. I have been using resources from Jason Dion (course and practice exams) Professor Messer (course and practice exams). Darril Gibson's book is a MUST HAVE and will compliment the other resources mentioned above.

To whoever is doing the exam in the near future. DO NOT BE INTIMIDATED BY IT. I was a nervous wreck before the exam started and the exam is wired in a way to make you think you are losing but you are actually not. Also like everyone else mentioned flagging the PBQs until the very end helped me extremely. Had over 30 minutes at the end to go back over all the questions so I highly recommend doing that. I just want to say a big thank you to the whole community here for helping me get started on this Security journey. I hope to go straight into a security job upon graduation next year (idk how realistic that is)"

I am looking for advice on career prospects and education, I’ll throw in as much information as possible.

**Background:**

* 23yo German national studying abroad
* Intl. Relations BSc in The Netherlands
* University with a decent reputation.
* Study with a strong focus on Research, e.g. Data Analysis/Statistics, quite intangible/not directly applicable to work field (more on this later)

**Languages:**

* Fluent English, German
* Mediocre French and Spanish -&gt; can be improved quickly as I pick it up quite fast
* Learning Dutch right now

**Interests:**

* Open-source Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence
* Foreign and domestic politics
* Finance/Business
* Like to engage with people, but don’t mind some time in front of a computer
* Policy implementation -&gt; but growingly frustrated how slow bureaucracy moves
* Huge outdoor sports guy, working in that field may also suit me well

**Strengths:**

* Quick-thinking analytical mind
* Good debater and speaker
* Relatively good writer
* Good at adopting new skills and knowledge

**Weaknesses:**

* Very mediocre STEM skills
* Little to no experience at coding - a tiny bit of Data Analysis stuff (mostly R)
* No extracurricular activity during study -&gt; weak CV
* Lack of internship experience
* Can be overwhelming in character
* Need clear goal and path to keep up motivation 

**Work experience:**

* Worked as volunteer youth coordinator for a local organization 
* Worked as volunteer football referee years ago.
* Gap year job as a Cashier
* Summer job as Forklift driver
* Summer job at the local Ministry of Finance, mainly administrative stuff

**Current situation:**

In my second year (out of 3yrs) of studies. Was doing quite good until Covid hit. Only did a few courses since then. Growing frustration and fear of a future of working as a slave in bureaucracy. Do not really know what to do, no clear goal/career path in life. Lack of hard skills and interdisciplinary nature of study further complicates matters. Feel like IR is an academic circle jerk, a lot of talking in the midst of more or less scientific approaches with little application to “real-life scenarios”. My financial situation is getting worse, IR does not really help, finding a part-time job with an IR BSc degree is nearly impossible. No debt so far, studying in EU is affordable, but may need a loan soon, hence a part-time job, preferably tied to study.

**Prospects/Plans:**

* Ideally increase work exp./internships
* Create purpose for myself/goal
* Find alternatives to study and start all over again OR continue study with focus on extracurricular activities
* Looked into business management/entrepreneurship in contrast to pure economics/econometrics as my mathematical strengths are a bit underdeveloped

***Summary/Questions:***

* Which majors/undergrads may fit my profile?
* How useful is an IR undergrad with the competition in the field?
* What extracurricular activity should I ideally combine my studies with?
* Have you had similar experiences and if so, which path did you choose?
* Are there any relatively well-paying job prospects out there and if so, where to find them?

We are going to be choosing our project soon. The company is using mainly WAMP stack (Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP), but they also have other projects in React, Swift, and Go.

My college classes were in C++ and Java but I never paid attention. I always studied Python on my own due to easy syntax and always solved interview questions and did my small projects in Python.

I will be graduating after this internship. I don't know if I want to be a front-end or back-end dev yet. All I want at the moment is to get a good-paying jr dev role in a non-toxic company after graduation and start from there.

Should I try to get a project in Python to just master my Python skills which I will be using in my interviews and have real-life experience, or should take advantage of this internship to learn a language that I've never seen before like Go language that I would procrastinate to go learn on my own otherwise?

Currently have an offer from an Electrical Engineering start up in my local area that seems to have pitched a good offer my way but I was hoping to receive some input from more experienced individuals. I recently graduated from a smaller university with a 3.6 GPA with a degree in CS and will finish my bachelors in computational mathematics this summer. I have two years tutoring  CS experience and a year long Automation Engineer Internship.

The Job Duties: Control System Integration, Power System Integration,  HMI &amp; PLC Programming, and SCADA Development and Design. I was told I will be involved in every stage of the process from actually designing and building the control systems to programming the  HMI &amp; PLC systems. (To me this seems like a more computer engineering position, which I personally have no problem with however I would like to make sure it is good experience). 

Some of the pros include: There is only two individuals at the company both of which are extremely nice and down to earth individuals (one is a P.E in electrical engineering with 15+ years of industry experience (the owner) and the others has a masters in enterprise systems that has been with the company 3 years), the company has been around 4 years and is expanding due to getting more private sector and government contracts (My initial thoughts are that they seem like a qaulity company with quality products).  I would be able to work with tools (big plus for me as I am a hands on type of guy), and I already feel like I could be friends with the other two workers. For logistics they also gave me an above average starting salary for my state for entry level computer science grads, 18 paid days off, medical insurance, free continuing education classes through Rockwell Automation, free classes to eventually take the Fundamentals of engineering exam (F.E) (which the company will also pay for), and the chance to work under a P.E and eventually take the P.E exam at no cost to myself. One thing to note is Computer Science jobs are also somewhat scarce in my area. The owner also discussed the possibility of part ownership down the line and the final point I can think of is that they mentioned that I could work overtime if I would like, however it is optional. 

Some of the cons include: The main thing I see here is how applicable this is to CS. Is there concerns if all of my job doesn't involve code? In addition the company is a start up so the company could boom or bust, however I am young and have no one to look out for other than myself. I mainly just want to make sure I can gain some more experience.

Would this be a good entry level job if I don't have any other offers?"

I am a student at UTD and work for a company called Erecycler. Feel free to look us up and check out our website. We are looking for students interested in part-time work, full-time work, or an internship. Specifically, we are looking for someone who can test and prep electronics such as laptops, networking equipment, printers, monitors, projectors, servers, etc... We prefer that you have some knowledge about hardware and that you have basic mechanical skills (taking equipment apart). But this is an entry level position and quick learners and self starters are absolutely welcome to shoot me a message. For more details you can send me a message and if you could tell me a bit about yourself and why you think you would be a good fit for this position that would be greatly appreciated!

Freshman and sophomore students are also welcome."

i really need some advice before i commit though. i don't necessarily need a job but the pay isn't bad and i feel like apple isn't a bad company for my resume. but honestly for a CS major like me, is a job like this going to be that nice on my resume? or should i focus my efforts more on internships??

sorry for all the questions + thanks for any help"

I got reject from CS, but still going with my second choice (bba/math). I want advice and insight on getting a swe co-op with my major because having some swe experience is needed in quant finance. Also just getting a first year co-op in general because after looking at this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/miu9wf/1b_first_year_employment_statistics_w_2021_as_of/) it got me a bit nervous as only 20% got first year co-op for my major. I am learning phyton and c right now and my goal is to have a personal project at least started by the end of summer. I looked into swe internships for first years like google step, explore mirosoft, *Amazon* Future Engineer, as well as some gta companies, but I am sure its gonna be hard to stand out competing with cs majors. if anyone can provide tips on how to stand out for swe as well as just getting a co op for first year it'll be much appreciated. Thank you everyone"

I'm here because I wanted to receive advice about my current situation &amp; internship searching. I posted in  r/internships but I thought I'd post here as well for more wisdom.

\-

I'm currently a junior going to uni in Los Angeles.

I applied to couple dozen of internships for this summer, but I don't seem to have any luck so far.

I want to go into the entertainment industry, which I know is competitive, but I can't help but feel like I'm doing something wrong after receiving rejection after rejection. I try applying to places but I feel so so discouraged and don't know what to do. :(

With May coming to a close, should I keep applying or give up and prepare for Fall instead? If so, how should I prepare?

Also, any advice on maintaining a good mindset during internship searching? I want to stop feeling discouraged &amp; demotivated. :(

Thank you in advance &amp; any advice is greatly appreciated!"
ngn8hm,2,2021-05-19,Apparently im doing the right thing but nothing seems to be working out for me,highfriend90,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ngn8hm/apparently_im_doing_the_right_thing_but_nothing/,"I volunteered for the past 3 years, graduated college, did some internships, looking for work every day, nope cant find anything

I pay school to help me with my driving so i can get my license, guys leaves half way through the lesson for vacation, school dosnt give me a refund or anything. I try a different school, instructor refuses to let me practice on what i feel i needs improvement

Friends and family will tell me they will offer me help with something that needs more then one person, so when i bring it up with them i get no nows not a good time maybe next time.. After asking about 3 times or more i remind them it was their idea to offer the help and let me know when will be a good time for them i never hear them bring up the subject again.

I cut someone off from my life because after saying no nearly a dozen times i dont want to hook up with him, my friends who keep in contact with him either tell me all about him when i dont ask or hint i should give him another chance..

My dad tells me before he passes away hell make sure il be taken care of, expect he leaves everything to his partner and she basically wants nothing to do with me as soon as possible.. 

I feel like im trying to take steps in the right direction but i never get the outcome i hope for.. If im doing something wrong i would like some tell me but ive had many people tell me your doing the right thing just having some bad luck,"

ngpdm2,2,2021-05-19,Jr Front-End Engineer - How do I approach asking higher pay?,jacksquare3266,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ngpdm2/jr_frontend_engineer_how_do_i_approach_asking/,"This is my first post so I'm not sure where to start, I apologize for the long essay of unorganized thoughts but I need some guidance.

Some background, I've (24 M) been working at this company in NYC for over 16 months now (8 months intern, 8 months full time). We are understaffed with 5 developers doing work for a relatively large company. 1 dev in charge of email newsletter templates, 1 in charge of pagination of websites, 1 in charge of specific content of pages (for ex: article pages), 1 in charge on mobile apps, something entirely different than what the rest of the team is working on, 1 who's a fullstack dev and who is also our team manager. He recently got promoted to be our manager so he has no idea about my official position. And then there's me, who works on all the other tasks that don't have a category.

I started as an Intern with no title, and started learning on the job as a web developer. I was working with email newsletter templates, and learned the ropes pretty quickly. Only one dev is in charge of the newsletters, and ever since I joined then, it gave him room to breathe. He and our project manager had a lot of praise for me even though I felt like this part of the job was on the easier and smaller scale, but I took the recognition as a good sign of course.

After the internship was over, they offered me a full time position as a Jr. Front-End Engineer, and this is where my growth really began and I've learned a whole bunch of skills. I moved on to bigger projects with website maintenance/redesigns and have definitely grew as a developer.

Well long story short, I think that I've become a valuable asset to the team and I wasn't sure if I could ask for a much higher salary. Of course I'm looking to be promoted but I don't know how much more they would give me realistically.

My offer was $52k annually, and I accepted it right away without counter-offering because I was afraid of losing this opportunity. But now that I've gained more experience and I'm comfortable with what's thrown at me, I'm seeking for a higher reward, and not just a 5k-10k increase. I'm looking for at least $80k, or hell maybe even $75k. But my problem is that this is a HUGE jump from $52k, and I'm not sure how to bring this up.

I know that I'm a valuable asset to the company because we are understaffed, so without me, they will definitely be flooded with work. I'm also the backup dev for the email newsletters too, so the main newsletter dev will have no back-up dev since I'm the only other person who knows how to work with them.

Another problem is, I don't really have an assigned ""role"" before my request. Each dev has their own role as listed above, but I work on many tasks that aren't really specific, although they are not minor. I was wondering if this would affect my request.

All in all, my main problem is how to approach requesting for a promotion with a wage from $52k to a massive jump of $80k. I do wish to stay in the company if I can, I don't want to leave them shorthanded, but I also don't want to go into the job hunting phase again.

Thank you for reading my long post, I appreciate any guidance!"

The internship is ten weeks, 40 hours a week, and fully remote.

I have a summer class that I NEED to take that is Mondays and Wednesdays from 12 pm - 3:50 pm. The summer course is a prerequisite for 3 of my courses this upcoming fall semester. The internship is remote and so is the course, but the course is synchronous. I am worried about them pulling my offer because of my availability. I can definitely work the 40-hour workweek, I am just gonna be unavailable during my synchronous sessions of the course twice a week.

ngpyt9,69,2021-05-19,Is it bad not to be special?,nonplaintive,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ngpyt9/is_it_bad_not_to_be_special/,"In all the places I’ve worked at, I’ve never been a special developer. I just finished my work and went home. It’s not that I didn’t care about my work, but I just felt like there were so many more enjoyable things in life to do than work. 

Recently, I was browsing LinkedIn and had a bit of a cry after seeing people who took positions that I had left. For example, I worked as a developer for a professor at my university. I got the project assigned to me done, but I never had a close relationship with the professor, and he never listed me as a student who worked for him. For a long time, I thought he just forgot because he had a lot of students, but I saw all the students he listed were high achievers and seemed like they had a close relationship with the professor from their posts, so maybe he didn’t list me because he thought my work was bad.

I also see students who get internships year after year at the big(5-1) and can’t help but feel like I’m not doing enough. If students can work so hard, am I being a bad adult by not working as hard as them? 

In my professional life, I feel like my bosses would have nothing special to say about me either. I’m just someone who gets my stuff done and goes home. I learn what is needed and stretch myself at times but I don’t have that hardworking “I just started but I’m gonna spend each night going over the codebase” mentality, the kind that bosses love. Yeah I do go over the codebase, but I don’t stress over it. And I do care about my career/promotions and go out to interview, but for me, life is more than a job and the position I hold. Or at least I thought. 

Which is right? Am I missing out? Is it ok to just be a normal developer?"

I'm in CS Y2 going Y3, not the best student by any means, 2nd lowers and very likely below average, but luckily managed to snag an internship at an SME. Don't want to doxx myself further but the company is small, doesn't even have a linkedin page and most people probably haven't heard of it.

When talking about it with my friends, they literally scoffed and said that it's a waste of time, better off just doing projects at home.

I know that my company is small and unknown, but honestly, it's only been 2 weeks and I've learnt quite a bit and been involved in real work projects already, and to add on to that my mentor is really nice and taught me a lot too.

It's not like I didn't try applying for the bigger companies though, I did, and I either got rejected or just ghosted.

I thought getting an internship was supposed to be something good, but their reactions really made me feel like shit tbh.

So   I decided to start Programming in lockdown last year as I knew, that   either I would have to settle for low paying Mechanical job, or low   paying WITCH job...

I started   programming and solved almost majority of Easy and Medium level problems   on hackerrank. I couldnt solve anyfurther as i didnt knew Data   Structures and Algorithms. So I started and completed learning   HTML,CSS,Javascript,Bootstrap.. I couldnt continue further as my   Mechanical Classes started and I soon started to lose interest in Both.

I   posted here few months ago about doing a year long course in Data   Science/ML/AI, but responses were critical. Some said that Companies   hire only Masters students who have research papers of their own in such   roles. One user said that Cloud thing is growing big and doing AWS CSA   or RHCSA would be good enough for a decent paying job. But I love   Machine Learning(Did some projects in college)

The problem is, I dont know where to start and what to start. And I have only little more than two years now.

Should I continue learning Data Structures, but I dont think people would prefer an average Mechanical grad for SDE roles..

I dont want to be a Web Developer

So I decided to start learn basics for AWS CSA. But it required learning Web development..

I dont even know where to start for RHCSA either.

Im   confused af right now and I dont want to end up being jack of all   trades but king of none and be unemployed as I couldnt completely master   a single technology..

What  should be my Approach now? I just want an internship at end of 3rd year  and a Good Cash earning job at end of 4th year, and Im willing to put  any number of hours need.."

As an international student, i'm having trouble securing an internship position in the US due to COVID (able in my home country tho). Might not be able to have a legit summer internship in the US before graduation. Has anyone landed at big tech as a SWE either w/o an internship or only with internships outside of the US? How was your experience/leetcode/portfolio? Did you ever feel like having a great portfolio of personal projects and acing the coding interviews weren't enough without internship experience under your belt? I heard most companies either do not take into consideration or ""downgrade"" non-US work experience.

Also, just out of curiosity, do most students from target schools at least get to phone screening/interview with referral + decent GPA/portfolio? I heard the school name does carry some weight for new grads (tho it doesn't as much after that).

Thank you!"

Just built my little NAS, the mainboard (MSI B550-A Pro AMD B550) has 6 SATA ports, 2 of them are used for 2x Seagate Ironwolf 10TB in RAID 0 and 1 of them is used for a 2.5'' SSD as OS drive.

It has 2x PCI-e 16x and 1x PCI-e 1x, one 16x is used for a low profile AMD FirePro W2100 and one 1x is used for a PCI-e 1x Wifi card (Intel AX200 based). So there is only one PCI-e 16x left on the board.

My case (Corsair Carbide Air 540 Cube) has 2x 3.5'' and 6x 2.5'' drive bays. So there are only 5x 2.5'' drive bays left. The 2x 5.35'' optical drive bays could also be modified to 2x 3.5'' bays, but it need more time.

Now i am planning to buy 5x 5TB Seagate portable disks (Expansion+ Portable 5TB, STEF5000400, 94 EUR for 5TB while it's on sale) and tear them down, get the Barracuda 5TB 2.5'' disks (ST5000LM000, SMR, with 128MB Cache) out of their cases and put them into my Corsair Cube as another 25 TB RAID 0.

And the problem is, there are only 3 SATA ports left on the mainboard. So I need a expansion card for at least 4 (or more) SATA ports (2 for 2x Barracuda 5TB 2.5'', 2 for 2x 3.5'' in 2x 5.35'' bays in the future)

Any suggestions for a good SATA expansion card with PCI-e x16 and as many intern SATA ports as possible? As I know this mainboard (MSI B550-A Pro AMD B550) has no onboard RAID controler.

So as the title of the post says, From the last few weeks I've been really confused about what web framework should I choose in order to grow and get a job after 1-2 years. Recently I completed one internship in which I worked on .NET Core but .NET wasn't that much interesting to me since I don't like the Microsoft Environment and also the number of jobs/internships in .NET Core are very few in my country (India). 

I already had some knowledge of Flask Framework before I applied to my internship, So I started learning Django thinking It would be somehow similar but it was not, and integrating a simple react project with Django backend project is taking me hours. 

Which web framework should I choose? Some of the most popular/trending web frameworks/languages which are used in backend development  I can think of are Golang, Laravel, Node/Express, Ruby On Rails, etc."
ngyl3e,1,2021-05-20,"Masters in Cyber Security, 2022",im3rck,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/ngyl3e/masters_in_cyber_security_2022/,"Hey everyone,

I'm a computer science undergrad going into my final year soon, looking to do a masters in cyber security.   
Yes, I've seen people advising others on how it's experience that matters in cyber security and  a masters won't provide them with any boost in their immediate career. But in my country, security not seen a fundamental field yet, so, my opportunities are extremely limited, so going to a university in a foreign country is my best chance of getting to where I want to be in a few years. 

**My profile at present is:**

I have a decent GPA atm, 8.9/10 (with three semesters to go), and hold a Certified Penetration Tester Certificate from a local Academy. I'll be giving my CCNA soon, and probably do an RHCSA afterwards. Started the first CTF and security group in my college, and that's going pretty well. Under a startup Cybersecurity firm, I am the founding member of a Cyber Security community that has over 60 members and  we are actively carrying out trainings and national level events. Presently I'm a part of the R&amp;D Management team for the same.   
Have a 2 month internship experience and should probably be able to get one more by the time I apply (this fall).

**Universities:**

Planning to apply for a masters in US and UK.

In USA, my choices at the moment are: 

1. CMU - ambitious and expensive
2. USC  - expensive
3. NEU -  my favorite choice 
4. Columbia (CS - Security track) - profs looked amazing

In UK, my choices are:

1. Imperial College - ambitious 
2. UCL - Heard a lot of great stuff about the information security department there
3. Warwick - Had a chat with a prof, seemed nice
4. Manchester
5. Royal Holloway -  1 year Internship program 

Another choice I have in mind is applying for a Cyber Security Graduate program at the Big4 in the UK, their requirements aren't demanding but I don't know if they'll sponsor a VISA (they say they do on the website). If I do get in, I'll probably take this over a masters degree. 

Am I doing the right thing? Please give me your view on my decisions so far.   
Should I consider another path? If yes, please tell me about the same.   
It would be great if you could suggest any other uni I may have missed out.  


Thank you for your time."

After a few days i got contacted by email saying i made it to the 2nd interview and that i would be with the head of the IT department.

From what I understood by the first call, this 2nd interview isn't gonna be more technical but rather more on the save fine as the first one just with different people, but I'm still kinda freaking out that i might choke it.

This is my first job interview for this sort of role, does anyone have any experience with this type of interviews ? What should I expect?

What would you do?,sswbud,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/nh3hcd/i_just_got_the_strangest_counter_offer_from_my/,"Back story- I’m 22. Still have a semester of college. I started working at a construction company as a marketing/design intern and was hired full time after. Recent leadership changes have driven me to see what else is out there. I was lucky enough to get 6 offers, accepted what seems like the perfect one, and am supposed to start Monday. 

Today, my boss (CEO) called me to his office with the strangest counter offer I could’ve imagined. He said he’s been looking for his next investment opportunity and would like to make me a partner. He essentially wants to pay me a stable salary (higher than the other job) and fund everything needed to start a digital marketing agency. No cost to me. Over time, I’d have the opportunity buy him lol out/some of his equity. It would stay in our office as it scales, but eventually become its own, totally separate entity. Problem is, half of the reason I’m leaving is because our office is super toxic and I’m not a huge fan of the way the company operates. 

I know I’m only 22 and have nothing really to lose, so I want to say yes, but I also have a new, stable opportunity elsewhere with a much better environment and leadership. One of my friends made a good point and said that the fact that I didn’t jump at the opportunity as soon as I heard it says that I should turn it down, but I also know I’ll never have an opportunity like this again. I know it could be great and I could really build something, but it could also crash and I will have burnt a bridge with the other company for nothing. 

What would you do in my position?

nh3uiw,0,2021-05-20,Is it just me or is Ruby a really annoying language?,Redditor000007,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/nh3uiw/is_it_just_me_or_is_ruby_a_really_annoying/,"I’ve been picking up the basics lately and everything has just been so frustrating. Im coming from Python.

In no particular order,

1. Ambiguous imports (like c)

When you import something in Python, if you want to see exactly what you’ve added you can ctrl-click into that library (I.e datetime) and see what is being offered and how. In ruby you just require a string that you’d presumably need to google.

2. Million ways of doing a single thing.

I hate how if I want to iterate through an array there are so many ways that look so different but do the same thing.

For example,
```
for x in arr
  Puts x
End

arr.each do |x|
  Puts x
End

arr.each { |x| puts x}

```

I’m not sure why the same way of doing something exists threefold except to make reading code from different developers with different preferences more confused.

3. The for x..y syntax is so ambiguous

I feel like I’m going to have to google this ruby range syntax every time I use it but in what way is it intuitive that 1..2 means range [1,2] and 1…3 means range [1,3)?


Python just makes this so much easier - you have a single range function that is inclusive exclusive, so range(1,3) you just always know the 3 will be excluded.

4. Random style conventions like ?

When you define a method, you can for whatever reason, add a “?” To it like

```

Def print_hello?()
End

```

And the kicker is that is a strictly a naming convention and there is no enforcement of a Boolean return value (as it is commonly used). So in this case it feels like someone just thought this would be cool and someone could use it if they wanted for style purposes, but all this does IMV is to make code less centralized and less consistent, which is bad for developers who are reading other people’s code.

5. Why is there not a builtin way of sorting in reverse order?

6. .intern and .to_sym - just why

7. Why can you call a method (with no parameters) with or without `()`, just why

I’m not even done learning it so I’m sure there are more issues I’m not aware of.

Tldr, hate ruby"

My first concern is security having multiple users logging into the same account and with everyone remote and new interns coming onboard I’m constantly resetting and unlocking accounts as they hit the workspace security filters.

I initially thought I could make the interns their own accounts   And add them into collaborative inbox groups in google workspace, thinking this would solve the issue. Only to find out that there is no simple way to use that address as an outbound address it’s still just an internal inbox. 

Does anyone have any ideas or can share your experience with intern accounts? 

Ideally I would have individual user accounts for each user, and then something like a collaborative inbox that would allow for outbound mail so that everyone in the group has access to the email content on the inbox."

I've been working as a developer for a year and I've been in 3 companies already. This year has been quite complicated career wise.

The first job I landed was an internship at a German company that after 3 months I left because I was learning nothing, then at this company I went they game me, a fresh out of the bootcamp junior developer, a whole angular node project that had to be done in 2 months, in the end I couldn't finish even though I worked on weekends and evenings. 

After being fired, I got hired at a startup as a junior dev, people here were making crazy hours, developers were getting fired pretty quickly, and I was pretty stressed out by that. 4 months passed and a new boss came in and everything was going good but all of a sudden i started making a lot of mistakes, and finally I got fired this last week. I think I'm burned out to be honest and I don't know what to do my CV looks kind of bad. What can I do now? Any ideas?

Thanks in advance."

Please let me know if it does. I just found this subreddit earlier this week and after the last couple of weeks of my life, I felt I needed to share this with all of you.""


So story time. A few months back, a groups of good friends and I were having weekly Zoom chats during the main part of the pandemic since many of us were stuck home or working from home and used it as a chance to reconnect. Well, in the conversation I mentioned that a running joke about me was always that I had undiagnosed ADHD because I've always NOTORIOUSLY been the definition of complete (though it's been increasingly barely) controlled chaos. Thought patterns and conversation directions firing off in an unstoppable sequence. I've been infamous for not being able to sit still and becoming very anxious when I have to. I grew up constantly being yelled at for making my family feel sea sick just sitting in the couch with me because my leg is always just going up and down like a piston. I have always had trouble focusing and reading and often when my brain feels overwhelmed I get mentally exhausted VERY quickly which is also accompanied with absolutely surging anxiety and panic. Like in Grad school, I'd sit down with massive quantities of caffeine, and a full night of sleep and try to write a 30 page research paper but 2 paragraphs in, I'm yawning and my mind is so burnt out and I'm staring off into space for an hour. 

So back to the zoom call. When I said that people always joked about my undiagnosed ADHD, one of my friends who I will call ""Beth"" for this case, is a special education specialist and teaching many children with various disorders and conditions. She looks at me and with a confused says, ""Wait,  you never were diagnosed with it? Like you never have spoken to a doctor about it?"" When I confirmed that, her response was shocked. She said that she assumed I had been diagnosed. She's known me for years and we've spent countless hours together. And she said she always just figured it was a known thing that I had it especially because now she teaches some kids with severe ADD &amp; ADHD and told me I showed worse symptoms than many of them. 

Here is the problem. I never actually seriously considered talking to a doctor or anyone really about it. I thought that was just me. As a kid, I was always hyperactive, and I struggled greatly to read and do school work. Not because I couldn't read. I was always reading books and articles written for adults. But because when I did, it would sometimes take me three hours to get through the same page. I'd have to reread it 20 times because I'd keep day dreaming and loosing track of where I was or realize that my brain was so all over the place that what I just read didn't even register. It was frustrating and I felt like I tried so hard but kept being told I didn't do it or couldn't finish because I wasn't ""applying myself"" or because I ""was lazy."" I even had a English teacher in Highschool when I was in the advanced English track come down so hard on me regularly. Everyone in the class noticed that she seemed to have it in for me. She told me at the end of the year she was extra hard on me because she thought I was her smartest student and I didn't have the grades others did because I was lazy. But when I feel like I have nothing left to give, when I'm burning myself out each day, then how am I supposed to ""not be lazy."" In college I struggled in the more rigid and traditional core classes. And it was irritating because during class discussions I always felt like I could out shine or out debate anyone in my classes. I knew my shit. But I struggled with studying and exams. 

Then I went to Grad school to get my Masters degree in Political Science and Global Policy. Now grad school (depending on what you go for) is anything but traditional. It is BRUTAL and grueling work but the structure is nowhere near as rigid (though I'd imagine in hard sciences and math it still is more traditional). Now, much of the classes were group discussion based, presentation based and then the big one writing papers. Class discussions were easy enough. And giving speeches and presentations is something I've always been good at doing. And in my head, as long as I imagined that I was just giving a performance of some kind like an actor on a stage, I was less likely to lose my place. I've been fascinated and interested in politics, government affairs and global policy since I was very young. More often than not, I had a decent enough knowledge base becauae various documentaries, news articles and such that I consumed anyway that I kind of knew at least a little about most things that would come up in conversation. And what I didn't know, I'd let other people in my class speak up for a few minutes and was genuinely quite good at using context clues to figure out exactly what was said in the readings and bullshit my ass off (my family can tell you that I've always had a gift for talking my way around, and through people and situations. I have a golden tongue) and never once had anyone suspect I didn't even own the text book let alone didn't do the readings. Thankfully many of the Professors I had also used articles and policy reports which are much shorter (just a few pages) so I'd be able to get through that before the next class easily. 

For the Papers I knew I'd have to get creative. I always put the ""Pro"" in procrastination and often times when I got to Grad school I vowed to get things done ahead of schedule and be a better student. I still believed the lie that I just was lazy and not applying my full efforts. But it was so hard to get going on writing and then when I did, I'd feel so burnt out just a page in, often even less. I had to go to extreme lengths to almost ""hack myself"" to get production. I'd be slamming hundreds of milligrams of caffeine, along with having a tv on, and music playing. The caffeine often helped in two way with the first being staving off the pending exhaustion for even just a critical precious few minutes of work. The second, because when ever I had coffee or an energy drink, a lot of my intrusive and anxious thoughts calmed down a little bit, even though no one believed me about that either and thought I was just making excuses for liking energy drinks and coffee.  

By working this way, it's just a couple of things that could distract me and I'd eventually cycle back to my paper. I'm lucky I was a decent writer when it came to research and policy papers and that I enjoyed it because I almost always knew to start automatically deducting points from my grade when I pulled all nighters and still turn the paper in a bit late. And that was literally how I got through grad school. I graduated, got my Masters degree with a decent GPA and moved on to my internship where I was also able to sort of use these tactics because we didn't have meetings every day and my reports and such could be done from home and sent in. But now that I'm working full-time in a pressure filled office political office that works in international relations and I literally have had zero of those coping tactics available. I can't blast music or put a tv on, or stop and play video games for 30 minutes or even take naps while at work. And coupling that with the inter-office pressures from higher ups who demand results and sometimes unrealistic deadlines and perfection, I've been extremely despondent and depressed the last couple of months. This feeling of not being able to do this job or field anymore, and always having my brain speed ahead to the worst possible outcomes of how each day could go. 

So I was talking to another very close friend of mine who is a wonderful human being but also a professional psychologist/therapist. While we were hanging out and I was telling her how bad things have been, she stopped me and stressed that she agreed with my other friend who said they thought I've had undiagnosed conditions and that as long as she has known me, she's seen that I'm capable of far more than I've been able to do. She told me that I genuinely fit the textbook example of someone who has had unchecked ADHD and she really thought I should speak to someone specifically about that. I had been in therapy before and have long been treated for a depression disorder. But I had a lot of extremely hard and difficult things going on in my life so I never even thought to discuss this specific thing. I genuinely thought it stemmed from being just stressed or whatever and that I was just as others had said, not applying myself fully. Well, our mutual friend who was sitting there with us, offered to ask her psychiatrist if she could take me on and give me an appointment. Which brings me to this past Friday. 

For what felt like hours, I spoke in depth with this psychiatrist and she evaluated me, spoke with me, we covered a lot of ground including my childhood and traumas and hardships I've experienced etc. Then she started asking me pointed questions. And making asking questions like if I, ""Do this like that, or forget this stuff here and feel a certain way when X,Y, &amp; Z happens."" And she was essentially describing my day to day life to perfection. She told me I most definitely have ADHD and she said, ""I want to tell you, that you aren't lazy. You don't need to apply yourself more. You're not stupid. You're brain is just wired differently than a lot people think everyone is supposed to be, and that's really okay. In fact it's remarkable you've accomplished and made it as far as you have with no treatment or or support with this and you should see that as proof that clearly you're none of those things."" 

I couldn't stop crying after hearing that. Literally almost 29 years of suffering and struggle and frustration and anger and panic was finally validated. I wanted to share this story albeit it's a long one. Because it's a real story of self-discovery. I began treatment already, this past weekend and these last few days have been mind-blowing. I asked a friend just talk to me about random shit just so I could show off that I could focus and listen to them. At work, I stopped making little mistakes and even more importantly, I'm catching the mistakes when I try to proofread which I always seemed to miss. I'm not constantly worried about having enough time to do things. It's been just so liberating to just begin the processing dealing with this. Just a couple of weeks ago, I was convinced all my work was for nothing and I just wasnt cut out for this career and passion that I have worked so damn hard to build and begin.  I feel so much more hopeful about my future, and so much more positive and confident about myself as a person. I know I have a very long road to go Imy mental health recovery, especially in unlearning all of the self-loathing, social anxiety and general poor view of myself that came from a lot of the struggles I talked about in this post. And I know this is just the beginning of treatment and that it will take some work to really refine things to where I'm thriving, instead of just merely surviving. But so far, the start has made me feel like I've honestly been reborn and beginning a new life. So I really wanted to share this with whoever reads this, and tell people, just how important it is to address and take care of your mental health. If you can, find and seek out a professional, even if you just supect you may need help. I can't even begin to describe just how much of your life could change for the better once you do. I love you all. Once again, I'm sorry if this post is not what is really allowed or appreciated here. I just found this subreddit after my diagnosis and felt compelled to share this part of my story."

I sat in my office and struggled to focus. Everyone around me was some kind of brain dead ridiculous peon without a single innovative thought in their meandering flesh sacks that they called their bodies.

I stared at the walls. Covered in plaques. Awards. Framed pictures of me with all the people who had come to appreciate everything that was my legacy. What had these people ever done? What had any of them ever done but ride my coattails to a place of success and worth?

This office was a testament. Proof that I was the best that there ever was. The best that there ever could be. Everyone else was a pale imitation of my genius. I can't believe that they even had the audacity to share this same place as me. The nerve to walk into this building. My shrine. Then pretend that they were even worth half the amount of the dirt that collected on the bottom of my shoe. 

I had created worlds beyond what these sheep could have ever begun to comprehend. I was the engineer. The designer. The creator. I was everything that they all simply wished they could be. Useless slaves to a wage is all they were. 

I stared at some of the memorabilia along the wall. Replications and inspirations that had been part of my creative process. Pieces of actual history that had only ever had one purpose. To fuel my creative and perfect genius. They had sat for hundreds of years after being created. Waiting for their true purpose that was set in time. Their only real destiny. 

I got up from my desk and walked to a blade. It was an ancient sword that had cost me an exorbitant amount of money. It was used in some ridiculous something or another. I don't know. I wasn't paying attention when the historian gave me the whole story along with a bunch of other nonsense that I didn't need to hear. 

The only thing that mattered in the history of this weapon that had been responsible for ending lives, was that it then became my property. Another small piece of inspiration for what I would design and share with the world. Meaningless without me. 

I grabbed it by the hilt and took it off the wall. I felt its weight in my hand as I grabbed onto it with both hands. Such a useless piece of steel that had served no purpose but to simply be smithed and then wait for me to come show it what real legend was. What real and true courage was. To utilize it like no owner before could. 

I could feel purpose and power surging through me. A feeling that all the characters and heroes and villains and denizens of the fantasy realms that I had created would never be able to truly feel. They were simply useless byproducts of my imagination. Not even real in any sense. Just a small and minute offering of my true potential to this useless world that somehow thought it was worth half as much as me. 

I was tired of all of it. I felt like it was time to really leave my mark. A proper end to a magnificent legacy that was always league's ahead of this strange and dull universe and its endless monotony. 

I walked back to my desk and sat the blade down on top of it. I sat back in my chair and breathed in and out three times. In. And out. I needed to focus for this to go perfectly. I noticed my tie was constricting my breathing. 

I couldn't have that. I needed to be of solid mind and body and oxygen flow was paramount to the success of the next few minutes. I loosened the tie and pulled it out of my shirt collar and tied it around my head and tied a knot. That way it wouldn't interfere with the coming battle. 

I got up and walked into the center of the room and bent over and placed my hands down against the solid floor. I leaned forward and placed my weight down against my hands as it held my body's weight. I held it like that for a half a minute and felt my brain getting the rush that I was looking for. I ended the handstand and rolled my shoulders back. I was ready. 

I balled both my hands into fists and bent my neck both ways as I savored the small crack that released the tension in my shoulders. 

I walked up to the blade and picked it up again. I twirled it inside my hand and then carefully ran my hand against the blade. It was perfectly sharp. As sharp as whenever some useless metalsmith had created it hundreds of years before it would find its perfect owner. He was forgotten now. This was my story now and it always has been. 

I ran my finger along the edge of the blade and savored the feel of the metal opening up my flesh. I felt the warm crimson blood drip out from me and onto the sword. This was the beginning taste for this weapon. 

I took my finger and ran it across my cheek. Then again on the opposite side. My warpaint was warm against my skin and I knew that my ancestors would be proud at what I had become. Which was ironic, considering the only worthwhile thing that they had done with their lives was be vessels that were responsible for my eventual arrival. 

This has all led up to this. This exact moment in time right before I transcended this mortal plane. Soon the world would know that what it had seen was only a fraction of what I was capable of. 

Breathe in. Breathe out. 

Breathe in. Breathe out. 

I walked to the door of my office and I grabbed the door handle. I was finally ready for these people to witness me. Ready for them to understand. 

The bright lights of the hall made me squint momentarily as I held my blade with both hands. I could tell that the enemy was nearby because I no longer felt able to rest. Even if I wanted to. Rest could not be further from my mind. I had begun my life's work. Everything had culminated into this exact moment in time. 

I walked around a corner and crouched as I listened and tried to better understand my prey. They were definitely plentiful and they roamed these halls like they belonged. Leeches. Every last one of them. They would soon learn the price that came with my coat tails. 

I could hear one coming now. I would make an example of this one. I could tell from the meandering walk which one of the drones that this was. 

Josh. Or something or the other. A useless intern if ever there was one. He was never on time and was practically scared of his own shadow. He didn't have an original bone in his body and has made it the very little distance in life that he has by simply holding on to anything he could and hoping it dragged him through even a moderate to minimal amount of success. 

I was going to enjoy this. 

I stepped backwards around the corner and I listened as he approached. Slow as usual. Never in a rush this one. Always taking his sweet time even when it directly affected me. Wasting his own life and time was acceptable. Understandable even. Considering he was literally nothing. Wasting my time however? That was unacceptable. 

He came around my corner and my sword swung down at the exact moment he did. I felt the crack of his bones as the blade buried itself between his shoulder and his neck and blood poured forth. 

He looked at me with eyes that were wide with shock. The audacity of this Josh character. To stumble into my realm with his worthless presence. To behave the way that he had, and then finally, after all that, to still be granted a small footnote in my epic legacy and then to behave like this. 

Ungrateful. 

I pulled my sword out from his flesh and sidestepped around him. I then shoved it forward into his gut and I felt my blade firmly embedding itself into the wall. 

I stepped back for a second and watched as he slowly faded into darkness. His eyes slowly closing as his mouth stood agape in horror and his hands desperately grasped at the sword hilt trying to pull it out. 

I left him that way for the better part of a minute. Waiting until he finally stopped squirming. I wanted to make sure that he was gone before I moved onto the next. 
I pulled the sword out slowly and watched as a stream of blood and what appeared to be some organs slid out onto the floor. What a waste of human life he was. 

I had approached the Josh with cunning and had surprised him. It was a fun thing to have done for sure. But it was not fitting my final legacy. These people would be my witnesses. My last testament to a worthless world. I was no rogue or highwayman. I was uncapped and righteous perfection. It was in this way that these drones would witness me. 

I smiled as I realized what must be done. This one. The useless one with the blood pool now on the floor. The Josh. He must have been sent to fetch me by his peers. I realized with glee that today was one of the many cake days. One of these worthless leeches was celebrating a useless event. They would be huddled around their sweet treats and in perfect position for my blade. 

I sat the sword against the wall and quickly did some push ups. I needed the blood pumping. Up and down. Up and down. I blinked twice as I came up and breathed out. Oxygen. Pure oxygen fueling my coming rampage. I hopped up onto my feet and grabbed my blade. I could feel my heart rate pulsing from the exercise. It was ready. 

I made my way down the hall dragging the sword wet with the blood of Josh behind me. It scraped alongst the floor as I hummed a tune that I didn't recognize. That was odd? A tune that I didn't recognize? But I found it relaxing, and wherever the melody came from did not matter. It was a beautiful piece of music. Combined with the adrenaline of taking a life along with the exercise. I was in a perfect state of mind for the coming events. 

I followed the voices. The sounds of their song as they prepared for their gluttonous feast. Combined with my tune and the scrape of my blade. It was all in perfect harmony. As it should be. Because finally these people and their useless existence would be intertwined with my legacy of greatness. 

Finally I approached the door at which the sheep convened behind. Waiting for their final moments before they even knew it. 

Breathe in. 

Breathe out. 

I kicked the door in and let out a shout. Not a fake shout like the ones normal people use. But a real one. A battle cry that would make the gods themselves shake in terror. A ferocious cry that let everyone know exactly who had arrived for their absurd cake festival. 

They took one look and let out of screams of terror. They witnessed me in all of my glory. I let out a laugh of pure glee as I set myself upon them. 

The first was another intern. One who went by the name Henry. He had forgotten my coffee once. Or at least he expected me to believe that excuse. He existed for one purpose and one purpose alone. To do exactly what I had asked of him. The audacity of him to expect me to believe that he had ""forgotten"" about me. The very reason he even had an existence. It was ludicrous. 

I ran him through with the sword in a tackle and I had hit him with such force that when he went down the sword stuck into the floor underneath. He gasped and coughed up blood, eyes completely wide with terror and unable to even fathom the world he now occupied. 

I stood up and stared down as he struggled. I grasped the sword and pulled it out from him before scanning the room for anyone fortunate enough to now witness me further. There was one making a run for the exit. I didn't necessarily feel like chasing though. Who was in swinging distance? 

I noticed a vivid blue to the left of me in my field of vision as I scanned the room looking for a target. It calmed me for just a second. I didn't want to be calm. I blinked as I struggled to regain the ferocity that I knew this moment demanded. 

It was only for a split second but it had been enough to disorient me momentarily. I shook my head and attempted to regain my composure. 

That's when the lights went out and I was plunged into darkness. 

Focus. 

Breathe in. 

Breathe out. 

There was a problem here. Lights don't just go out in office buildings randomly in the middle of the day. This was orchestrated. There was another unseen presence here. Or maybe the blue light? 

What had that been? 

I was suddenly hit from behind by a massive tackle. A person had the audacity to touch me with their useless flesh sack. I hit the ground hard and felt a set of hands pinning me down.I struggled against hands and felt another join the fray as they worked to keep me down. Yes, they would need to work hard. I was a living legend. I couldn't just be subdued by these peons.

""Flip him over!"" 

There was a voice. So they weren't some kind of mystic assailant. These really were just simple mortals. I struggled as they flipped me onto my back. 

That's when I saw the blue again. 

It was some kind of helmet or visor. Or something. My eyes hadn't fully adjusted to the darkness. The blue calmed me,only slightly. I still struggled. 

""Hit him. We need him still to find a vein."" a voice said calmly. 

I heard an audible tone and then one of my assailants balled his hand into a fist and had the nerve to hit me in the face. 

I saw stars as my body went limp. It had been a lucky shot. If it wasn't dark and they hadn't attacked me from behind I would have slain them where they stood. My eyes struggled to stay open. But I heard their voices. 

""Good, now help me find that vein."" one said

""Okay, hold on."" The other responded

There was another tone and there was suddenly a bright light emanating from one of their helmets. 

""Alright thanks, give me the syringe."" 

There was the sound of some shuffling and then about ten seconds later I felt something sharp bury itself in my arm. 

""How many did he get this time?"" The voice seemed distant. 

""Two, less than last time, but not ideal. "" 
The second man responded. 

""I don't get it. Why do we let this keep happening, whatever he came into contact with, it isn't going away. It will keep making him do this. Why aren't we killing him?"" The first man sounded agitated as he voiced his concern. 

""If it was up to me we would. But this guy needs to stay in play. Year after year he repeats himself and year after year the money flows. Whether it is because of whatever encounter he had with that thing we can't be sure. What we are sure of is the fact that he's basically a printing press."" the second man sounded tired as he responded. 

I was having trouble focusing after that point. Whatever these animals had injected into me was taking effect on me. 

They kept talking but I couldn't hear anything anymore.I felt myself slipping into a comfortable darkness. 


""Hey, you're finally awake!"" 

I looked up startled and saw a young woman with hopeful green eyes and a nervous smile. She seemed to be slightly uneasy but that was understandable. 

""Oh, I must have dozed off. I'm ready for them. I hope they are ready for me.""  I replied. 

My voice was comfortable. Prepared for the task ahead. I smiled at her after I responded and that seemed to put her at ease. 

I heard my name announced a moment later and I stood up and made my way enthusiastically down a short hall. I saw a light at the end that greeted me. 

I walked out onto the stage and the cheering was incredible. It practically shook the venue. I was honored to be seen by all these people. My fans.

I waved and gave a short bow and the screen lit up behind me with my name. These people were my everything and I would deliver things to them that they did not even know they could have. I would make their lives complete today. 

These people should consider themselves lucky to witness me. 

END JOURNAL 


There is no name in this journal. Whoever he is, he sounds important, or at least paid. 

It appears that he had a run in with the same paramedics that had dealt with Officer Whitaker. Or I don't even know if they were actually paramedics. I would assume not. 

I am not entirely sure what any of this means or how it ties back to Willow Village. Hell, I don't even know if any of this is real. 

I don't have enough information to try and find out who this is and even if I did, he doesn't seem like he's taking meetings, also even if he was. 

I'm not going to his office."

**Race:** Caucasian

**Gender:** Male

**Ethnicity:** Turkish, 1st Gen American (born in US, entire family from Turkey)

**State:** MN

**Highschool:** Top Public in state,
(Currently a Sophomore btw)

**“Hook”:** Prestigious debater, have a pretty decent story relating to culture and difficulties, more on that later. Also do 3 sports, Varsity on one, soon to be Captain of Varsity debate team… legacy of scholars, I *would* be a 5th generation scholar. 

**Intended Major(s):** Honestly, this is more like possible majors, because I still have no clue and am not 100% sure. For now, just assume I intend to major in Law and/or Political Science.

**Standardized Tests:**
PSAT: (first attempt) 1400, (second attempt) 1470, leading me to believe I can improve it greatly junior year. pACT: (first and only attempt) 31, I also believe I can improve this to around a 33 or 34

**UW/W gpa:** I’ve calculated the best possible UW gpa I can achieve is a 3.75, so just assume a 3.6-3.65 by college applications. Weighted gpa will be around 4.0. My rank is N/A as I don’t believe my school provides it.

**Coursework:**
2 AP’s this year: World and Comp Sci,
4 AP’s next year: Psych, APUSH, French and Calc,
Enriched/Honors Science classes throughout HS, obviously advanced math

**Awards:** Debate Speaker awards, trophies, etc… NSDA “Degree” (Debate related), Lettered in it as well.

**Extracurriculars:**
Varsity Debate, Varsity Ultimate Frisbee, Soccer, Skiing, (After this is what I *plan* to do this summer) Very Rigorous one month Debate camp at UMich, Internship with a Clean Water charity Non-Profit Organization, possibly more volunteer work, a job at a local movie theatre, something of the sorts. Junior year after my internship and camp ends, I plan to join or possibly even create a club with friends to make change and reinforce leadership, as I believe I have very very good leadership values I just haven’t had chances to show them. In general, when I’m passionate about something (which I am about all these things), I generally perform extremely well and try my very hardest to achieving whatever.

**Essays:** Generally, my essay writing is excellent and I always do well with essays during school and anywhere at all (debate, applications, tests).

**Schools:** Refer to the title, I’d also take recommendations for realistic yet still as “top” as possible schools.

**Other info:** Obviously, I’m aware my gpa isn’t too great. My story mainly throughout my years is one of conflicting culture and internal values. I was raised by Turkish parents having grown up in Turkey until their 20’s, meaning I was fully immersed in Turkish culture and general Eurasian values, as opposed to the more passive and non-“standard” American culture and values. What I mean by this is I was raised to be as respectful and kind and playful as possible. When I started grade school and experienced rude people, bullying, people complaining about school, it was quite shocking. My parents have been somewhat strict and so I never really “experimented” with other cultural values and such. This obviously affected me when I became a teenager and became more independent. I wanted to fit in, I wanted to be seen as normal, I wanted to be all these things, so I changed myself for others. My behavior was quite radical in middle school and I always got in trouble. When I transferred to high school in a different district, I tried to start over. It worked at first, as I had internalized more diverse culture and values that I myself agreed with, but as time went on and my friends started becoming less and less academically interested, I myself began to assimilate. Recently, between semester one and two of sophomore year, I was diagnosed with  severe ADD and put on medication for it. It’s been helping me tremendously and has allowed me to focus much better on the end goal and my true passions and intentions. This complication of colliding cultures mixed with unfamiliar standards has caused me to not perform in school until now. Since my diagnosis, I have been Acing every test and assignment and have seriously realized the difference I can make in the two years I have left. With this upward curve that I very much hope to achieve, I want to see how far I can go.

TL;DR
uw gpa: 3.6
w gpa: 4.0
SAT: 1500

nh5vr0,2,2021-05-20,Moving out of MSP field and need help defining title,lespy_laz,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/nh5vr0/moving_out_of_msp_field_and_need_help_defining/,"Hi all,

I was hoping to get some advice from some other people who have had a similar career paths or experience with lateral movement in the industry. I've been in the MSP field for 6 years now starting as an intern in college and moving all the way through the job stack to become a lead technician. The company I currently work for has a very wide range of clients but is a very small company. Multiple roles are expected from each position and there isn't very much exclusivity to the type of work performed. In a single day I could be doing project management, sales, account management, advanced technical deployments down to basic help desk tasks. 

I would consider my technical skill to be Jack of all trades since I have done everything a medium to small business would require from an IT service provider. Server deployments, Cloud Engineering, Network infrastructure engineering, Hardware and software deployment, Azure and Intune MDM roll outs, budget planning, workflow optimizations and consulting. If a client of ours has needed it, I have deployed it. This has also given me tons of business, sales and management experience as well. 

The biggest let down I have from working in the MSP field is that while I have obtained lots of experience from working with so many various clients I do not get the chance to specialize. My employer does not give us the time or incentivize training to acquire certs. I've reached the top of the ladder for this company on wages and technical development. So I am looking at breaking out of the MSP field and moving into a challenging role at a new company.

The problem I am having when building a resume and starting the job search is defining a title in our industry for a Jack of all trades.  What has worked for you that helped moving forward from an MSP to a Cloud engineer, Network Engineer, SR. Systems administrator positions? Did you need certs to break into those positions or can experience alone be attractive as well?

Thanks for reading and looking forward to hearing how others have navigated a similar obstacle."

**Hooks**

* My GPA is low because I had trouble focusing before getting a prescription this past year (started it summer after sophomore year) and I suddenly moved away after Freshman year. The school I went to Freshman year was a rigorous and prestigious private school in Florida, so Level classes were like the equivalent to public school advanced (Honors/Pre-AP/AP/IB) courses in terms of workload and depth of material (not just busy work). When my counselor at my current large competitve public school saw my transcript, she did not look at the actual curriculum and put me in all level classes my Sophomore year (as a result I was bored out of my mind). I was clearly much more capable and mature than everyone in all my classes. Should have been all Honors at least. My coursework does not reflect this because counselors overhype any advanced course when in reality they're not that bad at all, so even though I am clearly capable I still am too conservative when it comes to course selection. Lots of severe social anxiety Freshman and Sophomore year (frequent panic attacks, insomnia, loss of appetite, harmful thoughts) and I had a bad back injury as well Freshman year (stress fracture that kept me from being consistent in sports). My situation overall has improved dramatically thankfully.

**Interests**

* Sports
* Cars
* Podcasts
* Politics
* Public Policy
* Law
* Business
* Fitness
* Hanging out with friends
* Church
* Serving and Volunteering

**Current College List**

* Things I look for in a college-Large student body, large alumni base, endowment of $1B+, preferably public (I am very frugal), fun things to do in the area (I like bigger cities so more opportunities for internships, the outdoors, and sports). Still sort of the typical public/state school but a better balance between parties/sports and academics. T100-T50. But feel free to suggest outside the box.
* Safeties
   * Oklahoma State University (I am an auto admit)
   * University of Kansas
* Matches
   * University of Utah
   * University of Arizona
* Reaches
   * University of Texas at Austin (I am going to apply for CAP and/or PACE Program)
   * University of Pittsburgh"
nh6qps,1,2021-05-20,Road map to graphic programming,MR_Anth,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nh6qps/road_map_to_graphic_programming/,"Hi guys, sorry if this is a dumb question but I'm really interested in this and just wanna know.

So I just finished my first year at a Canadian uni as an undergrad math student and was going over some of the fields in computer science. I got really interested in computer graphics and wanted to learn more about it. After doing some more research I was hooked and decided it was something I wanted to do in the future. Something I realized was that it is quite competitive and hard to get an internship without experience. So my question is what internships should I get to land an internship as a graphic programmer? I know I have to work on projects but I personally don't think that's enough. Should I get an internship as a swe or ml?  What experience would look more appealing to a recruiter when hiring for this position."

I'm 5 months into my internship right now and it's been good, I've learned alot. Up until now I have mostly done front-end development and when I've worked on the back-end there has been a clear path to follow where I have used the teams previous projects as for guidance. 

That changed last week however when I was tasked with essentially designing and impleting a large chunk of the backend of the new project by myself. I've never really had to work on something with no clear direction before and the amount of decision making and complexity of this project are pretty far outside my experience and skillset. I don't even know where to start and the only developer I can go to about this project has only given me vary vague guidance. This work is pretty critical to the project and I'm scared I'm going to embarrass myself by coming up with a terrible design that then has to get redone by a senior engineer who already has enough on his plate. Because of this I've been second guessing every decision I make which has made progress very slow. This project seems like a great learning opportunity and I want to make the most of it but I just got slapped in the face with the realization that I don't work well without guidance and have no idea what to do anymore.

What's the best way for me to handle this?"

4. Learn &amp; practice some algorithm problems for interviews (grind leetcode???)
5. Practice interview questions (My biggest weakness)
6. Get some negotiation skills


Does this seem like a good enough plan? Is there something I'm missing or something I don't need to waste time on? Should I even try to switch if I really enjoy the company? Any feedback is appreciated.

nharls,2,2021-05-20,Current Business graduate looking to make transition into CS,iamverynormal,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nharls/current_business_graduate_looking_to_make/,"I graduated from a relatively prestigious university with a business administration degree but realized that business was fine but not for me. I already have some prior coding experience in Java and Javascript from high school, but I would be starting from scratch. 

I've come to three choices to make a transition into CS. 

1. Pursue data science and understand stats and python very well

2. Go into a coding bootcamp and hope to get a position as a developing intern.

3. Reapply for a cs degree at any other college

4. Self taught: I could just follow the syllabus on either https://functionalcs.github.io/curriculum/#org103f1da or https://teachyourselfcs.com/#architecture or any CS roadmap for a university.

I already know that data science could help me bridge the gap into CS as its related to business and would not be a big jump. While coding bootcamps seem okay, I'm worried that my lack of a background from either mathematics or engineering would really hold me back.
The only reason why i'm not particularly keen on doing another degree is the fact that I would have to focus on redoing GE's while I want to focus purely on computer science as a whole. 

Any suggestions as to what I can do a recent graduate?"
nhb9eb,1,2021-05-20,Advice needed on skills and Courses/Certifications for first internship,MakBoz,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/nhb9eb/advice_needed_on_skills_and_coursescertifications/,"Hey everyone,
A bit of backstory, I'm a 2nd year CS student at a well reputed Canadian university and will be applying for co-op/internship this fall.
And so I'd like to get some advice on what I should focus on. I was planning working on web dev in the summer so I can create 3-5 web projects. Is focusing on web dev the best strategy to land my first co-op or I should focus on something else?

Also any recs for project-centric courses I should do to strengthen my resume to secure a co-op. I've planned on doing at cs50 web programming and a few codecademy project based courses (like web apps with python and django, web apps with react, etc.)

I know codecademy courses dont really mean a lot in the real world but as a first-time intern, would having numerous codecademy certificates (backed by implementation in real projects) make a strong case for me?

Ps. I know its essential to focus on data structures and algorithms but I'm not sure how I can create a tangible project with it at this stage. Also all students in my batch will be taking couple of courses on this in 2nd year so I feel like I won't be able to stand out."

Welcome, current juniors, soon-to-be rising seniors! Above is the index for overviews and some specifics of mainly top liberal arts colleges and public research universities, so feel free to learn more about such colleges currently on the list so far! There are a lot of colleges of such categories that don't (yet) have highlights, so stayed when some of us (mainly u/eccentricgalaxy) create new posts of college highlights with updated indexes! Make sure to do some additional research on colleges that have interested you, and don't let rankings dominate your college list!

Anyways, while Davidson College isn't *underrated* per se compared to the other southeastern LACs I've done analyses for, there's an overall lack of information that goes around about the college, especially on A2C. It's extremely selective, so definitely also keep this in mind if you plan on adding this college to your application list! That being said, let's get right into the features of this liberal arts college that is located in Davidson, North Carolina:

* Rankings should be taken with a grain of salt and shouldn't be a major factor for your college decisions, but Davidson College's USNews rankings currently land at #15 in National Liberal Arts Colleges (Tie), #9 in Best Undergraduate Teaching (Tie), #11 in Best Value Schools, #6 in Most Innovative Schools, #16 in Undergraduate Research/Creative Projects, and #13 in First-Year Experiences. Niche also ranks Davidson College pretty well in general, including being #3 in Best Christian Colleges, #17 in Best Small Colleges, #17 in Best Liberal Arts Colleges, #41 in Top Private Universities in America, #47 in Best Colleges America, #47 in Colleges with the Best Academics in America, #48 in Best Value Colleges, #59 in Best Colleges for Student Athletes in America, and #93 in Colleges with the Best Professors in America as well as various subjects that Davidson has as majors.
* As of this school year, there are 1,983 enrolled undergraduates with no graduate students, an average class size of 15 (more than 71% of classes have less than 20 students), and a student:faculty ratio of 9:1. 98% of faculty have the highest degree possible. 74% of students have pursued research and/or an internship, and 78% of students have done study abroad by graduation! 95% of students live on campus too for those interested in a more active campus.
* The college is need-blind for domestic citizens and permanent residents and guarantees to meet 100% of all students' demonstrated need with no expectancy to take out loans as part of your financial aid package via what's called the Davidson Trust, meaning that students will be entirely funded by grants and student employment. 70% of its students receive some form of aid, and 51% of students receive need-based aid. It does also offer some [merit or talent scholarships](https://www.davidson.edu/admission-and-financial-aid/financial-aid/merit-scholarships), although only 5% of students had received such. Davidson has $1.13 billion in endowments to secure such policies and is sometimes funded by the [Duke Endowment](https://www.dukeendowment.org/story/welcoming-top-scholars-with-opportunities), which gives it, Duke University, Furman University, and Johnson C. Smith University some multimillion-dollar grants for educational funding purposes. It also participates in the [Bonner Scholars](https://www.davidson.edu/offices-and-services/civic-engagement/bonner-scholars) program!
* The liberal arts college is one of few that is home to NCAA Division 1 sports, specifically 21 total, including football, men's basketball, and women's basketball teams. As such, student-athletes are eligible for athletic scholarships, and 34% of all student-athletes receive them on average.
* Similar to Haverford, Sewanee, and Connecticut colleges, Davidson College is also well-known for its [student-run honor code](https://www.davidson.edu/about/distinctly-davidson/honor-code), which traces back to 1959 and requires that all students comply with it by attending an Honor Code signing ceremony to sign it. All will agree to avoid stealing, lying, and/or cheating on college business and academic works in return for trusted privileges like take-home tests, self-proctored final exams, and more!
* The college has plenty of [majors, minors, and pre-professional programs](https://www.davidson.edu/majors-minors-programs), with its unique interdisciplinary majors including communication studies; digital studies, digital &amp; screen media; educational studies; film &amp; media studies; genomics, bioinformatics; and global literary theory! In addition to the usual premed and prelaw programs, it also offers pre-veterinary medicine and pre-ministry programs! It's also part of the [Army ROTC program](https://www.davidson.edu/academic-departments/military-science-rotc)! It, as part of the dual degree engineering programs, partners up with [Columbia University and Washington University in St. Louis](https://www.davidson.edu/academic-departments/engineering)!
* Its [graduation requirements](https://www.davidson.edu/offices-and-services/registrar/graduation-requirements) are more critical thinking-oriented, as students are to take ways of knowing requirements to undergo rigorous liberal arts disciplines; a writing requirement within their first year; a foreign language requirement; a cultural diversity requirement to understand cultures outside of the United States or Western Europe; a justice, equality, and community requirement to examine justice and equality in various time periods, and a physical education requirement.
* It offers a wide range of advising programs for its students, especially in its first two years! For instance, the [holistic advising program](https://www.davidson.edu/offices-and-services/academic-affairs/holistic-advising) pairs first and second-year students up with pre-major advisors (made up of \~50 Davidson staff and faculty) to develop educational and professional goals by being encouraged to explore their interests on one-on-on sessions until they develop their academic plans that start after they declare their majors. The [summer advising](https://www.davidson.edu/offices-and-services/academic-affairs/holistic-advising/summer-advising) program is a section of the holistic advising program where you could schedule an appointment with a summer advisor to create a course selection plan. Other programs include advising for immersive experiences and tutoring &amp; academic support! The [Sustainability Scholars program](https://www.davidson.edu/offices-and-services/sustainability-office/sustainability-scholars) sends students to a community organization for a project during the summer to study how they address environmental issues on a community-level scale, particularly of climate change.
* Davidson College has a few exclusive educational opportunities for its students! Although unfortunately virtual this academic year, the [Davidson in Washington](https://www.davidson.edu/academic-departments/political-science/internships-careers-and-graduate-school/davidson-washington) program is typically a competitive 8-week experience for 20-35 students with an interest in politics (rising sophomores, juniors, and senior only; not required to major in political science) to gain full course credit by taking a seminar called ""Race and Place: Structural Inequality and U.S. Public Policy"" and taking an internship there then writing an analytical paper about their experiences. The [Davidson in East Asia Internship Program](https://www.davidson.edu/academic-departments/chinese-studies/internships) is another competitive program that provides 20 students $5,000 grants to participate in internships in the East and Southeast region of Asia!
* The liberal arts college has a lot of unique opportunities for students to research in their interested field(s)! College freshmen, sophomores, and juniors there can apply for the [Davidson Research Institute (DRI)](https://www.davidson.edu/academics/research/undergraduate-research/davidson-research-initiative) for any discipline that they wish to research, participating in a collaborative project, earning a bit of money on the way as they work for weeks. The [Davidson Research Network (DRN)](https://www.davidson.edu/academics/research/undergraduate-research/davidson-research-network) is a program where students interested in health sciences careers and graduate school may pick a research location that is a graduate school of their choice while potentially receiving competitive stipends of $5,000. The [Kemp Scholars program](https://www.davidson.edu/academics/research/undergraduate-research/kemp-scholars-program) is where non-senior applicants work independently on a research project of their passion(s) anywhere and are chosen through a competitive process administered by an economics faculty member. Once chosen, they'll meet up with their Kemp advisors several times, receive monetary awards to fund expenses for the project, and present the results of their research with the rest of the group.
* The liberal arts college's departments offer all students entering campus (even after their first year) programs that are intended to [familiarize them with current activities and community organizations](https://www.davidson.edu/offices-and-services/student-activities/programs). For example, the Center for Civic Engagement has [introductory programs](https://www.davidson.edu/offices-and-services/civic-engagement/introductory-programs) that teach members of campus about current events and current community partners.
* While the outcomes data for the class of 2020 are not available yet, the 2019 outcomes do reveal a [very high employment rate and a sizable graduate school/professional school enrollment rate](https://www.davidson.edu/offices-and-services/center-career-development/career-outcomes), as 84.9% of survey respondents participated in at least one internship or research experience, 70.4% in 2 or more of them, 83.4% were offered their position before June 1st, 2019, and 45.9% used Handshake, Davidson faculty/staff, and/or the alumni network to locate a job.

And that's all I have for today! Stay tuned as EG will be posting another liberal arts college highlight shortly after and as I will soon make another southeastern liberal arts college highlight! Good luck to juniors next school year for college admissions! As u/eccentricgalaxy always says, have a nice day!"

Brief Background:
I'm currently a data analyst with roughly 2 years of experience. Graduated 2019 with a major in Biology and Math/Chem minors. I have used Excel, R, Python, and MATLAB in past classes and internships. 

Now:
I have recently decided to make a move into software development. I've started learning basic HTML on my own (FreeCodeCamp), but feel overwhelmed by my path. Could I get into this field by learning on my own and making my own portfolio? Should I enroll into a part-time bootcamp? Do I need a CS degree (thinking masters)? I would really appreciate any advice and/or chatting with others with no formal CS background who got into the field. 

Thank y'all!"

After spending hours researching reviews and speaking to my friends and family, I am still unsure if I should be continuing with my job offer from them.

I graduated college this month with a BS in computer science. I have no internship experience and graduated with a 3.0 GPA. As far as SOME experience goes, I have ""mentored"" a 10-year old for five months on coding and some robotics, along with four months of front-end web design for a non-profit museum. Everyone I have spoken to said I should apply to places elsewhere before I stick with Revature, but I am having trouble turning away their offer on fear of not getting another job. Should I stick with it or stay far away?"

My friends have landed internships at google, NCR, Norfolk, etc. and I haven’t even gotten a single interview. Where do I go from here??"

I would help set out chairs and set up music equipment, brew coffee, set up communion elements, and run slides during worship and during the sermon. Would help break down/put away equipment as well, so I was at church at least an hour before and after services for at least once a month.

**Letters of Recommendation**

* Either a Pastor, Teacher, or the Attorney if that works out.

**Hooks**

* My GPA is low because I had trouble focusing before getting a prescription this past year (started it summer after sophomore year) and I suddenly moved away after Freshman year. The school I went to Freshman year was a rigorous and prestigious private school in Florida, so Level classes were like the equivalent to public school advanced (Honors/Pre-AP/AP/IB) courses in terms of workload and depth of material (not just busy work). When my counselor at my current large competitve public school saw my transcript, she did not look at the actual curriculum and put me in all level classes my Sophomore year (as a result I was bored out of my mind). I was clearly much more capable and mature than everyone in all my classes. Should have been all Honors at least. My coursework does not reflect this because counselors overhype any advanced course when in reality they're not that bad at all, so even though I am clearly capable I still am too conservative when it comes to course selection. Lots of severe social anxiety Freshman and Sophomore year (frequent panic attacks, insomnia, loss of appetite, harmful thoughts) and I had a bad back injury as well Freshman year (stress fracture that kept me from being consistent in sports). My situation overall has improved dramatically thankfully.

**Interests**

* Sports
* Cars
* Podcasts
* Politics
* Public Policy
* Law
* Business
* Fitness
* Hanging out with friends
* Church
* Serving and Volunteering

**Current College List**

* Things I look for in a college-Large student body, large alumni base, endowment of $1B+, preferably public (I am very frugal), fun things to do in the area (I like bigger cities so more opportunities for internships, the outdoors, and sports). Still sort of the typical public/state school but a better balance between parties/sports and academics. T100-T50. But feel free to suggest outside the box. My dad says he thinks I could get in to a more prestigious school (I do not think I can, simply because of stats, not actual ability or intellect).
* Safeties
   * Oklahoma State University (I am an auto admit)
   * University of Kansas
* Matches
   * University of Utah
   * University of Arizona
* Reaches
   * University of Texas at Austin (I am going to apply for CAP and/or PACE Program)
   * University of Pittsburgh"

I’m also loathing my retail job and i just feel so depressed that i’m 24 and stuck in this position. I’m trying to find internships/jobs, but it’s hard to when you’re studying full time. i have considered dropping out of my masters to find a decent job but feel like a failure if i do that. 

I feel like everyone around me is progressing at a good pace and actually finding themselves, while i’m stuck in the same position. Someone i haven’t spoke to in a long time messaged me to tell me that they just got an internship at a huge production company and i feel like the universe is mocking me. 

no one really understands. i moved to london in october and have hardly made any friends. i’m so lonely and now i wonder if moving was worth it. my parents and friends don’t really understand, and whatever they say doesn’t make me feel better. i just want to quit my job and masters and put myself out there but i’m scared. 

i feel like i won’t amount to anything. i haven’t felt this depressed in a long time and i’m starting to think that it might just be easier to end it."

I know I’m just scratching the surface but I want to build a complex enough app in time for me to start applying for internships so I have something substantial to talk about.

The app I want to build is like LuckyTrip: https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/luckytrip-a-trip-in-one-tap/id973059290

This app lets you select some parameters and then you press ‘lucky’ and it generates random trip ideas for you based on what you selected. Each time you press ‘lucky’ it generates another trip. I want to build something like this but for books. 

I was hoping I could get some advice and resources I could use on how to go about doing this, especially the planning part. Do I first do mock ups of what I want the app to look like? How do I plan the code I’m going to write? Do I code the front end first? Or do I scrape the data? Also, any alternatives to goodreads (they’re no longer allowing API usage)

Please let me know."

I just graduated from a good school with a bachelors in mechanical engineering, my program was incredibly math heavy and and I slowly started leaning towards ML / data science and ended up doing a long internship at a research lab where I published a few lead author ML papers to decent journals/conferences. Unfortunately that wasn't enough to get into any of the MSCS programs I applied to so I'm trying to apply to SWE jobs but it's a tough sell with a mech bachelors and only academic internships. Luckily I have two offers though and I'm trying to find out which one is better for me, I would like to work with ML for the foreseeable future.

1. ""**Software Engineer, ML**"" at large company, through staffing agency :(

* TC: 80K
* **pros:** actual ML work, in the areas I enjoy. Large company with good name recognition. Would be using pytorch, SQL, AWS every day.
* **cons:** I would be paid by a staffing agency and it's only a 1 year contract (with potential FTE conversion), not a big issue because the pay isn't great and I would just be doing it to kickstart my ML career.

1. ""**SWE New Grad**"" at start-up (\~80 ppl)

* TC: 90K base + equity (no idea how much this will be worth)
* Team seems great but they don't really have major ML operations going on yet. They use React &amp; typescript.
* **pros**: Seems like a great environment, more mentorship, flexibility to work on different projects
* **cons:** they are interested in ML but don't have much set up yet, most of the job would probably be full-stack development.

I think I'm going to apply to the online MSCS from UT Austin and try to do that over the next few years. The ML contract position would be great but I'm hesitant about how working for a staffing agency will look on my resume. Since I'd really be working for this big company, would I even need to mention that I'm at the staffing agency on my resume/linkedin? Can I list the big company as the actual employer and mention it was a contract in the bullet points?

If I go for the startup I could always try to pivot later but would it be harder to switch to an ML job later on?

What would you do if you were in my shoes? any advice?"

I'm currently on week 3 of a government-funded 9-week bootcamp so called &lt;&lt;Java Developer&gt;&gt; with guaranteed 3 months of internship afterwards. I'm 2 months away from graduating college so I thought this was an once-in-a-lifetime chance for me. Since it's government-funded, there is a selection process, and you need to do a multiple choice test on web dev and DBMS, a coding exercise on algorithms with Java/C, and an interview. Despite being an almost-complete noob with only basic Python and HTML, I somehow got in. I was a second batch so the first batch already learned for 1 week.

Basically the bootcamp is like a full-time job with two 4-hour sessions with 1-hour break in between. I honestly thought it was only Java but was shocked to find out that it was divided into 3 parts: Core Java, Algorithm and DBMS. Thing is Algorithm is in C++ which I never encountered before, and they said nothing in the orientation about C++. The teacher who teaches C++ don't teach us concepts and just gives us exercise and explain the logic (Still i don't understand).

During the session we don't have short breaks, and I cannot even focus on my one-hour class at uni let alone a four-hour coding Zoom session. Normally before when I have problem with codes I can enthusiastically search and debug. But now after 8 hours every weekday staring at the screen I have no mental energy left to do research on Java and C++. We also have daily tests and except for when I find the exact tutorial on that problem, I will score miserably low. The score will determine how prioritized you are when it comes to choosing companies to do internship. Honestly dealing with two new languages are tiring enough but having low score demotivates me. I feel like I will drop out even before choosing places to intern. Now I can't because I will have to pay around one grand.

I feel like if I actually tried harder it will turn out better but I honestly feel like shit every second of the day ever since this bootcamp. Sorry if this sounds like a whole bunch of excuses and if you said I'm not meant to be a programmer it's okay because i'm on the verge of believing it."

So    I decided to start Programming in lockdown last year as I knew, that    either I would have to settle for low paying Mechanical job, or low    paying WITCH job...

I started    programming and solved almost majority of Easy and Medium level problems    on hackerrank. I couldnt solve anyfurther as i didnt knew Data    Structures and Algorithms. So I started and completed learning    HTML,CSS,Javascript,Bootstrap.. I couldnt continue further as my    Mechanical Classes started and I soon started to lose interest in Both.

I    posted here few months ago about doing a year long course in Data    Science/ML/AI, but responses were critical. Some said that Companies    hire only Masters students who have research papers of their own in such    roles. One user said that Cloud thing is growing big and doing AWS  CSA   or RHCSA would be good enough for a decent paying job. But I love    Machine Learning(Did some projects in college)

The problem is, I dont know where to start and what to start. And I have only little more than two years now.

Should I continue learning Data Structures, but I dont think people would prefer an average Mechanical grad for SDE roles..

I dont want to be a Web Developer

So I decided to start learn basics for AWS CSA. But it required learning Web development..

I dont even know where to start for RHCSA either.

Somebody suggested to use my Mechanical Undergrad as leverage to get into ComputerVision etc

Im    confused af right now and I dont want to end up being jack of all    trades but king of none and be unemployed as I couldnt completely master    a single technology..

What   should be my Approach now? I just want an internship at end of 3rd year   and a Good Cash earning job at end of 4th year, and Im willing to put   any number of hours need.."

I was wondering if you guys knew any programs/internships that are primarily STEM based that are still available to apply. I am a sophomore, live in NY, and will turn 16 in July if that helps :)"
nhl07l,0,2021-05-21,Long term friend issues,acne_gun,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/nhl07l/long_term_friend_issues/,"21(M) friend is also 21(M), we've been friends for over 10 years over the years he made me lose 2.5k, asks me to borrow money and never pays me back, gets into trouble and always asks for favors.

Little context, I am an introvert and highly driven person, study day in and day out, every hour should be used efficiently. My friend is more of a ""present in the moment"" person. While i want to maximize my opportunities and set up a good future for myself(multiple classes while working during summer and learning stuff on the side, literally 0 free time) he has puts no effort in school(shit gpa) nor on his internship, he is given opportunities to have a full time internship and he negotiates to lessen the days so he could enjoy his summer. He values social skills over current priorities, spends hours outside socializing and talking to strangers, hanging out with friends, etc. I am also less emotional, he always talks about hoe he feels and how what i do affects him, I on the other hand dont do that at all. 

Now more about fights we ve had, he always take every opportunity to try to hang out with me, we have had multiple fights to his calling me selfish because I don't conform to his needs which I believe are excessive (hanging out 1 to 3 days a week), on top of that he forces em to study with him at school because he can't study at home. He was literally, in my life 24/7, on top of that he gets mad at me for not answering him on the same day when he texts me everyday. The whole point is, from his side it stems from me not being invested enough in him and I feel like this is overwhelming. 

More problems is that he keeps trying to push his lifestyle into me and make me change by critiquing what I do, my mentaloty, my relationships, etc. He gets pretty disrespectful sometimes. On my side I tend to be a bit moee hands off, I let him come to me for help, I don't force anything on him and I try to be present when he needs me given that the prkblems he has isnt created by himself(too many are him digging in his own grave)

Also, he has 0 understanding or perception of risk, i frugaly save since I was young and only spend on necessities, on tje other hand he spends his whole 4 month salary on garbage food, clothes and jewelry. Im irritated because he then complains about his situation and says things like""your fine in the future, you should pay me back that money, youll be fibalcially stablr in the future look at my position then look at you "" (this was a 2 year debt where he said i didnt need to pay him back, but since noe he has no money he wants the money back) . He essentially spent his whole bank account on attemps to become rich quick. 

More about my frustratiins, i have tried to help him so many times but telling him not to do this or that, he doesnt listen and it always backfires on him, thhen he constantly asks me for help, about once every 2 months (always concerns money, or borrowing sometging) . 

Girlfriend keeps saying hes taking advantage of me, i dont notice because all his habits have been ingrained inside me for the past 10 years. She says that he is using me for everytging, whenever I ask for a favor I always try to not inconvenience him, but him on the other hand asks favors that clearly inconvenience me, and the amount of favors between us is not proportional at all. Whenever he says ""lets do this for you"" it always includes joy for him, hes never sacrificing sometging for me while on the other hand all the favors he asks for is some sacrifice from my part. 

Essentially all of this came out because a couple of days ago he brought up that I need to pay him back for a debt that was owed one and a half year ago, where he clearky sttated it was fine not paying him back. Now that he needs money he is asking it back. And all of this feels like a backstab, like he broke a promise or went back on his word. Ofc its an accumulation of things, as before that he also kept asking me for money to pay for taxes etc because he legit has 0 in his bank, after i told him save some money for taxes. What i dint fucking understand is that he still has the audacity to not work more, and stop buying clothes. On top of that he owes me money as he always asks me to buy stuff for fim or to borrow money he eventually foegets to pay back.

All in all, is this a toxic environment created by him or me, is he a bad friend or am I the bad one, whos in the right here, me or him? 

Please feel free to ask more questions, this is a bit messy because these events range from lomg to short term"

nhmiqw,2,2021-05-21,Is it me or the company?,DryAuthor9,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nhmiqw/is_it_me_or_the_company/,"I'm doing an internship at a startup together with another intern who also did the same program as me.  I'm at the end of my first week, and working remotely due to COVID.  
The first thing I want to mention is that the program we followed was in a particular programming language and we mainly focussed on that.  We got an internship that uses another language so it required a bit of preparation on my part to get started and in no means I'm fluent in it.   


Me and the other intern each got our own project to work on. The first day was a disaster imo, our internmentor (who is the one who founded the company) went over all these systems in lightning speed, making us feel very overwhelmed. The next day I decided to take it step by step for my project and just ask questions when I'm really stuck. This means that for the past week I've been looking up all the information I can on the systems and frameworks and API's we use, I went through the code (which is written so damn difficult I don't even understand 5% of it) and started my project.   


I'm a very communicative person and during this first week I've been TRYING to contact my mentor on what I need to proceed along with some questions. Except for the one time I got an occassional dry 'i made this and here is the password', I haven't heard decently from him since Tuesday.  Yesterday I got an email where he said that the protocol I was using wasn't very secure and he said it would be better to use a certain API but that was out-of-scope for now(thats all the email said). I answered him and asked some questions, but haven't received a reply yet. Then I saw that he does have time for the other intern to arrange meetings and answering his questions on the platform we're using. I asked today again for a meeting with my mentor because I also have questions (my questions on the platform are unanswered btw). I feel like I'm getting ignored, while the other intern is getting all the support he needs. Maybe it's me, but I feel like I have been reaching out and have been doing my best. I learn a lot of things on my own, but I'm stuck and could use some guidance, but this seems to get ignored.   


To be honest I already made the decision in my mind that if my mentor doesn't answer this call for my meeting, I will ask the school what I should do, because this can't be a decent internship if they just leave me be and give no support at all. I already knew beginning as a developer is hard, and you can't be productive in the first few months, but I didn't expect this. Is this normal, are my expectations too high?"

So I'm going to be a senior this fall, undergrad in math department. I was originally planning to be a math teacher(high school) after graduation, but the thought of going to grad school popped up in me, and want to go with it.

Here's the problem
1. My GPA is around 3.18 ( was around 2.8~9 in 1st, 2nd. Not the best, not the worst, but still. 
2. I do not have any research/writing. Never thought about going to grad school, therefore no research or internships were done. Also, my parents are quite hysteric about workin in COVID, so... it was quite hard to do anything. 
3. Toefl is around 97. Need to take GRE. (Quite glad some school don't require it)

Is this possbile? Yes, it can be, but I just want to know what I need to do during this leftover  7 months before deadline. If you can help me with any advices, it would be really appreciated. Please help"

It was the company i had an internship in prior to grad. different from other mgt programs though, they only hired 2- reasoning was that they really wanted to train mt’s, give them their all... and later be among the company’s leader. i was so pleased to land a job during pandemic and of course i take pride that I am among the chosen 2. 

however after 8 months, i am having these questions in my head
- should i continue on with this program? we are expecting 3-4 rotations and i am on my 2nd now. looking at the org chart now, i keep wondering which department will they put me in after the program... i am taking in special projects. two of my key projects so far are on the nature of consultancy. i am diagnosing processes, identifying pain points, bridging gaps among teams, presenting corrective action plans to the exec team. the company has no dept that has the same nature as to what they are seem to be training me in... more than this, i am concerned if i will really be offered a leadership role afterwards. or if so, will that reflect in compensation.

-big companies are opening mt programs now. i am really tempted to apply but my thought is that... that’s another two years. i will begin again. Whats really pushing me now is that i am curious whether these bigger companies offer better compben packages (would love to try in coke). i am all when it comes to work, so shouldn’t i do it for the company that would offer me more?

-the managing director of my current company has been so kind to me and giving me praises on the corrective plans i recommend. He wondered why i didnt join consulting companies. with this,  i tried to browse through linked in and found one opening in deloitte. Should i try?

I am currently doing both competitive programming and projects at the moment but I think I can't do both at the same time properly. 

In competitive, I am currently at specialist rank at codeforces and 4 star at codechef and green coder at atcoder.

About Projects, I have a good grasp over python and c++ and have made some projects on python related to web scraping , sockets etc.. I also started learning rust a few days ago.

Also, I have a good grasp over linux  (have been using it for two years now).

So, My question is that should i focus on projects more or  should I be focusing on competitive programming more for the remaining months till the registration for internship starts?

Also, I am a resident of India...so can I apply for US or other foreign countries?And will Google provide any relocation bonus?  I've heard some people saying that it does but I am not sure."
nhwiuk,1,2021-05-21,"Feel like I should know more than I do at this point, definitely have hit the ""cliff of despair"" and am overwhelmed by the different options / prerequisite knowledge for some things.",drTNT,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/nhwiuk/feel_like_i_should_know_more_than_i_do_at_this/,"# Backstory

I got interesting programming when I was \~11-13 yrs old, did a python course and thought I was some big shit until I got to pygame and couldn't get it working on my computer for whatever reason.

Fast forward a couple years and I'm doing AP computer science to try and learn Java but my teacher is useless (long story for a different time) so I bounce between tutors, online tutorials, and self-teaching through project-euler and some for fun projects (made a RuneScape bot that got banned in like 3 days). Even did some very basic testing the waters in making some VR stuff in Unity. During most of this I had a classmate, Kenny, who did pretty much all the Github stuff as well as finding the resources that we used. I learned plenty of programming concepts and got decent at writing working code, but it wasn't until later that I realized I wasn't really learning fundamental things like version control and how to setup a dev-environment.

I go to college as a CS major, classes are going pretty well for the first couple of semesters (well being a relative term). I learn C/C++/Assembly and get a much better understanding of underlying code concepts and good practices, I even learn how to setup a basic dev-environment in a Linux shell. I also had learned some SQL from an internship and HTML/CSS from online courses.

It was around my 4th Semester that the issues really started. After kind of breezing through my *Comp I-III* courses by just doing the projects in MSVS and turning in *.c*/*.cpp*/*.h* files, I got a major wake-up call when my *Comp IV* class wanted me to do everything in a ubuntu VM and compile my programs with a makefile and install different libraries which I also had to compile by including dependencies in the makefile. Having never been taught or even seen any information regarding makefiles before, it took me a while before I was able to do much in that class (in part because I was being a dumbass and refusing to go to tutoring/office hours) but I finally got to a point where I could confidently compile a program from scratch in Linux. I also ran into some issues while going through using the Boost Library but that was more me not liking how Boost works/not seeing the point of using Boost in the small programs we were writing for class.

Everything went to absolute shit immediately after that. My next major class was *Orginization of Programming Languages*, and suddenly I had almost no guidance whatsoever. The course was basically ""make a programming language"" with a calendar of checkpoints like ""Week 2: have completed the Pretty Printer"". The issue was that I had no idea where to start, the professor didn't care what language we wrote the code in and wrote his example code in *Racket* which made it harder for me to follow along, not to mention he wrote it on paper so I couldn't even see what he was doing for compiling or file-structure. By the time we got to writing parts of the interpreter in a higher-level language I was already lost, and had no clue how I was supposed to combine two languages into one.

After failing that class a couple of times, with some personal issues + Covid certainly contributing, I decided to take a breather until online classes ended and I could more reliably get tutoring/office hours/help from classmates. Which brings us to the next section of this long ass post...

# The Current Situation

I've been hired for an IT position at a local school system, so far its been fine but I would like to move from doing the field-tech stuff to working on the server/backend things. Bossman said I could help out on the powerschool site, so I went on to W3Schools and started up the old HTML tutorial to refresh myself and learn more than ""make a static website with assets made in photoshop"".

Well I as I approach the end of the course, less and less of the things they are teaching work when just running a .html file off the computer; I need to actually be hosting the website in some way. So I started looking at resources and that is how I've ended up coming here for help.

Now that you know my life story, lets get to...

# The Problem

There are just so many different things that go into learning how to create a program that actually *does something*, and for each thing you need to learn there's at least 5 different languages or frameworks to choose from, and for each of those there's a bunch of different package managers or extensions/libraries/dependencies that you need to install and some are outdated and useless while others can be outdated but still useful for certain things.

I'm just losing my mind as I have 20+ tabs open trying to figure out what I need to know and how I can learn it, only to find out after a bit that I need to then also learn some other thing to use it properly and when I try to find help for it I often find people saying ""just use this other program"" which I also don't know how to use and for some reason they all seem to assume that I know how where to install things and what to do in the command-line.

The first thing I found when trying to get my practice website to be hosted in a way that would allow web-workers to actually function was node.js.

""Cool, I've vaguely heard of that before and I have a basic understanding of JavaScript.""

Well now I also have to learn how npm works because Node.js has a lot of setup done through that.

""Ok, well how hard could it be to learn the functions of what essentially seems to be a stand-in for a apt-get command?""

Turns out pretty hard. Cause now I need to install the Express framework and also other dependencies for the project like a linter and shit, all of which needs to be included in a .JSON file so that it runs properly so now I need to learn how to write a JSON file. Oh hey, it also created a Node\_modules folder with a bunch of stuff that I don't know how to use or what it does. To top it all off, when I actually try to do *""node index.js""* I get to a page with links to my files but clicking them doesn't actually load those pages. While trying to find a solution to this, I start running into stuff about AJAX, or using React vs using Django.

I tried using Google's Material tutorial and by the second page I was installing Sass, Babel, and webpack, all of which had some sort of errors popping up when I tried to install them with npm and I get conflicting answers on if I should be installing some of these directly into my dev-environment or if they should be going into a directory with a wider scope.

Everything I look at seems to be pulling me in different directions and I'm just totally overwhelmed by the choices of what framework to use and which libraries or add-ons I should be using with that framework and I just feel like my brain is melting. On top of that, since all these tutorials and sites don't seem to feel the need to include instructions on how to setup your environment or install/use the different packages required to follow the tutorial, I feel like at some point I was supposed to have learned how to do all these things already and I'm just not sure what I missed. Like even trying to setup a VS Code environment seems to involve linking a github page, giving VS Code the PATH of a compiler, and creating a JSON file to tell it how to compile. Plus I need to figure out which of the 1million extensions I should be using.

So I guess my questions are:

**How do I actually go about learning all these things?**

**What are the basics that I should know beyond just learning the programming languages?** Like, I know I should probably finally learn git, but what are the basics of setting up a dev-environment? and what compilers/IDEs should I be using? What frameworks/libraries should I know about? Should I be using Oracle's Database Express Edition and SQL developer or should I use some of Amazon's services and noSQL?

It feels like there's so many things out there that I should just know about and know what they do, but I don't. All I know is write code, make directory, compile, eat hot chip, and lie."

\-Apply for freshman/sophomore exploratory programs if you’re an underclassman. They’re great for building your network and for practicing your speaking skills. Some of them even let you recruit for junior internships early!

\-When I get rejected after an interview, I reflect on what I could do better next time and treat the failed opportunity as practice for the next one.

 Before I start I just want to mention how much this forum has helped me learn about the college application process, especially considering that I'm an international student! Thanks everyone! 

Alright, so I'm an international student from a third world nation who has always dreamt of studying in the US. The pandemic gave me a wonderful opportunity to work on my application. I would've needed close to a full ride to even consider my offers as my parents earn an annual income of &lt;$10,000. 

So I did my research and applied to a couple of schools (Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Brown, etc). It was a long shot but me being the foolish optimist I am thought I had a chance lol. I got rejected from most of them, mostly 'cuz apart from a couple of the unis I applied to, most of them were need aware for internationals. 

Anyway, I got accepted to Fordham and another school ranked #200 ish according to U.S News and World Report. Fordham didn't give me enough aid and the one year cost of attendance would require my family to save their income for 10 years lol.

However, I got into the other school for a business major with a full tuition scholarship. I'd still need to work on campus and I've received addnl scholarships to pay for room and board and other expenses. The school admitted that I was the first intl student to receive a full tuition as they were impressed with my academic record and EC's(I've won some national level awards, represented my country in an international conference etc). The school is ranked in the 200 ish range by US News and is locally well known in the regional area. Almost 50% of their students are first gen learners. The school's pretty small with a total enrollment of around 2,000 kids (undergrad). Upon learning more, I'm convinced that the school has opportunities for me to grow and being close to a huge city, has wonderful internship opportunities as well. However it isn't as well known as other renowned schools. I'm looking to settle in the U.S long term, so finding a job would be the first step. 

My long term goal is to go to a T-14 law school and earn my J.D. I've done this entire college application process all by myself with no assistance from any college advisors. It's my dream to study in the US and receive a world class education. However, I'm second guessing myself because I've made this huge leap all by myself and I'm not sure if it's the right decision in my best interest. 

I'm caught between deciding to go there or finishing my undergrad in my country and move to the US for my JD. But at the same time, this seems like such a golden opportunity especially considering that international students receive negligible aid.

I'd love it if y'all could give me your views. Do y'all think I should enroll or not? Please elaborate! 

Thank you so much for dealing with this!"

ni141v,6,2021-05-21,My Teaching Journey (sorry for length),MystycKnyght,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/ni141v/my_teaching_journey_sorry_for_length/,"This is my epic tale of my journey (so far) as a teacher. My story involves the failings of the education system, the nepotism and favoritism of administration, scandal, hypocrisy, karma, etc. as well as my personal struggle through it all. Please read through it all, it gets really interesting, I promise!


(Trolls couldn't get past this section so I have omitted it. Apparently stating facts is ""whining."")


Strangely enough I couldn’t just become a teacher in my major because a credential for my subject matter didn’t really exist and the next best option was English. I needed to take courses or pass a test in order to teach, both of which I did. With barely $100 in my account, I needed to find a paid teaching internship; otherwise more student loans would have been needed.


I interviewed at several places and it just so happened, one high school not only needed an English teacher but someone who could teach my “art.” I got lucky, but the only reason this opportunity existed is where it all begins. The teacher before me was caught fooling around with his students and subsequently ended up in jail.


So I was hired to teach; however, because of my situation I taught 4 classes, only 3 of which I was paid for because I had a master teacher that would never show up. It’s a great way to begin a teaching career, unpaid and unsupervised labor. In addition because of my “art” class, I knew how to run showings. Quite successfully, but again unpaid labor.


As part of this internship I was supervised by someone from my teaching university. It just so happened I went to the same university (including a few classes) with a fellow coworker. He was much older and had spent some 20-30 years in business. When his adviser came, he would come in for about 5-15 minutes, say he was “awesome,” and would walk out. My supervisor was the complete opposite. This woman literally had the last name of a cold metal and to be honest that’s what she was. We’ll call her Steel. I’m not sure if Steel hated the job, me, or men, but it was awful. 


Like most teachers we need to provide lesson plans. For Steel, she needed it at the beginning of every week and everything had to be perfect. I had never taught a class in my life, but I can do this, I think. For monthly observations, Steel would show up 30 minutes before and remind (aka berate) me what I needed to do and what she’d be looking over. During the lesson, she would sometimes correct me AS I WAS TEACHING and in some cases discipline students. Afterwards, it would be another 30 minutes or more telling me exactly everything I did wrong. Nothing ever felt constructive. When I tried to make changes, Steel would find more things wrong. (As a side note, I kept all her notes until a few years later I wanted to eliminate all negativity and shredded them.) The only reprieve I ever received was when she would watch the teacher on the other side of the full wall window that separated our classrooms. This teacher would just let his students do whatever work and he would spend the whole time practicing his golf swing. We’ll call him Clubswinger. His story gets interesting later. Steel would watch him and shake her head temporarily ignoring what I was doing.


Steel was not a great motivator. It was already difficult enough working in a Title 1 school, but I was spinning my wheels and unable to do anything to find a way to improve. She was even going to mark me down a letter grade. It also didn’t help when my fellow teachers and admin would often refer to my predecessor as a “pretty good English teacher.” I always wanted to say to them “well at least I’m not diddling my students.” But I’m not petty… like that. Let me explain. I was fed up with Steel. I’ve always been a hard worker and always working to improve myself, but this needed to STOP.


So I hatched a plan. I was notified that one of my special needs student’s meds were changing and he may be tired and should be allowed to sleep if needed. Because of confidentiality I couldn’t say a word. I knew how it would play out. Student falls asleep and Steel tries to wake him up. I let her try a few times to no avail. Steel gives up and let’s me know later that it was unacceptable I let him do it. I said I appreciated the advice and after she left I immediately contacted her supervisor explaining how I never received any help and what she did with the student was uncalled for and could potentially be illegal.


That got everyone’s attention real fast. Her supervisor said he would come in and observe with her to see what the fuss was all about. Fact is, I could have done a terrible job but I just so happened to have gone to a professional development when everything “clicked” into place in time for that lesson. I made the best lesson and it was well received by him. When he started to say that it must have been because of Steel, I quickly told him that I succeeded despite her. From that moment on, Steel knew I wasn’t to be messed with and the last few observations were much more amicable.


Luckily my school took me on full time after that year and it was mostly uneventful except I needed to clear my credential. As a teacher you take a bunch of courses to learn how to teach for the preliminary credential and then you teach while learning more of the exact same courses to “clear” the credential. The only reason I mention this is to show how hard it is to become a teacher but also this training was paid by the district for me. Not anymore as I learned that new teachers have to pay $2000 for this training to teach (which they already know how to do). Holy f@%$! Why?!


Things weren’t uneventful for much longer. The Great Recession hit. Frankly the only reason I wasn’t laid off was I was told “I just happened to be hired a few days before one of the other new English teachers.” But I believe it was because of my “art” class and the showings I ran and the fact that my principal told them I was invaluable. I was lucky that for once favoritism worked in my favor. I liked that Principal as well as the Assistant Principals at the time. They liked where they were and didn’t see this as a springboard for bigger and better things. That would all change soon.


In rapid succession, they all retired. Thus began the revolving door of administration at my school and at the district that continues today. I actually didn’t mind the next principal. As long as you didn’t get stuck with one of his long stories, he left you alone. He was gone within a few years. But before he did and during that time, there was an Assistant Principal who I really wished would have had my back in one of the situations I really regret not standing up for myself. 


You see I had a student who received an 89.4% in my English class, a B. The student could have applied himself more, taken up opportunities to improve, and/or just not be disrespectful during class time. I was literally walking out my door on the last day of the school year when an email chimes in. It was his parent. I get emails like this all the time, but the biggest concern was her job. She was the principal of a high school in a neighboring district. We’ll call her Karen. Karen understood (or not) that receiving a B for 89% (first semester) made sense, but he should receive an A for an 89.4%. It’s clearly my policy that 89.5% and above is an A. Karen demanded a meeting even alluding to the fact that she would point out everything I might have been doing wrong. This is about my 3rd or 4th year so this was worrying since we all make mistakes now and again. It’s not fair for a student to get a higher grade just because they asked, but it’s even worse when it’s an entitled parent who thinks they can use their position to try to intimidate a teacher, especially if they are an administrator who is supposed to respect teachers and the education system. Karen knew what she was doing. I immediately went to my assistant principal and he suggested that I give in. And careful consideration, I gave in like many in my position would. I made up some sort of extra credit I “forgot.” That really began to show me that these people don’t have my back. It’s one of the few regrets I have as a teacher and it didn’t stop there.


(Quick side note to just show more of her entitlement) The following year at one of the showings, Karen at one of the showings. During these events, I needed to be in a certain position as it was my job; however, Karen took it upon herself to ask me to move so she could see. I was taken a bit back by this. Perhaps she knew who I was and was just being rude or she had forgotten who I was and is just a witch. No worries and I went to another less desirable position. This is just a mild footnote, but don’t worry reader she’ll get hers.


Right around that time I dated, fell in love, and married one of my coworkers. So maybe I wouldn’t be alone in all this bullshit.


Soon I’ll go back to the revolving door of administration, but let’s talk about the International Baccalaureate Program that began around this time. You see, it’s hard to keep numbers in electives. The idea was floated to become an IB school, which if you didn’t know it’s a bit like AP but it comes with more classes, a diploma, a philosophy, and a weird pay structure for testing, evaluations, etc. I agreed to it in the hope it would help my numbers. It could not have been a worse decision. First it began with one of the worst mistakes I’ve ever made with my wife. I had to go to training several states away. A few days before the flight, my wife miscarried. When I tried to plead with them to cancel it, they said it couldn’t be done and there would have been nothing to take the place. Moving my “art” class into an IB would be delayed. They basically made it sound like it was absolutely necessary. It was the worst decision I ever made and I regret it to this day. Come to find out, it probably wouldn’t have been that big of a deal. Also, I was only one of a few people who actually did the job professionally and yet they were “training” me. (Fortunately my wife had our first child soon after so don’t worry reader.)


Second, the amount of extra work that was needed in no way compared to what any of my colleagues were doing. Third, my numbers never went higher than twelve students. Fourth, these students were in no way indicative of the kind of students who can handle it. Fifth, they kept trying to make these classes fast-tracked which is impossible and against the rules dictated by IB. 


Sixth, the arts are optional! That’s when I started my move away from IB. If I had known what I taught was optional, I never would have done it. IB speaks of well-rounded students, but if students don’t know art, that’s not well-rounded. So either I don’t get as many students as they thought I would get or my students concentrate more on their other classes and do poorly in mine. Thus, making me look bad. 


The last and final straw was the Extended Essay. Students write a mini-dissertation about a subject area of their choosing. My student did it over an art theory related to my class so I was the advisor. It was the best thing I’ve ever read from a student. If you put it in a magazine or major publication, you would never know it was written by a high school student. I have to grade it before it goes to IB for them to grade, and I couldn’t find anything wrong with it. I told my director and he said to mark it as perfect and move on. So I did. It came back as the equivalent of a B. I was shocked and demanded an explanation. That wasn’t possible because you have to PAY EXTRA FOR THAT. That was it. I was done and told the school to never ask me again. Just so you know readers. That student is at the most prestigious university for my art in the country so she'll be fine.


So back to the revolving door or musical chairs as my wife likes to call it. Now there has only been so many players so far in the story so it may be easy to guess who would be called up to become an assistant principal. Yep, Clubswinger. It’s interesting that most of Clubswinger’s classes were in the same department as my wife except for one. So whenever it was meeting time, Clubswinger would go to the other department and not with them. He never got called out for this even though I got called out when I was half in one department and half in another. But I digress. Then all of a sudden, he not only wanted to go to the meetings, but also run them. So my neighbor who always showed up late/left early, swung golf clubs all class, and did not partake in meetings, all of a sudden cares about his job and is in charge of us. Always wanting to improve, I didn’t like that he would be my evaluator for one year. My wife reminded me that he probably wouldn’t care too much and it would be easy. It was, but it still didn’t help me to get better. What was the point then?


He didn’t last long as his aspirations took him to other places but not before all HELL BROKE LOOSE… This is where things get wild.


New principal. Seems ok. Let’s call him CEO because when he came in a few years before the “awful school year'' began, CEO wanted to conduct our public school as a business. I know I can hear the collective eye-rolling of all the teachers reading this. This wasn’t too bad as CEO allowed us to try things and take risks. My classes actually improved, but it got bad. CEO wasn’t exactly one to keep teachers in check and he often let things slide especially when it came to off-campus gatherings when alcohol was involved. It was a bit of a free-for-all for a couple of years. Organized outings into the community actually became chaos and our school actually got banned from several businesses. None of which I partook in. Before I get into more of what happened… I have to describe how crappy that year already was for me.


(Side note: There've been rough years. Teachers will say that the first is always the worst, but it would have been true until this year as well as the year of the pandemic.)


It first began in Spring in the previous school year with my stepfather’s death and continued with one of my new assistant principals, let’s call her Blondie. Blondie commissioned an art piece from me for a district event at the beginning of the next year. Like many art redditors comment, most people don’t respect the skill and time it takes to do something. I was assured that I would receive a decent stipend, but whenever I needed to discuss this with Blondie, she was always conveniently unavailable or overseas observing another “country’s education system” a.k.a. district-paid vacation. Being the sucker that I am, I started anyway. It took over 80 hours to complete. The real world total would have been around $2000. 


The school year started with that district event. My art piece was extremely well received. I was even pointed out for the accomplishment, however, when I received my stipend, it was $200. It was the same amount they gave teachers who were asked 48 hours before this event to come up with a lesson plan to show to others. I was shocked. I basically went to that district person right after we were dismissed to tell her how it was completely unacceptable. We’ll call her Boss (you’ll see why later). Boss said she would get a hold of Blondie and see what could be done. I was able to negotiate for $800 dollars, but I burned several bridges along the way.


To start the “awful school year” I found out that I was given an extra period which although it is a very nice bump in pay, it would mean I would not have much time to plan and grade. I also was doing my “art” on the side because teachers are underpaid of course. It was not a good start to the school year already.


Not done with Blondie by a long shot. You see my wife and I both teach electives. As I mentioned before these are always on shaky ground. If enough students decide not to take your class, it could be troublesome and you might lose full time status. Fact is, we have no control over this since it all depends on Administration and counseling. Despite that, Blondie suggested that my wife teach at the middle school for a period. She agreed thinking that if 8th graders took her elective, they would continue into the high school freshmen year. Blondie basically lied and instead gave her 6th graders as part of “the wheel.” You know that strange elective thing they do when students take a class for 6 weeks and move on. This wouldn’t help my wife in the least bit. It was awful and she hated it. She was also not given any support especially when disciplining students. The principal there, BishFace, would come in and get on her case when she tried disciplining her students, undermining her in the process. 


(Side Note: Later when BishFace commissioned an art piece from me that very year, I made sure she looked bad. It was petty but no one was the wiser unless you really looked closely. She was also too chicken to ask me directly if I wanted to do it again the following year and instead enlisted a teacher to ask me. I politely told her “no” and why. I felt bad for the teacher, but she understood.)


When my wife became pregnant with our 2nd child, it could have been seen as a blessing or a curse. She would at least get to take time off from teaching the middle school students, but at the risk her numbers might falter. More on that to come.


In November, my grandmother passed away and only I could go. My wife struggled a bit with this pregnancy and even pulled a hamstring trying to take care of my 1st child while I was away. So when my grandfather passed away a month later, I wasn’t able to attend the funeral.


Soon after, ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. 


A coworker did some “stuff” with students which became National News very quickly. I’d get more into details but it might give away my school. In a few short weeks, every teacher lost what little respect we had from the community. Students were constantly acting up more because of it. We even had to go to extra training for something we didn’t even do. 


The worst part was the bomb threat. Some hackers targeted the school because of the national attention the school was getting. Instead of following procedure and going to a local park, Clubswinger evacuated us to a family member’s school an extra mile away. Recall readers that my wife is several months pregnant. I was able to flag down my other assistant principal who was riding a cart, let’s call him AssPric (get it?). You see AssPric actually was a teacher for a while mostly teaching Honor classes. So he knew teaching but not the kind of students most of us are used to. When AssPric became admin, he guzzled down that Kool Aid, choking along the way. I told him to find my wife and he didn’t. She never ended up walking the whole way and was ok, but she was done after that and went on maternity leave.


Asspric was not done. My 2nd child was born and my wife returned with a week to spare and was immediately called in. During the meeting, Asspric told her that her numbers were too low. His reasoning is that because of her maternity leave, she wasn’t able to advertise her classes. Once again, we have NO CONTROL over these numbers. Fact is, they had been pushing for another elective that directly competed with hers. So, of course, my wife’s numbers were down. It was really shocking because parents had been commenting that there was a waitlist and they couldn’t get their child in. When she asked, they denied this. For what reason would a parent lie about this? The worst is what he said next. “Give your husband a beer and see what he says about you going part time.” ...wow


Looking back now, I can’t believe just how awful that was and also grounds for a lawsuit. Afterwards she talked to other Admin, Union, etc. Nothing could be done because apparently they could just take away your numbers and claim it’s your fault. We were both rightfully pissed. Luckily for her, there just happened to be an elective class opening in the next district over, a much better district. My wife wants to say she only got the job because Clubswinger knew the principal from his doctorate program (consequently many of these sharks went through this program), but she is a really good teacher. Switching districts took a few years out of her experience (and pay), but in the end she said it was a good decision. Now my kids get to go to a much better district.


The fallout from all the scandals took down many admin. Our principal got a job as a principal in another district but when they found out, he was moved to a less visible position. Asspric got a job at another school. We actually had quite an interesting conversation with a waitress who felt extremely uncomfortable after having a meeting with Asspric about her child at that new school. He’s now a principal at another school in our district. Our superintendent was gone as well. 


The next part is very HEARSAY, but I don’t doubt the credibility of my source. Remember Karen? It was one of her other sons that was one of the students involved in the scandal. Was he a victim? Possibly. It’s hard to say since he allegedly and voluntarily took part in other illegal activities involved with the whole fiasco. Why didn’t they sue though? You’re probably wondering. The rumor is that for not suing, Karen’s husband, Dud, would become superintendent. AND THAT FOLKS IS WHAT HAPPENED, Karen’s husband became superintendent and guess who became our new principal, one of his buddies from the previous district. *face palm* Thus it is the end of the “awful school year.”


Perhaps they aren’t petty like me or they don’t care who they step on, but I can’t know for certain that Dud didn’t say anything about me to Buddy because I don’t think he likes me.


Buddy is hard to describe. It’s hard for me to trust any administration after everything we’ve been through. He’s another CEO and I can’t be certain how many years he’s actually been in the classroom. He talks like he’s your friend and then ignores you. He seems friendly but there’s a strangeness about that especially when he calls you on something or tries to make jokes. I can’t say that he often listens to the teachers he doesn’t get along with which often leads a lot to favoritism. He often tells us to do something with students but never demonstrates that with us. He has helped me grow my numbers in my elective and I no longer have to teach English, but I think that’s more of my efforts along with the best administrator I’ve ever worked with. 


Remember when I mentioned there wasn’t a credential for my elective? Apparently there was now. It was this other administrator that helped me get it. Luckily, my side hustle helped me qualify. That’s the messed up part too. It was my college major and I worked in that career for several years, but that didn’t help to qualify for this because that experience was too long ago. Normally someone who qualifies for this is someone who chooses to leave this highly paid career to become a teacher. Seriously, that can't be a big number. Good thing I was side hustling. Fortunately with this new credential, my classes/equipment got better funding; however, that funding has to be run through Blondie.


(Quick side Note: I often have to go to these meetings with Blondie. She and her favorites often ignore or interrupt me, but that’s fine I still get my funding because that’s all transparent; however, I must prove I have industry contacts to help legitimize my class. “Hello stupid education system, if I had industry contacts, I wouldn’t be a teacher.”)


Back to my classes. What really helped is I rewrote my curriculum to open my classes for the younger grades thinking a few here and there would help. This is what the admin suggested. What I didn’t expect is that it would become a class completely filled with freshmen. Understand, reader, that I am already teaching the content I learned in college. I really had to break the skills down to a basic level because the students from Bishface’s school could in no way handle this. My own child who is in elementary school gets it. They still can’t, by the way. It’s not that they don’t understand, they just don’t want to try. They learned that they can do nothing and float on. It’s called rubber stamping and we’ve been doing it for years to make our school(s) look good at the state level. We’re a graduation factory. So when the pandemic hit, it wasn’t a learning gap or “learning loss” we were experiencing. It was the rubber stamped students who we couldn’t “hover” over anymore to get them to do their work. The pandemic only exposed part of the problems we faced. More on that later.


The next few years were somewhat uneventful. I taught my electives all day. My kids grew up mostly in daycare because it’s very hard to live on one teacher’s salary and we have no family in the area. That was fine though. Things were so calm, I worked on my master’s degree fully online. I was nearly done with this teaching degree that actually became quite useful when the Pandemic began.


I’ll keep this part short since you know most of this. My master’s degree helped me easily get ready for remote learning. Remote learning could have been doable. Homeschool kids have been doing it for years; however, everyone has failed, excluding the teachers of course. Online learning should be asynchronous. Instead of listening to education experts and pediatricians, politicians gave into parents and demanded schools be synchronous. Students weren’t/aren’t doing their fair share despite all the extra opportunities. The media keeps decrying it’s a failure when we were barely a month in. 


This is when Karma happened. You’d think administration and others would have learned a thing or two, but no. Turns out another scandal was brewing. Some of these are hearsay and rumors since it was hard to gossip when you’re stuck at home, but I did get a glimpse of the allegations and material in question. Allegedly Dud had sent some inappropriate messages as well as conducted himself in an inappropriate manner with members of the opposite sex. It was only a minor blip in the local news world as he quickly and quietly resigned. In any case I was very much amused. That slowly slipped away as Boss took his position. Oh well at least I can feel some satisfaction that Karma prevailed. I’m sure Buddy must have felt betrayed, but he still remains as my principal nonetheless.


Back to the pandemic and the following school year. We weren’t told at all during the summer what to expect when we got back and had to scramble when we found out. My district went the extra step and politely insisted we change our Learning Management System DURING A PANDEMIC. Although I’m glad I made the switch, I’m not sure they really knew how bad of an idea this was. That’s the problem sometimes. They spend money on useless things without consulting the actual teachers. Even though I’ve been somewhat tech-savvy my whole life, this LMS is one of the hardest I’ve ever worked with. Chairs have ended up across the room because of my frustration. I can’t imagine what it was like for others.


I bring up the LMS because of what occurred. Most of the content in my class is step by step. One thing inevitably leads to the next thing. This is especially important in a project-based course like mine. The tendency for students is to skip all the build-up assignments and just do the final project. When they inevitably struggle and fail, they wonder what happened. It was/is possible with this new LMS to prevent students from skipping assignments. It's great in theory, but knowing my students I’m sure they would get stuck on one of the small build-up assignments and then give up and do nothing for the next few months. I was so concerned that if I took this route that would happen. I asked for input with Buddy and my new assistant principal. She’s actually pretty great too. It’s just unfortunate that my favorite administrator left at the beginning of the year. (I still pretend he’s my supervisor in my recently updated resume.) I was worried, but they told me it made sense and it was a great idea. Flashforward. It wasn’t. Not that it would have mattered, but no one was doing the work. It’s been one of the worst years I’ve ever had so when the great Grade Shaming occurred, it wasn’t good.


Oh Grade Shaming. Don’t know what this is? Well folks, let me explain. Back when CEO was principal they had this great idea. “To improve student ‘achievement’ (i.e. getting A’s) Let’s list all the classes and post the percentages of how many D’s and F’s each class had and how they improved on the next progress report.” The goal was to open up a dialogue with teachers who had similar courses to ours to see how they improved the scores. There are so many obvious problems with this. There’s no accountability on the students and what works for one teacher doesn’t work for the next. A good idea in theory, but in practice it became the same discussion. “Students aren’t doing the work.” Sound familiar? The worst part is no one else teaches my electives so it’s obvious, it’s me who is “failing the students.” At first it was indirectly obvious and then they started to put teacher names WITH their class scores. Thus GRADE SHAMING. Imagine displaying a student’s name and their grade so all their classmates could see. We’d be written up within a day’s time. This is a practice that continues today.


After 1st semester, Buddy wanted to sit down with me. Although it was somewhat about what new art supplies I needed, it quickly switched to how poorly students had done in my class. I understand that my class was already difficult, but add to the fact that it’s a pandemic, it makes it much worse. BUT YOU TOLD ME IT WAS A GOOD IDEA. This meeting was virtual and every time he made a suggestion, I quickly showed what I did to combat that problem (thanks Master Degree!). Also every student that failed my class had failed at least one of their other classes. When he asked what he thought could be done, I suggested that students should be required to turn on their cameras. There was fear that students would be embarrassed to show their living conditions. I get that, but that’s what backgrounds are for. The school had a chance to buy monitoring programs like Goguardian and others and instead they wasted it on the new LMS and other useless entities. Students needed to be held accountable and that was not happening with the parents, admin, or counselors. Upon his suggestion, I even gave an extra 6 weeks for students (into 2nd semester, mind you) to turn in one assignment. Only 30% took advantage. That means that 70% would rather fail than do this one assignment.


After that discussion, I did two things. I first worked to overhaul my class so students are graded on completion (which they kinda had already been) and no longer on skill despite this being a class that’s meant to teach them real world skills. The second thing I did was contact the union and told them I no longer wanted to be a part of this Grade Shaming crap and it needs to go. Perhaps one day I’ll update you if that actually happens.


Halfway through the second semester my district decided to do hybrid/concurrent teaching. If anyone reading this knows this, you know how extremely difficult this is. It’s a crazy schedule while looking after in-person students while monitoring ones online. My district was actually in a county that had a pretty high infection rate. Like many others in the nation, our students were highly affected by this. About a month went by when at least one of my students each week had to miss class for a funeral. Those are the ones who were willing to speak up and tell us. It easily could have been more. Remember this is a Title 1 school. Most of these students come from families who had parents who were only left with two choices, go to their essential job and be exposed to COVID or stay home and lose their savings, home, etc. Many of my students had to pick up jobs in the afternoon to help. They did not consider the trauma associated with this, the decision was too sudden, rates were still up, and changing the schedule with only 8 weeks left would have been more disruptive than necessary. It was just poor decision making all around. They only got lucky that the wave died down the way it had.


This presented another problem. You see, my wife’s district made a decision too. They would remain online (smart), but the teachers had to come to the school (dumb). WHY?! Once again, my theory is to appease parents who don’t know any better. It’s all part of the theatre to show that teachers really are working and not just chilling at home. This wouldn’t have been so bad except for the fact that we wanted to keep our own kids online. This was necessary since one of my kids has an underlying condition. Who would watch them? Remember we have no friends or family close by. Thing is, most daycare services dried up during the bulk of the pandemic and anything left had already been filled up months before. So either risk my child’s life (because my wife’s district wouldn’t bend on the in-person yet online teaching) by putting her with the district’s daycare (which was rumored to have had a few cases of COVID) or one of us take off the last 8 weeks with loss of pay. We considered leaving the state for a day just to say we had to quarantine, just to buy us two weeks. It got that desperate.


We relented and flew in a relative. That was complicated as well because who knows if the airline or airport was safe. We quarantined them as well. Thankfully there were no major issues with this, but there were so many issues with my school. Rules were constantly changed by the school and often broken by students. If they thought in-person was going to “save” the students, it has done nothing. I have even more students failing, but they keep pushing. “Let’s make sure prom happens!” No one was dancing with each other. “Let’s do sports!” Every sport happened all at once. A district not too far away had to cancel several of their games because of infections. Now they are pushing for a full graduation and of course we have to be there for supervision. Why?! What’s the point? Yes it is an accomplishment to graduate despite the crap it’s been for several years, but don’t make me be there if I don’t want to be. It’s been traumatic enough.


And the musical chairs continue. Remember those showings I helped run? I failed to mention I hadn’t run them for a while. “Why?” you ask. Well during the CEO's reign, he brought in an administrator (Male Cheerleader) whose duties would include taking that role from me. It was upsetting at first because I wasn’t told until the first day of school but those were always a big stress so maybe it was for the best. Eventually I didn’t mind and still helped out until a few months in. You see, we usually showcase groups within the school. I always tried to be inclusive so I was a bit concerned when Male Cheerleader wanted to only highlight one. He assured me, the rest would be included in the next one. That never happened. I felt mortified by this and quit helping. I went as far as to write out of the official curriculum any roles my students or I would play in these showings. That’s how upset I was and to put myself as far away from this as possible. 


Well he just received an assistant principal job under Asspric while one of Asspric’s assistant principals is coming here. Why couldn’t Male Cheerleader stay here? It’s odd. Here’s the thing, only a few people know how to put on those showings and when they try to come to me, I will politely show them that I don’t have to do it. I’m not sure they are aware that I officially wrote myself out. Petty? Absolutely Yes.


What’s the future? All year I was actually looking at jobs elsewhere and it’s not pretty. I think my children will be safe enough since rates are so low. Who knows? But every year my hope is that something will open up in my wife’s district and then I’m gone. I should be happy with my years of experience and a new degree that leads to a higher pay, but I really hate this district. I follow social media and I see similar things elsewhere, but I can’t think that anyone else has been through the same crap that I’ve been. I’m sick of this bullshit. I just want stability, calmness, respect, and people with a shred of common sense. Let me know that there are districts out there that actually care about and listen to their teachers. Give me some hope that it’s possible!


Hopefully this is everything you hoped it would be. I can add on as years go but this is my teacher’s journey so far and I’m maybe only halfway through."

ni1aki,2,2021-05-21,Do I have the right motivations for graduate school/ Am I pathetic?,[deleted],AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/ni1aki/do_i_have_the_right_motivations_for_graduate/,"Asking a bunch of strangers for their frank opinion. I'm in my late 20s and I just completed my first round of applications for master's degree programs. I grew up the child of two first-generation college students + high school valedictorians who attended a prestigious private university and created a very enriching environment at home, but in my teen years, that environment changed, and I coasted through high school with \~3.2 GPA thinking strong SAT scores and extracurriculars would get me where I needed to go, and probably never spent more than an hour or two a week studying; ours was a small public high school, so there was not very much academic competition culturally. By senior year, however, I started to get serious about school, particularly my interests in science, and attended my safety school, a mid-level public university to study physics and math. 

When I got there, however, I simultaneously realized I wasn't ready to study this challenging material, and that I was very alienated from my peers, 99% of whom seemed to not care about school at all, and several of my high school teachers seemed disappointed that I hadn't ended up somewhere better. I became obsessed with transferring and attended community college to 'save money while I figure it out', all the while incredibly socially isolated and depressed. I ultimately transferred back to the same state school because I couldn't afford anywhere else, and grinded through the program with mediocre grades while working to finish after 6 years with no research experience, good friends, internships, or strong mentorships. 

I still had a spark of optimism, however, so I moved to a major metropolitan area with lots of STEM opportunities with an idea of sneaking into graduate school eventually. The competition has been stiff and I ended up working in application engineering- basically sales with some basic science &amp; engineering knowledge required. I haven't enjoyed it, but the financial stability and free time have enabled me to reflect on what I really want, which is why I pulled the trigger on finally applying. I've had interviews for more interesting/technical jobs, but seem to always get eliminated at the last round. 

I had the first opportunity to visit home since the pandemic and got to spend some quality time with my younger siblings, who both attended a similar state school (our parents alma mater has become dramatically more competitive), studied social sciences/humanities with great GPAs (Dean's list, etc) in 4 years, maintained and added to their interests and social circles from high school, and the older of which was in the honors college and stayed on for a 5th year to earn a Master of Arts. In many ways they've achieved what I wanted so badly when I was 18- to continue the family legacy of academic success, to be leaders and successfully balance work and school. I feel slightly insane that I didn't simply follow a similar path.

I tell myself it's enough that I studied something difficult and beautiful that I was interested in and that I was able to support myself and my spouse through the pandemic, but when I think about what I really want out of graduate school, I find myself thinking more about those things I wanted 9 years ago- the Dean's list, a close circle of friends, a school name and colors worth having on a bumper sticker or a sweatshirt- than what graduate school is really about- becoming an expert in the field and contributing to new knowledge. It feels like my deepest ambition is not to be a scientist, but to be A Good Boy- to be the academically stellar son/big brother/partner/Hometown kid made good I was always supposed to be. And what I'm hoping by soliciting the opinions of strangers is to determine to what degree this could distract from what is really important about grad school- does anyone really care about a Good Boy who's almost 30? I considered applying for Economics or an MBA, just something easier that 'makes sense' for someone already working, but the dusty dream of an academic or scientific career still calls and I don't know if I'm deluded or not. 

And I should add as a caveat: I've always been aware that academic success isn't all it's chalked up to be- my parents themselves achieved financial stability through means completely unrelated to having attended a good university, and out of my high school classmates I'm doing pretty well. But for me it always seemed like academic excellence was still the minimum; it was a rock of stability even for people who never accomplished anything else, to know that they were at least smart &amp; hardworking in some limited domain. That's not a source of stability or identity I feel I have; all of my accomplishments have asterisks next to them. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Is it good to hold onto youthful goals in graduate school, or better to give them up and focus on the future?"
ni1f8d,12,2021-05-21,COGS-ML major future plan suggestions (desperate),DeepTarget8436,UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/ni1f8d/cogsml_major_future_plan_suggestions_desperate/,"Hello I am a 4th year Cogs. ML major student. For my background, I had some time off due to the army service when I was a 3rd year. After getting discharged, I tried to catch up since the beginning of this year, but I haven’t had any experience in job or research yet. So, I applied to some internships and researches for this Summer 21. If I get one, I am going to work and take classes together over this summer. And also, there’s not much of major course offerings in this Fall 21 (my last quarter). The only class I found informative was COGS137 (Practical Data Science in R). So, I was thinking to take it with one significant writing course and finish my B.S. 

But honestly, I am kind of nervous because I haven’t been in any associations or in coding competitions kind of stuff. And I saw a lot of Cogs. ML majors also minoring in CS. I have taken C++ and JAVA during the community college years, but I have only used Python at UCSD. Here are my questions:

1) Do you think it’s worth putting $30,000 (2 quarters of tuition for out of state students) to stay 2 or more quarters to get CS minor degree? I am more into Data Science and Machine Learning rather than Software Engineering. And can I even still take CSE12, 15L? It says FR, SO, JR.

2) Do you think I should pursue grad school? I saw there’s only M.A. in COGS, not specifically for ML. I know it really depends on what kind of job it is and what degree they require. But I just want to know if I could get hands on experience in this field by studying more at the grad school. But if the grad school is very academically heavy rather than the practical experience, then I guess it’s not for me. 

3) What I was thinking if 1) or 2) are not an option for me, I was thinking to go over Andrew Ng’s ML series to recap and enhance my knowledge from COGS118A,B and get better understandings in ML and perform some personal projects. Also, since I am going to take only 2 classes in Fall21, I was thinking to apply to another internship/research in Fall21 to experience more.

Below is my major coursework:

GPA: 3.73

Major courses taken: COGS118A, COGS118B, COGS 108, COGS109 , COGS107A, COGS107B

Major courses to be taken (Summer): COGS188, COGS160 (Genetic algorithm)

Major courses to be taken (Fall -Last quarter):  COGS137 (Practical Data Science in R)

I am sorry if I sound like absolutely far off the standards, but it was really hard to meet people or classmates after discharge under COVID situation, so all I could do was just studying hard and getting good grades. I am posting this because I’d like to hear what other people in this major could suggest. 

Thank you so much for spending time to read this long writings. Have a great day!"

   * advanced to Northern california band winter championships but didn't win anything (should i put this?)

   * 600 service hours (will probably get 200-300 more by college apps season)
   * nonprofit efforts to be commended by our local county
   * applying for congressional award (most likely gonna be bronze bc I didn’t know about it until recently so even tho I have the hours I still won’t qualify lol)

**Extracurriculars:**

* Varsity marching band: might be section leader next year but we'll see
   * 9th grade-present

   * 9th grade-present
* Local prestigious orchestra (probably stopping senior year tho bc of financial reasons)
   * 10th-11th grade
* Nonprofit: don't want to get into too much specifics lol but i founded this nonprofit (president) and it's about public health; we've raised $8k, 20k of the specific health product, teaching lessons in schools, blog, webinars, summer leadership camps, health product pickups at local schools, volunteer programs, etc. again nonprofit efforts to be recognized by local county
   * 10th-present
* Holistic care practice Internship: virtual internship throughout junior year for a holistic care practice startup in miami, held patient assessments, biometric data collections, blog writing, webinar, etc
   * 11th grade-current
* Volunteer: besides nonprofit volunteering (above) i've volunteered at a hospital previously in summer of 10th grade but i'm planning on starting volunteering @ a local hospital again this summer before semester ends so i can count it as a junior year activity lol, will total maybe 140 hours?
   * 10th-current
* our school makes us do stupid capstone projects, one per school year but didn't get much achievements there so idk if i should include

**Essays/LORs/Other:**

* essays idk yet but planning to grind over the summer LOL
* LOR:
   * AP Lang: Even though this year was virtual i made a huge effort to connect w my AP lang teacher and he was like ""yeah i'll definitely have a lot of fun writing your letter"" and when i asked if he needed a resume he was like ""i usually only require them for people i don't have much to talk about"" LOOLOLOL; 9.5/10
   * AP Bio: Probably a generic one, he isn't the best teacher and kinda sucks at teaching but i did show up to his office hours a lot and asked him a lot for help. he does like me but it's just that i didn't really get to connect with him like i did with my ap lang teacher. 7.5/10
   * Precalc teacher: This one's my backup in case my ap bio teacher says no. Again not the best teacher because she didn't allow anyone to participate out loud (meaning to participate you could only participate in the chat) so i didn't have the best experience with her but again i did show up to her office hours a lot whenever i needed help. i don't have any other stem teachers to ask tho bc senior year math teacher makes us write our own recs (YUCK) and all my previous math teachers either retired or are just lazy. 7/10?
   * Counselor: like any other large public school counselor it's probably gonna be super generic. probably from a template. 6/10
   * Holistic care intern rec letter: supplement. Had a pretty rough start from oct-dec bc my class schedule didn't align with the meetings so I was only able to meet like once every 2 weeks which kinda irritated my intern head but eventually my schedule did smoothen out and things should be okay now. i do plan on asking my intern head for a rec letter but we'll see if they end up wanting to write one for me or no. idk but if i get a feeling that they won't add much value should i include it or not (let me know HAHA)? probably 7.5/10
* Questions:
   * should i retake my sat (1510)? i've taken it twice already. not sure if I need to retake but if i do i theoretically could in August but i'd rather focus on school + ec's + essays b/c my schedule next year is gonna be brutal but idk what do u guys think
   * since i took ap stats outside (online school) junior year can i put it on my college app as taking the class and can i factor it into my gpa? or no
   * any other good colleges besides Brown w/ grade inflation, good scenery, food, and clean dorms? mainly the grade inflation part tho bc i heard medical school is harsh w/ gpas
      * i'm like 75% set on EDing to Brown plme but plz recommend some reasonable safeties or targets lol just in case i don't get in (im tryna be realistic here HAHA). doesn't have to be bs/md either.

ty in advance [❤️](https://emojipedia.org/red-heart/)"

Some highlights:

\-Apply for freshman/sophomore exploratory programs if you’re an underclassman. They’re great for building your network and for practicing your speaking skills. Some of them even let you recruit for junior internships early!

\-When I get rejected after an interview, I reflect on what I could do better next time and treat the failed opportunity as practice for the next one.

\-Rejection is not the end of the world (even if it may feel like it in the moment)! As long as you identify your mistakes and take steps to improve, you’ll find the opportunity that’s right for you!"

I’m not sure exactly when it started but a few days ago it was like something clicked and I’ve had these pangs of hopelessness and mostly just fear that I’m never gonna stop feeling like this.

Luckily I have been to much lower places before and I have enough of a support system to trust that things will eventually be okay and I won’t feel like this. But it’s just getting a bit harder and harder each day to hold onto that belief without anything to show for it.

I entered college with severe, crippling anxiety and self esteem issues. I was in the closet for the first 1.5 years of college and just repressed in every way possible. I felt like a shell of a person. 

I eventually got help and began to blossom into a fun and loving person. I had a brief stint with an abusive friendship, but through that experience and the pandemic forcing me to confront the issues I still had with my relationship to myself, I feel like I really “made it”. The last few months have been amazing. I’ve gotten really close with my friends and have been able to be more open about my sexuality and have overall just felt way more self confident. The vaccine rollout has definitely also vastly improved my mental health. I have a job lined up for this summer (it’s an engineering internship at a cannabis growing facility!) and I feel like all of this should point to me being happy and excited for my future.

But all of the sudden I’m feeling this overwhelming dread. Part of me thinks it’s because I have no idea what my next goals in life are. Our school had this event at orientation freshmen year where we wrote a letter to our senior self. I read the letter yesterday and the goals I wrote were “I want to be more honest with myself, become a happy, healthy person, and have a successful job lined up.”

I can’t begin to describe how impossible those tasks seemed 4 years ago. It felt like I would need to dedicate my entire life to achieve them. And now I have, and I don’t know what my purpose is anymore. Has anyone had a similar experience?"

And I'm consuming Seroquel 300mg (my doctor said the dose should be increased but I'm scared to take more than that)

During my study years, I thought engineering is what I really love. But since there’s this traumatic event that happened during that time, my depression symptoms getting worse and I lost interest in the things that I use to love (e.g; be an MC for an event, active in sports, I do love singing so bad, I always excited to do new things). And after that my grade dropped since I can't focus, my sleep cycle is so bad. and during my internship, I also hate &amp; sad at the same time to go to work, because I felt almost everyone doesn’t like me to be there, as if I’d just annoy them.

Once I finished my study, I started to work part-time here and there, but I never can work for more than 3 months because of the pressure from myself. I hate being there (workplace), I hate to meet people, I even crying at my workplace because I can't control myself from feeling anxious, awful, and I have a lot of self-hatred. And in the end, I'll just resign and stay at home doing nothing.

I'm planning to further my study degree, but I can initiate my plan just because I'm scared “what if I can't do well just like before? Isn't it will be more frustrating?”. Now every time everyone asked me when will I further my study, my answer will always be “soon” but never initiate the plan.

Currently, I'm working as an Administrator, it's already 3 months now. And actually, I think I'm holding myself for quite a long time (a long time for me) from resigning again. This because I've been struggling with the same thing (maybe because of my depressive episode) after 1 month I started working in my current company here. 

The last 2 days I cut again after almost 5 months I stop doing it. This feeling is overwhelming, I always feel I don't want to go to work, because I hate meeting people, felt anxious, and whatnot. And I'm so sad because I can't go to work with the feeling is at ease, you know what I mean?

I've started my old hobby again, collecting albums, but there's no spark just like before, I do enjoy them but it's not exciting anymore. So as I'm trying to discover my interest, just in case it can positively help me, I've been thinking, I love to sing, I love to make videos (during my high school &amp; uni life, I used to be in charge of multimedia &amp; editing tho), so why not challenge myself to post a video on YouTube since I'd love doing it. But, even think about it already make me scared, nervous, and hate myself even more. This is the same thing that happened about me getting up from bed and go to work, the struggles ugh. Even think about it, I already feel overwhelmed. I don't if what I do right now is right or wrong, and I don't know if the things I try wanna do is good for me or not.

I really need help 😔 I'm sorry if it's too long for you to read &amp; if my grammar is bad, I'm sorry again."

nie8at,479,2021-05-22,[Uni] poly and jc are both viable routes into uni,beeyonce56789,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/nie8at/uni_poly_and_jc_are_both_viable_routes_into_uni/,"
hi guys, i’ve been seeing a lot of rants over the priority of jc students’ chances of getting into uni and i’d thought i’ll put my 2 cents in the situation.


i was from a mid-tier jc for 2 years and i aimed to get into medicine after A levels (took PCME). i knew that med sch was for “the cream of the crop” and you needed nothing short of 90rp and a stacked portfolio to get in. so i took up multiple job shadowing attachments at NUHS and volunteered often at KKH, NCCS, SGH etc. i was president of my jc cca and a recipient of the EAGLES award. however, this all took a toll on my academics ofc and i cried upon receiving my A level results. I had gotten 70rp which meant my lifelong dream of Med, which required at least 88.75rp to be shortlisted, was not going to be realised. so i knew I had the option to go to certain igp courses but i had no passion for them, and at that point i knew i wanted to go into med so there was nothing that could stop me. it wasn’t a matter of chasing prestige, but a desire to follow my passion and make a difference in the healthcare industry. 

so after this I had 2 options: re-take A levels or go to poly. i chose the latter, bc I knew that taking A levels again would sacrifice my mental health -  and i was not rlly suited for JC bc the endless mugging and routine was too much for me to handle. 


at this point i did my research and knew the odds were stacked against me as every year there was only about 4/5 polytechnic students making it into med schs in local uni (altho the number is steadily increasing!). but i decided to take a chance and enrol in sp’s biomedical science anyways. 

from the start, i had a clear goal, so for the next 3 years, i worked extremely hard, ensuring my cumulative gpa could earn me a spot in med sch.  i eventually graduated with a 3.98 gpa this year and scored a spot in NUS YLL med sch aft a lot of anxiety over the rigorous admission process. was definitely very grateful for this opportunity, since i know there were only a handful of poly students getting accepted into med this year. 

so having gone thru both routes, i can’t give much advice for jc students since i flunked my A’s LOL. but for poly kids - those who want to aim for a local uni: here’s my advice 

1. work extremely hard for year 1 and year 2. year 1 basically sets the foundation for ur gpa and if u screw it up, there’s no going back no matter how hard you work in y2 and y3. also, since y3 has significantly less modules than y1 and y2, and its made up by FYP and intern it’s VERY hard to pull up ur gpa then (unless you get 4.0 for both sems). ESPECIALLY sem 2.2; it will make or break ur gpa bc that’s when u take modules with the most credit units (correct me if i’m wrong, but this was for my sp course). 
2. read all your lecture slides beforehand - this will help u absorb the content covered better, as opposed if u walked into the lecture with no clue what was gg to be covered. usually i will read the lecture slides on the mrt or bus on the way to sch.
3. make sure you invest equal effort into all components of ur module! i made the mistake of prioritising my individual assignments and exams over grp projects in year 1, and this brought down my overall grade for the module. grp projects are at least 30% of each module, so they can make the diff between an A and a B+. i found that when i spoke up during group discussions, did my work early and consistently and delegated the tasks to my group members, i scored higher for grp projects as compared to if i was more of a silent member. 
4. study for ur mid sem tests/finals beforehand! this is an underrated tip but especially important bc most of the time, we only study during study week. it’s pretty hard to cram material for 3 exams in 1 week if you don’t start early. for me, the start of the sem was usually the slackest before the assignments and projects started flooding in: so i utilised that time to read my textbooks beforehand (usually i would read one chapter every 2 days and then start making notes before the mid sem tests.) 
5. surround urself with ppl who are as motivated as u. if ur goal is to end up in a local uni, don’t hang out with ppl who slack in group projects or submit their assignments late. my friends were v helpful  during times when i didn’t understand a theory or a certain question in past year papers - make sure their goals are aligned with us too. 

i hope this helps for current poly students who aim for local unis! i had to experiment with a lot of things in y1 since i was unfamiliar with this new teaching style so alot of it is based on personal experience. and i’ve been seeing a lot of posts from poly students with 3.6+ gpa getting rejected by local unis, which is rather strange because the igp last year for some courses was 3.3-3.6. altho idk what it’s like, i know how hard y’all have worked to maintain ur cgpa for 3 years straight! it’s def not an easy feat so hold your head up high! try reapplying next year if you’re set on entering a local uni - and in the mean time take up internships to boost ur portfolio. y’all did great in poly and u should be proud of yourselves for graduating!!! don’t let this be a blow to your self esteem bc of certain factors like the pandemic or increase in competitiveness bring u down. 


and it is entirely possible for poly students to enter uni - albeit might be harder for law/medicine/dentistry/cs, but it’s not impossible. most of jc students gain entry to local uni as jc itself “prepares” them for the academic rigour in uni, hence i don’t think it’s entirely unfair that those with higher merit in poly are only allowed admission into uni. it might be hard to cope in uni if one does not have the necessary foundation in poly itself"

Thrid, generally is there any advice that I can get?

So basically for the summer I have an opportunity to do some crypto/machine learning related software development for a tiny start up as a lowly paid Software Engineer intern. Anyway, it's the only for sure internship I have for this summer (might be able to get a better one my senior year).

Anyway, next week I have a decent chance of getting an offer for SDET/Software Engineer in Test (selenium automation) at a big company. It pays WAYYYY more than the internship (full time role). Being that I still have my senior year to get a good internship and a lot of companies look for seniors, I thought about accepting both.

Make good money, and get to pick and choose what goes on my resume. Honestly, i'm not opposed to just leaving the SET off my resume.

Is it bad if I took both? If I took one or the other? What should I do? Can't I just put ""Software Engineer internship"" for the SET role if i'm using it as a school internship anyway? I realize that accepting a job after school might ""pigeonhole you"" but i'm confident person, was successful in sales, switched my direction and dove head first. I genuinely don't feel it's possible for me to be pigeonholed anywhere.

What do you guys think I should do? Accept both for the summer? One or the other?"

I'm graduating university at the end of this year with a BSc but I'm just really stuck on what I want to do.

Recently, I lost someone who was one of the closest supports I've ever had in my life. I met them almost 2 years ago - someone who made me smile and experience pure happiness for the first time in my life (a difference from the dehumanisation and bullying I received when I was younger), and see the world as a more brighter place as I came out of isolation from an event the year prior. This person, who I will call A, ended up becoming my very special LDR, and was constantly supporting me no matter what, but their ""departure"" was not in vain and never will be (as you'll come to find out).

Additionally, I also met another person, B, at this time, who was able to guarantee me a position in my then-dream job. They considered themselves a friend of A (which ended up never being true). However, they kept pushing the due date for contract arrival backward and backwards, and only when my studies were starting to get affected, they decided to tell me I would not get in because of my medical condition.

My friends helped dig into the issue and we realised that they were impersonating an employer of my then-dream company to work in, and that there was never a position made for me at all. Because of this person's guaranteed contract they offered me, I had to prepare for the job beforehand and so dropped studying for med school and will now graduate with a GPA below that of entry, alongside no preparation for an exam required for entry, which I'm sure I won't be able to take post-graduation. 

My friends also discovered that B was deliberately leading me on and bringing false hope, and that they had also ended up impersonating A without me realising - leading to a budding relationship between myself and the real A being ultimately cut short by B's actions (because B somehow blocked A from communicating with me on the only platform we had contact), long before I noticed, and thus when I found out, it ultimately shattered my heart. It's now placed me in a position where I don't know where to go or what to do with my life any more. 

This year, I was lucky to complete an internship in medical research. However, whilst I did enjoy it, I'm not sure if I want to pursue that pathway any more as I was just feeling tired every single day after work - and I know I'll need to pursue an Honours year to become a medical researcher. I've also been thinking of going into law school - so I can help others feel more humanised and not treated the way I was treated by B in the future, but knowing I'll need to have surgery on my medical condition in the future makes me worry that I won't be able to keep up if I choose this pathway. I'm also worried I'll accumulate more debt than I need, as I am currently just below the cutoff for this pathway but may still be able to enter a full fee paying position under compelling circumstances. For context, people with the same medical condition tend to drop out of university or end up graduating and finding a job in another industry - and most of the time they will only get part time at minimum wage. My dream job was to be an entry level manager in a specific industry which I won't disclose, but I already know when I graduate with a BSc, it will be very hard to find a job, and I won't have the qualification to make it into that career pathway.

My current major in molecular biology is already not going well compared to last year, yet I don't want to give up my major or my degree when I'm so far in already. I find it tough to study nowadays, and was working 26 hour weeks in my internship during the crux of my assignment weeks, whilst studying full time.

What would be the best outcome for someone who is worried they won't be able to do anything after graduation, a result of setback after setback after setback?"

Senior cybersecurity lead asked me how I was able to get my past work experience?,StuckinConfusion,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ninjuh/is_this_weird_senior_cybersecurity_lead_asked_me/,"So I had a cyber security internship two weeks ago. It was odd.The hiring manager from another state called, late in working hours, around 5, unannounced. No schedule of meeting up for a interview. He sort of just popped up and expected me to interview on the spot. I did, thinking that it could possibly lead somewhere.

The hiring manager from that state then directs me to the hiring manager in my state for a full video interview.

So anyway, I have the interview with two people in the upper management of cyber security on video call. One of the older members there is really stuck on the positions that I worked for in the past AND not like in a **""so what did you do""** kind of way, but more like hung up on me working the jobs while I was in school. He then continued to ask me how I was able to rack up as many jobs as I did? Like what am I supposed to say? Oh well, karen and Jacob just toss me jobs in relation to cyber security (IT work)?

I felt the question was odd since I'd never have experienced someone who asked me how I was able to work the jobs I got. Then kept saying that it was ""commendable"" that I worked while in school. Just kept going around it. Now that I think about it, they weren't really asking me many technical questions- just little here and there. The students I noticed that they hired for internships had wayy less experience as me, nothing that could draw out a pattern to me.

Out of all the interviews.. that interview felt so damn strange. I keep tryin to forget it but something keeps nagging at me!

&amp;#x200B;

To debrief- they  Kept saying, ""Commendable that you're able to work while in school"". "" You have some bit of experience working in technology"". They rarely asked me tech questions. The ones they did ask, I was able to give some examples from my work....

The job I have now... the technical managers/leads were actually impressed and hired me. So I just feel a bit off by it.

I have an IT internship. Two help desk jobs that are tech heavy from reputable companies (I'm currently in my third one) Everyone has heard of them."

I am 23M about to be 24 in a 2 months. I am in college and in the Army National Guard, however took a semester off this spring to wait until classes are back in person instead of online because I felt that I wasn't learning anything from it. Anyways, for the past 10+ years of my life, my days have consisted mostly of playing video games online with a few friends for 6+ hours a day and I am just bored doing the same thing everyday and annoyed with how its affected me.

I moved to a new state after graduating highschool and since then I haven't really made any new friends here that I am able to hang out with in person and get out of the house. I have social anxiety and find it hard to connect with people as I always find myself not knowing what to say and worrying about being seen as awkward, quiet, and uninvolved. I feel that all the time I've spent playing games have really put a damper on who I can be and basically gives me a very limited amount of topics I can actually connect with because the only thing I've really been doing is playing games and watching tv. I am sick of it and honestly haven't had as much fun recently playing them and I really just want to be able to connect with people in the real world and make friends to do things out and about. I know I don't want to completely phase out playing games because its the only way I can still hangout with my friends back in my home state.

I struggle everyday with my social anxiety, I feel that my future is bleak if I don't reign it in. In school, I find it difficult to even approach teachers to ask questions and involve myself in classes and extra studies. I am not doing bad in school but have made 0 connections with teachers and have not done any extra research/study opportunities which is pretty important for finding a career as I am studying Marine Biology and it requires a lot of experience to even get a starting job. I tried getting a summer internship at a Fishery, had an interview that I thought had went okay but I felt I fumbled many times and I ended up not getting the internship but getting listed as an alternate (if the person they chose backed out) so that didn't happen and I felt that meant nothing as it didn't pan out to anything. I am a senior with give or take 2 semesters left to graduate and I am just really nervous to graduate as I feel like I haven't gotten much from college.

I've felt this way for a while now and have tried making some improvements to myself for a little over 2 months now. I'm working on feeling more confident and so I have been lucky enough to find a gym partner in my neighborhood and we have been in his home gym almost every weekday in the past 2 months and I am doing really well physically. I started at 165lb, dropped to 158 after the first month, and since got back up to 166lb which my partner told me is good since I shredded some fat in the first month and the weight I'm seeing is muscle. Anyways I'm feeling good physically for the first time in a long time, I'm looking better than I have ever have even when I graduated basic training with the army 5 years ago. So I am feeling good in how I look but looks aren't everything and I feel like a bitch because I cant even hold conversations much less flirt.

I find social interactions hard even with some friends and family because I have just been doing the same thing for years and have nothing to say. I'm embarrassed by what I do and I want more from life. I have never been in a relationship but know I have to better who I am and be confident in who I am first but it feels so far away. I know its not a huge deal but I am a virgin and whenever some of my few friends talk anything about meeting girls, getting dates that lead to more, and getting girlfriends, I just have no idea how that feels and I am just envious. I know I have to work on myself before I should even think of trying any of that. Talking with anyone is just hard for me because I feel I have nothing to offer/show for where I am at and am intimidated by pretty much everyone. I know not everyone has it together too but the faces that they put on are convincing and I just feel weak and below everyone.

I know I should start by finding some hobbies and things that I like to do but I have no idea where to start. I get really anxious doing anything alone so it's hard for me to try new things but I know I just need to not think and just do but I don't know what it is I have to do if that makes sense. When I was a kid, I liked to fish and do those rock climbing walls which I have thought about doing again myself but I don't know where to go for that and I don't know how to fish on my own, I was a kid so I always had other people setting up the rod and everything and a lot of the videos I watch on youtube seem advanced and I don't really know what they're talking about.

I was going to therapy for a little while over a year and a half ago, but stopped as at the beginning of 2020, I was close to being deployed over the whole Iran situation and I had to cancel appointments with the therapist as I had to go through pre deployment things. When I tried to book another appointment when that died down, the only available days were like a month or so away and then Covid started around that time and they paused operations and went online and I do not like the video setup at all and just haven't gone back and now feel like its been too long to go back to that place and don't know if I should go to a new place or go to the old because my therapist wasn't bad but it's just been a long time now so... anxiety. lol

But thank you for reading all of this if ya did and any advice/guidance/personal experiences would be appreciated."

so I applied for only 1 summer program bc I was sure I would get in and also I didn't know about others until after the deadline passed...and I didn't get in.

I do have an internship with a local uni professor tho but I was wondering if there was any summer program where registration is still open. Technically, it doesn't have to be a summer program and can be year round too (like JHU ASPIRE). But I want something that is competitive/selective (but not MOSTEC level), if it is during the school yr, it would have to be completely virtual, and preferably something STEM related (esp bio, math, comp sci). Also, I don't want summer classes offered by colleges where its all online and modules, I would prefer maybe mentorship programs or opportunity to do research or anything else rlly hands-on.

IK its prob too late for this, but I found a bunch of opportunities with deadlines a little later, but I just wasn't eligible so I'm hoping one of you guys know a program I can apply to."

nirgsn,149,2021-05-22,There Are No Free Sofas In Habitsville,nicnoc246,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/nirgsn/there_are_no_free_sofas_in_habitsville/,"I don’t talk about this much, but I used to have a roommate.

It was a few years ago, when I was just an intern at the Habitsville Gazette. It was before any of my stories had been published, before anyone knew the name Samuel Singer. Rent in Habitsville is low, but my zero-dollar paycheck from the newspaper office was even lower, and the only way I could afford rent was to split it with somebody else.

Ironically, it was from a newspaper ad that I met Steven.

He was as broke as I was, but we each could scrape together enough to survive (and, truthfully, he was the only one who answered my ad), so we got a small place and moved in. We couldn’t afford living room furniture in the beginning, so we tended to keep to ourselves, opting instead to hang out in our individual rooms when we were home. It was a comfortable, if unfamiliar symbiotic relationship.

Until he brought *it* home.

Steven was proud of the couch he had found on the side of the road, but I wasn’t so sure. It was old, dirty, and pretty torn up. I’m no décor snob, but even this was a bit much for me.

“There’s a huge rip on that cushion.”

He shrugged. “We can flip it.”

“and the smell?”

He waved his hand dismissively. “We can clean it.” Then, after seeing the look on my face, he corrected himself. “*I* can clean it.”

I ran my gaze over the lumpy object again, in all its sickly green glory. The tragedy of it all was that at some point, this was a pretty nice sofa—I could see where once the ill color was a vivid emerald, the matted material was once soft velvet, and dry rot hanging off the bottom was once shined wooden molding. It probably once was a piece in some rich person’s parlor in the 1950’s—but now it looked like trash.

I leaned in a bit closer and squinted. “And what about the stain?”

Steven furrowed his brow. “What stain?”

I couldn’t believe he hadn’t seen it, it was so huge. It stood out dark violet against the green, and I could tell it spread across the bottom right cushion and the back. It didn’t take long to see that there was something odd about it—it wasn’t a splatter, like someone had spilled something, or a passing car had thrown a drink out of the window while it was sitting out on the curb. There were no droplet marks around it, no uneven spreading—it was as though it seeped upward from somewhere below.

I pointed to it, and Steven blinked once, twice, a third time, then looked surprised. “Oh wow, you weren’t kidding. I don’t know how I missed that.”

He bent closer to it, his face curious. I had a strange feeling as the distance between him and sofa closed, a gut sensation that I should tell him to stop, or pull him back. The instinct heightened when he raised a hand to it, and a surge of fear rippled down my back as he pressed a pointer finger to the dark mass.

Then, he pulled it away, stood back up, and shrugged.

“I’ll clean that too,” he said, and that was it.

I let Steven keep the couch that I hated, mostly because I avoid confrontation, but also because I couldn’t afford to get us a better one. It was hard to argue against a free couch when your alternative is a giant empty space in the middle of your living room.

And to his credit, Steven did flip the ripped cushion, and he did clean the couch. He got out the vacuum, and some sort of upholstery cleaner he found online, and set to work. Eventually, the smell mildew and must faded from the thing, and even though I never used it, I found that I didn’t mind the old couch.

What I did mind, however, was that Steven seemed to be… *secretly* cleaning it.

As strange as it sounds, there is really no other way to see it. I actually caught my roommate trying to quietly scrub our sofa in the dead of night. I had gotten up for a drink of water, and there he was on his knees, yellow rubber gloves on his hands, rubbing a rag against the dingy velvet with vigor.

I didn’t know what to say. So, I crept past him, got my water, and went back to bed.

The next day, I walked out of my room, and Steven was already awake. He was sitting on the sofa, on the side with the turned over cushion. He was still wearing his cleaning gloves, and he was looking ahead, as though he was watching the turned-off television.

“Hey man,” I said casually, though I was feeling uneasy.

“Hey,” he answered, his voice measured and normal, though his eyes stayed staring ahead.

I was walking towards the kitchen, making my way along the back of the sofa, when I stopped. I eyed the silhouette of Steven’s head for a moment, then opened my mouth to ask about the bizarre cleaning episode I had come across during the night. But before I could, he spoke first.

“Do you think it’s getting bigger?”

I blinked. “What?”

“The stain,” he said, nodding across from him as though referring to another person, “Do you think it’s getting bigger?”

His question surprised me, but I peeked over the back of the sofa to look anyway. There was the stain, as dark and ominous as it had been that first day. And oddly, I thought Steven was right. It *did* look bigger, like it had spread over the past week.

“It’s probably all of that product you’re using on it,” I said, trying to seem unbothered. “There’s such a thing as *over* cleaning,” I added, hoping that if I hinted that I had seen Steven the previous night, he would explain his strange behavior.

“Yeah, maybe,” he answered absent-mindedly, then turned to look ahead once more.

When I got home from work, he was still there. The television had those rainbow bars on it, with that high-pitched ringing. I grabbed the remote and shut it off. Steven didn’t seem to notice.

I’m going to be honest, I thought Steven was cracking up a bit. I ran through a possible mental health intervention in my mind, but the thought of instigating that made me feel like I was going to have a panic attack of my own. Instead, I started asking around to see if anybody I knew was in need of a roommate—either I was getting out, or Steven was.

And then, the stain spread.

At first, I didn’t notice it. Steven was on his hands and knees scrubbing the thing so much that it had a permanent dark mark across the entire right side. I figured it was constantly damp from all of the cleaner he had sloshed together in an old bucket he had taken to carrying around with his rubber-gloved hands.

But eventually, I saw that the stain had crept down onto the floor.

Initially, I was pissed. Steven’s couch neurosis was going to cost me my security deposit, and like I said, in that time of my life every cent counted.

But when I brought this up to Steven, his reaction replaced my anger with concern.

“What do you mean, it’s on the floor?” he asked with terse, bloodless lips.

The self-righteous speech about accountability and responsibility I had rehearsed in my head was put on hold. I pointed towards the dark spot that had dripped down the furniture and onto the carpet. “Right there.”

Steven’s eyes slowly turned to where I gestured, his face gaunt and withered. He stared at the stain and said nothing. I was able to see how pale he looked, how tired. Though it was 76 and sunny outside, he wore the same black turtleneck that I had seen him in the day before. There was obviously something going on, something that I knew nothing about. I felt bad for the guy—but I also felt a powerful uneasiness right in the deepest pit of my stomach.

“Steven—I don’t think that’s doing anything. It’s not that big of a deal, really—“I regretted bringing up the stain at all, for pointing out its spread; but that regret was quickly replaced with horror as Steven brought his shaking hands together, and began to peel off his gloves.

“I’ll just have to scrub *harder* then,” Steven said, spittle flying as he struggled with his with gloves. And then, they were off, empty rubber sacks that fell to the ground.

There was a moment, just after the gloves came off, that I was *certain* Steven was wearing another pair underneath.

Unfortunately, he wasn’t.

Under the bright yellow mitts were mottled, violet hands. The nails were mustard and cracked, and the cuticles were peeled and rimmed with scarlet. As I stared, an acrid scent wafted to my nostrils, the dank stench of detritus and decay.

What was worse, was what he did next.

Steven began to scrub.

I wanted to stop him, but sheer terror stuck me in place. I watched as Steven brought his fingers to the carpet and pressed impossibly hard, moving in a vicious rhythm back and forth across the carpet.  His fingertips were stark with pressure, then bloodied from broken nails that snapped off in all directions.

“Steven—” I said, but he didn’t slow his pace. The softs pads of his fingers grew shiny from friction, rubbed raw against the fabric, and all the while the stain stayed the same. When the skin blistered and broke, I finally lunged forward and tried to push Steven by his shoulders. “Hey, man—stop it, you’re hurting yourself—”

He didn’t say anything, only gave a guttural grunt and attempted to shake me off. As the red of the blood mingled with the deep purple of the stain, I reached out and grabbed Steven’s hands.

He immediately grew still.

I finally let myself exhale, but the relief I felt quickly gave way to dread as Steven lifted his chin towards me, a disturbingly empty, yet animalistic look in his eye.

“You shouldn’t have touched it.”

I swallowed. “What do you mean?”

Steven slowly held up his mangled hands towards me, loose bits of flesh and nail hanging from exposed bone, with strings of brown carpet clinging to the sticky bits. “The stain,” he replied lowly, nodding at his hands. “Now it’ll get on you too.”

Then with that, Steven grabbed hold of the bottom of his turtleneck, and with one harsh pull, unveiled one of the worst sights I had ever seen.

His torso was a splotchy violet, like a huge birthmark that spready down from his arms and towards his waist. I could see there was a ring of ordinary flesh just above his belt, like as the stain crept from the sofa to the floor, it was now flowing over the expanse of Steven’s body. A purple circle was choked around his neck, inching closer to his chin.

The smell was the worst part. The faint stench that had been following Steven around for weeks was intensely putrid when exposed to the open air, and my eyes watered with the sting of it. It was as though his body was rotting from the inside out.

As my eyes traveled over Steven’s form, he moved calmly and quietly, picking up the rubber gloves he had tossed aside.

With a terrible *squelch* of blood and pulp, he forced his hands back into the slight holes.

Then, he looked at me.

“Sam,” he said clinically. “We’ve got to get that stain off of you.”

I felt the color drain from my face. Slowly, I looked down. My hands didn’t have any hint of the diseased color that Steven was coated in. But when I turned back towards my roommate, his eyes were focused on my skin. It was as though he could see something that I couldn’t.

He took a step forward.

I took a step back.

My leg hit something behind me, and I turned to see the sofa, in all of its sickly green glory, blocking me from my easiest escape route.

Steven was staring at me, and his face was concerned. “Steven,” I said again, trying to keep my voice light and friendly, “there’s nothing to worry about. See?” I held up my hands to him, turning them to either side. “It didn’t get on me. I’m fine.”

To my dismay, my roommate shook his head. “I was fine too, Sam.” He said, as the pitter patter of blood dripped from the opening of his gloves. “I was fine.”

That was the moment he lunged for me.

Time seemed to stand still. My feet were locked in place as Steven came towards me, his orange-smeared hands raised. I glanced to the spot below me on the carpet, where bits of his skin and the jagged chunks of nail littered the floor. Then, I looked back into the cold, determined eyes of my assailant, and I swore for a moment, they shone a deep, dark, sickly violet.

Then in one second, I stepped out of the way.

It was too quick for Steven to change direction, and he crashed into the emerald sofa hard, though it didn’t move an inch. He laid there for a second, in the velvet embrace of the furniture, his discolored body pressed against the matching expanse of stain.

He turned his head towards me, a look of pure terror on his face. Like, somehow he knew what was going to happen next.

There was a terrible grinding, slurping sound, as, hands-first, Steven was pulled in the slight crack between the sofa cushion, and the sofa’s back. He didn’t say a word, not a whimper, nor a scream.

He just silently slid deeper and deeper into the stained split, until he was gone. A second later, something slid back out—two yellow rubber gloves, licked clean.

I dropped the sofa off on the curb that same night, careful to only touch the left side."

Help me choose a bachelor's program.,gopi_bahus_laptop,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/nisefc/looking_to_pursue_a_career_in_networkingit/,"Hey guys, been lurking the subreddit for quite some time. Need some advice on choosing a degree for uni. I have two in mind:

[Information and Communication Technology](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/study/course/bachelor-of-information-and-communication-technology/network-technology/)

[Computer Science](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/study/course/bachelor-of-computer-science/network-design/)

Both degrees have networking majors with similar subjects (CS one has more advanced network stuff I think). I'm leaning towards ICT as it is more tailored for IT. The uni mentions the ICT program having proper CCNA prep built into it's curriculum. However, I've seen people on here say CS opens more door, but it is more difficult objectively. The CS program in the uni also has more internship opportunities. Do you think it's worth the hassle? Cheers."

Most of my courses during my time in school consisted of data analytics and very little data engineering (imported datasets into sql and normalized tables). The job description for the internship states: 

Assist in performing budget and procurement formulation and administration duties using Financial and MS office systems. 

MS office systems is somewhat vague since I know that it would include excel, word, powerpoint, etc, but I’m wondering if it would it also include Microsoft SQL server. 

I’m curious, what is the difference between Program Analyst, Data Analyst, and Data Engineer?

For example, instead of just going straight for a software development position with $70-80k in compensation, is there a ""lower-tier"" of jobs that maybe pay in the $40-60k range, for people who have the education but aren't as qualified?

I'm 34 and have no prior experience or skills in programming.  The company hires without having  any previous knowledge and train you from the start. I'm not exactly sure which path to take what they have is:

 * Front-end with html, CSS, Javascript, Angular, Angular Material, MVC

 * Back-end using C#

 * Mobile  with Swift for iOS

 * Mobile with Java for Android

 * Progressive Web Apps with Node.js, React, Angular

 * Databases with Transact-SQL  using Microsoft SQL server


 How would you rate them by dificulty level and which path do you think is more suited for inexperienced person trying to land a the job? I'm not in the US and the ageism here is strong so I kinda have to make it with this one or I might not get a 2nd chance. Front end looks interesting and so does mobile with iOS and Android, but I'm not sure what the progressive web apps are. I'm also trying to avoid the ones where math skills are more represented. Is Back-end much harder than Front-end?  One last thing of small importance which of these paths would teach me skills related to pentesting and ethical hacking as I'm showing interest in them as a hobby."

Still hearing back from some internships, but there's a good chance, I won't be making any money this semester or working at one that pays minimum wage. Currently, I'm still living off my parents which isn't too bad considering that my family is solidly middle class, but I do wish that I can support myself more and lessen my burden on the family and I really only have a low budget for daily spending especially compared to my friends who are from better financial situations and more loose with money.

Any low commitment jobs to get some extra spending money? I don't need to fully support myself but every bit counts. I'm also taking tough cs classes next semester so I don't want anything that takes up too much time.

I'm genuinely considering making a seeking arrangements if anyone had any experience with that. I'm a single asian male of average height (5'9.5-5'10) who is somewhat good looking and enjoys talking with older people.

I also applied for course staff. I do not have high hopes because I got rejected from pretty much every course staff including intern position this summer when its supposed to be easier.

nj0wwr,2,2021-05-23,Should I follow up?,FailTryHard911,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/nj0wwr/should_i_follow_up/,"TLDR: 

JOB: I'm Semi-qualified IMO, its an IT internship on campus for the university i go to. Uses tech like python, sql, html, etc that I know the basics of. The job is primarily AWS focused, but they dont expect you to know it since they provide training/certifications. I work another IT job on campus but its not really what I want to do (i'm a data science major) and this AWS role seems like a huge opportunity to learn something relevant. 

\- I had an interview on 5/14, I'd say it went decently well? I joined the call early, answered questions relatively ok (although in hindsight I could have been way more detailed and eloquent in my answers), and even got to ask 2-3 questions to the previous intern and rest of the team about things I'd be working on, takeaways from the position, etc. None of the questions were directly technical (like coding), but they asked about scenarios I've been in and what I knew in a very general sense.

\- on the same day, 5/14, i sent a thank you email to the person I was corresponding with (who was the main interviewer). I thanked them for the interview, brought up some stuff we talked about in our discussion, and mentioned how I hope my genuine interest in the role was conveyed through the interview. Didn't get a response to that email, although it was just a thank you email and it was a Friday evening so I'm not sweating it.

&amp;#x200B;

Now

\- They said the last interview they were holding was  5/22 (this past Friday), and then I should hear back \*hopefully\* this week or by the end of May at the latest, since the position begins mid June. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, should I send another follow up email to again re-iterate my interest in the role / somehow show them I am super-interested, or just wait it out until they reach out with a decision? I really want this role, but I dont know if following up again would be too pushy vs showing genuine interest."

I have zero internships, zero projects, zero networking. I wanted to share several tips that I thought really helped me get one:

1. Check multiple job posting sites (LinkedIn, GoogleJobs, Indeed). The job that accepted me was only posted on Indeed and not on any other sites.
2. Once you find the posting you want to apply to, apply directly to the company's website instead of the job posting sites. Especially for Indeed, there are often many applicants (100+ for mine) and applying on the company's website instead can make your application stand out from others.
3. Job-hunt everyday. The sooner you apply, the better it is. I applied within a week of the posting. The companies who are hiring multiple people for the position may even accept applicants right after job interviews. The company that accepted me gave me an offer just two days after my interview. Therefore, if you are one of the first several interviewees, there are less people to compare you to, and companies may be in a hurry to fill in their position, so apply as soon as you can!
4. Get certifications (if applicable to your career)! This is what I really believe helped me the most. I would stalk people's profiles on LinkedIn that worked the general position I wanted (ex. IT Systems Analyst), and get the SAME certifications they had. The time taken to get these certifications can be optimized if you look through the specific subreddit for these, they have the best resources. My interviewer was really interested in the technical knowledge I got from my certs and said they were a good match for the position, so it looks like my stalking hours paid off.

I hopes this helps."

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently in the midst of National Service and I will be matriculating into SIT- Digipen IMGD next year, at least for now. Now, I am not sure if I want to carry on with IMGD as my choice for my degree.

&amp;#x200B;

During my internship, I was exposed to Automation Processes and I needed to learn from scratch so that I could carry out what I needed to do for internship, and I had a lot of fun with UI Path. Thus, When the news that SIT was gonna offer Robotics Systems as a degree, I went to apply for the course and went for an in person interview.

&amp;#x200B;

If there was anything that I could takeaway from the interview, it was that I was inadequate for the course, to the extent where I was actually questioning if I should carry on with studying IT, as the interviewers mentioned that I only scratched the surface of learning how to program and that my concepts towards programming was flawed. They still offered me a position a month after the interview, which to this day, I am not sure as to why they did, if I was not that good of a candidate.

&amp;#x200B;

I initially applied and accepted my place in IMGD as I wanted to be able to go overseas for a semester at the Digipen campus in Redmond (and also travel and experience new culture). In addition, I also has a lot of interest in game development, given that I love games with a storyline (like RE, Unchatered, TLOU) and always wondered how these blockbusters were developed, and I also love to tell stories, hence my choice for IMGD.

&amp;#x200B;

As I have interest in both courses, this is how I view the situation:

&amp;#x200B;

IMGD

\- I can actually learn how to develop a game from scratch

\- I can get to experience new stuff here and there

\- I would probably have a lot of job opportunities after graduation

\- I suck at art so I am not sure if I would be able to manage the artistic part of the course

\- Tiring curriculum. I am afraid that I cannot push through to graduation.

\- Probably great prospects overseas (I don't see myself being in Singapore after Uni if I can migrate after finding a job opportunity overseas.)

Robotics Systems

\- Cheaper!!!! (actually cost is not a concern since I am fortunate enough to afford both courses out of pocket)

\- I get to dive deeper into automation and help create processes that would help work processes or a task to be more efficient.

\- Not sure as to how the course will be like.

\- I am not sure as to my prospects after graduation.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that this post may come off as privileged, but I am really confused as to which is a more practical route for me to go through so that I do not flunk university. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

PS. Is C and C++ difficult to learn? I started learning some C and C++ recently and I can get the bare basics, but I am not sure if it is going to get tougher from there. Thank you for your help in advance!"
nj580r,1,2021-05-23,Got a lot of mental pressure in an internship and left it. Was it a right thing to do?,ugh__15,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/nj580r/got_a_lot_of_mental_pressure_in_an_internship_and/,"So this is my first time posting anything but I really needed an advice. I don't know if it was a right thing to do. So basically I got a internship through my University but due to Corona virus situation I was not able to go to the place of the job which was in other city. So I asked the HR if they can somehow relocate me near my hometown and they were pretty nice about it and relocated me. I joined there branch in my city and was excited about the training. On my first day, i was taught about there product and services that I would have to sell which dropped my mood because I was not informed that I would be in sales department concerning the factor that I have done my MBA in finance. But I let it go and thought to try my best nevertheless. The first week was okay I was taught a little bit but by end of the week they stopped to even look at me. It was like I became invisible to them. But I thought maybe it's the end of the week pressure. Next week the head directly gave me a list of potential customers and told me to give them cold call to make a sale. 

This is when things started changing because not knowing how to make a sale I still tried my very best and by the end of the 2nd week i got few leads but they were still uncertain to buy our insurance. Now I was supposed to give these leads to the one of the relationship manager there so that she can convert it to a more potential sale. But she went ahead and told the head of sales department that after the whole week i had only few leads and no sales. The head being the headass told me how it has been two weeks and I have done no sales and if this keeps going on they would have to leave me be.
I was so distraught after that day on work that I cried at home. I didn't knew what to do. I thought I was trying my best and I talked to my other classmates about it. They told me that how horrible it is and nothing like that was happening with them though.
The 3rd week i tried again but with low morale i hardly got 2 leads and by Thursday the head of the department came out of her cabin started shouting at me in front of the whole office. After that I could not take it anymore and stopped going. I did 1 call the next day from that relationship manager about where I was and i told her that I was down with fever. I told my college how i could not continue there any longer. And they told me that I would have to find another internship because it's mandatory. So I somehow found one through a relation and have been doing the internship here now which is more nicer and less draining. But somehow I still feel that maybe I was in the wrong somewhere. Maybe it's the fact that I am an introvert and doing sales was never my preference but I still feel that I let down people specifically myself. I don't know if this was a right thing to do and if this happens a lot. Because my parents have said that's how a sales is done and that I should have tried harder. What do you think reddit?"

I was inspired by someone in this community who got into law while having a relatively lower rp compared to our peers. I hope my story could bring some hope to those reapplying/applying for the first time in 2022.

I took my A levels in 2019 and when the results were out in 2020, my rp was way below the cut off for med (84 rp). My BMAT was not superb but with the portfolio I had, I applied to both nus and ntu.

It wasn’t surprising that exactly one year ago, I was rejected without an interview. I was a huge mess that I couldn’t pursue my passion. Big decisions such as retaking As, going overseas, taking a gap year and duke-nus flooded my mind. On 24 May 2020, I accepted another uni course as my family heavily disapproved my want to take a gap year.

Through sem 1, it was apparent that I was more passionate about volunteering and working at clinics(which i was heavily involved in since 2019) compared to studying for my degree. 

I mustered the courage to talk to my friends and family and convinced my family that the decision I really wanted to make was properly thought out and planned. After much consideration, I took the leap of faith and dropped out. I started volunteering and working full time.

Fast forward to 2021, i reapplied to nus with a refreshed portfolio and rewritten personal statement. After being blessed to have a chance to be in interviews and a gruelling month-long wait, I was accepted into nus med.

To those weren’t successful and are thinking of reapplying: i understand you may be feeling discouraged and lost on what to do next. I too was disappointed a year ago and I know how it feels like when things don’t go the way we originally planned it to be. Please dont be too hard on yourself:,) It is not the end of the world and you’re strong enough to pick yoursef up and take your next step. I hope that I could help by sharing my experience on my half-ish gap year.

Portfolio: 
- 4 clinical related— 2 internships pre covid and 2 part time/full time clinic work pre covid till now
- 4 long term volunteering — started a project and regular volunteering ranging from 4 months to 1 year plus 
- 2 leadership awards

Ps: 
- what interested me to pursue med
- what i did to find out more/figure out if this is the path for me
- “why med” and experiences that cemented my passion for med
- what I learnt from my experiences"

I was wondering which would be more worth it. Some issues i have are:
1. I heard that the trimester system at UNSW was exhausting and stressful to many and the fact that diploma students face a 12 week semester instead of the usual 10 worries me as they get less free time and holidays

2. Some people say students of CS find it difficult to get internships not only due to the trimester system but as well as the amount of workload making it difficult to slide in an internship in all that

3. UTS CS major is considered way worse than UNSW and some says that its just a IT program disguised as a CS. UTS is also not part of the go8 and ranked way lower than UNSW so im worried that employers would choose a graduate from a go8 uni than me(if i were to choose UTS)"

Currently in my 4th-year of undergraduate study. I initially developed an interest in computer hardware back in my 2nd year, did a couple of projects, internships and eventually applied for an MS in the US. Thankfully, I got an offer for an MS in Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and will be joining this Fall 2021, provided the pandemic doesn't create any more uncertainty. However, by 4th year, I kind of lost my interest in computer architecture, VLSI, ML, and whatever I had been doing until now.

In the end, I decided to change my career to software engineering and apply for an SDE role after my MS in the US. I do believe I am decently proficient in Data Structures and Algorithms, Operating Systems, OOP, and Computer Networks and can improve on that if necessary.  But, I don't have any related work experience or projects.

Therefore, I need some advice on how I should plan these 2 years in the US so that I can land a decent job after my master's. Hoping it's not too late to change, some insight into what courses I should take, what skills I should develop, or any factors I missed that should be taken into account will be really helpful.

Do you guys recommend any courses to take while I wait for the semester to start? It will be about 4 months before it starts.

So I've posted about this recently in other places about my internship, but in short, I'm a CAD designer for a small aerospace manufacturer that makes rubber components.

Two weeks ago, I got swamped with 10 or so projects that I had to complete in about 3.5 days. I got most of those things modeled but nothing got sent out because my supervisor specifically told me not to let him review them until the list was completed. Not only did I not quite finish, but I made some absolutely *idiotic* mistakes. 

How bad?

* I completely made something up based on a design table
* I didn't stop to look at the provided notes and drawings enough
* Most of all, I didn't have the courage to tell my supervisor and the CEO that I couldn't actually finish all the projects in such a short time

I thankfully didn't get in trouble, but I was given a serious talk about making mistakes and that I could've killed the company overnight. Now, I let everyone know how long something will take so that I don't overcommit. I'm also going through each project one at a time, taking my time and asking more questions.

There's still some mistakes being uncovered from that week, though, and I keep making new small ones. Thankfully, I'm not repeating any and I'm learning them quite quickly. My supervisor is saying I'm doing an excellent job, but the CEO is way more critical of me (this is a 20+ people company).

Is there a way I can learn from mistakes without actually making mistakes? I understand that that's how you grow and learn, but now I'm starting to realize how much these little mistakes I keep making add up."

I suspect that if the situation arises that I would be seeking a business-related job, I will have been out of school for several years with no internships or relative experience. With that in mind, does anyone have any suggestions for which I should choose? While I think I would enjoy both, what worries me is the lack of experience I’ll have when looking for a job in the field so perhaps one might be easier to get into without experience than the other?

I am a Finance Major with a Minor in Mathematics. I am in my junior and expect to graduate by Dec 22. I want to break in as a quant. I am an international student in Canada and expect to find work in Canada. (Pref. Toronto or Vancouver). My current GPA is around 3/4.33 and  I am sure it will stay around that by the time I graduate.  I have worked part-time jobs before but nothing related to what I am studying.   
I want to ask what should I focus on before graduating so that I stand a good chance of finding a good job as a quant.

  
These are the things I have thought about so far that I believe I should focus on:  
1. Internship - that's obvious but still have no clue who would hire me as my GPA isn't fantastic 

2. Programming - I have started with python and am halfway there in a 40-hour basic data science course. I will definitely learn more. I am studying MATLAB in one of my courses as well. Not sure whether  I should build projects or focus on something else.  


Some more background:  
I have been on the dean's honour roll twice and got a small scholarship from my uni. My uni is among the top 10 in Canada. (Don't know if that matters a lot but I thought it would be worth mentioning.)

What do you think I should focus on while I am still in university?

Also, could you mention the best places to work in Canada? 

Thank you!"

I'm a second year intl. student studying Adv. Math / CS student, and I'm planning further studies in Applied Math (or CS) in Graduate school in the US or UK. Currently, my goal is to enter top grad schools like MIT, Standford, or Cambridge univ.

I heard that to enter Grad school in US, I need to take an exam called GRE, along with ""good undergrad. grade"". But I'm quite confused whether these two would be enough.  
So my questions are,

1. To be accepted in top Grad School in the US, how high my WAM should be? (like at least 90+ ??)
2. Would good WAM along with good GRE score be enough, or should I do extracurricular activities, such as personal project, internship, club activites?
3.   If so, what activities are highly recommended?"
njf9u2,2,2021-05-23,Need experience to enter financial planning field and took a credit union job that is quickly becoming overwhelming. What should I do?,tempacctbtw,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/njf9u2/need_experience_to_enter_financial_planning_field/,"So I want to get into being a CFP, and I have already been studying to take the SIE, but I don't have money handling or customer service experience. 
To cover this, I applied to every bank/credit union in my town and only received 1 offer. I took it because it would give me the experience I want but the actual job is more than I have expected.

They expect me to be a teller, an account manager, and a loan officer whenever they need someone for the role. So if no one was in the lobby waiting to talk about getting a loan, I would be expected to work the teller line, or if someone wanted to alter their account I would have to help them.
The problem is I have no prior experience in any of these categories and the schedule they gave me only has a week's training for each of these, where I am by myself in a back room reading pages on how to theoretically do the transactions. First week learning how to be a teller, second week how to manage accounts, and third week how to open and alter loans. So by the 4th week I won't have done tellering for 2 weeks. Minimal hands on training and mostly shadowing the other tellers at the end of the day. I asked one of the part time tellers how long she had for training and she said she had 3 weeks just for being a teller. 

They are aware of my lack of experience and I had them clarify my role. I also informed my manager and hiring person that I would not be able to do the jobs effectively or safely (each of these roles has many regulations that must be followed) with only 3 days of reading training and one day of shadowing so they said they would allow me an extra week of teller shadowing. But that doesn't feel like enough.
I'm overwhelmed with their expectations and I dont know what to do. Advice?

Backstory:
Im 24 and graduated with a degree in finance in Dec 2019, live in Tx. Covid shut everything down, so I ended up making 2020 a gap year. Since January I have been looking for my first job, preferably in the financial planning field as that was what my internship focused on, but I was not getting any answers on my submissions, good or bad, just ghosted and sometimes over a month after the fact I would get a rejection.
I started to just apply to every bank/credit union/ any place that did anything financial in my town. This credit union job was the only one that extended an offer and I took it because I only needed the one opportunity. They told me they were going through a change but its so much more than that, they are completely changing their system in a few months. So once I learn this system I will have to forget it and learn another completely new system, along with learning all the other roles. They are incredibly understaffed and it's for $15/hr.


I'm so scared that if I leave I won't find anything else and I will be a failure and the longer I go without work history the worse it will be. I really like the idea of being a CFP but even just helping people with investing in general would be amazing. I'm willing to work and learn but it's just so much. What should I do??

TL;DR I'd set my mind to moving back to India but my indian friends are all looking to leave India. I'm now completely rethinking my decision. 

Hi, I'm having a lot of anxiety right now and the people in my life aren't really helping so I thought I'd try reddit to see if anyone has advice that can comfort me. 

I'm (F22) from India. I used to live in the Philippines when I was younger for 5 years but I moved back to India for high school. From there, I moved to the Netherlands for 3 years for my undergraduate degree, then back to India for a year for a uni course, and then to the UK for a year for my masters degree. I'm currently in the UK and close to finishing up my degree. 

I moved to the UK in Sep 2020, in the middle of the pandemic, and because of this, my stay in the UK has been very isolating. I had a hard time at first but I've adjusted since then, and while I don't mind it so much right now, I can't imagine doing this for longer than a couple of months. 

I had been looking for jobs in the UK but after having a super hard time even finding an unpaid internship in my field (psychology btw), much less a paying job that would sponsor my visa (that means paying more than the average worker in my position simply because of the laws surrounding work visas), and having a hard time with my mental health, I decided to give up looking for a job here and focusing on myself and just moving back to India at the end of my degree. I also started therapy at this time because I've just been struggling with isolation and anxiety.

I took some time to adjust to this decision, but overall, I do like living in India. My family is decently well-off, so ofc I understand that I come from a place of privilege compared to the average person, and that's probably contributing to me liking living in India. I'm an only child so I sometimes think that spending time with my parents in India would be nice. I feel like since things are cheaper and certain luxuries are more accessible, I would have a nicer time living there. In comparison, I feel isolated and a little out of place in Europe. I have loved living in the Netherlands and the UK and I like my quality of life but life just seems a little harder for me in terms of expenses and things and I think I always thought of it as temporary, and moving back to India at some point of my life was always the plan. 

Now onto the dilemma. Over the past few days, multiple friends in India have told me that they're looking for masters programmes outside India because they really want to settle outside and basically just not live in India. Generally as well, whenever I tell indian people that I really like India, they always give me a look and ask if I'm crazy and why I'd want to leave my life in Europe. 

All of this is making me ask, am I crazy? Am I completely mistaken about what my life would be like in India? Am I making a horrible decision and ruining my life? 

I'm trying to tell myself that I can change my mind again later as well and that I don't need to plan my entire life out at 22. But the other part of me is saying that whatever decisions I make in my 20s will have a huge impact on how my life pans out and I need to take this extremely seriously.

I've been hyperventilating for quite a while now, but I wanna ask you guys. Am I crazy to want to move to my home country? Would it be better to start looking for jobs in the UK again?

I have set goals for myself, and know where I want to be in 10-20 years from now. However I have a hard time executing my goals. My goals consist of,

Owning a house 

Starting a family

Becoming a good software engineer

Having over $1,000,000 in an investment portfolio

Having a stable job that I can chose to work at home when I want and have flexible hours

First year out of highschool:

Right out of highschool I went from working 35 hours to 60 hours between two jobs, One was a assistant management position in a small pizzeria that I eventually quit, because I didn't get along with the new manager that was hired shortly after. In order to become the manager, I would of had to quit my other job that I was working, which I liked the people that worked there, up until I switched to full time. During this time of working, I learned about investing into the stock market from a microeconomics class that I took during highschool. During this time, I didn't know what I wanted to go to college for or what I wanted to do. I made sure to be cautious about my career because I have a lot of family / older friends who hate their careers. I would stay up and play league of legends and nerd out on my freetime. I ended up getting addicted to the game, and only worked 40 hours a week while focusing on playing games and hanging out with my EX girlfriend who ended up cheating on me. I know that I am smart and I find learning things to be easy as long as I put in the effort. During highschool I was taking college general classes. My parents make me pay a $300 rent fee. This is already on top of my phone and insurance bill which I had to pay when I was 16 which is around $200. With this, I wanted to build my credit so I bought a car with a loan that I need to pay $255 a month over a span of 6 years. With this information, it brought my total bill expenses to $755 a month. I was making about $1,800 a month after tax, and I would use minimum of my money for pleasure, and invest the majority of my money. My parents were nice and fed me most days so I would just have to buy dinner at work when I worked the second shift which wasn't bad at all. However, I worked at a gas station so the food that I would pick out would be things that often made me not feel good enough to exercise anymore and I ended up gaining weight and ended up weighing about 285 lbs at the age of 19.

Second year out of highschool:

I learned that my health was lacking, so I started to eat salads, or skip dinner instead of munching on junk food for dinner. This helped me lose 50 lbs so currently I weigh about 235 lbs. During this time I settled on that I wanted to go to college and become a software engineer.  I found out that FASFA would only loan me $300 a semester, due to my college being an accelerated program that goes through the summer. Also my parents were making $210,000 with combined incomes. This made it so I had to continue working 40 hours a week. I was putting about $1000 a month for my college leaving me with only about $145 a month to spend freely without dipping into robinhood stocks for security. I learned how to budget well because of this. Eventually  I was angered when the manager that I had for scheduling me for Christmas eve, Christmas, and new years, and my birthday. These were days that I specifically asked off. I ended up quitting my job due to conflicts. I got my tax return back, and two stimulus checks, because I didn't get them right away. I ended up with about $6,000 in my bank account to live freely with. At this time I broke up with my EX after I caught her cheating and my grades started to slip, along with my motivation. I still managed to pass my classes with a C average between the 2 semesters. I had no idea how to pay for college so I decided to join the National Guard when the recruiter bugged me about it. I didn't know how I was going to About 3 months later I found my current girlfriend, but she lives 300 miles away in another state. I am now planning to move away from my family, because they disagree with every decision that I make. I leave for basic training in a few days, but I dont know If I want to go anymore because I felt like I was pushed, and I know that it will be hard to work with if I do a lot of overtime being that I need to drill a weekend out of every month while working. They have already postponed 4 months of college and I want to get on with my life. I am going for 25Q which is a job for hardware engineering. This will give me some college credit in hardware engineering. However I dont know if I want to post pone another 6 months of college to do this.

Finances:

I started with an initial $16,000 investment At this time I have $17,800 in my portfolio. Most of it is invested in a REIT and then a startup company that just successfully passed its SPAC. They are finishing the final touches right now. This money I do not need, but I don't live at myself . It went up to about $57,000 but then crashed as the merger was announced for some stupid reason. I am not very educated about SPACS but I love the merging companies business ideas and their overall goal. The company that I am invested in is CCIV or otherwise merging to be Lucid Motors. 

Other subjects:

I want to finish college and find a job to become a software engineer and hopefully make $70,000 after my first year. I dont know much about coding yet. I have a little experience with python, but not enough to know how to create a good big project. 

I want to move to North Dakota, because there is more job opportunity than where I am located, also because my girlfriends family is way sweeter and more supporting than mine. I eventually hope to marry her and become very well bonded with her and her family. 

I want to be happy in life and not stress out but my parents think the only way to be happy is working 75 hours a week and spend the rest of your money at the casino. (probably why they dont support the decision of me going to college) they have actually almost kicked me out for wanting to go to college, even though I gained 45 credits through PSEO. They went gambling instead of going to scholarship night with me, so I didn't get any scholarships. 

I am hoping to start an internship as soon as I learn some coding skills during my next year of schooling, that way I have job experience and can afford rent in another state."
njgaxt,6,2021-05-23,High school student looking for advice,KataraDark,DevelEire,https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/njgaxt/high_school_student_looking_for_advice/,"So, I’m approaching the point when I’m going to have to start applying to universities, and I’m really scared of making the wrong decision. Ireland seems like a great country, and my goal is to work there after university, but the problem is that I don’t know where to study. Essentially, I’m torn between UCD and a university in my home city in Poland. At least on paper, UCD seems awesome—but it would be really expensive for me to go there (the uni in Poland would be around 5 times cheaper).

I’m just wondering how going to one or the other uni would impact my chances of getting a job in Ireland straight out of uni (and/or an internship during the summer before I graduate). And then there’s the issue of time: in Poland, I wouldn’t have to work part-time, so I could definitely work on some smaller projects to build a portfolio, while I’m not sure if I’d be able to do that in Dublin. But the Polish uni doesn’t have an internship built into the programme, so I’d have to find that myself.

Do you think a portfolio might be worth more to potential employers? Or would it be worth it to go to UCD?

And how important is the ranking of the uni? My family lives in the US now and here rankings seem very important—and some members of my family really want me to go to some top uni. (It doesn’t help that I really don’t like living in the US, so I’m not even looking at any colleges here, just in Europe.) I’m not against doing that, because I like challenges, but I’m struggling to decide if UCD would be worth the money and effort.

I’m also a bit scared of having to study and to work part-time, I guess, because this year I took lots of challenging classes and would often spend 10-12 hours per day at school (well, on Zoom)/doing homework—and still would have stuff left for the weekend. Does anybody have experience with working while doing a CS degree? Is that doable? And is it worth it if there’s an alternative?"

I knew this person for 3 months in a casual manner before she miraculously got pregnant right before I moved out of state (to Florida). Highly likely she lied about having an IUD. She also put my through the ringer before I left with threats of blackmail, withholding the child from me unless I married her, amongst other things. Haven’t signed brith certificate or had paternity established yet as well. She threatened me with child support if I got a test done back when she was pregnant. She also has three other children from another father. Anyways, I never wanted a child but as a man I have no say in the matter. I’ve come to terms with it all and recently introduced her and him to my family for his birthday. We’ve been on good terms up until now. During that event, I casually mentioned I had a new girlfriend. After the visit, she ignores me for a week and then texts me saying she now wants child support. I only pay $200 a month to her because that is literally all I can afford after all my bills are paid. I live literally paycheck to paycheck. I do not go out and I do not spend on anything but living expenses. Clearly she is being vindictive and petty over something so childish and now I am worried for my financial future. I have a $1300 mortgage, a $1400 private student loan payment, about $250 (minimum payments) in credit cards, a $400 personal loan (used to pay off my credit cards), $360 car payment, not including $100 insurance, variable gas expenses, basic utilities, and groceries. I make $50,000 and at the end of the month I have about $100 disposable income and have been living on a negative  overdrafted balance to pay her. I cannot cut anything more as I am spread out as thin as I can be. She also has a trust fund of $3000, interns at her father’s law office, and pays little to no bills as her father bought her a condo. She claims to be struggling but I know for a fact she does not. Even had the gall to tell me she was getting cosmetic surgery done soon.

How is child support calculated and do my expenses factor into it at all or should I basically just be prepared to declare bankruptcy?

TLDR: Mother wants to put me on child support because I am in a new relationship. I can barely support myself as is and she makes more than I do. What do I do?"

I'm writing this post in an attempt to understand more of the job search for Software Engineers post graduation/ in the field. I'm a first gen grad and not completely understanding what it all takes to an acceptable candidate when applying for SWE jobs. 

I graduated with a 3.65 gpa and had done a few side projects along with an internship and 2 semesters of undergraduate teaching experience while in my undergrad but have yet to land an offer since I started putting apps out since Feb. I did undergo a few resume rewrites and some other experience building stuff so its quite a bit different since I started applying in Feb.

I usually do a lot of the LinkedIn Easy applies but I also do the more in-depth ones as well. So I don't know if that could be where I'm faulting as there will eventually be 100s of applicants with those postings.

I've also noticed that I might not seem like a good candidate based on how I present myself, I'm quite the introvert and I might come off as not passionate about being a Software engineer and maybe that's the one of the things I need to work on along with basic oop questions and answers and behavioral SAR responses

At this point, its been 3 weeks post graduation and not much farther in my career when I graduated. Along with the title of How difficult is it to get position after getting the degree. I also would like to know what are some tips for someone like me that is still working on their interview skills and trying to get into industry.

I had the wonderful experience of being able to do a DevOps role even if it was a minor one.  It's funny how this all came to be because going down this road wasn't easy and a bit odd.  I don't have much extensive coding experience like a full time software engineer/developer does and my experience is very mixed.  I have a background as a Test Technician, Tech Writer, IT technician, Research Engineering Intern, and then finally DevOps (woohoo!).  However, as of recent, I actually was laid off due to COVID so now I'm currently in the market.  In terms of programming, I'm actually very very rusty.  I have this tendency where I practice a lot of coding and then at some points in time, I don't practice enough which I then forget after some time has passed.  Are there any specific questions that I should be looking at in terms of coding or should I just chug and plug away at programming questions from Hacker Rank, Leet Code, etc to improve my coding.  I find that trying to answer as many coding questions as possible seems a bit exhaustive considering that DevOps don't code as much as Software Developers and Engineers.  What are your guy's experience like?  Any additional tips are always welcome.

One of the person (fellow participant) made a comment which was ""You look so old that's why you have so many experience"" I was hurt by the comment but didn't want to rage at someone in a big event. Later I decided to have a conversation with the coordinator of the event about this issue but she didn't take the issue seriously and said he might have tried to compliment you but it came in a wrong way. 

I contacted a student advisor who felt like this is a serious issue and needs to be brought into attention. He wanted me to get in contact with the legal team of our university to get an idea about the issue but the legal team said they can only help me in filing a complaint and I have to explain what kind of actions needs to be taken.

I’m a quick learner when it comes to having learned html and css through online courses: built my first website on my own within my first week of learning any programming.

njqauh,26,2021-05-24,[A-Level] Applying to US colleges for undergrad,shefriendzonedme,Nepal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/njqauh/alevel_applying_to_us_colleges_for_undergrad/,"So, as the title suggests, I’ve compiled information to guide those interested in applying to the US, after their A-Level.

Firstly, lets get the dates right on when you intend to apply.

If you wish to go for Fall of 2022, the you got to apply after 1st Aug of 2021, and before Dec, or Jan, depending on the college.

Also, make sure that you’ve gotten your SAT or your ACT scores ready beforehand.  Most colleges treat both SAT and ACT equally, but it depends upon you where you perform greater.

The ACT checks knowledge on: Reading &amp; Writing, Science, and Math with an optional Essay component. SAT on the other hand comprises of all as ACT does, minus the Science portion. Also, you’re allowed to use a calculator on all portions of Math in the ACT, but that’s not the case in SAT. The ACT has a full score of 36, meanwhile it is 1600 for the new SAT (aka post-2016 SAT).

For simplicity, and the sake of popularity in Nepal, we’re just going to talk regarding the SAT here.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**So, what SAT scores do you need to get into colleges?**

I’ve compiled the SAT scores, certain schools want, and here they are:

* Harvard:

 ⠀  ⠀ R&amp;W: 720-780

 ⠀  ⠀ Math: 740-800

 ⠀  ⠀  ⠀  ⠀ Total: 1460-1580

* MIT:

 ⠀  ⠀ R&amp;W: 720-770

 ⠀  ⠀ Math: 780-800

 ⠀  ⠀  ⠀  ⠀ Total: 1500-1570

* NYU:

 ⠀  ⠀ R&amp;W: 650-720

 ⠀  ⠀ Math: 660-790

 ⠀  ⠀  ⠀  ⠀ Total: 1310-1510

* TAMU:

 ⠀  ⠀ R&amp;W: 580-680

 ⠀  ⠀ Math: 590-700

 ⠀  ⠀  ⠀  ⠀ Total: 1170-1380

&amp;#x200B;

From, those data, you could infer that to get into those schools, you have to score at least greater than the average kid scored.

So, the average Harvard kid scored (1460+1580)/2=1520

The average MIT kid scored (1500+1570)/2=1535

And for NYU and TAMU, the average kid got 1410 and 1275. (If you don’t trust my calculation, do the math yourself)

So, what we now know is that to get into Harvard you have to have at least greater that 1520, for MIT 1535, for NYU 1410 and 1275 for TAMU.

But, don’t come and shouting in my DMs saying you still didn’t get to those schools.

&amp;#x200B;

**There are a lot more factors that influence.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**1) Your high school grades**

According to CAIE, here’s how A-level scores tally to their US counterpart.

Then, if you wish to know your US equivalent, then here’s how it goes:

|A (&amp; AS) level|US Grade Point (AP)|
|:-|:-|
|A\*|5.0|
|A/(a)|5.0|
|B/(b)|4.0|
|C/(c)|4.0|
|D/(d)|3.0|
|E/(e)|3.0|
|Ungraded|1.0-2.0|

For instance, if you have done 4 A-levels and one AS-level, scoring: A\*AA\*Aa

Then your US GPA would be 5.0. Which is the highest you could score.

It is believed that having a GPA greater than 4.5 is outstanding if you’re applying to colleges.

Certain careers require high GPAs at the high school level because of how competitive they are. For example, *anesthesiologists should have a high GPA in high school to stand out when it’s time to apply for college and med-school.*

&amp;#x200B;

**2) Your personal essay**

The essay is your opportunity to shine! It’s the one place where you can differentiate yourself from others who have similar grades and SAT scores and make your application memorable in the eyes of the admissions committee. Even if a school does not require an essay, submit one anyway to make yourself stand out even more. When you write the essay, it’s important to be true to who you are, not who you think the admissions officers want you to be. I recommend brainstorming ideas in the summer and then going through several drafts before you submit your final essay with your application. You can and should ask others to read your drafts and assist with edits, but by no means should anyone else (like your parents) write your essay for you. Also, the essay is quite confidential.

&amp;#x200B;

**3) Extra-curriculars**

Top-tier schools get thousands of academically qualified applicants. Extracurriculars are essential if you’re applying to these colleges, not only because they demonstrate your interests, but also because they give your application personality. This will help you stand out among the many other candidates who have great grades and test scores. Like, saying you’re bilingual or even trilingual will make you CV prettier, than just speaking a single tongue.

In fact, at the top 250 schools, your extracurricular profile makes up 30% of the weight of your application, which is more than any other component (**test scores, 15%; grades and coursework, 20%; extracurricular profile, 30%; essays, 25%; recommendations, 10%**).

Also, you could choose to do extra-curriculars which suit your career path, if you’re an aspiring engineer you could get an internship at engineering firms, or if you desire to go to medicine or the biological sciences, you could get some hands-on experience at pharmaceutical companies, biological laboratories, or hospitals.

&amp;#x200B;

**4) Do the right coursework for your stream.**

Many of you know this, but well, if you desire to go to pre-med, you could do Chemistry, Biology, etc.  at A level

For law, you could take something related, like History, Law, Sociology

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**What about other standardized tests?**

Okay, so here’s good news, if you’re doing AS or an A level in English Language, English Literature or English Language and Literature, most colleges will exempt you from needing to do a TOEFL, but it’s not always sure for English General Paper though. Also, if you’re from an Anglophone nation, there’s no need in that case too.

In case of SAT subject tests (aka SAT II), most universities will consider them equal to your A-level, so for instance if you’ve done an A-level in Biology, you don’t have to give a SAT II for Biology.

As a sidenote, AS level in any Cambridge AS level English subjects in equivalent to 12th grade English in India and in turn in Nepal.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So well, you can’t exactly say what’s of greater importance, but because of the fact like the grade points of A\* and A are same, and B and C, you could say that, what you have to put more effort into are your SATs and the essay (don’t ignore the essay), you have to put effort into your grades too, but just a little bit more into your ECA, SAT and Essay combined.

Somewhat like this:

Effort for grades = Effort for SAT &amp; Essay

Effort for grades &lt; Effort for SAT, ECA, Essay combined"

I bet even a staff engineer at a Big N company who passed their interview with flying colors and got hired could have some part of their interview process that could have went just a bit better.

njum05,17,2021-05-24,[Uni] No interview offers/news from SMU business,Prior_Pressure9695,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/njum05/uni_no_interview_offersnews_from_smu_business/,"as the title suggests... i still have yet to hear from SMU biz ever since i applied for it back in february. no news as in not even an interview offer sigh.... i've talked to many redditors who are on the same boat as me and we are honestly just so dejected from the long wait. 

my burning question is: 

1. is it possible to still receive interview offers after the first window (after 24 may onwards?) 

2. if we don't receive any interview offers, is it possible to get a direct offer? (i doubt...) 

3. and to the seniors: does this long wait even after the first window means we will 100% be rejected? 

i mean... i am aware that SMU has sent rejection letters to their applicants a few weeks ago. do they send them randomly/in batches? or do they mass reject? HAHAHA. im so sorry i have so many questions i literally couldnt sleep last night. like not even kidding i couldnt even keep my eyes shut for 10mins... 

also what's even more depressing is i am already rejected by both NTU and NUS lmao. no interview opportunity either altho i applied via ABA :/ so that's why im super paranoid now. im also on waitlist for SUSS accountancy. 

for more context:
i'm from JC with 65.75RP and quite a strong portfolio - was in a sports cca in both secondary and jc, represented sg in international competitions and took part in national school games too (i won multiple medals too hehe!). i alse held vice-pres role in a society in jc. initiated a non-profit business to donate all profits to various humanitarian charities. did intern at a media marketing company and currently interning in one of the big 4 accounting firms as well. 

i was kinda sad as i thought i would at least get an interview offer from NTU/SMU. ive already appealed into NTU but i dont really bother about NUS AHHAHAHA. my backup plan now is to go for SIM-UOL if i'm rejected by all unis :"")

to those on the same boat: i hope we all get some closure (be it rejection letter, interview offers or direct hahahaha)! we keep our faith up &lt;3

to those who have received an offer, CONGRATS IM SO PROUD OF YOU HEHEHE &lt;3"

I'm in 3rd year of uni in computer science engineering, and my gpa is gradually improving, but as far as coding and practical knowledge is concerned, I'm lacking and far behind in comparison to an average engineering student. I lazed through the first 2 years of college, and then the covid quarantine started, which only made me more lethargic. Then from the end of 2020, my college provided us with internship opportunities where I had to take technical entrance tests. After taking a couple of them, I was crushed by how little I know. At this point I realized I really need to get good at programming, especially make up for the years I wasted. I do not want to turn back on the career option I chose even though my interest has waned over the years, and I'm willing to work hard to at least reach the average level of programming. I know without interest, there is no future for me, but I hope to acquire some interest as I try learning.

The issue for me is that I have no idea how to start. I am familiar with the basics of programming, but there are still gaps in my knowledge; there are concepts I am not familiar with, and I don't know how to learn them. Besides these concepts, I don't know what the best way to practice coding is. Most of my friends and teachers don't give a very satisfactory response, and some of them tell me to practice on sites like hackerrank and leetcode. I have tried those recently, but in the cases where I have no idea how to answer the questions, I have no way of learning what and how I should do them. There are fields I still need to get familiar in, like data structures and some important algorithms, but other than those, I am not aware of what I'm missing. Which is why I ask you all, is there any way to simplify my rehab into coding? Can anyone tell me the right way to learn? Is there a simple and easy to understand strategy I can follow and improve through, like Corey Schafer's python guide? Something that covers very essential coding topics and carve my coding skills? Sorry if this comes off as a low effort rant, but I just feel broken after seeing how worthless I am from the internship tests. I really, really want to improve and get better. Thanks for reading, and giving your suggestions."

I've decided to share with you my absolute dreadful internship searching experience. To start it all off, I am a senior student studying Civil ENG. It is required by our University to intern/co-op at one or two companies(if you're lucky) to gain some much-needed experience. Although I believe it's only for job learning reasons, not so much the experience. Mine happens to be for this summer and I begin searching earlier this year in the midst of my studies. An excellent company presents itself called AECOM. Top-notch and much to gain. The requirements for the internship are simply to be in the senior year of your studies. I think to myself how incredible! a company that wants to help the undergrads. So I apply to only get rejected before even reaching the phone interview stage without any feedback as to why that is. So I second-guessed everything I applied with. Was it my GPA (3.41)? Was it my lack of practical/ previous internship experience?  That wrecked me a lot because I put so much hope into it. Once that sadness drifted away in a week. I put my hope into our training department at our University. Through them, I managed to also get into contact with another top-notch company called Stantec, which comes back also dry by April, and now here I am. I missed the deadline to find a company and will also as a result delay my graduation to later next year. I know that it's a bit common to hear about the cliche that all hope is lost and we have no chance. But picture yourself in my shoes. Struggling with social anxiety, and have absolutely no connections in the industry as a result. Most of my colleagues scored internships thanks to their connections or at least social skills. For me It almost adds a new meaning to no chance. At this rate, all I can think about is what will I do? A few of my teachers who I opened up to, told me that they are worried about me and about what will I do in my future? And I am worried. I don't have a driving License either to add to my dismay and hopelessness.  Should someone like me look forward to a future in Engineering or should I pack my bags to another route that's a bit forgiving or tolerant to my being? 

TL;DR 

Social anxiety + tough market unforgiving(rejections left and right). Missed University training deadline which delays graduation. Hopeless and lost as to what to do."

I'm a relatively new CS student from Brazil (started to take it seriously by mid 2019) and I'd like some advice from y'all.

From these 2 years of experience, I've noticed some things about what I enjoy doing and what I try to avoid.

* At college, the practical software development classes have been focused on C. I actually quite like to write procedural code in C. It makes sense to me and I think it has been of great help understanding dynamic memory allocation and ADTs. However, at the company I'm doing my internship, they develop using JS and Ruby (React and RoR as frameworks) and I'm finding some difficulty in understanding OOP concepts.
   * 1. How should I approach these 2 different paradigms ""at the same time""? Or does it really matter what paradigm it is? Should be focusing on something else?
* When it comes to theoretical/math classes: I consider myself a curiosity-driven person, and the theoretical concepts of CS (mainly Discrete Maths related topics) were not really what drew me into programming and computing in general and I'm finding some difficulty in grasping these concepts while handling the other classes.
   * 2. I'm not looking for ""tips and tricks"", as I don't believe in that. I'm kind of trying to figure out  a way to get a better method and conduct to dedicate myself to these topics. Can anyone help me with this?
* Now, this has been my biggest fear. I've really struggled to harmonize all these different topics (theory, practice, maths...)  and make them work together throughout my learning process. It's been really difficult to focus on one thing without jeopardizing other(s).
   * 3. How do you keep up with all of this without losing ""control"" and whilst keeping up with new technologies and areas to explore?

Thank you for taking the time!"

Before that, I completed a non-finance internship at a different Fortune20, a VC internship, and a few lower tier corporate finance internships. I am studying finance and I have a 3.7 GPA from a decent but non target western university. I will start my senior year in September.

While I like the company I am interning with, for various reasons I need to land in NYC immediately following graduation. I feel like I’ve done internship recruiting enough that I know how it works, but I don’t know anything about full time recruiting and I generally haven’t limited myself to such a narrow geography in the past.

Does anyone have advice on how I can land a full time offer in NYC for postgrad? I am interested in corporate finance, commercial banking, strategy, ESG finance, and really anything that would let me directly apply my degree and/or internship experience. 

When/how does full time recruiting usually take place? Should I try to land an internship postgrad and use that to get a full time offer or is it possible to skip the internship track? 

I have a few connections at a couple BB’s but no one that could just give me a job or anything. Ideally I would like to end up at a financial institution like a bank or investment firm."

My first full-time gig post-graduation (2018 Grad, Marketing) was in recruitment. I was promoted and did fairly well, but resigned this past February. Since then, I've continued to run a small company of my own on the side, and I'm working full-time in sales for a small software company in my hometown that my Father owns/started.

I guess, I just don't know if I enjoy sales. I don't think I enjoy ""making conversation"" on a proactive front... if that makes sense. It's a lot of reach-out, a lot of following up with no response, people that don't want to talk to you because they have this preconceived belief of salespeople being ""stingy"" (thanks, salespeople that actually are stingy)... etc...

In a way, I just don't really know what I want to do. I have interests, for sure. I'm good with people/relationships. I can make (marketing material) attractive. I have a minor case of OCD which makes me a bit of a perfectionist.

A part of me wonders if I don't want a desk job. Maybe I want something else... I am not sure. I've never tried anything else. I had sales internships throughout college and even continued to do sales post-college. It's like my entire life has been sales, and while I've been good at it, I'm having a hard time identifying where else these skillsets can go, if not another desk job. I make decent money now, but a part of me just has anxiety going into work every day knowing what I'm about to get myself into.

Any direction/point in the right direction would be greatly appreciated!

Edit: or maybe it's just a lack of inspo. One thing I do know about myself is that reading can get me motivated, especially when it's something new. Maybe I just start reading about sales tactics/business development as a whole, or ways to grow my side business and go from there. From all the reading I've done on this sub and others around career advice, the general consensus is that regardless of what you do, you have to do *something*."

Here is the sixty-fifth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

Actually trapped... this program promises reimbursement of tuition at the end of my PhD, and since I’ve already taken out another loan while in this job, I would have to eat it if I quit. I started during COVID, so I have no coworkers other than my intense supervisor. I feel alone, lost, and completely overwhelmed. 

I have a Masters in mathematics and I’m now working on a PhD in Computational Science. School was easy (relative to what I’m doing now), but I also went to a university that isn’t very impressive on a resume. My advisor was SUPER chill, and a pretty big hand-holder. He is also the professor of most classes I’ve taken in my field. He’s still my advisor now, but this job at the lab has become the majority of my focus, so we don’t communicate as much anymore. My supervisor at the lab is the complete opposite of my academic advisor. No jokes, no positive feedback, no negative feedback. Just a super serious Russian that makes me want to cry after every one of our weekly (virtual) meetings. 

I don’t want to blame it on imposter syndrome.. I want to hold myself accountable.. but I literally feel too stupid and inadequate for this job. I’m living in constant fear of being fired or let go just because I’m not moving quickly enough or coming to conclusions as soon as I feel like my supervisor would like. And honestly, I’ve gotten to the point where I wish they would just fire me. Unfortunately (or fortunately), I’ve heard it’s pretty hard to get fired from a government scientist position just from inadequacy. 

Going from being a 3.8 GPA student who stayed extremely busy with jobs, clubs, and sports to being stuck in my apartment in a new city with no friends and a job I absolutely despise, my mental health has taken a toll. I truly don’t know what to do. Suck it up and get through this next 1.5 years just so they pay for my school and then leave, or eat my PhD loan and perhaps find something I actually enjoy? My boyfriend says it would be irrational to leave, and I get that. I don’t think he realizes just how unhappy I am. I’ve always been good at everything I’ve done, but with this I feel like they hired me thinking I knew OpenFOAM and CFD modeling already. I thought this was going to be a learning experience, and it is... but the only thing I’m learning from is YouTube. 

Anyways, this has become quite a rant. I just wanted to hear from others that may have had the same experience. If anyone can give me some light at the end of the tunnel, it would be immensely appreciated."

I thought Google would leverage me into a nice programming job, but in the past few weeks I've been applying I've had terrible luck.

nk33ne,33,2021-05-24,A Bad Internship Experience,JustAnotherPenmonkey,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/nk33ne/a_bad_internship_experience/,"They won’t be happy that I’m telling you this.

I’ve been working as an intern for the Gold Lightning Agency for just under a month now. They dropped an ad round my house and I thought ‘sure, why not?’. I probably should’ve worried more about the vagueness of it and the little details that just didn’t fit together, but my excitement drowned out any doubts. I wanted to make a difference.

The Agency’s primary function is to suppress knowledge of the supernatural, so I’d expected to be battling monsters or saving innocents, but the hero work was reserved for higher ranks. Instead, I was assigned the noble role of copying and filing.

The office I worked in was a communal space, shared by thirty or so other interns. Unlike the sleek, high-tech look of the rest of the building, it was very outdated. Without windows or conditioning, the air grew into a thick, cloying soup of dust and sweat -- more like an animal pen than an office. The desks had been arranged in a semi-circle, covered in years of graffiti. Posters plastered the walls, warning of the dangers of curiosity. The computers took so long to start up that some people fell asleep before the screen stuttered into life. They weren’t connected to the internet. Looking back, I’m sure if our work was saved, or if it was just to keep us busy.

Though we didn’t talk often, there was an unspoken camaraderie between the interns. We all shared one dream that kept us typing in that sweltering, suffocating room. You see, when we joined, we were all promised something at the end of the internship -- a meeting with the Agency’s Benefactors.

We all assumed that the meeting was a job interview, a chance to join the Agency properly. A chance to rise higher. They must’ve had a good acceptance rate, too, because nobody ever returned to the interns’ office afterwards.

I’d like to say that I managed to put the pieces together and work out what was going on myself, but it was jealousy that lead to my revelation, I’d been sure that I would be the next to be given a meeting, but instead, a woman who’d barely been working there a week -- Susie, I think her name was -- got the call. I was outraged. I was a better worker than her -- by all accounts, I should’ve been at the front of the queue. So I decided to follow her to see what the meetings are all about, and why I wasn’t being invited.

Nobody paid me much attention. In fact, they seemed to be avoiding my and Susie’s gaze. She walked a few paces ahead of me, her footsteps echoing off the whitewashed walls of the corridor, too wrapped up in her own thoughts to notice me. She held a map up, tracing the route with her finger. Disdain twisted in her gut. I’d memorised the route. I could’ve walked it with my eyes closed.

After about two minutes, she arrived at the meeting room. After taking a deep breath, she opened the door, and stepped in.

I managed to catch the door before it snapped shut. Standing in a way that meant nobody inside would be able to easily see me, I peered through the slither of a gap into the room beyond.

It didn’t look like the sort of place you’d use for job interviews. A single metal chair stood in the centre, bolted to the floor. Underneath it was a drain. Concrete walls enclosed it on three sides. On the wall facing the chair, there was a mirror.

Susie hesitated for a moment, but eventually she took a seat.

It was then that I felt it: a kind of nausea in the mind, like acid was building up behind my eyes. My vision swam.

Something in the mirror moved. Behind Susie’s frozen reflection, two silver eyes appeared. A hand reached up to press against the glass, which cracked, then shattered. Something began to crawl out.

The creature unfolded itself like some kind of grotesque origami piece. Pale, sinewy limbs stretched out. Spidery spines clicked into place. It smiled, showing needle-like teeth. Susie didn’t move. She watched it with wonder in her eyes, as though daydreaming. Then, the creature turned to the door.

Pain spread through me like ice. I cried out. A voice whispered in the back of my mind.

_Couldn’t wait your turn, little lamb?_

I knew then what we were brought here for. Not workers, but sacrifices. Before the door closed, I heard the wet snap of a bone breaking. It didn’t follow me. It had more immediate prey.

They’ll find me, eventually. The Agency doesn’t take kindly to defactors. Maybe, if I put up enough of a fight, they’ll be forced to deal with me then and there rather than taking me back to that room. If I hadn’t written this, I might’ve been insignificant enough for them to leave me alone. But people need to know. If the Agency offers you an internship, get away before you end up like Susie, like me. They tell you when you join that ‘All great victories require sacrifice’. They just don’t mention that you’ll be filling that role."

I have undergone 2 brain surgeries and have to live with a humongous scar that goes from one ear to the other on the top of my head. I have been made fun of and have been called names for countless years. 

I am now 21 and these past few months have just been brutal for me. To start things off I got COVID back in late March due to my dumbass roommate just not giving a crap and giving it to all my roommates including myself. I was sick for around 4 weeks and finally got over it. I have had to live with partial permanent blindness in both of my eyes and as of 3 weeks ago I started to develop a lazy eye in my left eye. It happens when ever I focus on something and reading a book is impossible unless I close my left eye. I almost had a brain tumor scare as well because my doctor thought the lazy eye was due to my tumor growing and was opting for me to undergo surgery again and chemotherapy. Recently as well my cat who I have lived with my entire life since 2007 died this past Tuesday back at home. I literally balled my eyes out and was sad because I wasn’t there for him since I’m living by myself at an apartment somewhere else for an internship.  

I don’t know what else is going to happen to me. I always think and wonder about what my life could have been like if I had never developed an inoperable brain tumor. I just don’t understand why all these bad things are happening to me.  This lazy eye is really debilitating and I’m afraid I’ll never be able to get a girlfriend and or decent job because of it. I know eventually my tumor will kill me but I don’t know how to put that behind me or just forget about it. I always sleep too because I know I’m depressed and the brain tumor fatigue just gets to me. Im completing a programming internship and staring at the screen all day just makes my eye go lazy and I can feel it everyday getting worse and worse. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I just want something good and happy to happen to me in my life right now."

I had almost given up hope on getting into a grad school with this profile even though I was yet to hear from USC. Was resolved to take GRE again to try and bump up scores, write a Research paper on one of my ML projects, with an intern currently ongoing. But what can I say, I got into USC after an almost 8 month suspense. Yep I am happy that I got into USC even though it’s for spring, given the chaos and consulates being closed in India, also needed alot of time to get the financial docs ready.

Now I did a lotttt of research online to see which of the languages is harder to learn and I think Mandarin is a bit more difficult for me than Japanese.(Btw I currently don’t really have a problem with the difficulty of a language, but I might have in the future). I also read that Mandarin is more useful when it comes to business. But then on the other hand my interest for Japanese is a little bigger, but then on the other hand again I can grow my interest for Chinese in the future.

Now my problem is, I can’t decide which one I want to study and which one I want to learn in my free time and it’s really taking a toll on me.

I also want to note that in the 3rd or 4th year of my study I’ll eventually go to the country that I study to do an internship. I think I have about less than a week, they didn’t even gave me an exact date but I assume about a week, to choose a language. A close friend of mine is also going to do the same study and she already chose Mandarin so that also gives me a little motivation to choose that.

Anyone can help??/ Have some advice??

nk8aum,0,2021-05-24,My grad school provided inadequate training and I failed my oral exams. Am I responsible for paying for remediation?,legalgrad,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/nk8aum/my_grad_school_provided_inadequate_training_and_i/,"Hi r/legaladvice. I'll try to keep this as simple as possible. I'm in a doctoral program for clinical psychology in Pennsylvania. I recently failed my final clinical oral exams and am being told I need to pay for a semester of remediation in order to retake my exam. I don't feel like I should be obligated to pay for this for the following reasons:

\- My internship placement, assigned by my university, did not provide adequate training according to guidelines put in place by the American Psychological Association. Interns are required to receive 2 hours of supervision per week to go over their clinical work. I was never given work that required supervision (they used us as cheap labor) and so supervision was never provided. I brought this to my internship director's attention and was told that some sites are not as good as others and that I should take what I can from the experience. I want to say I had 2, maybe 3 discussions about this before finally threatening to leave my placement due to no training and being overworked (my hours were extremely long but only included routine duties). At this point, my school finally did step in and determined the site was not fulfilling their obligations. They were instructed to begin providing adequate training, though this was now nearly 9 months into my placement. I was diagnosed with cancer one week before these changes were to be made and left my placement.

\- Because I was not receiving training at my internship, I was unable to keep up in class case conferences that reflected work we should be encountering in the field. I brought this up to my professor, stating specifically that I was unable to keep up in class because of the lack of training at my site, and he told me that my site was well known for providing poor training but that I would ""eventually"" catch up. I was the only person in my cohort who was receiving absolutely no clinical training and it was well known that I was unable to contribute to class discussions for this reason.

\- One year after leaving my placement (took a partial medical leave to handle the cancer), I started my second internship at a large hospital. During this time, I struggled tremendously as I had no prior clinical training, and my supervisor worked diligently with me to get me up to speed. Most people entering this placement had a year's worth of experience and I had almost none, so my evaluations regularly referred to me as ""emerging,"" or unable to work without supervision. My supervisor regularly commented on how unethical it was of my university to allow my prior internship to train me so poorly.

Throughout all of this, I met several times with my internship director to express that I was struggling. I stressed my difficulty keeping up, understanding my obligations (final clinical oral exam) given I no longer had a cohort to move through these hurdles with, and general lack of understanding about how to move through the program. I asked for additional support on numerous occasions but there was always a reason they couldn't help me just yet. I also stated my incredible ambivalence about attempting my oral exams given I had no idea where to start or what was expected. I was encouraged to move forward and to use my prior experience in class case conferences, though these were not reflective of the exam format. I need the remediation. I want the remediation. But as far as I'm concerned, I've been asking for additional support for years and the school has not provided this to me. I also feel the school failed in their obligation to ensure adequate training that meets APA guidelines, guidelines they are required to uphold. I feel that while the school did not initially step in, their eventual decision to do a site review and enforce changes as a direct result of my complaints is an acknowledgement of the inadequate training I received. Notably, these changes were only going to be implemented at the 9 month mark of my 12 month placement. While I had to leave prematurely, the APA only required my placement last for 9 months, so I technically completed the necessary hours.

Well that was a lot. So here's my question. Do I have a leg to stand on if I were to request the school pay for my remediation credits? I've already had a follow-up discussion regarding my exam failure and they acknowledged that my training was not ideal (though they have never directly stated it didn't meet regulations). I don't care if it takes me longer to finish school or if I need to take online classes. I want to be competent and I want to feel good about passing. I just don't want to pay thousands of dollars for training I already paid for."

Which is annoying because I don’t even want to major in that.

I have a Software Engineering Internship lined up at a big name company. Had a SWE internship at a startup last year and a CS-related one a year before that.

I will be taking CS classes throughout the next two years regardless of whether it is required or not for Data Science.

How screwed am I as an incoming junior? Career-wise I’d want to work at a FAANG/Unicorn and will not having a “CS” degree keep me out from interviews at these companies?

Background: I graduated from UTD last May 2020, majoring in ITS, when the pandemic hit and everyone struggled to find jobs. I graduated without any internship under my belt, yet I was lucky enough to secure a relevant position in a company that operates within the IT field. I have been working full-time for almost a year now, but I feel that my impact has been minimal. A lot of people in my team have a Ph.D. in Data Science, and most of them have a graduate degree. I'm grateful that I have a job now, but, from my observation, in order to advance in this field, a graduate degree is needed. I quite like my Analyst position, but would love to move into Data Science/ Data Engineer roles

MS BA program is now waiving GRE/GMAT as well as application fees for Fall 2021. So I think this is a great time to apply and be back on campus as we're starting to open again. Looking at the potential earnings after graduation, it is around 100k avg, which is very promising. 

On the other hand, I have to take in another 30k ish of student loan, and I haven't even paid back my current loan yet.  Anyone graduated with MS BA, how's your experience during and after college? Is the degree worth it, or should I just take another education route e.g. getting certifications(Google Data Engineering, AWS, etc... )"

Back then everything we had was rudimentary by modern standards. And one thing we had was a primitive version of email designed for purely internal communication. I was in front line user support and I was called to the office of a VP level user one day. 

She was concerned about the email. 

We had a text based mainframe driven email system that we loving called “Blue Mail” mostly because it had a simple text and cursor based GUI that was blue. We had just upgraded her to Windows 95 and along with it came a new sleek actual GUI based email client (Banyan BeyondMail 3.0 for the nerds) but even though it used the same messaging system the VP was very change resistant. 

So she called for help. 

Now everyone at the user help desk knew this VP was actually a PITA so they kept bumping the ticket until the snot nosed 19 year old college intern got the ticket. So up I went. When I got there she claimed that someone had sent her an email and she couldn’t find it in the new client. (Remember that, when people followed up emails with calls saying “I sent you an email”) So she dropped into blue mail, and there it was. 

I tried explaining that our network was fragile and so we used a 10 minute cycle to avoid network issues and she looked at me like I was speaking in tongues. I tried explaining that blue mail was a live client and was actually hosted on another system (mainframe) and it only delivered email on the cycle. Now I was speaking in tongues encoded in base64. 

So I said you need to wait about 10 minutes for emails to arrive. She was very unhappy. And concerned that her emails were going to go missing. So she asked me to set her up with a printer and I obliged and she then wasted months of the governments time and money printing emails out in paper so she “wouldn’t lose them”.

She took a buyout about 8 months later when people figured out that she was useless. I was among the people that cleaned out her office as reclaiming computer equipment was a shit job and guess who gets those. We found almost 20 bankers boxes filled with printed emails. None of it was worth keeping. She easily made in the high 100k range. And she spent all this time doing this to look busy so she could get 6 months pay to walk away. She probably ended up getting a high paying consulting gig after while I was making 8 bucks an hour."

I would very much prefer an in person internship, and it doesn’t need to be in my area, but I would be open to remote.

I know I waited too long and it is a longshot to find an opportunity with the world right now, but I figured it is worth trying. I am going to continue emailing universities near me (Ohio state university, university of Akron, university of Toledo, etc.) but I am not optimistic about replies. Thanks"

I won’t be eligible to apply as a new grad anymore and I do not have any experience outside school and some internships back in 2017.

Career options?,hungryvaagh,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nkcxxf/what_can_i_do_as_a_software_engineer_career/,"Hey guys, I'm a fourth year engineering student in Canada. When I got into uni I chose a more mechanical-oriented program (Mechatronics) because it taught mech, electrical and software and I was confused about what I wanted to do (so I thought I'd learn all 3). However, I'm graduating in a year and I realized that I want to pursue software engineering full time. 

However, I see a majority of people going into web app dev (full-stack, front-end, back-end, even mobile dev). Just wondering, is this the main career path that most SWE's end up taking? I see people with CS/Software Engineering degrees taking this path, and then I also see bootcamp grads taking this path.

I understand that web dev is lucrative, but what is the smartest path I can take that is both financially rewarding and will allow me to progress in my career? I'm doing an embedded SW internship right now, and that's fun but it seems a little anti-social. 

Any thoughts and insights would be appreciated, thanks guys :)"

I focus on making websites, i am also decent in making UIs, i have knowledge on CSS, JS/jQuery, and a little bit of PHP. but i also know SQL and Java but am not too skilled. I dont know if these skills are enough. and how can i solidify my skills on these? should i make more personal projects and post them on portfolio websites? really i have no clue.

I have ideas in mind like freelancing and applying to internship jobs, and i have tried those before. I have made personal projects to have as my portfolio but i think i have made those projects scuffed and not enough to be said as a proper website, and i have only posted 2 of them yeah im not really active. I have also tried to apply on one internship recommended to me, i have sent my [portfolio](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yzUsMInai6pCrg7vNaD_zpOFM9nugmkP?usp=sharing) and received no reply. Also i dont know where to find internships

A classmate of mine told me that i should always attend webinars in order to have knowledge and have certificate because it can be helpful when finding jobs. but i dont really know where to find these and dont know what to watch where can i find that will be reliable.

Also i rarely use my linkedIn, its even empty i dont what to put there, i dont know how to use it when it comes to finding jobs and for my career

In conclusion im pretty clueless on how to find and be accepted on a job, procatisnation, stress, and other responsibilites have affected me to become a less efficient person when it comes to growing my skills, im really afraid i might end up jobless after i graduate, so as early i want to establish myself and gain income.

(Research, school experience)",ThrowawayNervousHire,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/nkf0lz/can_my_offer_be_rescinded_due_to_date_job_title/,"I'm becoming more and more paranoid about the background check process. 

I recently signed my offer letter and submitted materials for background check process.

My concerns are:

1. one of my experiences was my senior capstone project. We had different ""clients"" come to class and we worked to analyze their data over the course of the semester and presented it at the end of the year. 

- In the first version of my resume I worded it as ""data analyst intern"", because it was my first experience working with a client's data and providing some kind of service to them. I realized this could be taken as paid work so I clairifed in my application that the title was ""capstone project"". 

- Should I be worried this can seem like misrepresentation? Will they try to verify this unpaid experience? 

2.I'm not entirely sure, but I think some of my start / end dates are a little off. 

- My tutoring job during freshman / sophomore year at uni is listed to end in December but I think I may have stopped in October. I'm not entirely sure and can't find records to confirm. 

- Same with my second tutoring job (first job out of uni). I worry my end date is 2 months off or so. I kept this job after starting another full time job - there we overlap. after going back and checking, I noticed I was not on the schedule since October, but I listed the end date as December. 

My questions are:

- is it common to rescind an offer or have a serious problem if they find a few mismatches like the above? Would it show as a red flag? 

- do they verify unpaid experience? Like my capstone project, and my research experience working in a lab? I wasn't sure whether to list them or not. I'm spiraling into anxiety and can't stop thinking about it. 

Someone please give me some advice on your experiences with background checks and what kinds of hiccups came up along the way 🙏🏼"

(2020 new grad w/ no internships),honeybami_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nkfzlg/i_finally_got_an_offer_2020_new_grad_w_no/,"Hey guys this is my obligatory I got an offer post! I've been lurking this sub ever since I graduated last summer and wasn't having any success during my post grad job search. I applied to close to 500 job listings in my initial job search, which lasted a couple months. I had a handful of interviews, and ultimately made it to the final round with two companies (at different times). I posted about them before on this sub but basically I felt I did pretty well for both companies, but both times the recruiter would ghost me at some point after the final interview without giving me a solid answer. Then 2 weeks later they would send me a rejection email that told me they went with someone with more experience. This left me feeling so defeated, especially since having no internships made me a lot less competitive as a candidate, and it was difficult to get to the final round. Finally around December I got an offer at a notorious WITCH company, but I decided to just go for it since it wasn't contract based and I could still continue to apply on the job.

Luckily the training at the WITCH company taught me a couple of new technologies, which I immediately added to my resume. Then after a few months I started my second round of job search, and this time I had a lot more callbacks for interviews! I think having a few months of ""experience"" at a company even if it was a WITCH helped me significantly in my job search. This time I was interviewing for companies left and right, even though I only submitted about 85 applications. Eventually I got to the final round with 2 companies, and both times I again felt I did pretty good. The first company took a week to get back to me after the final round and lo and behold they decided to go with a more experienced candidate. The second company gave me an offer the same day as the final interview! I still had interviews lined up with other companies at this point, but I was pretty tired of interviewing in general so I didn't continue with those applications.

So the moral of the story, for me at least, is to take a job even if it may be a WITCH, especially if you are able to leave and it's not contract based. The new technologies and skills I gained there were pretty invaluable to my own job search. Of course I'm not trying to tell you to join a WITCH if you have to sign away 2 years of your life, however if you manage to get an offer that's less than ideal but you can leave at any time and still keep job searching I'd say go for it. At the end of the day having any amount of relevant experience, however minimal, may still be better than having no experience at all.

Some other things worth mentioning about my story is that I did probably only around 20 leetcode questions, mostly easys and mediums. Any time I was given an online assessment, even if I did well and completed all the questions and passed all the tests, none of them ever got back to me. I did a couple of take home projects too, and I felt that although I initally preferred those to leetcode, I found that doing well enough to pass to the next round was a lot harder than just doing straight up leetcode interviews. Another thing that may have helped me is that I switched from applying on LinkedIn to Indeed, which is where I found success.

Edit: Wow I didn't expect this to blow up, thanks for the awards! I'll add a tldr.

Tldr: I couldn't find a job post grad and so after 500 applications I decided to take a WITCH job and keep searching. It panned out and my experience at the WITCH job helped me get a real job offer elsewhere."

Considering I am an international student, and visa restrictions will bar me from applying to internships during the summer after the 1st semester.

1. Professors not being free for research 
2. No internships until after the 3rd semester
3. Lesser chances in the H1B lottery

nkh926,62,2021-05-25,[UNI] AMA – MY UNLIKELY PATH TO SMU BUSINESS,wokestreetbets,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/nkh926/uni_ama_my_unlikely_path_to_smu_business/,"Hi there!

Thought I'd host an AMA since (1) I don't see that many similar posts on this (2) I know what it feels like to be absolutely lost and nervous about university and life in general. Many seniors have helped me, so now that I've just graduated it seems like a good time to give back (2a) I'm waiting to start work so I'm a little bored with this pseudo-lockdown

This post is for:

* Anyone curious about SMU Business
* Anyone who finds themselves struggling pre-uni
* Anyone lost during university

I probably don't have all the answers, but I hope my story can help you find your answers.

**My five-second summary:**

Good-ish neighbourhood sec school –&gt; Good-ish junior college –&gt; NS –&gt; SMU Business

@ SMU, I majored in Finance and did internships in investments and banking. I've just graduated and waiting to start at a global firm in this field.

**My academic life:**

PSLE: &lt;240

Secondary school: Double science, L1R5 \~10

Junior college: PCME, RP 76

SMU: Business (finance), GPA 3.8 / 4.0

**I did okay pre-university, but never truly excelled at anything**

I was not a strong (or hardworking) student, didn't take studies too seriously until O Levels

* Barely scraped into an express stream sec school but consistently ranked @ the back of my class
* Somehow 'woke up' in my 4th year and managed to 'make it' to JC (inverted commas because is JC **really** the best path anymore?)
* Was a huge mistake because I was miserable – @ this point I understood the importance of taking my studies seriously, but I couldn't perform no matter how much I studied
* I never passed a single H2 physics paper in JC and **was convinced** I would fail the actual H2 math paper after walking out of the hall that day but thankfully did okay

**Once I stepped into university, things started turning around**

I had a very vague idea of what I wanted to do – @ the time, I knew I wanted to become an entrepreneur (like Elon Musk) someday but didn't know what I was good at.

* I applied (and got) spots at engineering courses in NUS, NTU and SUTD and applied for business at SMU as a safety net. Accepted SMU in the end (a blessing on hindsight)
* Was still pretty lost, even applied to SUTD a second time during my second year of NS
* Eventually stuck through with my decision and went to SMU to read Finance (fun fact, when I stepped into SMU I even told myself investment banking was not for me. Haha)
* **Here's the key takeaway:** For the first time in my life, I was interested in what I was studying and as a result, I did well enough (for my standards). I started getting placed on Dean's List and saw semesters with straight As. Don't get me wrong, there are MANY courses in business school that are BS but I was fascinated by most of the finance courses I took
* Academic excellence was something I never experienced in my life before, and I became so invested in what I was studying that at some point in my final year that I started tutoring other undergraduates in finance

This brings me to my final point (and I wish someone had told me this when I was choosing courses): don't choose a course just because (1) your mum says so (2) GES says the uni has the highest starting salary (3) your friends are going to the same school (4) uni says they have a 'unique pedagogy'

For (1-3), recognise that this is your life and you have to face the reality of actually living your choices. For e.g., software engineers may get paid a lot, have great work-life balance, but is that how you want to live out your life? Everyone's personal situation is different, but that doesn't mean there are fixed paths to success.

And for (4), I've met and worked with students from different schools, and my take is that there is just very little difference btw NUS, NTU, SMU. Don't let the marketing get to you.

**To wrap up, here's some general advice nobody asked for:**

* Don't underestimate the power of interest – if you like what you study, chances are you'll do well
* Don't let school get in the way of your education – university won't get you a job. It is an opportunity for you to get a job. Don't be a boring person and just study, hang out with friends, start something on your own, seize internship opportunities and really make full use of this experience
* Talk to people IRL and don't rely on AMAs by strangers – it sounds scary at first but it is the surest way to get the information you need to make a decision about most things (whether it's a job, or university)
* Make your own choices – follow-up to the above point, talk to people but **make your own decisions.** Everyone has their own biases – even those you look up to
* It's the person not the university – I agree the environment has some influence, but in my opinion it's better to choose the one that can fulfil your needs the best. For e.g. I didn't care about having a 'hall life' because it didn't seem like a life to me at all. And I still believe that. But for some of my NUS / NTU friends, hall is where they meet their best buddies and make their best memories

Anyway, feel free to ask away about university life, related career questions, academics etc.

I will try my best to be as structured and unbiased with my answers. 

**As some have asked, I'm happy to respond to DMs but prefer to chat on the thread so others can see it too.**"

Though I know it's very difficult to get an internship as a freshman, my position is a bit unique: as a result of all the university credit I got from my AP and IB exams, I'm entering university as a second-year student, and as such, I'm unsure of whether companies would treat me as a freshman or as a sophomore.

Further, how important is this distinction? Is the lack of freshman internships a result of freshmen generally being less qualified, or do companies actively prefer sophomores and juniors because they're closer to finishing their degree? For a bit of context, I don't have *zero* experience, but I'm not super skilled or anything; I've done a paid CS research internship at a university and have a few personal projects.

In summary: I'm starting university this year, but graduating in 2024. How will companies treat this, and is there anything specific I should do on my resume?"

I grew up in the ghetto, did very well before university and ppl used to say I was smart..I didn't know what I was doing as I had no one guiding me. In the last year of HS I took classes in physics and it was so hard I decided not to study engineering for fear of failure. Went for business instead. First person in my family to attend university.



(19yo )Because I was so used to hard sciences business classes just seemed silly to me. Only class I was good at was math. I failed the 2nd year and isolated myself due to shame. 3rd year went on to study abroad, a hot mess, yolo mode, lost friends.

(23yo)When I finished the study abroad I moved to the UK( where my mom was). Tried getting work experience but the internships were for people still studying and with 2.1 which I didn’t have. I got a job, 1y later applied for a masters, left the job in bad terms and went on to do the masters (in Business &amp; finance).

The masters was so hard, I failed the dissertation, isolated myself and moved to London. In London I was super broke, got dead end jobs to keep me afloat, applied to professional jobs, got call backs but at some point, with no experience, no perfect grades, poor interviewing/social skills, no references, I lost confidence and stopped applying. Got fed up of the dead end jobs, I quit.

(26yo) After quitting I searched for ways to get rich. Found trading. Roughly 2 months after quitting, the pandemic hit so i decided to focus on trading full time. The whole year of 2020 I was in London in a small room, isolated, in debt, losing money trading.

(27yo) Today I’m at my moms house, still trading and running out of savings to contribute to rent. I started the year losing money trading but now I’m slowly compounding and growing my account. I’m also learning how to code and taking data analytics courses just in case.



I dream of getting rich, building a few businesses, helping people and living a fulfilling life. I want to leave my moms house and have a social life. I pushed everybody away. Now nobody likes me and I’m alone. I need money and want to move out, but I don’t want to do a dead end job nor want to wait till trading eventually pays off. I want to enjoy life every day. My spirit is of dream, adventure and happiness but right now I’m none of these. Also people look down on me here, since I came to this country I’ve been feeling less than.. I feel like I don't fit in anywhere, my confidence plumed, and every day I regret having moved to this country. All my classmates back home have amazing careers at great companies and I am here still lost.

I want to run away again because i feel so lost but I feel like at some point I will die of depression and complete solitude.

nkkgx5,13,2021-05-25,"Wannabe engineering undergraduates of r/india, here's some not-so-well-but-it-works kind of advice.",PseudoScienceJihad,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/nkkgx5/wannabe_engineering_undergraduates_of_rindia/,"I'm writing down my experiences and what I felt people should have told me, as a 6th sem student, and I regret wasting my time. Since I can't go back, and bring back what's lost, and I don't want you all to suffer like me, here's some FAQ-like guide.

**This is for CS  students only, but IS students can refer this as well.**

&gt; - So there are some courses that I find interesting, I'll do it from second year

Please don't. Start with a course, as soon as you can. Also remember, more courses != (not equals)""yeah, I'll get a job"". Choose a specialization, and work only on that. If you have some interest in, let's say, ML and web, learn one of them as a hobby, but focus more on the one you want to do. Allot the first three months to find what interests you, and then, don't change your roadmap.

&gt; - I am really confused about what to learn, should I go for web-dev or competitive programming, or android development?

Learning to code competitively is a good practice, but be reminded by the fact that you can't use the same technique for real-life development. You need to work with other dev as well, and if the code is not readable, don't be surprised if you're been cursed by some sort of black magic. What I am saying is, learn to code competitively, but stop getting obsessed with techniques to write smaller and faster code.

The first and foremost thing - in the first three years, try and explore all the fields briefly. Once you feel like, ""yeah, machine learning is my thing"", **START WITH THE FUCKING ROADMAP**. 

&gt; - So there is this internship that I have to pay for, so should I...?

Stop, and get some help. Internship should not be ""pay and work"", It can either be ""free"" or ""get-paid"". Stop enabling these people to exploit you for labour as well as money. I will also guarantee you that you won't even get an iota of experience. My friend has taken part in such shitty scam, and he didn't like anything about it (subject was machine learning, the ""scammer"" made smart students to teach others, while he had a good night's sleep. He (my friend) was really irritated when others kept calling him for silly doubt which should have been taught by the ""scammer"").

If you want experience, work in **open source**. Open source is also a good way to meet new people and increase your connections.

If you want an internship for namesake (let me guess, you're studying under VTU?), just get some random digital marketing internship, or volunteer intership on Internshala. If you want to try your luck with startups, Angel.co and YCombinator should work.

&gt; - But open source is really hard...

I agree partially, to be honest. And the reason is that i) if a community is small, or ii) if the maintainers of the project don't interact with you, you  start feeling frustrated.
Choose an easier project to work on. Let's be realistic, most of you probably don't even know anything about coding. Just because you've read a book does not make you any expert. Start with labels like ""good first issue"", ""easy"", ""beginner"", or ""hacktober"". Also remember, contribution is not necessarily coding. You may also contribute by improving the documentation, or helping other new users with their issues.

&gt; - Okay, so I'll start learning all courses...

Hol the fuck up. Don't EVER DO this. Learn only courses that matter to you. If I am not wrong, some people also promote Microsoft certified, Google certification and all such crap. Don't waste your money on that. They're crap. I've wasted my money on Microsoft's CPMA course, and it is garbage.

&gt; - So yeah, I've done all that stuff. What now?

Take part in extracurricular activities like hackathon, externships and  fellowships. GSOC, MLH fellowship, Outreachy, Tweag, are some examples. They're all a great way to get real like experience, and also to earn some bucks (I think for 3 months, you're getting paid like 1.5 lacs for Google, and 3 lacs for Tweag)

&gt; - You've said this and that wrong...

If I've said so, I would agree with you. No one has ever said this to me, and since I am a first generation degree holder (meaning, I'll be the first one in my family to get a degree), I did not have many people to recommend and guide me. So basically, I am at a disadvantage, compared to my other peers. If you're just like me, this ""misinformation"" should suffice, and still help you.

&gt; - Some good website to practice coding? Other ""generic"" tips?

I don't like HackerRank, HackerEarth and Codechef, to be honest. I used to practice on Codewars, but then, I felt like the difficulty system was messed up, so I switched to Exercism.  Geek for geeks is also good. You should subscribe to Kunal's youtube channel (Code for Cause), and Ishan Sharma. Since they're in the same year as I am, I can kind of relate with them. Also, master one language properly. If it's C++, master it. But don't forget to learn scripting languages like Python or Ruby. I would not recommend you to learn newer languages like Julia or Crystal, but as a hobby, sure, why not? Just remember to check their pros and cons. **Don't take interview and aptitude lightly**. I have, and it has costed me a lot.


Also, **very IMPORTANT**: LEARN GIT, please.
Let me stress this again, and again,if you don't know to use version control system, you're gonna get whopped. For real."

Most of the time I don't write any original code except for some simple functions or if I'm working on a platform with custom syntax. I am mostly familiar with the libraries I need, but only to the extent where I know which specific library can help me with a particular task.

Hello people from this amazing world,

Firstly i gotta say that i am not a native speaker so i want to apologize for my not so good English. I just want to post this to get more opinions about what is troubling me lately. To give a quick summary, i have been suicidal on and off since march 2020.

But first off all i am gonna start with my life. I am 23 years old now and the first 20 years of my life were perfect and i was very happy. I had a girlfriend from age 18-22 and we were together for 3.5 years. The first year (this was in 2017) was perfect and i think that was the happiest part in my life so far. Sadly after that year we were arguing a lot and some toxic elements were part of the relationship. At the end of 2018(October 2018- February 2019)i felt something was wrong with me but i did not go to look for help. When it got dark outside my mood changed drastically to a negative mood and i felt somehow unreal, which was pretty scary.

2019 things got better in the summer time and i also got to travel around for one month (August 2019) and i felt amazing. At that time i also broke up with her but we shortly got back together in September 2019. In september 2019 i moved to another city for an internship and things started to get darker because my mood got worse at night time somedays, but it was still durable. In March 2020 i was doing an exchange semester in netherlands and smoked a lot of weed even though i knew i should not and one day i wanted to kill myself by putting a knife through my throat. I never felt an urge to kill myself till this point and i cried the whole day.

Because of Corona i lived from march 2020 - june 2020 with my girlfriend and we broke up after that again. I came back home in July 2020 and some days were okay and some days i felt very dark. In October 2020 i cut contact with her and things were going pretty heavy but after a few weeks i was not feeling suicidal anymore and the dark nights slowly disappeared. I was not feeling happy but i was not feeling sad but lately (April 2021 and May 2021) the darker thoughts (especially when the daylight is gone) are coming back. The dark thoughts lasts for maybe 3-4 hours and than everything is back to normal at which point i feel happy and just listen to music in my room.

I also live too much in the past because i want to go back to school and just want to be a kid again (or is it because i am unhappy right now). My life is perfect from the outside. I don't miss my now girlfriend (I just miss the past and the memories with her. I am studying computer science with good grades and i also have a part time job, which i love to do. I also have some friends who i can hang out with and don't have to be alone and even though my life is perfect right now (i travel a lot, have enough money and friends) i still i think about killing myself. Why am i like that? I am having a doctors appointment in 2 weeks and going to tell him about that stuff. Does anyone of you have advice? To whoever who read this, i hope you have an amazing day and life.

Background: I have ADHD and my mom (i don't know a lot about her since i have not seen her for more than 10 years also has a mental illness)"
nkqqb9,41,2021-05-25,The fear can't be trusted,WitchyDaydream,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/nkqqb9/the_fear_cant_be_trusted/,"So this is my first time ever posting on reddit, for perhaps obvious reasons.

Was diagnosed with social anxiety in 2020 and have since then attended a treatment of 30 group sessions to overcome a great part of it. Finished treatment in March of this year.

But covid has not made it easy to keep in touch with my friends or to organize/attend gatherings and it felt like the anxiety once again increased. I tend to be in my own head a lot.

Today I had an interview for an internship I really want. The days before today I have been really nervous. I was afraid to be unable to have an actual (professional) conversation with the managers. I was afraid I wouldn't be able to answer their questions or form full sentences.

I went in, well prepared. And luckily the fear could, once again, not be trusted.

Not only were the managers kind, but they also paid me some compliments and even said I came across as confident. A completely different experience from what I was fearing. 

This outcome reminded me of some of the key points of my social anxiety treatment:
- Our anxious thoughts do not resemble reality.
- Just because it feels like something will have a negative outcome doesn't mean that it will.
- Spotlight effect: We always tend to focus on the things we're most insecure about and expect other people to notice those things, but they don't. They. Really. Don't.

I just felt like sharing and hope that it's welcome."

**Demographics:** white female at NC private school

**Intended Major(s):** political science or something on a pre-law track (there's a program that I really like at UVA—Political Philosophy, Policy, and Law)

**ACT/SAT:** ACT: 33 (DNF, may retake); SAT: 1510 = 770 EBRW, 740 Math (debating retaking for a 1530+ superscore)

also, I will most likely be a NMSF.

**UW/W GPA and Rank:** UW: 3.72 (my school does not give us UW, so my calculations may be off); W: 3.89; Rank: not disclosed by my school. Fantastic upward trend from around a 3.7 in 9th to a 4.3 last semester.

**APs Taken:** I'll have taken a total of 8 by the end of high school. 

10th: AP World History (2)—we don't discuss the digital exams of 2020...

11th: AP U.S. Gov (predicted 4), AP U.S. History (predicted 4), AP Lang (predicted 5)

12th: AP Spanish, AP Stats, AP Art &amp; Design, and AP Art History

**Extracurricular Activities:** not in order of importance...just order that I remembered them, since there's a decent amount. 

Varsity Soccer; 9, 10, 11, (12?): 2019 and 2021 NCISAA State Champions (no 2020 season), ranked #2 nationally by MaxPreps and UnitedSoccerCoaches.

Club Soccer; 9, 10,11

Model UN; 9, 10, 11, 12: attended 5+ conferences and chaired others; elected to officer in 11th grade. in 2021-22, I'll serve as Director of Logistics for the club. 

Mock Trial; 10, 11, 12: participated in both prosecution and defense during all competitions; won Best Attorney in my round at regionals (2021), co-captain for 11th and 12th grade

Rotary Interact; 10, 11, 12; co-founded club with my brother and hosted speakers monthly prior to COVID in 2020 (also, brother graduated). for the 2020-2021 school year, i shifted the club to be more service-based; members participated in a project in which they made 1000+ sandwiches for homeless neighbors. 

Student Government Association; 10, 11, 12: served as a 2022 class officer in 10th and 11th grade and was elected to serve on the SGA executive committee for 2021-22.

Part-Time Jobs; 9, 10, 11, 12: have had a part-time job since prior to freshman year, though the place of employment varies. worked at Chick-fil-A for 15 months, a juice bar (that closed) for another 15, and am currently working at an art gallery. 

I was voted onto Homecoming Court as a joke...twice... does that count for anything? /s

**Summer Activities:** i want to highlight these in some way on my application

after 9th: interned with local nonprofit for 100+ hours (unpaid); planned events, wrote grant applications; met with donors, among other misc. tasks.

after 10th: I *was* awarded a scholarship by my local Rotary chapter for a short-term exchange in Logroño, Spain; however, this was cancelled due to COVID. Instead, I stayed home and worked at the juice bar. Big whoop.

after 11th: I have two internships and am continuing my job at the gallery. 

My first internship is with a local parody show that's written about my city each year; I'm aiding with graphics and dabbling in writing. The man with whom I'm interning went to UVA and practices law but writes the show on the side. This sounds like my literal DREAM. 

My second internship, which starts next week, will have me working with my county to create the 2025 plan for our city's homeless population. I don't know what my work will entail, but I'm so damn excited I can't see straight.

**Senior Courseload:** two English electives (Shakespeare and Graphic Novels), the four APs listed above, a theater design class, and a legal issues class.

**Letter of Recs:** I already asked two teachers, listed below.

10th/11th English teacher: 7.5/10; she really likes me as a person and as a writer, but I was not on task in her class at all. she did once tell me that my writing restored her faith in our class. do what you will with this.

10th grade history teacher who also advises Model UN and Mock Trial: 9/10; once again, I was not the most attentive in her class. however, she has watched me grow since freshman year in many different areas, so maybe she'll have an interesting take on me. 

externally, i may ask the man overseeing one of my internships for a recommendation. as i said before, he's an attorney and attended UVA—aka who/what I want to be.

**Essays:** I can write decently well, but I'm unsure as to how I'll tackle the Common App prompts. I think that my essays will be good, but not standout. 

**Schools:** UVA (ED?), UNC (in-state), UCLA, Cal, UT Austin, Michigan, UW-Seattle, USC (only private school), UMD, UGA, and UofSC. I'd like to apply EA to those that offer it, but would it be better if I wait for first semester grades?

**One last thing:** i didn't want to mention this until the end, but I feel like it's important to my development. I was diagnosed with ADHD (cool guy syndrome) in August 2020 at the beginning of my junior year; this earned me some medication and extra time, which has made a dramatic difference in my work. I don't want to make any excuses for my performance prior to my diagnosis, but I think it explains a lot. 

**TL;DR, as promised:** mediocre GPA, good test scores with potential for NMSF, decent ECs but have not cured cancer. Live, Love, UVA?"

I complete Codecademy courses and watch tutorials, but when it’s finally time to try to do my work-projects, I’m at a lost of what to do. I understand there’s no such thing as learning to code in 2 weeks, but it sucks feeling so unproductive. I have experience with MATLAB, but that’s pretty much it.

Hi all,

My name is Joseph, and I am a part-time lifeguard at a moderately big YMCA in Northern Virginia (NOVA) and a full-time college student. Recently, my YMCA hired a new aquatics manager and a bunch of new lifeguards for the summer around two weeks ago. I have been working here for around a year now, and I started during the pandemic last year. Yesterday out of nowhere, the new boss emailed me to come in for a meeting with him for 20 minutes. He told me to choose a date and time that worked best with me to come in. This has never occurred to me before, and I don't think I have done anything wrong. I haven't been able to come in as much because of final exams and internships, but I'm getting worried. I have a pretty good engineering internship lined up next summer, but I really need the money.

Could this be a sign that I'm getting fired? Like I mentioned before, I haven't really done anything wrong nor talked to my new manager in person before, so I'm getting kinda worried.

Thanks"

I am a dutch alumnus who has both a bachelor degree as a master degree in Biomedical Science. During my studies I always did labwork instead of computational work, but in my last internship Ive had the opportunity to actually do structural analyses and an evolutional analyses on proteins for 6 months. 

I really found out that compared to labwork, the computational side of biology really suits me way more. Therefore I would now like to enter a career in bioinformatics but I am questioning what to do since I don't have any experience yet in programming etc. 

Therefore, I was wondering whether anyone knows, or has great advice on what the best next steps would be for me in order to enter a career in bioinformatics. 

From what I know I have two possibilities:   


Either to do an IT traineeship for 2 years in which I'd earn an average salary. The problem here is that these traineeships have no precise goal and often focus on business analytics rather than on bioinformatics. 

Or I could do some courses on basic Python/R programming and then try to enter a company/academic institution as a beginner, but I am afraid that the chances of me getting into one of the careers will then be hard due to my lack of experience. 

Right now, I am working in a start-up as product manager, but my contract will be terminated at the end of July. That is why I am now willing to start doing courses in the night and weekend to get to know those basics of Python, but I was wondering whether this would be worth the effort?

I hope you guys can tell me what would be best for me to do and what would give me the most chance of finding a nice career in bioinformatics. I would love to work on evolutional studies."

Should I consider a Coding bootcamp ( I am familiar with a very good one through UNC ) or a masters program? The languages I already know are Java, Python, C, Javascript(learning typescript right now on the job, which is way better), and a few others vaguely. I am looking into getting an AWS Certification this summer too, since I already completed a course on it just never got around to getting the actual certification. I would love, of course, a FAANG level, or slight tier below, big tech company job. What would my best course of action be? Thanks!"

It's my fault. I put too much time into my schoolwork and got overwhelmed, and didn't spend enough time searching. I only applied to about &lt;10 places, and didn't work much on my coding interviews.


I do however have a summer job to hopefully brushen up my soft skills. I'm planning on trying to work on and learn some independent projects: some software development, making my personal website, and learning some ML over the summer. I'm also trying to work with my statistics professor and her graduate students with some ML and data science projects. I want this to be a productive summer. I don't have many great projects under my belt.


I also want to improve my interview skills, since I've been struggling with coding interviews. Most Leetcode mediums pose a problem to me.


Other than that, right now, I don't have anything really great. Executive board of a professional/cultural organization, 3.91 GPA, double majoring in computer science and applied math, a data science project team (that hasn't done much(, and experience in most relevant languages (Java/Python/MERN stack/React.js), but my lack of relevant experience puts me so far behind. And most people I know have internships.


Will I still have a shot at those better internships? Or will they immediately see my lack of relevant experience and shoot me down?"

I recently graduated college and got a job offer as software engineer at a well known defense contractor.

However, I don’t feel that I would succeed at this job. I'm not very good at coding and I don’t code if I don't have to, because I don’t find it to be very rewarding.

I started college out in engineering, because I thought designing medical devices/ prosthetics would be cool. Then I struggled and wasn’t enjoying it at all. While searching for a career path change, I realized I'd always liked design. I learned about UX/ UI design and then tried to switch to a computer science major, to be safe and get the coding skills that can give you an edge in that field.

I took some introductory programming courses (fundamentals, discrete structures, math), all of which I struggled through and two of which I failed.

After going through rough mental health patches trying to stay in Comp Sci, I switched to a hybrid degree that involved game design, 3D/ 2D animation and a little programming (mostly of games). I even struggled through those coding classes, and I rarely got my code to work without help. Even an app development course I thought I was gonna like, I barely made it through. So I concluded that coding wasn’t for me, because I don’t find it rewarding enough to spend all that time sitting, writing code.

I decided to pursue UX/UI by learning what I could on the side outside of school, and working on things for my portfolio. Since then, I’ve been rejected from all the 70+ design jobs I’ve applied to. I don’t have much experience or skill in UX - I’ve only been able to complete one project and case study, and I’m still putting together my portfolio. I’ve asked designers to review my portfolio and it needs work, so it might be a while before I get anywhere with my ideal career. Eventually, I hope to become an art director for films or campaigns.

I also wanted to mention that if all my needs were met, my ideal job would be to be an illustrator. Amidst all the fleeting interests I’ve had in life, drawing has always brought me joy.

I also had an internship as a programmer/ analyst in 2019 that I know helped me get the job offer in question. While I got good reviews at the end, it was more for my work ethic. I could tell throughout the time that my manager at that job was expecting me to be better at coding than I was, and to know more than I did. Eventually he picked up on my lack of skill and gave me visual design focused assignments. I didn't get a return offer.

I don’t want to relive that situation where I felt incompetent again, especially since this is the real world, not an internship. I’m willing to self-study and put in the work, but don’t think it’s realistic that I’ll compare to SWEs with a whole degree in CS that I don’t have.

I’m also just a lot more interested in solving design problems than I am in technical problems. Throughout all my experiences in tech/ engineering, I’ve felt like an outsider who has little understanding of what’s going on, and I continue to feel this way. On the other hand, visual design and art feels a lot more natural, and I get ideas because I’m inspired.

So I’m at a crossroads. This job is in front of me and would pay pretty well, but I don’t think I’m cut out for it. The alternative - a career I would enjoy much more - has no offers in sight. Is it smart to take a job just to have a job, and keep looking for the job you want? How easy is it to really make a career transition like that?

Any advice for making this decision would be appreciated, truly."

Can you please list anything that helped you understand how to break down problems. I will go back down to the very basics if needed. Ive failed Google 2 times for internship, Amazon OA, Snowflake, Snapchat, Bloomberg, Amazon New Grad AWS, Amazon front end and about 10 other companies.

This is beginning to take a toll on me. I don't really have anybody to talk to, maybe my mom but she wouldn't understand anything. I really dont have any friends to talk to, I've tried to make a few friends and tried doing leetcode with them but they end up bailing out and I get stuck alone doing problem after problem. I just graduated and I have about a month and a half before my contract is finished for the room Im leasing at a student house. I dont have a room back home with my parents and would just be sleeping on the floor with my desk being the kitchen table when its not occupied. Im going to have to go back to home depot or lowes to pay rent/food there as well as pay my debt. I have no idea what to do besides keep going at this but I would really appreciate any resources at all. I will go down to the basics. Ill do anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:

I forgot to mentin that some of these roles I've interviewed for were in my junior year where I had no idea what I was doing. The only recent interviews I've had after doing a few leetcode problems were Bloomberg, Amazon,  Snapchat and 2 other companies.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for the responses. Looks like I will be going back to basics since I dont have strong fundamentals down. Ill also broaden my search to include smaller companies not just big N. Thank you guys. Also I see people commenting that I was whining about working retail and that I've given up just know that I havent given up and I've broaden job search and Im continuing to practice. I was simply saying I did not want to go back to retail because Im tired of it, ive worked those retail stores including fast food while going to school and it just sucks. **Post is resolved.**

I wanted to make use of my summer and secure an internship alongside my summer semester, but from where I'm from, internships are pretty hard to fetch if you're not a graduate.

I did however manage to contact a company and secure a digital marketing and web development internship. The company is however WordPress based, and I was hoping to find something that focuses on HTML, CSS, and JS, but I took the internship anyway because digital marketing would also be a good plus on my CV, and I didn't want to lose that opportunity since I wasn't sure I could find another internship for this summer. 

I do not have any prior experience in WordPress, but I think web developers should generally have a good idea on platforms like WP and Drupal since they're an easier approach when working with smaller businesses. But what should I do next? Or in other words, how do I maintain my HTML, CSS and JS skills, and what skills should I focus on attaining while I'm still at school to be able to secure a good job as a fresh graduate? Was it a good idea to take the internship? And what advice do you have for a web development newbie?"

I just decided to pick up a finance minor during my junior year, at first I struggled because I am so used to accounting, but I ended up loving it and I found the curriculum more exciting than accounting. 

This summer I will be interning at a big 4 doing a deal advisory and audit internship. Last summer I interned at the same Big 4 doing a rotational internship. Hopefully, I will be able to earn a returning job offer but, senior year I definitely want to interview with other companies. I recently discovered an interest in asset/wealth management and I am hoping to apply and interview at a few banks, but I also am torn whether or not to stay at a Big 4 and pursue a career in accounting or to work at a major investment bank. 

Ultimately, I am curious to know which path is better for me right now? Is there a career field at any major bank (Goldman, JP Morgan, Merrill, etc..) where I can utilize both my CPA and finance minor? Also, any insight on what a career in wealth/asset management looks like for a first-year? 

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated! :)"
nl325j,1,2021-05-25,Newly diagnosed and struggling. Looking for advice/perspective,ShaggyTheJesus,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/nl325j/newly_diagnosed_and_struggling_looking_for/,"I had therapist recently diagnose me as ADHD after listening to my history with standard ADHD like symptoms.

I'm curious if anyone else has experienced being a ""type 2"" ADHD, as in you didn't struggle and then, at some point, you did? To explain a bit of my story, I was unbelievably focused a kid -- I could sit down and read the same book for like 6 hours straight. I did extremely well in school and was even moved forward a grade. Then middle school came along and I started feeling a shit load of resistance to school and making any kind of cognitive effort. I've always loved science and was great at math when I was younger, but by high school I was a B/C student, just putting in enough effort to not fail. I started struggling massively with high dopamine distractions like video games, TV shows, and porn.

During my senior year of highschool, I started to get stressed about getting into a good college. I loaded up on honors and AP courses and got an internship. I was struggling enormously to sit down and do my school work. Then, something magic happened. I discovered coffee.

I can tell you the exact day I had my first cup of coffee. I walked into a starbucks to do my AP Calculus homework, ordered a white chocolate mocha, and experienced something unbelievable. It felt like coffee fixed my brain -- the fog and distractability and dullness cleared and I was suddenly just calm, clear, focused, and sharp. I didnt just do my work that night, I actually *enjoyed* it. Coffee gave me access to this amazing feeling of being meaningfully engaged in my life. I thought I had found my solution, and I went on to get a MS in a prestigious engineering program, largely fueled by coffee.

I started having issues though. I'm very caffeine sensitive and eventually I started to feel like I couldn't calm down. I was laying in bed at night feeling like my body was in fight or flight mode and I started getting really bad insomnia. On top of all that, I started to feel like I couldn't really feel any of my emotions through the stress and caffeine induced anxiety.

After a horrific event that left me with serious PTSD, caffeine started having the opposite effect on me: instead of focusing me, it scattered me (I'd just get caffeinated and have like 30 tabs open and get nothing done); instead of calming me, it made me anxious and sweaty. Then, the insomnia got *really* bad. I started having panic attacks.

I tried everything in the book to try and keep caffeine (restricting time/amount, taking time off, adding in noots/supplements) in my life because it was so helpful, but it became clear to me that I had to quit all together due to the panic/insomnia and did so about 7 months ago. I was hoping a lot of the depression, brain fog, and difficulty focusing would get better as I got through the caffeine withdrawals, but after 7 months, things haven't really changed much cognitively (I now don't have insomnia, my anxiety is MUCH better, and I can actually feel my emotions -- definitely worth it), hence me posting here.

I'm finding I'm feeling a lot of grief over how much I'm struggling to kick into gear. I have all sorts of things that I want to do, but it's extremely difficult and rare for me to tap into the feeling of being meaningfully engaged in *anything*. It's like my brain can't do anything difficult -- clearly not because I'm incapable, I have an MS in engineering, but I just constantly feel like I have a 10,000 rock strapped to my brain and I have to lift that rock *before* I can do any task that requires any effort. Before, coffee would just lift that rock and my brain felt free; now, it's like effort just requires an extraordinary amount of... effort. 

I'm not struggling to get out of bed, shower, eat well, or exercise, nor do I feel sad or depressed -- I definitely have my issues but I'm actually a decently content guy right now. But I'm really struggling with how, without caffeine, I feel powerless over how distractable I am and how I seemingly compulsively avoid any kind of mental effort. On top of that I have a growing sense of spending my life just wasting time. It's like I'm stuck with some terrible double edged sword: my brain doesn't want to do *anything*, yet I also feel a growing sense of pain from *not doing anything*.

Not sure if I really have a question as much as I just needed to vent. If any of you have any tips on your experiences with therapy and medication management, I'd be super interested to hear."

But stay persistent and jump on any opportunity you get! Most importantly, PUT YOURSELF OUT THERE. Not just to people that work in the firm you want, but everyone.

A few weeks ago, right at the end of the semester as I was planning my part time summer research that the school probably gave me out of pity, the head of my side of our student investment fund (quant) reached out  about an opportunity at a small/med hedge fund (\~800AUM) as a data science intern. 

Chain of referral looked sorta like this: Some guy that used to be in fund got analyst offer, CIO asked him for data science guy, he asked my head, head offered it to me.

My and the CIO clicked and I just got an offer from them this week. The past two semesters I did not get a SINGLE interview, ANYWHERE... I had already given up by the end of spring and gotten pretty depressed about the whole thing.

Background:

Major: Quantitative Finance (its sorta rare major, basically first half of CS degree, first half of pure math degree and then lots of technical finance stuff (time series, stats, adv probability, etc)

3.75 GPA

Year: Junior (finishing degree in 3 years, so had no internships prior)

Resume was basically class projects, my student managed investment fund and personal investing I did in my own time

And I need the money to support myself.

So I’m wondering….am I screwed without internships?

I like the job I have, I have great managers, and I can support myself with it. An internship is a much more shaky thing, because I’m risking all those things.

My current job is fairly technical (it does include a fair bit of SQL and working with multiple departments like Accounts etc).

But about a month into my talks with them and our go-between they finally told me it's an unpaid internship, and while it wasn't stated initially whether it was or not they certainly made it seem, to me at least, that it would be a paid internship or that I would have some kind of financial help(housing, food, transportation, something). It now appears that if I go through with this internship I'd be going down there and kind of just be on my own as far as a lot of things go. Pay my own airfare, housing, day-to-day expenses, transportation, etc. I'm aware the cost of living down there is rather cheap but the more I talk to them about it the less interested I get. It would be an amazing experience, both personally and to put on a resume, but I'm not sure how worthwhile it  will be to go to another country for 6 months for unpaid experience. I would get to finally perfect my Spanish speaking as well. I am currently applying for other jobs and internships on Indeed and LinkedIn but I guess I just wanted to see what this subreddit thought of my situation. Would the experience be worth it? Should I try to negotiate something more out of them? Should I just keep looking else-where and if nothing lines up take the internship anyways?"

You might be wondering though, do you need a Computer Science degree? (or an equivalent, such as Software Engineering, etc.). The answer is - no! 

This doesn’t mean that becoming a developer without an engineering degree is easy. Quite the contrary. The most straightforward way to break into this career will always be with a Computer Science degree. Employers across the world will value these degrees. Computer Science programs will teach core fundamentals for software development such as exposure to various programming languages, database concepts, software architecture, assembly language, and mathematics that lend themselves to programming algorithms. This is why an employer will feel at ease hiring a candidate with a Computer Science degree. 

The good news is, you don’t necessarily need that degree and there are a couple of paths that can lead you into landing your own Software Developer gig.

&amp;#x200B;

#### Transitioning from Software QA into Software Engineering:

The first path we are going to talk about is transitioning into an engineer role from a Software QA analyst position. A Software Quality Assurance (QA) analyst is one who is hired to review and test software as it is being developed. Having some technical skills will always benefit a Software QA analyst, but it’s usually not a requirement. Because of this, landing a job as a QA analyst is a good way to position yourself for an eventual transition into Software Engineering. 

So now the question becomes, how do you get into QA without a Computer Science degree? This is something I have witnessed countless people achieve. Here are a few strategies that will work:

* Apply to software testing internships or entry-level positions. At a previous company, we constantly hired interns to do software testing and ultimately hired most of them into full-time Software QA Analyst jobs. Go ahead and do a quick search for local software testing/QA internships. You’ll see that while some of the job listings would prefer Computer Science coursework, it’s usually not a requirement. You can also try your luck at applying to entry-level jobs as well. I’ve seen companies hire software QA analysts with degrees in English, history, anthropology, economics, mathematics, and yes, even Computer Science!
* Transition into Software QA from a Software Support role. You’ll notice that many companies have Customer Support Representative roles. This is a role in which customers will send in calls and emails asking for support on a given piece of software. This is where you become an SME, a Subject Matter Expert, at a specific type of software. You’ll know how the software works, how it breaks, when new features drop, etc. At many companies, transitions from support representatives to software QA is fairly common. 

Once you’ve been working as a Software QA analyst, you’ll notice that this career path has some interesting places for career growth - you can become a team lead, a manager, a director - OR you can instead grow into a QA engineering role which might have a title such as Software QA Engineer, Software Test Automation Engineer, or Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET, a title created by Microsoft). If you are interested in become a Software Engineer, then I highly recommend the latter path.   


#### What is a Software QA Engineer/Test Automation Engineer/Software Development Engineer in Test?

All of these roles have many things in common. At the end of the day, the goal of this job is to ensure the quality of software that is being released. However, what differentiates these roles from traditional Software QA is that this is a role in which you will develop tools to automate the testing and preparation of software. As a traditional Software QA analyst, you’ll be doing a lot of manual testing of software. For example, let’s say Amazon implements a new feature that quickly does a price comparison against other retailer competitors. Imagine that there’s a button next to the “Add to Cart” button that says “Price Matching.” When you click on this button, Amazon quickly analyzes the prices of this item across its competitors’ websites. If it finds a cheaper price, it will match the price (the more I talk about this feature, the more I wish it actually existed). As a Software QA analyst, you test this feature by lining up test cases in which you have items that will trigger a price match and manually test this feature on a test environment to make sure it triggers and adjusts the price accordingly. In order to make sure this feature works correctly, the QA analyst will be tasked with testing all competitor websites across hundreds of items. Manually doing this testing is going to be cumbersome and soul-crushing. 

A Software QA Engineer/Test Automation Engineer/SDET will instead create testing frameworks that will allow this testing to be automated. Some tools to make this happen would be Selenium or UiPath. These are largely scripting tools that will make testing a breeze (well…. once a framework is put in place!). In our previous example, an SDET might create an automated testing framework that has a script that will click through hundreds of items and then check for valid results when you click on “Price Matching.” Rather than having to manually conduct this test hundreds of times, you simply write a script ***once***, test it a few times, and then upload a test data set (for example the URLs of hundreds of items to test) and then you let the script do it’s own thing. The script will then fire off a simulation testing the software across each item on the dataset completely on its own! The nice thing about these frameworks is that any time there are updates made to the software, you can simply click a button and perform hundreds of automated tests with a single click. The time savings is palpable! As you might imagine, for many organizations, having this type of testing setup is incredibly advantageous.

You’re now probably wondering, pretty rad job description, but how do I get into that? If you’re already working as a Software QA analyst at a company, you may or may not already have test automation initiatives. If you do have someone who runs this already, now is the perfect time to partner with them and make your interest in the subject known. The more teammates that can learn this skill, the stronger the team. When I was responsible for creating a test automation framework, I created a boot-camp course for all new QA hires. I made sure that anyone that started at our company knew the fundamentals of automation regardless of their tech skills at the time. It was then incumbent on them to engage with the automation opportunities they had. 

If you find that your organization does NOT have test automation in place, don’t be disheartened. Do the opposite of that! Be…. heartened? That’s not quite right… but you get the idea. This is now an opportunity for you to stand out by figuring out how to implement automated testing. There are tons of resources on how to get started online:

* [YouTube - Selenium for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FUdrBq-WFo)
* [YouTube - Selenium Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jdkrj2lDAEY)
* [PluralSight - Automated Web Testing with Selenium and WebDriver](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/automated-web-testing-selenium-webdriver-java)
* [YouTube - UIPath Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVtgA_PQ5R4)
* [Udemy - UiPath - Level 1 Robotic Process Automation (RPA)](https://www.udemy.com/course/uipath-robotic-process-automation/)   


There are tons of resources out there to learn the process of testing automation, way more than when I had to implement a testing framework 7 years ago. After perusing some of the offerings, I can safely say that both the free and paid courses seem to be very thorough and cover Java, Python, and C# so you’ll have many prograamming language options available to you. 

As you can imagine, someone in this role is gaining development experience by having to create automation frameworks, write scripts, and maintain and deploy their solutions. These are all skills that translate almost 1:1 to a software developer job. 

#### Transitioning from an Automation Engineer/SDET to a Software Developer

Hypothetically, once you’ve gained a few years of experience in this role, you’ll be primed to make a career move. The first step is to make sure your manager(s) are well aware of your career ambitions. Just because you know how much you want to transition into Software Engineering does not mean that leadership in the company are even aware of that. If you’re silent, they’ll assume that you’re content. This is why you must take advantage of any form of yearly and bi-yearly performance reviews. You must articulate what it is you’re trying to achieve professionally. Having the support from your managers will make a possible transition much more seamless. 

After you make your ambitions known, the next step becomes making it known that your coding skills are sharp, that you deliver value to the team, and that you’re constantly growing. If you can combine those types of results along with communicating to your managers that you want to transition to a traditional software engineer role, your odds will be looking pretty good. Whenever there is a Software Engineer opening, this is when you pounce you speak with your managers about it. If they have faith in you and have a plan to backfill your position as a tester, they should hopefully present you with an interview (hell, I’ve seen situations where they don’t even interview and just promote someone into that position). 

But what happens if you don’t have a support manager or there aren’t any promising openings at your company? No need to be discourage. Review all of the skills you’ve accrued working as an Automation Engineer and list them out as if you were creating a resume to be a developer. You’ll see a lot of overlap. It’s time to construct a resume that highlights your engineering finesse and downplays some of the more manual testing you’ve done. When you apply for software engineering openings, make sure to promote your developer skills at the top of the resume and also provide an object section or full cover letter explaining your background and ambitions. Never assume that a recruiter or a hiring manager can read your mind on why you’re applying for a software engineer role when you’re currently something else. 

With the proper fostering of engineering skills, you’ll be very well positioned to land a proper software developer job. It takes time, and it certainly takes a specific type of personality to constantly be learning and implementing new skills - but it can be done. It happens every day. Make sure tomorrow is that day for you.

SoCal student here. I'm currently finishing up my first year of community college as a Psych major (I'm mostly doing gen eds right now anyways), but I am 100% certain I want to switch to something that will lead me to the path of doing something regarding help desk technician, and eventually afterwards moving onto becoming a sysadmin and so forth. I plan on getting an AA-T while pursuing some internships for experience.  


The issue I'm having on my decision, though, is that my school offers two Associates' program paths, **Computer Information Systems** (as a branch of a Business major) and **Electronics and Computer Hardware Technology** (as a branch of Industry and Technology (Engineering, Science major)).  
While I've heard of Computer Information Systems before along with Information Technology, Management Information Systems (not provided by the school, but I'm not looking towards more software-oriented courses anyways), Computer Science (which I'm not looking into due to being mainly interested in hardware over software and less theory-based subjects), etc., I've never once heard of Electronics and Computer Hardware Technology. It's associated with the Industry and Technology Division.  


The school's page for the latter is as follows:

""Electronics and Computer Hardware Technology

Associate in Science and Certificates of Achievement and Accomplishment

The Electronics and Computer Hardware Technology program prepares students for employment in the areas of computer hardware and industrial, military, and consumer electronics. Students acquire proficiency in analyzing, assembling, testing, and troubleshooting both analog circuits and computer systems. Students are trained in industry standard codes and symbols for components, systems, safety devices, and procedures.  
The program also meets the needs of the currently employed who seek upgrade skills, change careers, or prepare for industry certification and licensing. Competencies will be assessed regularly by student performance in the classroom and laboratory. Electronics Engineering Technician, Computer Hardware Engineer, etc.**""**  


I scheduled an appointment with one of the school's Industry and Technology counselors, but after seeing there's a set of counselors for Business that deals with those in CIS, I'm extremely confused now. Which is better for this career path? Am I confusing myself? Does it even matter since they're both associated with computer technology?"
nl6afx,141,2021-05-25,Reflection CS Internship Hunt,Ok_Matter6365,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/nl6afx/reflection_cs_internship_hunt/,"Background: International sophomore student majoring in cs at a ok state college in USA. I got this internship for the summer semester in a mid-sized company. My GPA was 3.75 which I don’t think really matters to companies and I had previous experience working as a web developer intern in a very small startup that didn’t even had launched there first product. I think I applied for nearly 1000 companies or more throughout the process in which I received many automated rejection emails. I started to apply for summer internships from last December or even earlier but I was very slow in applying at that time since rejection bothered me. So the time that I really gave my everything was from January when I applied for nearly 30 companies per day. 

So my cs internship hunt ended finally after some months and I realized, the only thing that kept me trying was persistence. It's easy to say that ""I am persistent"" but it's hard to actually follow it. During this time I even lost self-belief several times, but there was something that kept me trying and that was persistent in the process. I took this inspiration from the movie ""The Founders"" and found it to be true. So to all the people reading this read this carefully. Being persistent does really helps you to increase your odds of success. Also, the common mistake that I found in myself ( and I assume in most of the people ) is to keep on expecting things to go the way they wanted them to go. I know it's hard to not expect an outcome for which you put on so much, but believe me, expecting doesn't help except breaking yourself from inside.

I hope that this Reddit post could help someone."

I'm a CS student with 1.5 years left of school until I graduate. Although I've had multiple great and kind professors each time I look online I see how little I actually know of anything and it actually seems I've been taught very little in my classes so far, ofc I've gone through Data structures and seen most of the basic ones and even then I feel like the pressure I had in those classes hindered my learning ability during the course. I was told to apply to multiple internships during my second year which I did, I applied to google once I feel like I did fairly good for my first interview but definitely flunked the second one, got rejected and ghosted for three weeks until my recruiter finally said no. I applied again the next summer I solved the challenge questions and passed all cases with what I thought were good solutions, once again I got ghosted for three weeks before being told I was rejected. I applied to Palantir and the challenge felt too hard for my level I tried and got rejected. I'm almost at the end of the line and I feel very discouraged as many of my friends have succeeded, I myself don't feel like I'm a bad programmer, definitely trying to polish my skills and refresh my knowledge this summer. Right now I'm very lost, I don't have any idea of what I should be aiming to do or where to look for help, I've thought about starting simple projects but looking at YouTube tutorials feels like I'm cheating or that I won't learn because I'm watching someone do it and explain.

I am majoring in Civil Engineering with specialization in BIM. In short, I am a few months away from graduating. Last year, I did a summer internship as a BIM engineer at the BIM department of a company. When the internship ended, the HR conducted a small interview with me and asked whether I would like to work for them again in the future, to which I responded I would love to.  My supervisor said that the company will recruit more full-time worker when they acquire new projects in which they would need more people, so he couldn't promise me a spot in the company yet and said that we needed to wait and see if they will have a job opening for me in the future. 

Almost one year has passed since then and today I saw the company posted a BIM engineer job in the same department where I interned at last year (the BIM department). They posted it in a job-seeking website similar to Linkedin (If anyone is curious, it is 104.com.tw , which is basically the Taiwanese-equivalent to Linkedin). I decided to apply for the job through the job-seeking portal but then the thought crossed my mind, ""Why don't I just email my supervisor again, saying that I saw the job post and would be interested to work with them again?""

So I need an advice, will it be considered rude to email my past supervisor again for the job opening? Sorry if this seems like a newbie question, because this is going to be my first full-time job and in general I just lack a good understanding of working politics yet.

Thanks in advance!"

3. From what I have read online and going by rankings, York Schulich has better brand recognition in Toronto and Finance industry in Canada compared to McMaster Degroote. 

4.

nlb5j2,1,2021-05-26,"CS degree, no internships, looking for a job and am on the fence about App Academy bootcamp",davidlovescats,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nlb5j2/cs_degree_no_internships_looking_for_a_job_and_am/,"I graduated last December with a BS in computer science and a minor in math, with a 3.34 gpa.

I never had an internship during college, and I’m looking for my first job in the software development industry. I’m in the application process for App Academy for a 4 month long intensive bootcamp online, which covers Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, SQL, and a lot of other things to prepare me to be a full stack web developer.

The reason I’m considering App Academy is because I seriously dread the job search and application process, and I hate long wait times and rejections to be honest. So by doing an intensive bootcamp, I’m making myself the most qualified I have ever been. I’ll have more skills in my resume under skills I’m “proficient” in and more skills in general. I’ll have new projects which could hopefully be better than my previous projects, and on top of that, they offer career services like 1:1 career coaching, mock interviews, and resume reviews and stuff. I’ll have group project experience, which I feel also helps make up for not having an internship. So I think it will take me less applications to get my job after a bootcamp, and I can hopefully shorten the job search process and minimize rejections. That’s why I’m considering it. I really just want to “get my foot in the door” but without a painful process. I kinda enjoy learning new computer science stuff anyways. I’ll look forward to learning (in depth, not just basics) Ruby, JavaScript, HTML and CSS, and SQL. The rest, hopefully I enjoy and I think I probably will. 

At this point, 4 months are gonna pass by quick anyways, so I’d rather be more qualified in 4 months than possibly be still unemployed or lost. And the thing I fear most is a large amount of time passing by, like 4 months, and me regretting not joining App Academy from the start (especially because this is the last online cohort before they switch back to San Francisco and New York cohorts.) So I’d rather just get this over with, study for 4 months (I guess it will just be like one more university semester), and put myself in the best position to get hired.

One thing is their job placement rate though. This is one thing that made me uneasy about the program, because though they say they have around a 93% placement rate, my counselor said 6 months is the average time to get placed, and in an information session they said that 50% get placed within 6 months after the program. So while I do have a big advantage because of my degree, and I also have decent knowledge of and practice with  technical interviews, and at least a few projects already, I don’t want to struggle for months after an already intensive program. If any App Academy graduates have information on how long it took to get a job and roughly how many applications were sent, I would appreciate that information very much."
nlb9fg,10,2021-05-26,My internship doesn't go as planned. Still a chance to save it?,throwwawway__,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nlb9fg/my_internship_doesnt_go_as_planned_still_a_chance/,"I've been an intern in SWE and ML in a pretty big company for a few months now (not in the US). This internship is supposed to be the last one I do before I graduate, and the grade the uni jury and my manager will give to my internship report counts as half my final grade this year. 

The problem is that my internship isn't going as well as I planned. I am working within a team of SWEs but on a separate project, which is in my opinion way too ambitious to be completed by an intern in just a few months. 

It is roughly about building an entire system which will use a ML model I had to find on my own, and that will be used as an internal tool by developers at the company, with no data available to train the model. I came up with several ideas for a model since I've been here, the team let me demonstrate how I could use them to solve the problem and every time they said that the model was not going to be precise enough, fast enough, etc. I spoke to different people working in ML and they said that it was a known difficult subject even among researchers and more likely to be completed by a PhD student in a few years. Actually, three other interns have been working on this subject before me and they all failed apparently. 

I am starting to feel really anxious about the outcome of this internship, and every morning I wake up with the stressful thought that I will not be able to graduate because I am too incompetent for this. 

Is there still a chance to save my internship even if I do not finish the product they expected me to build?"

Here is my background, stats, etc. Please let me know what you think. I understand there are many other factors such as essays, letters of recommendation, etc. that determine your chances. However, I would really appreciate if you could judge just my stats for now.

Background:
Applicant type: International
Race/Ethnicity: Indian (Overrepresented I know)
Gender: Male
Family income: $20k a year (will be applying for aid)
Legacy: None

Grades:
9th grade - 85%
10th grade - 89%
11th grade - 88.5%
12th grade midterms - 94%
(I have been told that admissions officers tend to know about education systems around the world. So, I think they'll understand that grades are deflated in 9th and 11th grade in India CBSE. I am a little worried about my 10th grade scores tho.)

Standardized test scores:
SAT: 1520 (780 Math 740 English)

I haven't taken an English Proficiency Exam yet, but I'll easily get the required score.

ECs:
Youtube channel: 10k subs. 500k views. Entirely original content. No compilations or anything like that.

Filmmaking: 6 short films, two of which have one a low level competition. I also worked with a UC Berkeley Professor on a video. My yt channel also involves a lot Filmmaking, but I plan on listing my yt channel as a a separate ec.

Debate: Many debates at school. 1st place in a national level MUN. 2nd place in an international MUN.

Public Speaking: 1st place at a state level panel discussion. Was part of another panel discussion at my school on gender inequality.

Advocacy Program: Partnered with Oxfam and hosted an Advocacy Program shedding light on some of the major gender disparities in Indian society, along with 4 other students.

Italy Exchange Programme: So the name here is misleading. I didn't actually get to go to Italy. Our visas were rejected, but they came. So I hosted two Italian kids and basically showed them around my city, we talked about our cultures and played around and stuff.

Leadership positions: Class representative in 9th grade. I'll stand for the head of student council elections soon and I have an okay chance at that.

Building machines: I have built a 3d printer from scratch, and am currently working on a robotic camera Movement Device sorta thing. I expect it to be done before my application deadline.

Python: Just did a random online course. Uploaded a few things on github. Developed a graphical interface to control that camera Movement Device thing.

Beta testing: I beta tested a career counseling app.

Basketball: Was a player on one of the four school teams in 10th grade. I couldn't do anything else after that cuz for most of 11th and 12th grade, India was and will be in lockdown due to a serious covid 19 situation.

Drawing: Don't have any tangible achievements. But I've made quite a few very realistic pieces of art. I could maybe submit a portfolio for it.

Keep in mind that a few of these ecs could be merged into one if I don't have enough space.

I still have a few months till I apply, so here are some things I haven't done yet, but might do (not sure, but maybe):
1. Raise some money to help charities fight the covid situation in india.
2. Some more public speaking stuff. Probably can't attend an event due to covid, but maybe some online conferences and debates.
3. Maybe another short film.

I do want to mention in my additional info section that I couldn't do any internship or participate much in athletic stuff in the last two years of schooling due to the covid 19 lockdown. 

Apart from this, I'm really focusing on my personal statement (have started and will spend a month or two or maybe more on it) and my supplemental essays (will put time into them too)

I will try my best to get good letters of recommendation from the right teachers.

So, now for the final question:
How do you think I'll do? I would love to go to an Ivy or somewhere like Amherst, but I understand that's extremeelyyyyy hard. I will also apply to safeties. The main issue is that I need financial aid  and I don't want to take a hugeee loan. 

So, where do you think I can get in? Do I have any shot at the top universities (Ivies and ones like Amherst)? What about ones like Skidmore and Colgate? My intended major is Computer Science."

Sobrang appreciated and makakatulong po ang advise/tips niyo. Thank you!"

(Research, school experience)",ThrowawayNervousHire,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/nlgbno/would_big_4_rescind_offer_due_to_date_job_title/,"Can my offer be rescinded due to date / job title discrepancies in my resume? Does big 4 verify unpaid experience as well? (Research, school experience)

I'm becoming more and more paranoid about the background check process. 

I recently signed my offer letter and submitted materials for background check process.

My concerns are:

1. one of my experiences was my senior year capstone project. We had different ""clients"" come to our class and we worked to analyze their data over the course of the semester and presented it at the end of the year. 

- In the first version of my resume I worded it as ""data analyst intern"", because it was my first experience working with a client's data and providing some kind of service to them. I realized this could be taken as paid work so I clairifed in my application that the title was ""capstone project"". 

- Should I be worried this can seem like misrepresentation? Will they try to verify unpaid experience? 

2.I'm not entirely sure, but I think some of my start / end dates are a little off. 

- My tutoring job during freshman / sophomore year at uni is listed to end in December but I think I may have stopped in October. I'm not entirely sure and can't find records to confirm. 

- Same with my second tutoring job (first job out of uni). I worry my end date is 2 months off or so. I kept this job after starting another full time job - there we overlap. after going back and checking, I noticed I was not on the schedule since October, but I listed the end date as December. 

*My questions are:*

- is it common to rescind an offer or have a serious problem if they find a few mismatches like the above? Would it show as a red flag? 

- do they verify unpaid experience? Like my capstone project, and my research experience working in a lab? I wasn't sure whether to list them or not. I'm spiraling into anxiety and can't stop thinking about it. 

Someone please give me some advice on your experiences with background checks and what kinds of hiccups came up along the way 🙏🏼"

I've done 2 6 month internships as a software/cloud developer and I realized I want to do more business side of things than pure development. I think it's more interesting to see the bigger picture and how technology is innovated then being in the weeds and coding/implementing it yourself.

My idea is that tech consulting will allow people to get into more business/strategy roles faster than starting out as a dev in tech industry. I've saw roles of product roadmapping, strategy, etc mentioned when reading about big 4 tech consulting."

I'm a J2 taking A Levels this year and am interesting in NTU WKWSCI, so I was hoping to find out more about the course and its nature because the information on the website is limited and after all it is always best to hear from people who are students of WKW. 

I have several questions about it

1. How is the admission process like? Apart from A Level results, are there any other things that need to be submitted? Or will there be interviews, selection processes etc ? Also, are you aware of any rough indication of the required rank point, if there is a minimum requirement?

2. How's the workload and timetable? Are lessons and assignments very jam packed and in your opinion, how does it compare to JC? (if you came from JC)

3. Are JC students disadvantaged in any way compared to poly students who took a related course like mass comm? Although uni is probably much more in-depth and cover a larger range of things, I'm assuming that there's gotta be some overlap in content with poly courses? Not trying to be competitive in any way, just purely curious! (Would appreciate it if poly students in wkw who took comms in poly could share your views!)

4. Ok this is more like me trying to seek advice haha but what do you think about internships in related industries after A Levels and would it help in admission? To be very frank, I kinda really want to just chill and rest a bit after As but most internships need a min. commitment of 6 months, but I'm still thinking about it because I'm not exactly sure how important it is

That should be about it. If you'd like to share some other things about wkw or your interesting experiences I'll be really interested to hear it too! Thanks in advance!"

I was recently accepted to a graduate CS program in the US which I'm planning to join in late August. As a part of the program, I have the option of doing a summer internship in 2022. 

Due to the Covid-19 situation in my country, I might not be able to make arrangements for my visa and travel in time(all US embassies are currently closed here). 

 I'm going to hand in my resignation on Monday, and I thought it would be a good idea to interview for a few companies while I'm on my notice period(it's 2 months long). If my graduate studies plan works out, it would be a good experience for me, and if it doesn't, I now have a backup job offer in hand. 

Most big tech companies have a ""cooldown"" period when you interview with them, which prevents you from applying to the same job for any time from 3 months to 1 year.

 I wanted to know if applying for an SDE1/SDE2 role here will impact me when I'm applying for the summer internship. I understand that each company has a unique policy, and so the same answer will not apply to all companies. I just want to know if in general, interview cooldown periods for SDE jobs impact applying to internships.

I'm in graduate school, and it seemed like a great foot in the door. The staff is extremely nice and welcoming, and they'll keep me on board for as long as I want, which I think is a huge plus in this uncertain job market. It is also basically a stomping ground for every big player in my field, so the networking opportunities are plentiful. Bottom line is, it's a great gig. 

A few weeks ago, a hiring manager at my dream company let me know that they were on track to onboard an intern sometime in mid to late June. Now, I know the term ""dream company"" gets thrown around a lot, but when I tell you that this is the company I've wanted to work for since I was a child, I'm not lying. 

The hiring process moved forward today, and I might be getting way too ahead of myself, but I think I need to start thinking about what to do should they offer me a job just in case. There's a very large chance that they will offer me a full-time job upon graduation and the pay is amazing. It's also directly related to my field. 

My concern is that I will be burning a huge bridge at my current place and earning a reputation that I like to bounce around. Like I said, it's very well connected, and I can't afford to be ruining relationships this early in my career. I also realize that it is early in my career and I need to make the best moves for myself.

Does anybody have a similar experience or advice? TYIA!"

nlidza,17,2021-05-26,Is it normal that my bosses hug everyone? My lack of participation in hug culture is affecting me at work.,calamar-encre,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/nlidza/is_it_normal_that_my_bosses_hug_everyone_my_lack/,"
So for context, I work at a pretty established niche start up in my industry and city and we are run by two women CEOs. Mostly everyone on my team identifies as female (me included) except for two male staff members. My bosses and coworkers love to hug everyone in the beginning and end of the day and I think it is so incredibly weird, for so many reasons. 

I don’t really like giving hugs to people I’m not close to, it’s just a personal boundary thing for me. I don’t even really hug my friends. And especially in COVID times I have been really strict about who is near me. We are all vaccinated at work so they have said “we are vaccinated we can finally hug again!!” I only sometimes hug one of my best friends who also works with me but I won’t hug anyone else in the office. 

I also know for a fact that a lot of us working there dislike our CEOs because they are pretty toxic, manipulative, under pay us, and often over work us all. But they are constantly spewing the “we are a family here” bs even though I feel they are abusing our labor for their dream and business. We are also struggling financially as a business and they have cut a lot of our hours and forced a couple employees to take their PTO with no notice. They also have us all hired as 1099 employees (freelancers) even though we work daily, in the space, with a schedule. They refuse to give health insurance or keep our taxes so it saves the business money. It’s definitely illegal and tax fraud according to my accountant. So I think it’s really incredibly fake that everyone hugs our bosses like we’re friends and then as soon as we leave they are talking bad about them. Just as a person I find it really hard to fake my feelings and it’s pretty visible on my face when I’m uncomfortable or around someone I don’t like. 

I started noticing that they have picked up on the fact that I don’t like hugging people in the office. Now I don’t even get a good morning like the others, I feel unwelcome in the space when everyone is being affectionate, and it makes me feel awkward and not included. I am constantly left out of “friendly banter”. 

Then, yesterday coworkers made after work drink plans in front of me and no one asked me to come. They all hugged and said how excited they were about hanging out together and I just felt really bad and like an outcast. I am friendly, helpful, do my job really well, and I’m one of the core team members and I notice the interns are getting more love from my bosses than me because they love to suck up to them. I seriously am nice to everyone, everyone comes to me when they need help with a technical problem, our clients give me the best reviews out of all our staff and I am constantly requested by name by return clients which tells me I should definitely be at least a little appreciated by my bosses. 

Is that normal office culture? This is my first big girl corporate job so I’m just wondering if I’m the one being weird or if they are. How do I feel like less of an outcast when I hate participating in fake social interactions? Im just here to do my job. I love my clients (tech education) and I love the work I do but I couldn’t care less about people that I work a 9-6 job with."

Need advice on a career path,keremenci,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nll67h/first_internship_at_cyber_threat_intelligence_and/,"First, a little about myself: I'm a third year computer science student with some outside education on exploit development and reverse engineering. I have always been enthusiastic about cybersecurity as i find myself greatly enjoying low level programming, shellcoding, solving CTF challenges and malware reverse engineering. 

This is my first of three 3 month long mandatory internships and it's my first week at a defense industry corporation. I really wanted to get into the technical stuff but all I've been doing is writing OSINT reports and browsing social media for news, with some translation of security articles in between to publish at the news feed of the corporation. It seems like I will only be writing further reports on newly discovered vulnerabilities, never actually working towards discovering, exploiting or further exploring the possibilities of these vulnerabilities.

Being only an intern and a junior year computer science student, I don't think i'll get any work related to the fields I would like to work at, and spend my three months in this repetitive cycle of writing reports and dealing with corporate stuff.

I really enjoy programming and now considering moving away from the industry -even though i dig the technical stuff- towards more programming oriented career paths like web development. What would you suggest? Should i open up to my advisor or should I just shut up and do my work as an intern?

In any case, I was really enthusiastic when i was accepted to the internship. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.

Then one of the departments from the same college also hired me as their web developer for the summer. My questions are should I send them an email and let them know that I am taking both of these offers, and will this be a red flag on my resume in the future when employers see I'm doing two internships at the same time?

Thanks in advance for any answers"

nlnnbq,5,2021-05-26,Should I take a leap of faith?,xpyrosh,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nlnnbq/should_i_take_a_leap_of_faith/,"A little background:

I graduated college for computer engineering in 2013 but spent the years since working non technical jobs. I've taught myself web dev and managed to do a couple freelance websites for clients however despite applying to every job on LinkedIn or Indeed that I could, I've been ghosted or rejected for the last year and a bit.

The current situation:

I've finally received some responses from two startup companies.. the first of which wanted me to work for three months as an unpaid intern with the potential to be hired at the end of the project. Financially speaking this is unfeasible so I didn't entertain it.

The second company has me doing a coding test where I have to use a cloud firestore db and React.js to setup user signup/login and then storage/querying/editing of data that users submit through a form. Despite the test code provided being riddled with bugs and crashes I've completed the test. The problem however is that this startup is a 5 person team of medical professionals and I fear that in a few months after the project is complete I'll then be jobless.. but the alternative is perhaps never getting my foot into the tech industry."

nlon5m,3,2021-05-26,Should I really finish my Computer Science degree?,AverageWindowsHater,AskProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/nlon5m/should_i_really_finish_my_computer_science_degree/,"Hi, idk if this is the adequate place to get some advices about career, but if someone can give their opinions about this I would be grateful. So I am a 21 year old guy, who lives in Portugal, that fell very soon in love with computer programming, I was about 12/13 when I started learning programming by myself. By the time of going to high school I already knew I wanted to be a programmer so decided to go to a specialized course about software development, did some internships, and one of the companies really liked my work and decided to get me a job there when I finished my high school degree. That was October 2018 till now, working as a web developer, mainly with backend and a little of system administration, which gives me about 2 years and 7 months of working experience.... However, when I started working there I got into university at the same time, I had a option in my cs degree to do it post-labour bc of people like me who work full time jobs... Meanwhile, I was starting to get a little stressed at my work, some of the co-workers started to be very toxic, the work wasn't so enjoyable and starting to get bored so I decided to quit, and now I am having only university classes again, but I am extremely bored and unmotivated, and Idk if I can really do this because I was never a very academic person, I like to do things that I like and find challenging, and because of my experience, college is just relearning the basics, maybe from 100% of the course content I am learning really 2.5% of things that I don't know right now... Is it really worth it for me to take this degree considering I already have experience in the field? Am I going to encounter much trouble later in my career bc I don't have a degree? Some people say that the degree only matters on getting the first job, but Idk if it really is like this here in Portugal.

Notes: Here the college isn't that expensive, and I already saved some money to pay for it.

To finish my degree I still have to take 2 years full of classes... The ones that I think will be more challenging are Computer Architecture bc goes very very low level and Operating systems bc it teaches basically how to do your own file systems and etc... reinventing the wheel... But I don't think I will ever need that to a standard software engineer career."

nlprl6,2,2021-05-26,Is it wrong for me to not to have a summer job this year?,TotallyADogbro,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/nlprl6/is_it_wrong_for_me_to_not_to_have_a_summer_job/,"For a little back story, My girlfriend and I are about finished with our first year of college. (We go to different schools) She is in dental school and is very busy going to school all year round for 2 years while I am in computing school but for 4 years. The main difference is that I have a summer vacation and she does not have many breaks at all and works tirelessly every day. 

Just recently she mentioned to me that she works all day and when she texts me and asks what im up to im always doing something like playing video games or just hanging out while she is actually doing something productive.  

She then continued to say that I should get a job and do something and her parents always mention to her and ask if Im going to get a summer job. I have a small landscaping “business” (I have 8 customers) and I make more than I made when I had a part time job in High school. But I guess thats not enough for this summer? 

Also, I should mention that I have not accumulated much debt thus far so I don’t see a problem in not having a job this summer. I do however,  plan on getting one next year or even an internship."
nlpwc2,3,2021-05-26,"Hey Devs, a little anxious coder here. Is it ok if I watch solutions of leetcode problems and then practice it again?",frikuser,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/nlpwc2/hey_devs_a_little_anxious_coder_here_is_it_ok_if/,"Or should I do the trial and error and think for hours to come up with a solution (that too may be right). I am a 4th-semester student from Tier 1 college and companies will come for an internship exam starting from august. I know most of DS concepts but implementing is difficult for me. Like I know the basic problems like 2 Sum and all but I can not get the idea or intuition of problems like clone graph, merge interval etc.

What I do at this moment is that I see a question, I devote 20-30 minutes to it if I think I can do it. If I could not, I search for the solution, understand it, understand the logic and then code on my own and then practice it again on some random day. Do you think this approach is correct? Ik it is you do what you do but I wanna take input from you guys. So far I have completed close to 80 questions on leetcode (most being medium level, I guess 40ish something) and this strategy seems to be working. Should I carry on with it or it would harm me in the future?  
For reference, questions are like Combination sum, LCA, Maximum Path Sum, Reverse Linked List in groups etc. Sorry if I am sounding a little too nervous, its my anxiety creeping up and saying ""you been doing this wrong"". Sorry if it is sounding like a question with an obvious answer.

Thank you :)"
nlrl81,1,2021-05-26,Masters in Chemistry or Masters in CS?,clopezle,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/nlrl81/masters_in_chemistry_or_masters_in_cs/,"I will be graduating in a year from now with a BS in Chemistry. I originally pursued pharmacy during my 1st to 3rd year of college and I realized it was not the right profession for me. I also tried out various Pharma research internships and to be honest, I enjoyed it. Also, I have been learning CS and creating projects on my own for the past few months and I enjoyed that too!

I am already on my fourth and last year in college and I would like to graduate as soon as possible since the college I attended was small and sucked. I am debating about pursuing a PhD in the future but I am not ready for that commitment yet. I know there is barely any jobs that a Chem graduate can get. Planning to attend MS at a much bigger university but not too sure what to Master in...

A Masters in Chemistry is nice but it is a ""useless degree"" in terms of job hunting unless if it’s for a PhD. I would like to do a Masters in CS since it is a safe back up as the job market is expanding and there are programs for non-CS majors. 

Considering doing a Masters in CS, work within Software Engineering for a few years, then pursue another Masters &amp; PhD in Chemistry. 

Any Advise?"

I consider myself a hard worker, and I'm putting in the effort in school and extra study. I don't feel like I have natural coding talent though. It seems like you need to be some kind of genius to find a job. That can't be true, though? Do average people that work hard get jobs?"

I'm lucky enough to have gotten two internship offers, one from Splunk and one from Coinbase for the Fall 2021 term. This will be my last internship before graduating next year, and I want to return to one of these companies as a new grad. I would prefer to pick a company where I will be able to grow and learn quickly and maximize my new grad compensation.

As well, Coinbase could be in any domain (frontend, backend, etc.) and I know Splunk will be backend though I do not know the exact team I will be on for either.

I would appreciate any advice on which company I should accept the offer for.

Thanks in advance"

I’ve taken my Resume to several different people and they said it is fine. But I’m rarely hearing from anyone. I did not graduate with a great GPA and had no internships (Covid and Family Emergencies got in the way the last two years) so I knew it might be a struggle but I really hoped that I would Atleast have a few more prospect by now since my Degree was in a good field in Information Technology, and a lot of people I know from school have jobs already. I really just want the piece of mind Of having a job and not being stressed from this. I’m not even looking for anything high paying just somewhat related to what I studied. If anyone has any advice or wisdom on who to actually get noticed by employers I’m all ears. I know that  shouldn’t be worried yet but I can’t help it.

Sorry if this was kinda whiny or if u have been searching for A lot longer than me I just needed to vent somewhere"

As well, Coinbase could be in any domain (frontend, backend, etc.) and I know Splunk will be backend though I do not know the exact team I will be on for either.

I would appreciate any advice on which company I should accept the offer for.

Thanks in advance"

**Background**:I am an international applicant looking to do my masters in **Germany** and work here for a considerable time (5-10 years). While I have gone through the wiki for studying in Germany for my masters multiple times and it certainly has been helpful to a considerable extent, I still am unable to decide with my admit for [**MSc. DDS (Data Analytics and Decision Sciences, Business school of RWTH)**](https://www.business-school.rwth-aachen.de/en/programs/m-sc-data-analytics-and-decision-science/) mainly because of my profile.

**Profile :**Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering - in India good grades 8.6/10GPA \~ 1.8+/4 Germany equivalent.Full time work for 3 years as a Business Analyst/Decision Scientist (in India)**Areas of Masters Interest:** Data Science. Machine Learning.(This makes it a bit improbable since my B.Tech is in Mechanical Engineering and area of interest is in ML/DS, as German universities are restrictive in choosing with profiles that are not in their line of studies from the Bachelor's qualification, although work is in Data Analytics)

Now for the particular program in question,**Cons:**

* Fee - **30000Euros + Living Expense (2 years)** \- (I will need a student loan for the same)
* Course is by **Business School of RWTH** and not RWTH (How much of a difference can this make in placements, etc?)
* Very little info on course ranking - [https://ranking.zeit.de/che/en/studiengang/41904](https://ranking.zeit.de/che/en/studiengang/41904)
* Not a core Data science/ course but with moderate DS/ML courses (Although it is claimed to include placements as Data Scientists)

* **6 months mandatory Internship** as part of course curriculum (ample time to learn German before I graduate for work)

Hence, given my current profile do you think this will probably the best opportunity I can get to pursue my masters in Germany and to land a job here, especially since universities like TUM explicitly state that I am not eligible to apply to their Analytics/Data Science Program?

Please do feel free to add on to any other perspectives that I could be missing on when I consider this course as my entry to Germany especially since I will be dependent on a student loan for the same.

So recently I have got an offer to a (student) internship position for this summer, but it is most likely that my task won't be including any kind of 'coding' or 'programming'. It is a simple IT internship position whereas I will be assisting other employees to troubleshoot devices like printers, their laptops, etc. 

I am aiming to become a software engineer after graduation, and I have heard that to do so, it is fairly important to have programming experiences (a.k.a. coding projects). I was originally going to do some self-studies for some new programming languages or frameworks and actually work on some personal (programming) projects throughout the break before I got this internship offer (because I have only taken fundamental courses at my university up until now,) and actually try to build some apps or programs, but now I am having a hard time choosing between the two. 

Could working as an intern benefit me more even when it does not involve any kind of programming task? Just want to hear some opinions."

I have an eight month period where I will work either way but I'm currently doing a 4 month internship at a company and was offered a choice to extend this work term to 8 months. I'm not sure if I should stay at this company or do my next 4 month period at a different company/position. 

I heard 4 months isn't really enough time to get familiar with new tools and its better to do 8 months because you don't have to spend weeks retraining again. On the contrary, I heard two different 4 month internships look better on your resume because you have more space to fill and you also get to experience more positions/learn new tools. 

I would appreciate any input or advice for this. I have to make a decision as to whether I should accept my offer from another company or remain at this company. The position I have right now is a software developer position that focuses on writing python scripts and performing automated tests, and the position that I was offered from a different company is also a software developer position that focuses on writing with a mix of python and C/C++ 

The job I have right now is also my first internship in general. I am a 3rd year computer science student."

It was around the time when many businesses here in Norway started to move their stuff from physical locations to online services - everything from banks to government functions - and lots of people were starting to pick up their first PC out of necessity rather than interest.


I get to work and find that I have a build order for one of our basic PCs. I build it, test it, pack it up, and call the customers as they wanted to pick it up at the store.


I happened to be at the front desk when they came to pick it up, and it turned out to be an elderly couple so I offered to put everything in their car for them - those cheap steel boxes were heavy back then! Apparently they would get help to set it up at home.


Just as I'm about to leave work for the day I get called to the office and I'm told there's a problem with the computer I built earlier that day. The elderly couple is on the phone and I take the call:

Me: Hi, I heard you were having a problem with your new computer?

Them: Yes, you forgot to include the antenna!

Me: I... um, I am pretty sure there wasn't supposed to be an antenna? It didn't have wifi.. 

Them: There has to be, the computer says it isn't getting a signal! 

Me: Did you connect everything? Are all the lights on? Did you figure out all the cables?

Them: Yes, everything is connected, it's just not getting the signal!


I'm not a phone support guy, and this elderly couple does not appear to be sufficiently comfortable with this new contraption to go through troubleshooting by phone anyway. I also know it'll be a hassle for them to pack everything back up and return to the store (normal store procedure). I ask them where they live and it's not a terrible detour for my drive home so I offer to drop by and take a look.


When I get there everything looks fine at first glance - until I realize that the tower isn't anywhere to be found. Huh. The monitor is saying ""no signal"" because there's nothing - other than the mouse and keyboard plugged into the integrated USB hub - connected to it.


Me: Hey, uh, where's the PC?

Them: *blank stare*

Me: The big black box?

Them: Oh, so there *is* something missing?! 


I then remember that I carried everything to their car, put the monitor and accessories in the back seat, and put the PC itself in the trunk. I go out to their car, find the PC where I left it, and bring it inside. A couple of minutes later it's running and I get it connected to their internet service. I realize that they'll need a bit of a crash course to get started and I offer to show them how the basics work. They gladly accept, but insist on serving me dinner first. I got home pretty late that day, but I never charged them anything for it. The food was good, they were nice, and for years afterwards they'd send their friends and family to our shop to buy computers."

 It was hard but I could handle It, in the vacation after the semester ended I studied my ass off for ir, but alas fate said it wasn't meant to be, and the exam was postponed from march to may due to Covid.

 To be able to get the job, I had to at least have a college degree and that's without counting the other 300K  people (literally) going for It as well. I still had three left to graduate and for that I took 16 subjects(?)+ my thesis and an obrigatory internship in this semester, and the part that bugs me the most is that it would have worked out if the exam wasn't postponed, since my classes started in march as well and the start ain't ever that important.

 I just did the exam this Sunday and now I feel like shit. I had to juggle between so much that I couldn't do anything properly, right now I feel like I can't do shit and can't motivate myself to do anything. My meds were doing more bad than good, so i've been without them for a while as well.

I just feel so lost, like, I had to send my thesis on monday and yet, I haven't even did half of It, I mean, It ain't that hard to write It, but it's hard to get up my ass and do It. I slowly feel like i've been losing my mind, my motivation and I dread that soon I will reach somewhere I haven't been in a few years, and complete what I failed long ago on christmass 2017.

 My gf has been with me through It all, and although she can't help me in the way I need, she tries her best. For me and for her, I can't let myself fall further. I need to get over this, but how? Somedays it's hard to even get out of the bed.

 Idk if I will be able to pass all those subjects, If I will be able to pass the exam, if I will be able to keep my relationship due to how much i've fallen mentally and idk if I even see a sense in keeping trying so hard anymore"

I am a recent graduate (May 2021) from a top university. I entered into college as a biomedical engineering major and enjoyed some of the coding we did and picked up a computer science double major. For the longest time I was planning to go to graduate school, but recently I decided it wouldn't be a financially wise decision. In addition, I was facing a lot of mental health related issues and family issues my spring and fall semester of my senior year resulting in my final GPA dropping to 3.3. Long story short, I decided to enter the software job market really late (like last month) and have been applying to many junior software engineer and entry level positions. I have also been studying leetcode and systems design, while I apply around.

I have 1 internship where I was working as an R&amp;D engineer, developing some ML algorithms coding in Python and utilizing a fair amount of SQL. I also have also been working on a health tech start-up with some friends since my junior year and have learned quite a bit about full-stack software engineering. Although I don't think software companies care, I also have 2 published works and 1 technical patent, from research projects.

My problem seems to be I don't get any replies from most companies I apply to, presumably because most of the new grad positions are already filed (or my resume is trash). Last week, I was contacted by a recruiter of a small company (my LinkedIn has open to work) inquiring if I was interested in an associate web developer job. I just went along with the process and interviewed at the firm. I interviewed the next week and was then given an offer. The company works with .NET (C#), React native, and some mobile frameworks. I'm not sure which team I am assigned to but, the company essentially builds software tools for other industrial oriented companies.

The offer is $60k/yr ($3k signing bonus) with standard benefits (insurance, PTO, etc.) and the job is located in Raleigh, NC. This seems pretty low for the Raleigh area, but according to some friends it I manageable. Most of my friends who are CS major are incoming SWEs at FAANG companies making 90k+, making me feel like this offer is too low. Additionally, the company seems to have bad Glassdoor reviews (2.0/5) saying that the management/training is bad and hours are long for the salary. However, I also feel like one of by big problems is a lack of formal software engineering experience, which working at this firm for a year or two could help fix. The only fear I have is whether working at this company will pigeonhole me into not being competitive  at companies like FAANG. Is this true (I don't know how common it I for people to hop around companies)?

I am a pretty motivated person who is currently getting into competitive programming, open source development, and learning new frameworks to improve my resume and interview skills. Does anyone have any advice about whether I should take the offer, keep applying, or what?

Thanks!"

I also have an insultingly low GPA.

Now, I know this sub's users are high calibre students with great projects and internships under their belt and accomplished engineers and software professionals and it may be extremely hard or impossible to reach that level but I want to be atleast a decent software developer.

I have been learning Java for sometime now but then I realised that Java is mainly used at larger tech companies like FAANG , enterprises and banks. And there is no way I am getting an internship or job at these companies due to my very low GPA, mediocre profile, no Competitive programming and because only a few mass recruiters visit my college for placements.

From what I have read on this sub, startups are the only ones who don't care for GPA and only want good coders but DSA is probably required here too. The issue is almost startups I see hire for MERN or Python/Django or occasionally, other ""newer"" stacks.

So, would it be a bad idea to continue with Java? Should I switch to learning JS or Python?

TL;DR Most startups and smaller companies hire for MERN or Python stacks, should I ditch Java and start learning JS or Python instead?"

I have been thinking a lot about what direction I want to go after my study. I have looked at tech and consultancy companies, however working for a bank seems more interesting to me. I have however only followed one finance course. People I have spoken to who currently work at bank in the data and analytics field (eg data scientist position), told me my background should be sufficient. 

I’m worried since there doesn’t seem to be a lot of vacancies as data scientist or data analyst at banks. Is there a way to increase my chances at getting hired when a position opens up? 

My grades are good so far. I have done some teaching and research assistant jobs, however no practical experience since I had to help out at my mums restaurant every evening. My bachelor also did not give me enough time to do an internship (also not common/required) so I did my thesis within academics. 

I will be moving to Stockholm in August for my second year. I was thinking about getting a student job at a bank during first semester, and an internship during the second in combination with my master thesis. And hopefully, after graduation work at a bank (in The Netherlands) full time. Is this feasible? I’m namely afraid I won’t even get the chance to do so. 

Moreover, I noticed a lot of banks offered traineeships. What would be the differences between traineeship and entree-level job? I have heard as trainee you receive more guidance and also support in terms of personal development. Is there a big difference in salary? Are you guaranteed to work there after the traineeship? 

Someone who is working / has worked at a bank in The Netherlands with a CS background that can share some experiences with me? What other industry would be similar? Insurance companies? 

I’m someone who likes stability and regular working hours. I don’t mind doing similar tasks every day. I prefer to work with Python, R, and SAS and I’m willing to work with other softwares such as Tableau, Power BI etc. which I have seen mentioned few times in vacancies."
nm5m13,8,2021-05-27,How internships are shaping the career of engineering students,Wise_Contribution770,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/nm5m13/how_internships_are_shaping_the_career_of/,"When it comes to, employability we have seen the significant issues faced by engineering students due to the lack of skills required by the Industry.

Engineering students lack practical knowledge and experience in the job domain, and students' credibility is accessed based on the training or internship they have done during their academics.

Many organizations allow students to learn, work, and get experience while pursuing their academics to address the issue. The students who're applying for the internship program are getting better career opportunities as they're getting polished in the skills and be ready for Industry.

The USP of Internships Programs for Engineering Students.

&amp;#x200B;

* Understand Industry and its requirements.
* Work on real projects
* Learn from the expertise leaders
* Develop inter and Intra Personal skills
* Get guidance on Industry placement
* Above all, Internships Program helps students to get accustomed to the work environment and culture and the experience to add- to their resumes.

**How to select the Internship Program or Organisation for the Internships?**

Many organizations show interest and hire pursuing students to work as interns in their organization and provide them with pre-placement/ stipend/ certificate that will help in future endeavors. Still, as it says, there are other cons that students should be careful of and shouldn't get trap in such fake organizations.

Though it looks lucrative, many organizations are just provided internships on collecting hefty sums or promising placements after completing the training or internships. Therefore, engineering students should stay away from such an organization.

The best way to select or apply for Internships

Initially, you should approach the college cell to find any internship Programs for students or tie-ups with organizations. Still, many colleges didn't have that resources or association in that case, you should start looking outside your college.

The students should research the organization's background authenticity before applying for it and learn or get advice from their peers and follow their recommendations.

Find an organization that focuses on training you rather than taking out the work from you.

Go through the Internship Program prospectus or read the terms and conditions applicable for Interns during the Internships Programs; this will save you from working extra hours or merely doing the odd works that are in no way related to your interest field.

Select the domain you're interested in and find the organization that's providing an internship in that particular domain, and apply for it. For instance, computer science or IT students should look for internships in IoT, AI and ML, Data Analytics, etc., whereas Electronic students in Robotics, PCB Design, Industrial Automation, etc.

Online Internships Opportunity:

Due to pandemics, everything has become digitalize even the work from home is the next adapted thing by the people or organization.

It's an excellent opportunity for students to get in touch for work or learn from the expertise and starts applying without any further delays.

**Paid vs. Unpaid Internships- to choose from**

The primary objective is to learn and gain experience; hence the engineering students should focus on learning rather than on earning.

Paid Internships come with many responsibilities and stress out the students in a way they're obliged to do work in the allocated time, which affects their studies. In addition, the organization that hires the students focuses on driving the work from them rather than training them.

We suggest or recommend students to go for learning and unpaid internships as it's not bound them to employability and flexibility, they can learn and work parallelly with ease."

Looking for any advice &amp; insight would be greatly appreciated.

Background:  Full time at a wealth management firm that I know I do not want to  stay. Doing part time masters in accounting at a known state school.  About one year away from graduation so long as nothing unexpected  happens with class.

Accepted an  offer as an audit intern at a big four, however just recently I have  also been given an offer by a national/mid size firm for an associate  position &amp; the ability to work as an intern prior to my anticipated  start date. The biggest difference right away from the offers given  between the b4 and the national firm is the starting salary. The  difference is $8,000 more in favor of the national firm. The benefits  also seem better, especially PTO &amp; 401k. However, this associate  position is a tax position, the firm does not do audit. I might have  given away which firm. And I guess another thing would be that for the  b4 offer, I do not know if I will even receive a FT offer, and if I  receive a FT offer, the anticipated start date would be in 2023. This  would give me a solid year for me to attempt my CPA without any worries  if I choose the b4. I guess the downside is the uncertainly of the FT  offer, and not working for a year. Money is a concern, but I have  figured out that I can adjust to not being paid for that year.

My  concerns are primary I've been told the resources &amp; experiences at a  b4 is unmatched, the exit opportunity for audit is also better. And  that it's easier to move from audit to tax than it is the opposite. I do  not know if I like tax or audit better, since I don't have any  experience at all. So I am currently unsure of what I intend to do.  Renege on my accepted offer to b4 and join this firm, or accept the  lower salary and benefits for the prestige. Looking for any insights  would be great. Appreciate it.

Thanks!"

I'm sorry if that kinda makes me sound like a jerk but I'm not. I like my boss and my coworkers and I have a strong work ethic. I don't want to let them down or make things hard

At this current job I run the marketing department for a small start up. I've been asking for an intern or coop or some kind of help for months because there's so much to do and I can't stay on top of it all myself. Lots of stress and late nights just staying on top of things here

We finally hired someone, a junior marketer starting on next Tuesday and I have just received an offer for basically my dream job. It's bad timing but I didn't go looking or anything, my former manager just went to a new company and they need a UX designer. They sent me a great offer with a good salary bump and comparable benefits after only 1 call and a portfolio

They asked me for the timeline of when I want to start but they did say they are looking for someone to come on board ASAP

I don't want to leave them high and dry with only a Jr marketer who has been there for 2 weeks and J want time to train the new guy so he can at least be helpful on his own til they replace my job 

If I had my perfect way, I would start on the first week of July. I could wait until next Friday to give my notice to my boss so he isn't slammed with new employee and that at the same time or right before, then 3 weeks and a small break before starting

But I don't want to risk losing this opportunity because I will take to long to start!

I would never give less than a 2 week notice but what about more? Is it fair to ask for that? Will they just take back the offer? What should I say?"

However, despite me having had my license since August and having practiced frequently with my parents during high school and when I’m home from college, they do not feel comfortable letting me drive the car by myself since they do not want to risk me wrecking it before I need to take it to my internship. My dad will also be staying in an Airbnb with me near the internship location, since my parents do not believe I can drive well enough on my own and want my dad to be there to practice with me (he’s working remotely still due to COVID, and will continue working remotely this summer, so this does not affect his job).

I also can’t drive with my mom in the car at all, since she freaks out really easily in response to minor things that she perceives as wrong that I and even more experienced drivers (like my dad) do, even when it’s not actually wrong. So the only times I can drive are when my dad and only my dad is in the car with me, which really limits my driving opportunities (it also prevents me from driving my family to any of the places we go together, since my mom would need to be in the car).

This wouldn’t really affect me that much except for the fact it means I can’t get away from my parents and am stuck at home with them 24/7 for multiple consecutive weeks when I’m at home from college (this would not affect me as much if my mom did not come from a dysfunctional family that yelled all the time and, consequently, she freaks out and yells very easily, too).

I’ve talked with a friend and my therapist about this to get their input, and they both believe my parents are being controlling and are worried that my first time driving alone will likely be in new, unfamiliar territory (we agreed that I can drive myself more once we’re at the location of my internship). Even my great-aunt questioned why my parents wouldn’t let me drive myself to her house when she noticed my car wasn’t there when I visited the other day.

At this point, the only person I feel comfortable discussing this with is my therapist (my friend unfortunately became extremely worried to the point where she was shaking and had to step away, and I don’t want to put her through that again).

What (if anything) do you think I could do in this situation? I currently feel kind of trapped and like I can’t do anything about it, since my parents are helping pay for the car, though I’d appreciate any input you could give."

First of all, thanks for taking the time to look at this post! I'm a student studying for my undergrad in CS and I've become worried about getting a job after I graduate, particularly after seeing posts where the OP has submitted hundreds of applications, received only had a handful of interviews, and still hasn't seen a job offer. I haven't found the time/motivation to start any side projects, I'm not exactly sure where I want to specialize, I don't have any internship experience yet, and I've got about 1.5 years until I graduate. Needless to say, I think my chances of success for finding a job soon after graduation are weak at this point.

Fortunately, I've picked up on some of the insightful comments many of you have made on posts in this subreddit since I joined a week or so ago. All of this along with some things I've read on here has lead me to some questions, which I hope some of you can help me understand the answers to:

1. It's becoming more apparent to me that choosing where to specialize in CS could be one of the best things I could do to prepare for a job. What resources are out there that could help me learn more about different specializations I could do? Is there any benefit to me trying to generalize my skills or should I focus on one specific area in my free time?
2. Once I have an idea of what I might specialize in, it seems like doing side projects will be a good way to strengthen my resume/GitHub. Is it better to do these projects totally independent? Or are open source projects better to participate in? Would it be valuable to an employer to see that I've collaborated with one or more people in creating something? I understand that the answers here could depend on what specialization I go for.
3. I'm hoping to qualify for some sort of internship next spring/summer. Should I take any internship I'm offered even if it doesn't align with the specialization I decide on? If I'm unsuccessful at getting an internship, what are some of the best ways to compensate for not having experience to speak of on my resume? 
4. Any other last tips or advice you've got for an undergrad student? I'm sincerely open to any input or feedback.

Thanks for your time, I apologize if a lot of these questions are too commonplace for a dedicated post. The FAQ section was helpful, but I was hoping to have some back and forth dialogue for follow up questions."
nm9l5y,1,2021-05-27,Is it time for me to give up my career dreams?,risottohoe,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/nm9l5y/is_it_time_for_me_to_give_up_my_career_dreams/,"I have known what I wanted to do for a career since I was in high school. (Without being too specific, my career is in Parks &amp; Rec/Hospitality Management). It’s something I really love and enjoy. I went to college and did three internships to get the experience and everything. Graduated with honors, all that. 

But things have been a struggle for me ever since graduating college. I started applying for jobs before graduating. I didn’t get a job in my career until a year and a half after graduating. And it was part time. After applying to 300+ jobs. 

Got a full time job after that finally a few months later. Only had that job for a year and a half until COVID hit and I was laid off. It’s been about a year since I was laid off and still don’t have a job in my career. I’ve applied and interviewed, applied and interviewed, and just nothing. 

I will say my standards are a little bit higher this time around, like I just want to make a livable wage (crazy I know). 

But I’m just wondering if this is the universe giving me a sign?! Like am I not meant to do this? I feel so lost and sad because this is the only thing I’m truly passionate about.  

Can someone give me their thoughts?"
nm9p8m,12,2021-05-27,Turns out teaching is the first job that doesn’t give me anxiety,Empathicrobot21,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/nm9p8m/turns_out_teaching_is_the_first_job_that_doesnt/,"I flagged this obsession sharing, because I’ve been writing this for an hour to get it off my chest and it turned into a love letter to my new job and teaching. 



It’s been two weeks at my new job and I really need to share this. You might know that gnawing feeling inside when you have to get a new job? All the anxiety, frustration, inability to communicate your needs to work well. I started as a waitress November 19 and I was so anxious I would be that mix of slug and waitress, too afraid to do anything wrong and get scolded at (luckily, this prevented most accidents. Crossing my fingers). I liked my colleagues a lot, which makes the job still enjoyable, but I was always praying to the gods, please don’t make me drop the plates on people lol. 

So, I wanted to be a teacher ever since I had my first history lesson with 12. Apparently, after a few weeks I came home one day, upset, and told my mom of my new plans so ‚i could do it better than them‘. I am a huge history nerd, I just cannot help it, I’m constantly daydreaming about how it must have felt like to have lived someTIME else. I did my fair share of wavering about my plans for adult life, but after a detour to veterinary medicine, I ended up studying English and history to become a teacher (Germany). I’m graduating next semester, finally, and will start my advanced training at a school after that (which is about 18 months and ends with another graduation for second state exam). 

I love studying history so much and the prof that basically teaches us how to teach history and plan lessons is, in my eyes, a legit genius. He was too smart to be a teacher himself, so he went one step further. His system is amazing. It gives students the tools and precise skills to discuss advanced questions of history. 
What it means for me, additionally: I can basically do everything that interests me, break it down into an appropriate format, add in the interests of students, and I turn my classroom into a space to share whatever interesting I stumbled upon, a question I asked myself and would like to discuss, or even projects that I’d like to do myself and can realise with these kids. 

But I was always afraid I wouldn’t be up to the task. That my brain would scramble, that the bees would buzz even louder. Anxiety, nervousness, frustration. 
What if students would notice what a mess I am? What if colleagues would see how hard I am working only to keep it organised? What if I start teaching and i just cannot do it? 

Boy, I was almost furious with myself from anxiety when I took a job two weeks ago, subbing at a school I had already done some lessons with a group of other students from uni (it’s a module literally teaching in class with your prof and 4 people. Back then, I did really, really well. So I was thinking ‘at least you wont have to get anxiety over worrying of not finding the door the first day’. Off I go into school then. I’ve been doing rather well the past few months and that certainly helps. But as soon as I started my first day with teaching my very first unsupervised lessons, I was free of all of my fears. I cannot put it into other words, it is just that: I think this job is everything I’ve dreamed of. 

Don’t get me wrong. I know this is just the start. There’s so much more to come. I mean I’m just subbing. I’m not even dealing with parents, tests, injury, paper work and the like yet. But I just think I can do it, you know? I will take it day by day. I will have bad days. I will have days where I feel uncomfortable. I can see now though, that those are just bumps in the road. Because let me tell me about my absolute favourite thing about teaching:

No one is supervising me. I can follow my gut. I can be as innovative as I want, I can be as boring as I want. If I have an off day, working on a text it is. If I am a little scatterbrained, I will be able to explain to the kids that in terms that a few of them may very well understand. And I think if I find the right school for me, my colleagues will, too. 
I can also be flexible. I have to work on me being too impulsive still. As of now, most my lessons are a little chaotic. But there’s another thing: I do not mind. I know the difference between enthusiastic chaos and destructive chaos. And if it ever comes to that, I have no doubt I will handle that as well. 
I like to work in the same environments everyday, as I’ve learned. I see the same faces, I see people I like (which is worth more than the few faces I might some day not like as much). I absolutely love talking to kids and teens, they’re so confused and basically nothing they do is actually aimed at you. I was afraid of this as well- but I can see very clearly now, that most of the kids I teach (6 different classes so far) seem to like me. I encourage them to come talk to me after class if they want to share something. Cannot wait for the day someone actually comes to ask about the excavation I was part of during an internship. I know the day will come! 

So, in summary: I am living my dream. I have never been this happy. All my hard work paid off so far."

nma0b8,5,2021-05-27,An Early Profile Review for CS and ML PhD (Please Help!),ml12358,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/nma0b8/an_early_profile_review_for_cs_and_ml_phd_please/,"Hi there! I'm a rising junior at a T10 CS school (UIUC) and I'm wanting to apply to grad programs next fall. I'd really appreciate some advice from successful admits about what I can do over the next 1.5 years to strengthen my chances at T10 programs. As of now, my interest lies in Natural Language Processing and ML

**School/Major:** UIUC, BS in Statistics and Computer Science (essentially a CS major with Stats minor)

**Potential ""Hooks"":** Female in STEM (but I'm Asian so definite ORM?)

**GPA:** 3.9; All A's and A+s in my CS/Stats classes, but 1 C in Calculus 3 freshman year.

**GRE (based on 1 practice test):** 167 Verbal, 165 Quant

**Research:** Unfortunately I have not done much; I'll be starting a [structured year-long AI research program](https://www.c3sr.com/post/2019/20190114_urai/) this fall that should lead to at least a project presentation and possibly a publication? We get to choose projects for this and I'd like to match with someone working in ML or NLP. I'm also going to be doing research with another professor (also NLP), not sure how publications and stuff work for that.

**Work Experience:** Don't think this matters as much, but I worked as a Data Science Intern 2 summers ago (NLP and Text Mining) and will be doing a SWE Internship at a top Bank this summer.

**Possible Letters of Rec:** 1st one would probably come from the professor who supervises me for the AI research program. 2nd one probably from the other NLP professor. I'm not quite sure about the 3rd one, there is a Statistics professor I've done project based work under that might be a good option?

Right now my ""list"" tentatively consists of most of the T10 (US News), Purdue, and UW Madison. I'm also planning on applying for CMU's ML PhD (that would probably be the dream). Would I have any ""advantage"" when it comes to UIUC PhD admissions since I go here for undergrad?

I really have no clue how competitive or uncompetitive I am for programs like this. I'd realllyyyy appreciate advice from people who've been through the process and come out the other side. Should I go for a thesis MS first to build my research profile? Thank you so much!"

nmb30x,2,2021-05-27,I would love to be on your career panel...,urbanlegendary2014,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/nmb30x/i_would_love_to_be_on_your_career_panel/,"...But I don't actually have a career.

I got my college degree a few years ago. As part of the program, I had to do an internship. My internship co-workers were pretty awesome. I really liked them and I was sad when I had to move on but, again, needed a career. They weren't hiring full-time.

I got a job in my field. I burnt out hard. I got another job in my field and burnt out even harder. I got diagnosed with ADHD.

When I was diagnosed, I still had my last job. Since being diagnosed, I realized I made a huge mistake, the job was not ADHD-friendly (so boring, so many rules, mountains of work in all different directions). None of my jobs had been. During the pandemic, with work from home being too much, I quit. But I vowed, with my diagnosis, that *this time* I would find a job that worked well for me.

I've been applying to jobs since last October. I even did a certification program, because I wanted to go further in the field and look good to employers. None of it was easy. The degree wasn't easy. Right now, I am having a really hard time with it. But I needed a career.

To keep myself sane and likely as the result of lifelong ADHD, I have some antiwork views. I believe that people shouldn't be defined (by others or by themselves) by their productivity or their labor. Your career doesn't make you a better person than anyone else - this is nonsense designed to keep us all constantly competing over jobs while the employer profits. I believe that workplaces are not accommodating to ADHD and, frankly, I don't see how they could ever be at their core.

Being productive is the goal of work. ADHD is the opposite of any goals or productivity. I understand if this view makes me ""lazy"" or if I'm ""using my disorder as an excuse"". I also recognize that I need to work to exist in society. All of this is how I feel - it's super contradictory. I want to work to be valued by society but I realize I'm not ""good"" at work by the nature of my disorder. ""Employment"" itself isn't a goal to strive toward, being a full person who can take care of myself is.

So, why is it that, when my internship folks reached out to have me on their career panel, I feel this crappy about it? I'm not embarrassed to not have a job. I'm doing all the work I can to figure out this disorder and what can make me successful, as I define it. I know I need to work and need a career. I don't have any kids so there is no excuse, other than I'm not very good at working. I'm doing my best to reconcile my feelings about work with this disease.

But... today feels really bad, man. I've been crying for a few hours now. I'm going to have to tell my internship folks I can't do the panel. I don't have a career. Still really need one, still hoping to have one, still hoping to someday find some peace between work and ADHD... But it's not here yet. I'm doing everything I can, applying to hundreds of jobs, been on 20+ interviews, even had a job offer I couldn't take (it was only temporary remote in another state and I can't move because of my SO's work). But I don't have a career.

I think I'm ashamed. My internship boss was a really positive person. They really brought out the best in people and want to help people succeed. They are good at it. Some really successful people have done this internship. But I'm not one of them. It's not their fault... it's mine.

I realize all of this is eff'd. I doubt I'll even feel bad about it in a few hours, once I've posted this shit and sent the email rejecting being on the panel. What am I even going to tell them? I just need to keep my head down, keep applying, keep making fun of all of this stupid job search BS until I get something. Hell, I could get a job offer today for all I know.

I wish things were different. I am fully vaccinated and ready to get back out there after isolating hard this past year+. I wanted to see my internship co-workers after the pandemic - again, they were cool people and I'm glad they're all okay, so this panel would have been a good opportunity to catch up. One of the people I worked with even got her Master's - I wanted to congratulate her in person.

But it's not going to happen. Because I don't have a career. And that's the only thing that matters ever, right? What's the point of talking to people or existing if you don't (or can't) work? Pariah on society for life, that's me. I guess. For now.

I'm gonna be okay. There's actually job stuff I have to do today. But... this stupid disorder makes it so hard to exist. No one takes it seriously, not even me. I don't understand why I don't have a career. I've done everything I was ""supposed"" to do, degree, certification, experience. It was crazy hard and I hated every second of it. I'm not bad at job applications, I'm not bad at interviews. I just suck, as a person, at doing anything and this makes me so freaking crazy I feel like smashing things. It's not my fault - except for the part where it is? Like no one else can help, it's gotta be on me...

This post is getting too long. My thoughts are exactly like this post, too - just complete, non-stop, utter self-pitying nonsense. I know everyone here probably feels similarly about work. Hell, my problems with employment were the reason I got diagnosed in the first place. Did \*sO gOoD\* in college because I enjoyed my degree. Actually got 100% in my certification program, that's how much I liked it. But I'm a terrible employee. I really am. I feel bad about not being able to do the panel but I don't feel bad about not working... it's an exercise in frustration for both me and my employer. Just.

Ugh. Whatever. **TL; DR:** An internship program I did during college contacted me about being on their career panel. Post-college, I have no career, not even a job right now. I'm not ashamed but I totally am ashamed of not having a job. I have ADHD. These factors, compounded by the general shittiness of everything, have turned me into a crazy person and I cannot stop crying, or start working on my job stuff today. I probably need to go back to therapy but therapy won't fix my nonexistent career... It will just get me to stop posting ridiculously long diatribes on the internet because I can bore my therapist in person now. Like I bored all of you.

Can anyone post something nice in the comments, please? I don't care if it's unrelated to the post, just something positive today would be super. Stories of pets and cute animals would be ideal."

It’s my 3rd day and they’ve assigned me a project for a client using software I have zero experience with. It’s a small company so I thought they’d be more hands on, but they just gave me material without explaining what to do and asked me to get started. Everytime I ask for help (let me remind you it’s my t h i r d day with hardly any training or shadowing), I get told everyone is too busy, or the person who is working the full time position of what I’m interning for comes to help me and leaves seconds later saying they’re busy. I know google is a solution but with the company laptop they gave me I have zero admin rights so I can’t do half the work I’m supposed to do. This is so frustrating, has anyone else experienced this situation?? How do I express that I’m not comfortable running and leading a project within my first week with little to no supervision.

Due to various reasons, including health and lazyness, i took far too long for my bachelors degree in IT, around 7 years.
I am now close to the end, 3 exams to go and a necessary internship. In my time, i however did do nothing to improve my CV and now need to improve my chances to get interviews and be taken somewhat seriously in the coming weeks and months. Some applications are already out, including an interview next week, but i have put severall of them on hold in order to improve my cv before applying. I am stationed in Frankfurt / Germany.

My current skills are mostly in java (and many student jobs are for java developers), some skill in cpp and c#, and the smaller things picked up in university courses, mysql, scrum, some batch, theoretical knowledge in testing (voluntary course) and the general theoretical stuff.

The last few days i have learned some git/hub, refreshed my java knowledge and am now looking into  multi threads.
After that my current goals are.

-Docker.

-Aws / lamda, both based on the free code camp courses.

-unit testing with junit (for now based on random internet tutorials).

-Design patterns (based on head first design patterns).

-Algorithms in java (including one of my missing courses) and statistics with r, my last 2 courses.

What do you think do companies value most (Of those topics, and other things), that i can learn to improve my chances, mostly things that can be learned to a beginners niveau in a few weeks / a month.

And do you think learning such topics to improve my cv, doing smaller projects based on the limited knowledge that i have,  or doing code challenges give me the best chances?"
nmd3xi,7,2021-05-27,[Sophomores &amp; Freshmen] How NOT to miss the good Extracurriculars,slime_college,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/nmd3xi/sophomores_freshmen_how_not_to_miss_the_good/,"Writing as a person who cried a river after joining this subreddit a bit too late as a senior and figuring out that the deadlines for all the good summer programs have passed.

Extracurriculars were seriously one of the things that stressed me out the most. When I first joined this subreddit as a Junior, I was shocked at how everyone seemed to be aware of the good summer programs and devastated that I wasn't.

The ECs that I wanted the most were: internship (research), Pre-college (the free ones), and competitions. Here are all the info I have:

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Internship &amp; research: start preparing at least 3 months ahead**

Things needed: LOR, Transcript, and essay

Generally, internships &amp; research opportunities are for students over 11th grade (juniors &amp; seniors) and take place during Summer. They mostly require a letter of recommendation, essay, official transcript, and more, so you should be prepared in advance. Some activities even ask for pre-requisite, asking students to take specific courses in their high school in advance in order to participate in the activity.

Sending all the documents and check if you meet the pre-requisite is not easy work. Talk to the teachers and let them help you throughout the application process and send the documents.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Pre-college: The good ones are mostly free, and they open in Fall.**

Things needed: LOR, Transcript, and essay

Most of the selective pre-college programs open their application **during the fall semester of the year before and close in March.** However, if you are open to other pre-college programs that are less selective (~~and ask for like $5,000 haha~~), many of them accept the application upon May.

Prestigious and free pre-college programs mostly require you to submit online applications, letters of recommendation, essays, official transcripts, and more, so you should be prepared in advance. Talk to the teachers and let them help you throughout the application process and send the documents.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Competition: Some colleges actually ask for it.**

Some of the most renowned competitions (that do not cost much and actually let you learn things and help you in the App procedure), most require you to prepare in advance. For example, you can prepare for National Chemistry Olympiad, by looking through previous questions and taking mock tests. For some of them, you can only participate as a team.

Some colleges ask students to write their accomplishments in national-level competitions if they have one. These are of course not necessary, but definitely helps students to demonstrate their competence and interest in certain field of study.

These are examples: 

AIME (Yale, Carnegie Mellon, Columbia), AMC (Yale, Carnegie Mellon, Columbia), AOIEM (Carnegie Mellon)

&amp;#x200B;

I'll bring some quality extracurricular activities for sophomores with some tips and info to be prepared for them maybe in my next post!"

nmegzk,1,2021-05-27,Job Gap After College then Filled With Irrelevant Pursuits. Now double guessing and really have trouble guessing if I'm at all fit to land an engineering job.,Pranosaurus,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/nmegzk/job_gap_after_college_then_filled_with_irrelevant/,"I graduated June 2020, with a Mechanical &amp; Aerospace Engineering Degree.

Okay GPA (\~3.59 from UCI),

While I was in college I had a few stints with a few senior projects my last 2 years and kind of got pushed into dummy roles in each of them, one in FSAE as a powertrain engineering where I made some designs, all of which were thrown out, one in Rocket where I pretty much ended up playing with CAD drawings and assemblies and looking at catalogs for parts, and another where I worked in a wind tunnel lab (kind of hard to fill in all my roles here) and I was already in a mussive rut when I started here after failing internship searches and had trouble making meaningful contributions. I found classes interesting but never had very much of a sense of direction.  I had some personal projects involving simple stuff with arduinos, all which the final product failed. 

Worked in a Machine Shop for a few months for minimum wage,  I have had perpetual troubles and depression about job searching to the point where its hard to stay motivated and my state is/was kind of humiliating as hell. I wasn't getting much meaningful experience here, 

I then decided in an extremely bold and probably stupid move that I'm going to quit and live with my parents for the remainder of the pandemic and pursuit effectively a Web-Dev skillset via self-learning from youtube University (some frontend (React/Redux/Flutter), backend(basic stuff) , and some basics in dev ops (Docker/Kubernetes/AWS) and system design(database engineering, distributed system basics, etc.) ). In summary, just completely non-overlapping skills with what my degree is in and which I had next to 0 background knowledge in. This has been a pretty terribly unsuccessful pursuit, although I've learned some stuff I really,  I pretty much had a very desperate and impatient approach to learning which has kind of massively sabotaged long-term progress. I pretty much have a handful of half baked projects for my portfolio at this point. Kind of feel like the desperation of the last few years in the job hunt has turned me into a shell of my former self. 

The Crux of What I'm Wondering

I felt at the point of making the switch decision that with a job gap that it would be irreversible and kind of hard to land anything in Mechanical unless I decided to pursue a Masters which I would prefer not to do without a sense of direction. I kind of just wanted honest opinions of this since I'm really wondering if I should buy a 3D printer, build some stuff and finish previously failed projects, and pursue further solidworks certificates (CSWP, etc.) or if this seems kind of a dead pursuit at this point. I know there's not really a concrete answer but are the odds reasonable. Because I simply do not know how there is any chance I would be hired over recent graduates and especially those with internships, I've heard success stories of people finding jobs years after graduation but I'm really wondering how you would ever beat an applicant pool without some kind of connection, I'd like to believe it but it just doesn't sound reasonable"

Please lmk if some of these activities mean nothing to my college application and also pls give some suggestions to make my summer more productive... Also, I haven't visited any colleges yet. Please suggest me some colleges to visit and apply my stats are below:

**Demographics**: Male, Asian (Indian), MS, public HS but pretty competitive, middle class

**Intended major**: Computer Science or Software Engineering or astrophysics

**Academics**:

**ACT**: 28 (31 Math, 32 Science, 25 English, 23 Reading) I'll retake to improve my English and reading to 28-31. Pushing my act score to a 31-33.

**PSAT/NMSQT**: 1270 (700 Math and 570 EBRW) only missed 3 on the whole math section idk the curve was kinda trash

**GPA**: 4 out of 5 and 3.2 out of 4

This is because when I came to the US the first quat was already completed and my teacher gave me a 0 for that quat, and I did not know much about the American educational system then.

**AP scores**: AP Chem and AB Calc expecting a 5, but the scores aren't out.

**Sophomore courses**: Pre calc (Algebra 3) 98%, Hons Algebra 2 98%, Hons Chemistry 100%, Hons US History (I didn't know AP version existed) 99%, Eng 2 92%, Programming Fundamentals 99%, Engineering 93%, Geography 97%, and Health 95%

Programing fundamentals is basically one sem worth of college-level web development, also given by local community college.

**Junior courses**: AP Calc AB, AP Chemistry, French 1, Photography 1&amp;2, Physics 1 (AP phy isn't offered), MS studies, Eng 3, and ACT prep (My grades are kinda wack this bc of covid and online learning but they are A's)

(I actually know 2 Languages apart from English but they aren't given at my HS and I am proficient at them)

**Senior courses (probably)**: AP Calc BC, AP Bio, AP CompSci, French 2, College and Career readiness, English 4, Drivers ed, AP US Government (I don't have enough hours for other courses bc my school has given me a few mandatory courses to graduate)

**EC**: engineering class (2 years as of now), NTHS and NHS Membership, around 20 credit hours for tutoring, Debate novice semifinalist, Nominated to take National Chemistry Olympiad (yet to be taken), Participating in ""codemiss"" a free coding workshop given by graduate students from Ole Miss, hosted Hour of Code at a local store, on the Honor roll for every quat from 10th grade, and a star student for Alg3 and Hons US History in my sophomore year. Star student in Photography 2 junior year. (Please give me some tips to improve on this area)

**Awards**: MTA Certification for Exam 98-383 and Exam 98-382 (These are given Microsoft); 2 Gold medals, 1 Silver medal, and 1 Bronze medal for sci olympiad (only for 1 year); Completed ""Introduction to Calculus"" by University of Sydney 95%; Completed ""Stanford Introduction to food and health"" by Stanford University 100%. Won some state and national level aeromodelling and robotics competitions while I was in India (was recognized by a Boeing representative in India).

**Essay/LOR**: I haven't really started any essays, but they will be decent. LOR's are great!

nmfbd3,7,2021-05-27,What would my job title be?,among_shadows,InformationTechnology,https://www.reddit.com/r/InformationTechnology/comments/nmfbd3/what_would_my_job_title_be/,"Very weird question, I know, but let me explain why I'm asking. To make a long story short, I worked my way up at a charter school, starting as an intern. Previously, the school was outsourcing their IT services, but now, I am the ""IT guy"" of the school. I am starting to find a new job, and someone will be hired to replace me. I have been asked to create a job description of what I do with a job title. However, I've only been known as, or call myself, the ""IT guy"". What would be my official job title?

- I am over the network and network devices, including router, switches, access points, and IP phones.
- I keep inventory and maintain school-owned computers, and other IOT devices.
- I act as tech support to all teachers and students.
- I talk with technology vendors that service the school.
- I maintain email accounts and other local user accounts.
- I am not over anyone, and the only person above me is the principal of the school."

Is it safe to put it on my resume as “software engineer” or is this a bad idea?"

With this in mind, I was planning to take a summer course so that I can be on track to graduate next year without having to take a 5 class quarter.

I just spoke with the CTO who is also going to be my supervisor regarding my schedule and he says that 20 hours is just the minimum and some people put in 30-40 hours a week. 

What's interesting is that I interviewed with the CMO and suggested that I could work past the 20 hour limit if needed and she reminded me that the internship is part time at 20 hours a week.

Should i go with my supervisor's suggestion of 30 to 40 hours a week? If yes, is it too much to take a summer course along with the internship? Would just putting in the minimum(20 hours) be a bad look?"
nmh3av,4,2021-05-27,A long time friend's disgusting betrayal,SeconDairyACownt,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/nmh3av/a_long_time_friends_disgusting_betrayal/,"Scroll down to the line for TLDR, kinda. 

We have been close for about four years now. For the sake of this story, I’ll \[21 F\] call him Ben \[21 M\]. 

Back when he came to my high school in sophomore year, I picked up on something a little off about Ben. It wasn’t too much different than the majority of my friend group, but he gravitated to some of the people I had learned to steer clear from. He was excessively obnoxious and loud and had no social skills, and I was wary of him. I can’t explicitly say if he is on the spectrum, but I am, so I’d say I’m a decent judge of that. So, all the more reason to be understanding and overlook the quirks as time went on.

Ben integrated into my regular friend group, and I slowly got to hang out with this person more. I would be the slowest to warm up to him, but ultimately come out to be one of his closest friends, and he one of mine. 

Early on, I noticed another particular quirk that absolutely irked me. He was a compulsive liar. He would lie about little things. With such ease. For instance, to spice up a story. I would always call him out. He didn’t like it, it probably made him feel vulnerable or something. I remember telling him that it doesn’t help a story to lie, and he wouldn’t be able to get away with it around me anyway. I can read somebody like a book in 14 pt font.

I noticed that bad habit start to slow down over the years. I watched this person grow a little bit. Indeed he was more mature than most people. Or maybe down-to-earth is a better word, he was an absolute man-child. But he had common sense and didn’t care what anyone thought of him. I came to admire it. This was somebody I could get along with, if he could learn to keep his volume down. 

Another problem of his I noticed… He always went after girls who didn’t want him, were not good to him, or most significantly… ones that were already in a relationship. Such as the girl dating his male best friend. So, long story short, they have all three always been close, but the dynamics and the tensions have always been kind-of strange. In a loving way? 

As for me, I made it clear that I had boundaries and was not interested. I would regularly call him out for his dumb shit. Preferred to be treated more like “one of the guys” and such. Tried to get him out in the dating scene. Etc. Those boundaries and messages were respected and understood between us, and we had a great, deep friendship. 

But his bad habits eventually got the better of him, and I noticed a shift lately. What could possibly go wrong when combining deceptive tendencies, high intelligence, bad crushes, and loneliness? Not to mention his mother, who he lives with, has been acting fairly misguided these last few months. Ben lost a sibling a couple years ago. About the only thing going right in his life, besides a couple of consistent friends, was a new internship. 

Mind, I only give background to make for an interesting story, and provide due background for Ben. Although I am not really defending his actions.

So, back to the shift I mentioned. We used to be the kind of people who could hang out in a room together, even lie on the same bed and watch TV or play video games, and not do anything intimate. That’s saying a lot for high-schoolers, considering that’s when our friendship started. I was never really uncomfortable around Ben. 

Last couple of times we hung out, I picked up on something heavy. I noticed him closer to me than usual. I would move away and make myself clear. I left earlier than I normally would. 

———— TLDR, just begin here honestly ————

My family was going out of town for a few days, so we asked Ben if he would like to look after our dogs at the house. Two of the family dogs loved Ben, but my wolfhound was never quite fond of Ben, so I took my dog with me. Anyway, he seemed to need a break from his mother, and we would pay him to literally just hang out at our house, eat whatever food, and bring his game console over. 

So, as I tidied up my room, where my cat mostly stays… I had a weird feeling. As I was walking out of my room, I turned back and looked at my laundry pile, which was mostly hidden in a corner behind some furniture. 

No, he wouldn’t… … …

I went back, piled up my laundry in a neater way, underwear at the bottom of the pile, and shoved away as close to the wall as possible. I left my blue socks in a “T” shape on top of the pile, like a seal. “Just in case” I thought. “If this does turn out to be a test… the only way I would know is if he fails it…”

I came back a few days later, and the pile had clearly been rummaged through. I couldn’t look at it. At first I thought maybe one of my dogs could have gotten into it. No… the girls don’t do that ever, and I had my dog with me the whole time. The cat doesn’t care for laundry either. This wasn’t enough to come forward with an accusation. 

Ben had stayed an extra morning for us to allow me time to get home from where I had gone, and my family to return some time after me. So I owed him $20 more. He told me I could pay him in food. 

Ben and I would frequent a Chinese restaurant, Waffle House, and Steak Out, to name a few. So I liked the idea, it was just another excuse to go hang out with my buddy. And test a hypothesis. 

It went something like this.

“So, how were the animals?!”

“Great, yada yada yada, rada rada rada…”

“Aw. Sweet. I loved the pictures you sent of cat!”

“Yeah, she’s sweet, I lied on your bed with her… yada yada yada…”

Red flag #1… 

So I looked him right dead in the eye. Knowingly. 

“Ahah. So did she lay in my…

l a u n d r y p i l e??” :)

I saw the slightest expression of alarm cross his eyes for a split second. I didn’t look away, and smiled.

“Uhhh… yeah, she did. Cute little…. Bla bla bla…”

“Oh really? Hahah!” I looked away for a moment, then back to his waiting expression…

“Heheh. Aw. She NEVER does that!” :)

I could almost hear an audible gulp. 

Oh shit, she’s onto me.

We arrived at the restaurant, went inside to eat, and talked about various things like normal. All the while, he was composing a cover story to launch, to glaze over any suspicions I might have… but all he did was confirm them for me.

Back in the car, a doorless, old, manual-shift Bronco, in the spirits of summertime. 

“Oh… by the way, I didn’t know how to mention this earlier…”

Oh, was he going to confess his deeds? 

“You left some underwear in the middle of your floor…”

My stomach sank. 

“…so I picked them up and moved them to the pile, out of the way…”

Oh, wow! How nice. More bullshit. And with such ease. Now I was feeling insulted. I was going to make him worry. I was going to make him feel miserably guilty, make him wonder, get him good.

“No I didn’t, I think you are mistaken.”

….

“Yea, you did.”

“Oh, did I? Well, maybe I missed them. But if I didn’t know you, I’d say that story doesn’t sound true at all!” (Jokingly calling him a pervert boy)

“Ah, shut up \[nerd\].” (His usual response to my wise-cracks)

We laughed. I noted that he did so quite nervously.

We went on to talk about other things, like normal. 

He was so relieved when I started to mention my robots, a completely different subject. Little did he know it was a trap! 

Fast forwarding through some of the geek stuff… 

“So I could check on Cat though my aibo app!!

He froze. “Your aibos were in there?!”

“Yeah! They sat on the charger by my bed, near the outlet, so they wouldn’t die during house-sitting mode.”

His soul probably left his body. 

At this point I was just screwing with him. My robots weren’t actually in there, but I have so many that he couldn’t have known that. I pulled the app up on my phone where you can see through the eyes of the little robot dogs. Conveniently, it was off-loaded, so I didn’t have to demonstrate. 

I went on to casually tell him more features of my hobby bots. And he kept playing along, with a small glimmer of hope that I actually wasn’t onto him.

That conversation ended, and I remained silent for the remainder of the trip home. I was driving us to my house, where his car was parked. 

After several minutes and turning closer to some familiar roads near my neighborhood, I decided to take him for a little joy-ride.

I nearly threw him out of the doorless Bronco a few times. I wasn’t acting all funny about it either. I think he enjoyed it, but I made it clear that was not the intent. He still played the act.

We arrived home. He was probably expecting to get to come into my house and hang out like we normally would. I parked the car, didn’t look at him again, and told him to get lost. He looked genuinely confused, but he wasn’t. “What?”

“I said get lost.”

“Why?” 

“I have had enough of you today. Get your food out of the car.”

I looked back through the door one more time before entering the house, then coldly shut it as he walked, defeated, toward his own car. 

I got a text later that night, asking if I was angry for some reason… yada yada…. And his lying was so good, it almost made me wonder if I had made a mistake. 

My sliver of doubt implored me to add a disclaimer “if you TRULY don’t know what this was about, then don’t worry about it.” 

Ultimately my response was… “we’re even”

But he was still acting confused… all “Even? What did I do?!” 

Wow. After all this time. I had made myself damn clear that I knew what he did. That I was angry. I found his lies to be even more insulting at this point. 

The utter disrespect. I was pissed. More than I was to discover that he went through my laundry. 

The acting was impressive, had I not already tested my hypothesis, it would have been convincing…. Sick. 

The more I thought about it, the more I felt sick and violated by not only his acts, but his deception. 

He made a new groupchat with those couple of friends I mentioned earlier, and me. Supposedly it was for planning short-notice get-togethers. No, it was really a new mask, a distraction. I left it a day later. The more I thought about everything, the angrier I got. 

Then he was stupid enough to text me playing all dumb again. “Why did you leave le group? I haven’t heard from you in a while… yada yada”

Why. You. Little.

That was it. I called his ass out. Never explicitly. I basically said I knew what was going on. And he had one more chance to own up to it.

“Okay, I own up to it…” (followed by a long message… saying he would meet any demands, repercussions, all kinds of bullshit… “a more explicit elaboration can be done in-person…”

Oh, please. As if he hadn’t already had his chances and lost that privilege. I called him out again, my patience was wearing thin. No more nice me.

“Own up to WHAT?”

(…and a video of him telling his friend what he did. Friend looked shocked. I only recently watched the video, but at the time, I was too irritated to listen to his voice.)

Followed by this hair-raising written statement:

“I, Ben Benson, rooted through SeconDairyACownt’s laundry and did things with her underwear.”

After a good “FUCK YOU” and expressing my frustrations, I ultimately decided that I do not want to associate or be friends with Ben anymore. Even if I did decide to forgive him some day, I don’t trust him anymore, and there would be nothing imposing me to reconnect. I told him goodbye and made new boundaries clear. For instance, he is not allowed near my house anymore.

He went on to confess to his friends and loved ones because, supposedly he thinks it is a warning as he might be a danger to other people’s privacy. While although I think this has some truth to it, I’m sure there were some other motives. 

I don’t know what else to do. I feel utterly cheated, betrayed, and also kind-of violated. And gross. I feel disgusting.

He didn’t show a sign of remorse until I called him out explicitly. The acting was impressive, had I not already tested my hypothesis, it would have been convincing…. But the suspicions I finally pressed him to admit are still echoing in my brain, and they make me feel sick, maybe even more-so than the bold-faced lies, now. I usually don’t have a problem moving on from people, especially given a reason like this, but I cannot shake that gross feeling. :( 

I think I need some comfort and support. I think other people will go on being friends with him, because of his own confessions and great acting. As for me, I am removing myself from this person and any of his/our friends that try to justify him or speak on his behalf. I just want away from it, and I want this gross feeing to be over. If anyone has dealt with a situation like this before, how did you handle it?"

COL of the area is a bit higher than national average because it's a major urban area. Index of 114 which is 29% higher than national average according to some websites I looked at. 

Also I had no relevant experience in terms of previous jobs held. I worked retail for years before finishing this degree at age 31. And I failed/retook a lot of classes along the way. So don't give up if you are struggling or are a nontraditional student, there is hope! 

Also, my student loan debt is around 32k, and most of that is in the form of subsidized government loans."

Since then, I barely had time to think: I was given an interview a few days later, and I just learned today that they want to hire me.

But in the mean time, I realized that I don’t want the job. It’s too pressuring, marketing-focused (which I don’t like) and not interesting to me overall. The internship itself was fine, but the manager’s tasks just aren’t for me.
What they offer to pay me is also terrible (minimum wage when I’m getting my master’s degree next month...).

Overall, I don’t want this. I just want some time off after I graduate.

Problem is, I’ve already kind of said yes (haven’t signed anything tho) and they wouldn’t have time to hire someone else before my manager leaves in 2 weeks and a half. 

Is it stupid to throw away such an opportunity (even if I’m not really into it)? Is it too late to back off and say I’m actually not interested anymore? Have you experienced something similar?"

I'm quadrilingual. Random Stuff about me: Both my parents are immigrants from two countries in Eastern Europe and went to school in Europe.

**Family income:** \~200k

**Major:** Finance or Econ   (finance for the schools that offer it)

**Test Scores:** SAT: 1500

**GPA:** 3.65UW/ 4.6 W  (top 10%), Upward grade trend. 11th grade GPA: 3.83 (B in English both semesters).

All clases in HS have been honors/AP/IB. Except Theater in freshman year. GPA was tanked due to Spanish where I got C's.

\--&gt;My entire application revolves around having EC's, LOR's, and awards that can outweigh my UW GPA which I know is not competitive. Low grades are in classes completely unrelated to finance such as biology, Spanish, etc.

Currently in IB program.

**Current Classes:** AP Calc BC, IB English HL, IB History HL, Business SL, Spanish SL, Chem Honors

**Awards:** AIME Qualifier, 3x Deca State Winner (ICDC Qualifier in all), NHD 2x Nationals Qualifier (2nd in State Both Years for Documentary), Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Civics Contest 1st Place in AZ Video ($1k) 2021, same competition in 2020 but 3rd Place Video, National Spanish Exam Silver &amp; Bronze for 4 years in a row (scam award imo, but I hope that such award and its consistency can mediate the C in Spanish I have previously received, also took AP Spanish exam, hopefully a 5, I also received a seal of biliteracy for Spanish this year)

**Work Experience:**

1. For Profit Business. I run a coin business, self taught. Buy/Sell/Consign paper money and coins. Net profit of \~20K for first year in Business (2020), and revenue of about 70k. This is a passion of mine so I don't really count hours, and I don't have specified times when I work.
2. Sales Intern at a Startup based of the Midwest (applied online) for this summer. Paid. 20-30hr/wk for Summer 2021
3. Business Analytics Intern at a STEM Non Profit (applied online) for this summer. Unpaid. 15hr/wk for June-October 2021
4. Algebra/Trig/Calc Tutor at tutoring center. Paid. 20hr/week usually

**Clubs:**

1. JSA, non-partisan political club. Pretty much 2nd highest position for the region of SW US. Involved since 10th grade.
2. DECA, Written Mentor Head. Awards received through DECA listed in awards section. Involved since 9th grade.
3. Investment Club and Personal Stock Trader. Secretary of Inv. club. All except one stock that I suggested in club meetings came out profitable. Involved since 9th grade.
4. Student Association at school. Historian for 2 years. Involved since 9th grade.
5. Speech and Debate. Semifinalist for some regional stuff, nothing too crazy. Involved since 9th grade.
6. Creative Writing Club. Treasurer. Editing videos, website work, etc. Involved since 10th grade.

**Recs:**

1. Math Prof. Known him from 5 years by the time I apply. He came with me to my high school. Told me he would write me a 3 page letter, so I am confident to think it would be a 10/10. Knows me super well and all of the stuff I am involved in.
2. History Prof. Known him for a year, but he knows me well through my love for monetary history  and producing video. He is my Extended Essay (an IB Requirement) mentor. Favorite student. Not super close though, should be a 7/10.
3. Security Guard. I came in every day at school at 6.30am so her and I spoke daily, nerding out on politics/history/etc. Her letter should be pretty good, she told me she never wrote a letter like this before but I am optimistic. Can speak about my soft skills of being a communicator, geniunly learning, etc. She is also aware of spanish situation where I got a C. 8.5/10

**Essays:** Will start later this summer. I think my common app will be pretty good. I have a rough idea of what I will speak about, and will display my passions of monetary history/coins/alternative assets to pad a lawyer of commitment to finance in college. But I plan to center my essay around a sense of discovery.

**Schools:**

* Plan to ED to UPenn Wharton. Considering ED to Yale or Dartmouth as well. Am I shooting too high for penn?
* Want to be east coast.
* Rest of app will be spent shotgunning pretty much all the T20s. Figure that if I spend a good chunk of time, I can get this done and hopefully one college will admit me even with my low UW GPA.

**Also, what schools, except LAC's prefer EC's over grades? Since I am going into finance, school rank is stressed for future jobs.**"

TLDR of that is: Go to UBC Computer Engineering program (my understanding talking with recruiters, friends and relatives who work at senior-most positions at major SV companies that after UWaterloo, UBC and UofT are considered the next 2 best schools in Canada), am in dean's honor list, close to 90% major (last 4 semester) GPA and my academic advisor told me that my current GPA would put me in top 5-10% in my entire faculty (my faculty consists of both electrical engineering and computer engineering so that would be around at least 400 students or more). I will have 4 coop work terms (16 months) completed by September 2021 (recently started working at my current coop company)

Yet, it seems like I can't get any interview from top name companies (not necessarily need to be faang, other companies such as IBM, salesforce, mastercard, SAP, RBC, Deliotte etc would suffice) apart from SAP. I posted similar posts before and the common theme I get is that my luck is extremely bad (it seems like people is USA have rarely any trouble getting interviews at big-name companies after 1-2 internships even if they go to no name state schools). I also talked with my friends in USA and they are also surprised looking at my resume that this resume is not getting me any interview at all, and I have friends who go to SUNY (State university of new york, stony brooks, its very low ranked school) and didn't have as much internship as mine got into IBM full time this year. 

What gives? is it Canadian job market is in really bad condition/way oversaturated right now (I really don't understand the job situation here, I interviewed at a small company that told me that they had thousands of resumes for one coop position while my current company is telling me they hired so many people that they literally don't have office space for all those people and plan to go into full hybrid model once they go back to office and hired a lot of coop students, and crazy thing is that they are still hiring like crazy. I heard similar stories from other companies as well that they are struggling to find enough talents?) Is it my luck? I could really use some advice.

I have posted similar posts before and similar to this thread the common theme is that I could use some minor tweaking (which again varies from thread to thread, but rn it seems like people are telling me to move my education section at the top of my resume since I am in dean's list, have good gpa and go to UBC) but this doesn't answer the question that why I can't break into a big name companies even with referrals (I had a referral for MSFT and yet heard nothing back, nada so assuming I will be rejected soon, for summer, I had referrals at google, amazon and MSFT and got resume rejected from all of them)

Also to clarify, I didn't apply for us based positions, I applied to Canada-based positions for all those companies and I don't require visa sponsorship for any Canadian position. I am also in UBC's coop program (a lot of companies prefer, I heard, coop students over someone else who are not in coop program)

1. Get a Masters in Comp Sci.
2. Work on personal projects and complete guidance texts like ""Cracking the Coding Interview""
3. Attempt to get an unpaid internship to gain experience.

I’m going to graduate my from my US undergrad next May, and I want to apply to PhD programs in aerospace in controls. I have some research experience and my gpa is ~3.7, but obviously I have to start looking at the other parts of the application. 

I’m planning on emailing professors that I’ve been looking at around the first week of June. I also am planning on taking the GRE early August or so. My first question, is this general plan smart, or should I change anything about it?

My second question is about rec letters. I was researching with a prof last summer, but because of COVID and all, I mainly just read papers before he ghosted me and that project went nowhere. This summer, I’m working with two professors and I’m assuming I will get at least good letters from them. My question is, will a rec letter from a supervisor from a research-based internship work, or will that weaken my app?

My last question is, I’m graduating in 3 years from my undergrad, and with COVID, I lost a year of good work. I don’t have as much true research experience, but I am heavily involved in clubs and personal projects, which are more research oriented in nature. For example, my main club has to do with creating autonomous drones, for which I held leadership positions. My most recent project was a slightly advanced nonlinear estimation model for which I had to read through several papers. Can I still use these to really strengthen my app, or will admission committees see them as bs and fluff?

Thanks in advance, and good luck to everyone else applying for next year!"

I just want something to get me in the door and sharpen my tech/soft skills for interviews.

That being said has anyone done the JUMP program by Cognixia for a Full Stack Java dev position? I want to hear about how your experience was with them as I might join them soon. 

&amp;#x200B;

few questions I have :

how was the training? how long after the 6-10 weeks training did you get placed with a client? did you know anyone in your group who did not get placed with a client but still could not go out looking for a job because of the 2-year contract and the penalty?

&amp;#x200B;

Im already hurt with the 1.5 year gap from graduation till my first internship then work. I do not want to waste anymore time, I have already done that and deeply regret it. PS if you graduate... start looking for a job ASAP or even before graduation... dont be an idiot like me and waste 1.5 years then decide you want to start working. It will hurt you and recruiters always filter out the candidates with a gap in their resume so"

My parents were immigrants, but were educated, so we've always been well off. As a result of that, they didn't know anything about the American education system. I always excelled at school, and always had the best grades. I did a bunch of extracurricular science and math competitions, and did good in the science ones. I basically thought of myself as a ""cut above the rest"". I continued to think that when I entered ninth grade and tenth grade. However, during tenth grade, it started going wrong. (For context, I go to a magnet school, so all the students could be considered advanced, since they passed a test to get in). I either would not make it on the school team for extracurricular competitions, or I would simply not place even close to high in individual competitions. I still held faith, but only because I was completely naive and unaware of the college application requirements and process. Hell, I didn't even know what the SAT was until the summer before my junior year (Class of 2022). I didn't even know that colleges cared about summer internships and leadership positions until February 2021. I didn't realize how far behind I was compared to my peers until I stalked their LinkedIns within the last couple months. All this discovery has sort of created a tiny seed of despair within me. As much as would like to blame this disaster on my parents' lack of guidance or a lack of close friends to discuss these types of thing with, I know that it is actually my fault for not researching college applications and ideal high school careers before the middle of junior year. 

Seeing my peers found nonprofits, get multiple internships every summer, become presidents of three different school clubs or more, qualify for freaking USNCO camp, earn multiple varsity letters, getting athletic and academic awards etc., makes me realize how far behind I am as a student, especially coming off 5 internship rejections for this summer. I have no leadership positions, no major awards (only two regional science olympiad awards from high school), no volunteer hours, no completed projects, no organization positions, no varsity letters (freshman/JV basketball for two years) and so far, no summer internships. I have nothing to show for the past three years of life as a high school student, except for all A's, which my peers breezed through, because of course they did. I always dreamed of going Ivy League, or even to a top 20 college. I only realized now, slapped in the face with the biggest reality check of my life, that I am just average now. I am not advanced like I thought I was. 

I want to become a doctor when I grow up, just like most other Asians. But now, I'm the type of kid that chokes when he has to give a presentation, who chokes when he has to give a speech, who can't even talk freely to an interviewer or to a group. Even in this aspect, I am miles behind my peers, in terms of self-confidence and professionalism. I sit on my ass and watch Youtube in my free time, while they are making major moves in their careers and doing what they need to do to succeed. Seeing how much I'll have to do as a premed student in college, I'm really scared now. If I can't even get accepted into any major academic teams or research internships as a high schooler, what makes me think that I will all of a sudden become an advanced, excellent student who can publish research, volunteer and lead clubs, and go above and beyond to go to med school? 

If you read this far, thanks. I just wanted some advice, anything, so that I don't feel alone like this. I'm even considering switching my career focus, even though medicine is my biggest dream, because I'm starting to doubt whether I am cut for medical school. After all this thinking, my head is just swirling right now, and I feel sad. I don't even know what to do or what to think. Obviously I'm running for leadership positions and I'm going to keep applying for internships, but my perceived inadequacy is really demotivating me right now. Any words would be appreciated 🙏🏽."

TLDR: I’ve changed my major a million times in the 4 years I’ve been in and out of college. Torn between staying with mechanical or if I should swap to computer or electrical, I also have a strong interest in real estate(getting my license to be an agent as we speak)

Okay, so. When I started my college journey (2017) I went for mechanical engineering and got into a drafting class I couldn’t figure out.. panicked and switched majors because I was afraid of failing. 

Switched to electrical engineering and I enjoyed that for a semester but when I came back for my second I decided I was going to switch to business. 

Ended up dropping out of that school altogether because it was a private school and very expensive not did I get the work internship that I needed to pay for it. 

Fast forward, I’ve been in and out of community college for various majors from nursing to business. I’m finally in school again (third semester in a row!) for what I originally planned to be a business management degree because I want to start and own businesses. Just so happens, I decided to go back to my grassroots of an engineering degree and here I am pursuing a mechanical engineering degree... unsure if I should stay in it because computers and electronics are going to be the future aaaaand I have a very very large interest in real estate (going to be buying my first rental this year!)  

Anyways, any advice on whether I should stay the course or alter paths would be appreciated. Thank you!"

In almost all cases, those sources of happiness have moved on, and there's no bringing them back. I haven't experienced general contentedness in years.

I recently graduated from a top university. Like, the kind where shows and movies about ""geniuses"" are set. I worked my ass off for 4 years, losing out on sleep, sanity, and some close relationships from home, all because I thought it would be worth it, and I'd be in the perfect position to get a good job after graduation.

6 months later, and I haven't found anything. I've gotten 4 interviews after close to 60 applications, and not a single one has led to anything. I spend so much time and effort tailoring my materials, but candidates with work experience seem to be flooding all the entry level positions, and I consistently get ghosted. I would've had a super cool internship to put on my resume, but the people who hired me for that didn't communicate with their investors, who decided about 1 week in that as a temp employee, I couldn't be trusted with access to the algorithm I was hired to work with. The interviews haven't even been bad, in fact one led to an offer for a second round of interviews, but of course the company just ghosted me before setting those up.

I'm being drained of money - I know better than to spend money I don't have, so I've been eating rice and beans for weeks. I'm increasingly having to rely on my mom for financial support, which feels so shitty, because money has been tight for her too since my alcoholic father left. I know my mom loves me, which should give me some solace, but in all honesty it'd be so much easier for all of us if she didn't. She's constantly asking how my day was and giving job advice; I know she cares, but she's not a professional, and none of the advice has been helpful. It takes all my effort not to lash out and tell her the truth. She's the last person I want to hurt, and she is the only obstacle to me just offing myself.

For a bit, I was feeling a bit better through making money with Uber, but my car broke down, and I can't afford repairs. I don't have the money to even get it diagnosed. Funnily enough, the breakdown was almost disastrous, yet for some reason my base fucking instincts kicked in to save my life. So much for that freak accident I hope for every morning.

I've given up on finding any kind of long-term companionship - I thought I had it once, but I was just a consistent rebound/""I'm bored tonight"" the whole time. That itself was an incredibly rare occurrence - I don't ""get"" most people (I've long suspected autism), and my interests are way too obscure to find people who share them. I get along with people just fine; I'm friendly, and I'm always helpful, even to people who only talk to me when they need something. But that base separation never goes away, and I'm always the odd one out.

For some reason, people seem generally against sui, because ""oh, there are so many good things to experience,"" but that's not the point. Nobody is denying that good things exist, the question is whether those things, considered along with the shitty parts of life, outweigh the call of the sweet nothingness of the void. I don't think they do.

Another common suggestion is therapy, which I understand may work for some people, but IMO it's just indoctrination into the ""life isn't that bad"" cult. Not to be a douche (I'm not proud, in fact I hate it), but I'd consider myself pretty intelligent, and I'm way too good at constructing counterarguments. I want to be convinced that life beats nothing, but no one so far has been able to do that, and I highly doubt that will change. The only way I've been able to silence those thoughts is by dumbing myself down with weed, and I can't even do that right now because who knows what job opportunity might get ruined by a bowl from 3 weeks ago. I'd sub in alcohol but that just makes me feel worse.

So here I am, trapped in my mind, running out of money, knowing that I'm leeching off of the one person I care about, and my preferred solution would just cause that person more pain. The paper writer in me wants to find a conclusion, but I've got nothing. Guess that's what this sub is for. Thanks for reading, I guess."

1. What are my odds at getting into a top 10 program just looking at the info above (disregarding the subjective factors like SOP and LORs for now)
2. I'm interested in computational mechanics in general, as I have a CS minor and my undergrad research is more or less related to it. Any recommendations on what programs I should keep an eye out for?
3. I haven't taken GRE yet because I'm looking for universities to drop their updated policies regarding GRE requirements. Should I take it regardless? 
4. I'm an international student but I'm graduating in a year's time.

I get so jealous when other people in my life are way ahead of me. They already have internship experience and all, and here I am, on autopilot in college and I'm about to graduate with no work experience in my field of study. 

I guess it's just the process of asking for recommendation letters, needing to appear perfect at job interviews, getting rejected, and especially just not feeling competent enough that's stressing me out. I feel pathetic that I'm an adult now but I'm still afraid of basic things like that.

All my years in college I've had imposter syndrome and it still won't go away, at this point I believe it's not imposter syndrome - that I really am too stupid and too slow to be in the software industry. My grades are ok but I've forgotten everything and I'm always overwhelmed by how much I need to learn, and how little I know. 

At the same time, I'm really tired of being a coward. I'm tired of putting off job hunting and practicing technical interview questions. I wish I could change overnight, wake up as a brand new, brave and smart person.

I need advice, how can I overcome this fear of being incompetent? thanks in advance, and sorry for the ranty post"

I'm going to be looking to apply for accounting internships next year and want to give myself the best chance possible. Thus, I was wondering if going for an excel certification would be worth it to put on my resume.

I already had pretty basic knowledge in Excel so I feel like I know what I'm getting myself into. If I don't know what I'm getting myself into, please let me know!

The certification would definitely take a lot of time, so I'm wondering if this would be worth more than applying and working in the student organizations that I'm already in.

I am an incoming junior pursuing a CS degree who failed to get an internship this summer. Over the summer I was thinking of working/building my resume for the fall recruiting season. However, I am in a dilemma. 

I have some experience both in the back-end and front-end and from my experience, I didn't enjoy doing any of those. I always had an interest in security, so I am currently self-studying computer security in hopes of participating in some CTFs by end of the summer. Still, I am worried. 

I looked online and by far there seem to be way more job openings for SWE interns than security interns. I don't care much about higher pay, I just want to have a secure job that I enjoy. I am not much knowledgeable about the work environment and outlook of security engineers, which is why I am asking in this reddit. 

I have a decent GPA (3.9) and I am thinking of getting research at a security lab in my uni. What does it take to set a foot on the security engineer path (and how), and if the path is too hard should I just focus on SWE because it's not worth it?"

I'm just wondering if it's commonly required to get A's + B's across the board in uni in order to actually get into an internship...

I'm studying Commerce in NZ and my first few years my grades in finance + economics were C's (lol) but my management and marketing grades are high B's and A's.... also I worked full time in my first year so my GPA suffered overall a bit.

So obviously I wont be applying for anything accounting or finance related specifically but am just wondering how important overall grades are when applying to stuff? Particularly at EY.. I had a mate who tried to apply there and apparently  they just werent interested unless his GPA was at a certain standard, but I saw they had some business and consultancy internship opportunities so I thought it might be worth a shot 

I know applications and cover letters and interviews are also important but yea, all grades across the courses too? Thanks for your help :)"

I finished my first semester this Spring and I foolishly didn't apply for much of anything for the Summer so I'm not really doing much right now. When I start Fall 2021 I'll still be considered a Freshman and then become a Sophomore in Spring 2022. I'm 26 years old right now, not sure if that hurts my chances at being able to get internships and what not. 

With that background out of the way... I was looking to get advice on what I should actively be doing in the near future to ensure that I have a good chance at being able to get internships and a job in the aerospace industry after graduation. Besides the obvious of maintaining a good GPA, my current plan is to enter an undergraduate research 2-semester program at my university and actively try to participate in the robotics or rocketry club (maybe both if time permits). I'm not exactly too sure when applications for Spring and Summer internships go out, but I guess I'll try to keep an eye out for them on stuff like Handshake, LinkedIn, and USAJobs. Additionally, the only internship that I applied for the Fall semester was on the NASA intern website. I know the Pathways for NASA opens up sometime during Fall, and with that, that's pretty much the extent of what I have planned so far. 

With all that in mind, I am hoping that I could get some advice on what else I should be doing or focusing on doing or trying to do within say... the next 2 years or so. I was really foolish to not do any internships when I got my Bachelor's degree in CS and I was an idiot and did the exact same thing again during my first semester here, so I want to make sure I'm making the best use of my time from here out and not make any mistakes. Any recommendations on what I could be doing during my free time during the summer would be nice too. Currently thinking of learning Python (never learned it somehow, was mostly taught Java). I guess my ultimate goal is to work on stuff like robotics/landers/rovers or work on rockets or spacecraft, but I'm not too sure of my chances on rockets since Chemistry didn't really click for me.

Thank you for taking your time to read through all this, and I would greatly appreciate any advice you may have!"

So I moved in Malta a couple of years ago and did some customer support jobs in iGaming... recently I got into self-taught frontend development but the job searching was brutal. I know HTML, CSS, Javascript, Vue.js, Jquery and Bootstrap. I use Github and use a little bit of SCSS.

At first I thought I would be able to get a 27k job by may. then I got my expectations down at 23k. Now I just got refused at a minimum wage internship of 17k and I feel so incredibly defeated.

There are not many jobs in Malta in IT anymore I think... a few months ago it was full now summer is approaching and there's nothing left anymore. I am incredibly desperate.

My questions is, what do you guys think is a country/city in Europe where it is SUPER EASY to get your first Junior/internship role? 
Or maybe I should try to get something remotely? I tried a few times applying for remote roles and I literally never got an answer. Maybe they don't hire juniors remotely? I'm not sure

What should I do?,__freexilef__,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nmum4y/i_feel_like_im_cheated_what_should_i_do/,"As an international student, I'm now looking for UK located jobs. With almost zero experience (1 weak internship which is not of good quality, lasted for 2 months), I am recently working on improving my resume by any means. Not after a long time I find myself in a dilemma.

I have a CS bachelor's degree and am now doing a master's, however, what I have learnt from it is that apart from spoon-feeding you with idle theorizing, courses of these degrees have nothing to do with practical programming that would be applied in real-world jobs. When I realize this I have not much time to learn the frameworks, leetcode and other interviewing stuff, because my time has already been wasted in doing the crappy exams testing how well you understand theories. I know it could be my fault that I should have started job-seeking much earlier, but what I have been told before I go to colleges is colleges DO help you in terms of career, which turns out that they DON'T. Oh, they DO charge you fees.

Since education won't help, I devote much of my time to developing toy projects, hoping that this will become parts of my portfolio.  But I was told by some chaps that toy projects also won't help and are going to be ignored by the recruiters. They also told me that what recruiters want is projects that are fancy enough. I don't know how to develop a fancy project, although I can make a twitter clone with the help of frameworks. I don't have a mentor, nor can I afford tutorials for a fee, and I have to say that the outcomes of these tutorials don't seem quite fancy.

Since both universities and side projects won't help, I find that I have trapped in a catch 22 situation.

Companies require years of experience but you have to got a job first to gain experience.

I got 0 interviewing after rejected by tens of applications. What should I do?

I am going to graduate in September. I know time is running out but  I am really desperate and depressed."

While I was taking a shower I heard multiple times ""deja Vu"" from Olivia Rodrigo and the song was stuck in my head after that, but what was weird was that for only one second I swear I seemed to hear the melody from outside of my head when it wasn't playing anywhere, it was really just a second and stoped immediately and never happened again, so I just assumed I probably misheard something from the TV.

But today something weirder happened, my mother's phone was ringing, it was my sister, 3 minutes after I heard the phone ringing but it wasn't that loud so I was in doubt, when it actually didn't ring, I even checked to see if someone had called.

The last time I heard something was when I was a kid, I was on my grandparents house and heard my grandfather calling from above like echoing, he was dead... I was so fucking scared and remember it to this day.

Now like any person I'm afraid I'm going ""crazy"" I'm super afraid I'll develop schizophrenia or something, although there's no one in family with it, but I'm 18, female, I know it starts to manifest around this age. 

I never heard anything else like voices or loud thoughts, I've always been an anxious person and I've been kinda anxious because of my internship, although I was never diagnosed, but I don't really seem to fit on the other early symptoms, wouldn't say I'm depressed, or having mood swings, or having trouble focusing or remembering things I just learned, nor changes in sleep routine etc.

But this makes me so scared that now I'm afraid of going to sleep because of the silence of night, I fear that during that absolute silence I hear something. Maybe I'm just overthinking this too much, I always do, I'm the kinda of person who googles the symptoms and thinks that has all of the diseases possible and then stress about it for a few days and then forget it."

It’s only me and him working there, which makes me a little nervous as a 23 year old girl and he’s pretty arrogant, but I really __really__ need the experience to land my next job. I’m thinking of this as a stepping stone.

I should be happy since this is what I wanted, and I felt good about my decision when I accepted it, but as soon as I got in my car to leave I felt unsure. Just like this heavy feeling in my chest.

I am interested in taking a Machine Learning course to beef up my resume. I was thinking between the IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate (6 months) or the Udacity Machine Learning Engineering Nanodegree (3 months).

A bit about my background: I have 3 years of experience as a Software Developer (2/3 being an intern). 3 years of experience with Python, and I have some experience with ML libraries like sci-kit learn, Pytorch, and other useful ones like jupyter, numpy, matplotlib, Flask for API development. I just finished my undergraduate degree in Computer Science (I'm in Montreal, Canada).

I have a few web application projects and one Reinforcement Learning project to showcase in my portfolio. The RL project was for an undergrad level ML class I took, we tried to train a RL agent to play poker, it was somewhat successful and there is a formal paper with it explaining our methodology.

I think my background leans well towards going after a Machine Learning Engineer role, but does anyone have any recommendations for the 2 courses or any others? Or perhaps other work that they completed to help beef up their resume? Thanks"

***I am a U.S. citizen so I will apply as a domestic student***

**Intended Major(s):** Computer engineering

**SAT:** 1470 (780M, 690EBRW)

**UW/W GPA and Rank:**

My school has 0-10 grading system and the passing mark is 7. My average must be around 7.8 or smth. I know this sounds horrible but since we don't need good grades for getting into universities there is no real incentive for trying our best so believe it or not my average is average to highish. I don't know if I should mention this in my application (pls tell me).

My school doesn't rank but i think I am top 30% in a class of 30.

**Awards:**

* Represented my school in a state math olympiad.
* A in IGCSE Mathematics Extended

**Extracurriculars:**

* Almost 10 years playing rugby (2012-present)
* My family and I sponsor two children from a poor part of Argentina (This means buy them clothes, Christmas presents, write them letters, etc. Have probably done it for 5 years now)
* Self-taught Python
* Programmed Knight's Tour solver and Sudoku solver
* Karate 3 years
* School House Captain (Senior Year)
* Cultural and sports exchange trip to UK &amp; France with my school

Most of  US EC like research, internship, debate club don't exist

**LORs:** My teachers have probably never written LORs so I'll have to guide them a little. i think this helps. I also have very good relationships with many of them

**Essay:** English is not my native language but I will dedicate plenty of time studying how to write a successful college essay so I don't know how will my essays result.

I am looking for colleges but i liked some of them like BU (although I plan on ED there, i know is a hard reach), UF and FIU.

The position was in data analytics\*.\* (the [full blog](https://dataanalystlife.blogspot.com/2021/06/working-at-big-4.html) if anyone is interested)

**The interview**

I had three interviews to pass.

* Technical (with one of the nicest recruiters/Data analyst/scientist)
* HR (also a very nice person)
* Manager (very serious guy, he scared the shit out of me, but once I started working with them he was super nice)

***Technical***

1. SQL = What would you write to do x, y, z. (Small question to test if I know how to use SQL or not at all)
2. Business question to test my business acumen
3. Statistics questions regarding outliers and robust preprocessing, median and mean in skewed data

Yes overall, the interview was not that hard, because I am a Civil Engineer + Master of AI. I truly think that having a good educational gives a nice push. The interviewer will think, if he made it that far, he won't be a dumb fuck (unless i cheated all the way). Yes I know, good grades does not mean intelligence. But good grades/good education means hard work and that's what most company want (hard workers) in my opinion.

***HR***

1. Testing my French skills (I am supposed to be bilingual but once you start talking English everyday you start losing the French vocab, ""le science de data"" I said it like 30 times (FFS)) mainly because in Belgium the languages are French, English, Dutch and German.
2. General storytelling, my cv, why i came to europe, why i chose my masters, what i did before coming
3. Motivation: on why I found the position interesting. BTW Deals Analytics is one of the most fun position if you check the YouTube videos.
4. \*\*Me saying some jokes to gain points :p\*\*

**Manager**

1. Same as HR but with a lot more pressure. I got scared to death no joke (I bet many people know what I am talking about)

**First Week as an Intern**

Right away, I had to learn the software they use, which is **Alteryx**. Since I have already done my Pandas and SQL on DataCamp, I did not require lots of time to get used to it. **VERY** fun no code software for data cleaning and prepping.

**First Project**

I directly started working on an RED financial data. The goal was to create insight from the financial data to direct the next investments in the right path (most lucrative).

**Second Project**

Geospatial analysis. Oh boiii, Oh BOIIIII ! This one was amazing. I had no idea how good is creating a map and understanding the effect of the surroundings on the business. This one was huge! Learned how to webscrape, how to deal with JSONS and much more.

**Third Project**

Computer Vision project (what the actual fuck? are we still in the same internship?). Haha. Matter of fact, I had learned a course on CV and I was like: ""guys i studied this a few months ago, I can solve it with CV"". Everyone liked it so much (even though i copy pasted the code from my old projects \*\*evil laugh\*\*)

**Fourth Project**

Geospatial Analysis again. But this was one very tough and stressing.

**Fifth Project**

At that point I had to work on my thesis because I had an intermediate presentation. However, the project was about traffic analysis (traffic as in cars). A dream coming true because i am a civil engineer specialized in traffic engineering/transportation. We did amazing stuff but they were very limited :(.

**The End**

One thing to add, for however gets an internship at a big4, I hope you get a supervisor similar to the one I had. I loved him. Always supportive and encouraging. He cared about me on the personal level.

**To the readers**

I hope you benefit from this. Either motivates you to apply or to learn something new.

hope you enjoyed it♥"

But the sentiments in the comments I've seen all over reddit. They're always very polar when it comes to the Engineering job market. People are either doing very well or been unemployed since graduation.

For example

* ^(There is a huge shortage in STEM. We can't find enough people. If you can't get hired, the problem is you.)
* ^(There is a huge surplus in STEM. Nobody wants to hire anybody without veteran experience or with a day's gap in employment.)
* ^(There was never a shortage in STEM. It was all a marketing scam to get more greencard employees)
* ^(The majority of graduates won't work in STEM because they're too mediocre for the actual job even if they graduate.)
* ^(The majority of students won't work in STEM because they're not going to graduate because the degree standards are so high.)
* ^(There is a shortage of experienced candidates. Replacements aren't being trained fast enough. We need more graduates being trained.)
* ^(There is a surplus of experienced candidates, but companies are trying too hard to suppress wages to actually attract the people they need for the right roles.)
* ^(Nobody wants to train fresh graduates, and interns are rotated out like disposable goods for cheap labor)
* ^(We can't find graduates)
* ^(Universities lie or inflate about the rate at which their graduates find work while cranking out a surplus of graduates in overpriced programs, devaluing degrees)
* ^(HR lies and inflates about their job requirements, requiring more people to be over-educated yet under-trained)
* ^(Hiring managers and HR are incompetent and has no idea what an Engineer even is or does)
* ^(Engineers making their CV's are incompetent and have no idea how hiring managers or HR even works)
* ^(Nobody is hiring)
* ^(We're hiring like crazy and can't find anybody)
* ^(We're hiring like crazy, we hired 3 out of 120 qualified candidates, so nobody should be complaining about not finding work)
* ^(We're hiring and we're in a low cost of living area so you should move here)
* ^(I'm trying to be hired but nobody wants to cover relocation costs I can't afford)

I guess I'm wondering where the truth lies in all of this. My own experience is just as polar, and I suspect my degree is just a ticket that cost me tens of thousands of dollars to participate in a game of musical chairs."

nnb02u,3,2021-05-28,I graduated from dental school abroad and passed the boards exam - now I legally am not allowed to work anywhere,Ambitious-Ad5048,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/nnb02u/i_graduated_from_dental_school_abroad_and_passed/,"Back in 2015 I moved abroad to study dentistry. The program was in english and I was promised to be able to work in my country once I graduated and passed the national boards exam of the university-country.
I studied for 5 years and paid student loans.

In 2019 (9 months until my graduation) the law concerning graduates from dental/medical schools of the foreign country got changed. Now, to receive a license, a graduate has to complete 12 months of internship. The 12 months consist of working as a dentist in different departments of dentistry (dental surgery, orthodontics, conservative dentistry, pediatric dentistry and periodontology) for a very low income. Additionally these interns need to attend some extra lectures and first aid courses. To enroll in the internship program, the graduates must have a certain level of the native language. No exceptions for international students who are already enrolled in english programs were granted. A language exam for foreigners is held twice a year.

According to the foreign country, internship abroad is possible as long as it follows the provided regulations. Unfortunately where I live I am not allowed to do any of the listed procedures without a license - and I don’t receive the license until I did all the procedures. The ministry of health from my country started negotiating with the foreign country since this change of law affected MDs, dentists and vets.

Then the pandemic hit. I informed myself about possibilities in my country and learned that I‘m „kind of stuck in a legal limbo“ where I can’t apply for jobs, and I once I passed the boards I should have more possibilities. So I moved back to my home-country and studied for the board exam of the foreign country (which is based on foreign literature instead of international). Therefore for months I had to re-memorize definitions and categorizations that are only used in the foreign country. 
I passed my boards and started applying for internship at universities in the country that I live in. 30 applications and 30 rejections later I learned that due to the pandemic all internships/guest students/erasmus got cancelled. Applications for doing my Dr. got rejected too since basically every second student now decided they want to use their extra time (from cancelled classes/clinics) by doing their Dr. degree. And universities prioritize their students over graduates from other places.
I got invited to one uni-clinic for a trial week once covid hopefully calms down in the end of summer. The professor that I talked with in a zoom interview suggested that I could maybe do my Dr. there which would take approximately 12 months, and I could help out at the clinic in my free time.

So once the universities plan didn‘t work out, I started applying for internship at dental offices. So far one dentist told me I need more practice and classes because the international program differs from the dental schools here and I am very insecure. Another one just wanted to talk to me because his son wants to study medicine abroad. My own dentist informed himself about my legal situation and said that he can’t offer me anything at the moment. Approximately 40 dentists never got back to me. 
Right now I am assisting one dentist who is an immigrant himself too and understands the struggle, but all I am allowed to do is work as an intern, assist and clean up (no payment).

My university announced that they received a permission to create a 6 months long internship program for international graduates which allows us to receive our license. Since the university has to provide rooms, equipment and supervision, we have to pay a loan for the 6 months. With the license I‘d be able to work in my home-country too. Unfortunately the university announced a possible internship program back in february and asked for signing up in their list... and since then there‘s no news. The program was supposed to start in october, but according to the secretary they‘re having issues finding dentists who speak english and would supervise us while we‘re working on patients.

Today I learned that the language exam happened last week and that the next one will be in november. So if the english 6 month internship program won‘t happen, I‘ll have to pass the language exam in november to then sign up for a 12 month internship which will start in march. By then it‘ll be 2 years since my graduation, and in the new regulations it states that I need to complete the internship within 2 years of graduating. Which means I won‘t get my license. 

I worked hard for years to get good grades so I can get into dental school. I studied dentistry for 5 years. I passed the boards. It‘s been a year since the last time I treated a patient and at this point I feel like leaving me alone with a patient is reckless. When I graduated I  was worried and felt like an imposter, but I told myself over and over again that I’m quite confident in diagnosis and treatment and felt like within a couple of weeks of working it will become a routine. 
But now it‘s been 13 months of me having no chance to use my knowledge and my abilities. It feels to me like doing a split without warm up after a year of no exercise. I don‘t know what to do. I question my choices, and at this point I lost hope. This whole situation creates a lot of tension in my family too, which makes everything even worse.

My intern company does not allow taking of evening modules and I only managed to clear ES2531 last sem, so I'd like to know if EG2401A can be cleared in the semesters following IA sem.

From ME btw."
nnbsxy,13,2021-05-28,I don't know which job to choose please help,thatonegirlnyla,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/nnbsxy/i_dont_know_which_job_to_choose_please_help/,"So for context I am a 23F living at home, and it's time for me to go honestly. I am currently in online school for a BS in computer science on a fast track where I finish in 18 months or less but I am aiming to be done in 1 year. I do study a lot but I know I can handle full time work too.

I was offered a part-time job that pays $17/hour at 20 hours a week, but I would have to stay with this job for a year after I start so if I want to find an internship or something to increase my job chances after I graduate, I can't even do that. Also I have to sign my offer letter by June 1st not leaving me a lot of time to decide.

I have lots of interviews and one, semi-offer for full time work, which will allow me to move out, start paying off my student loans and be done paying them off by the time I graduate, save to buy a home and pay off other debts also. 

I just don't know which to choose. I am not afraid of hard work which is why I am going for a computer science degree in the first place. If you were in my shoes what would you choose???"
nnc7uj,146,2021-05-28,Internship starting out,ecl118,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/nnc7uj/internship_starting_out/,I just started my first major SWE internship. I’m really excited but I keep running into bugs while setting up the technology and everything to deploy the software. None of the other interns are running into these and I have been following the instructions pretty well. I already feel like I’m failing and I haven’t even started to code. Everyone is willing to help out I just feel like I’m already asking for too much help off the bat. Does anyone else feel this way?
nnca20,2,2021-05-28,How valuable is a multilingual engineer?,CalculusMcCalculus,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/nnca20/how_valuable_is_a_multilingual_engineer/,"Hey everybody! I am a rising senior mechanical engineer in the United States. I am extremely fortunate enough to have landed an internship this summer with a multinational company which starts soon. Nearing the end of my college career, I have been thinking recently about how I would want to shape my early career.

I am currently studying and receiving a minor degree in Spanish, and I have discovered that I really have the passion and skills to pick up languages other than English. I am nearing the point where I can speak professionally in Spanish, and I am planning on hopefully learning more German too whenever I have the time (likely after college). One day, I would love to try to live abroad as an engineer (also studied abroad last year in France), and to me it seems like becoming proficient in these languages is the most efficient way.

With this in mind, I have a few questions for those who may have any answers or advice:

* How in demand is an engineer who speaks different languages for a company who may have international involvements?
* Is the value of knowing one or more other languages as valuable as a unique technical skill? (i.e. an ME who knows how to code well)
* How often do companies allow engineers to relocate to a different country given they are interested in acclimating to the new culture/workforce?

I have not had many opportunities to talk about my interests in languages and engineering in real life so I truly appreciate any input. Thank you!"

nndjps,1,2021-05-28,Might Throw Away Scholarship For CC Transfer At Better School - High School Senior,WonderfulDraft9637,TransferToTop25,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransferToTop25/comments/nndjps/might_throw_away_scholarship_for_cc_transfer_at/,"Starting off, I admit that I may be delusional. I just need confirmation or denial of it.

This March, I was fortunate to win a $20,000/year scholarship with internships all four years and the promise of a job afterward. I am grateful for this opportunity. The schools I was accepted to are NYU and a few local schools of technology. I was able to bargain my NYU tuition down 77%. With my scholarship, all I would need to do in payment for the school is take out federal loans. Loans—of course—scare me. It’s the reason why I tested my luck and applied for scholarships in the first place.

After I committed to NYU, I was let off the waitlist for a local technology school near me. It has a good turnout rate for graduates securing jobs afterward, but it doesn‘t have the brand name and reach that I want. Even further, I didn’t get in for my first choice major (Computer Science) at the technology school. I got in for a semi-related major, but its still far enough from a Comp Sci degree for it to worry me.

I know that if I change commitments to my local school of technology and persuade my way into double majoring in my admitted major along with computer science, I may be able to attain credits to transfer to another school. The biggest downside to this is how poorly non-community college transfer students are treated by top schools. NYU (I’ve heard) does not grant financial aid to transfers who aren’t from community college. Most Ivy League transfer students come from community college background and have been part of the Phi Theta Kappa society or some other ECs. Great schools like MIT have extremely low admittance rates. And worst of all, computer science is infamous for being a degree nearly impossible to transfer into.

To be quite frank. I do consider time to time if I should go to community college, use the same drive that got me into NYU and then apply to my top schools then. The downside is that my admittance to the Ivies and top schools I wish to attend aren‘t guaranteed, and even more-so, my large yearly scholarship is *not* applicable to community college....

If I end up staying at my local school of technology and earning a degree from there, I wouldn’t be the unhappiest person in the world (especially since its debt free). But I also crave the prestige of a top school, which is something that place can’t provide.

Ivies and top schools have the potential of helping a student from a bad neighborhood such as mine and catapulting them into great places of wealth. The resources, connections and atmospheres there are invaluable. But is it worth losing out on a free ride and guaranteed job?

Does anyone have opinions or advice for me?"

And I’m very excited, except today I feel like im already starting off on the wrong foot. I was told I would get a package delivered to me for my first day to my home address, and I didn’t think much of it, until last night (Thursday night) when I was out for the weekend I just wanted to follow up that a signature wasnt required, but they got back to me Friday morning saying that a signature was required and that the package would be delivered that day by noon. I called up so many people to try and get there to get the package, but we missed it, and my supervisor was cc’ed to the email chain of me clarifying things back and forth with the HR rep to try and sort the situation out. I feel like I already made a complete mess of myself. My supervisor and I spoke on the phone, and she said everything is fine and it is what it is and we can start a day later, but I can’t help but think of how disorganized she already thinks I am.  At one point she kinda implied that if I had said all of this yesterday the situation could have been avoided, which is true, but it made me feel so awful :( just hoping I can salvage this. Does anyone have any advice?

- 800 on math 2 sat

- but none in college so far bc of the time diff since i was remote
- got invited to my current uni’s honors program
- decent essays (based on at least my freshman year apps, i got into more competitive unis (lower acceptance rate) than usc transfer admissions such as cmu computer science, umich engineering, ucsd, northeastern, and nyu)

despite all this i was rejected (not even asked for further grades or spring admission) from usc. for more context, im applying out of nyu (im in cas as a computer science major) to usc viterbi (for a computer science/business admin major). i know plenty of ppl w id say objectively a weaker profile that got in. idk im just gutted right now. any insight?"
nngrq2,5,2021-05-29,Advice for current/prospective engineering students?,BestAd9733,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/nngrq2/advice_for_currentprospective_engineering_students/,"Reflecting on last year, what advice would you give to current/prospective engineering students?

Here are some tips from my experience:
1) Find a good study group. Not only will this keep you accountable, but studying in a public place helps you stay more productive than your dorm where there are distractions such as your bed or tv. 

2) Use student solution manuals. Yes it is important to learn to work through hard problems, but it is equally important to see the methodology behind solving problems. Studying solutions helps us become better problem solvers and is more productive than struggling all night and getting nowhere. As Issac Newton said, “If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.” We don’t need to reinvent the wheel, but we do need to use all resources we have to gain expertise in a subject area so we can start to solve new problems. 

3) Apply for internships as early as possible. Finding your first job can be difficult, but an internship gives you a foot in the door. 

4) Network with engineers. Similar to the previous tip, this can help get you a referral to get a foot in the door for your first job out of school. 

5) Make sure you have a firm grasp of calculus and physics. This will make subsequent courses much easier. I actually passed AP physics and calculus in high school, but retook those courses in college. I graduated summa cum laude in mechanical engineering and think this was a  big factor why. 

6) Study hard, but try to have fun. You don’t have to graduate at the top of your class to get a good job and after a few years of work, your GPA doesn’t matter. As an engineering student, you won’t be able to experience college like others as studying will consume most of your time, but it should still be an experience you make the most of.

Hope this helps!"
nnguuj,3,2021-05-29,The eLearning Bundle for the Security + 601 is pricy but I find value in it.,001011001101,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/nnguuj/the_elearning_bundle_for_the_security_601_is/,"To start off, I am a student studying Cyber Security. I am fortunate to have landed an internship as a Sysadmin and he has asked me to give him tips on security for what I am studying. I have found a lot of the hands-on reading from the labs and exercises has helped me in this field.

We all know Professor Messer is a great resource but having a deeper reading of what he is talking about has helped me comprehend the topics. It is a different perspective and I appreciate that. It is not for everyone but it has helped me understand key terms.

The questions are also great on there too which helps assess understanding. It is from the official CompTIA website so it should be related to what's on the test. 

I haven't taken the test yet but this has given me confidence. I am not worried. 

**TL'DR** It is not for everyone but if you have the money, it gives you a greater look on the field beyond the test which I have found value in with my internship to give insight."
nnhur6,38,2021-05-29,Is it normal to not have been the typical student in India?,notioner,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/nnhur6/is_it_normal_to_not_have_been_the_typical_student/,"First of all, I hope whoever's reading this is safe and doing well. I was tired of looking at all the negative posts on this sub so here I am talking about something else.  
I'm a 20 year old engineering student from Bangalore. Over time I've come to realise that I don't see myself involving in and talking about a lot of things my friends and peers seem to do. Here's some context:

1. I've never smoked anything or tried anything alcoholic. Both my school and college friends were full of late-night weed/OMR/beer stories either in the hostel or the canteen or some random birthday party.
2. I did have 1 girlfriend but tbvh I lost interest after a while and realized it was temporary and uninteresting and broke up within a year. I've always considered spending time over girls my weakness  (wasted time over two of them in 11th and 12th) but I've come to not care about relationships anymore and haven't pursued anyone for quite a while now.
3. I don't use social media. Haven't used FB in over 5 years and I don't have an Iinstagram account. I decided to join it for a while to see what the fuss was all about only to get bored of friends just posting stories about them going to restaurants in the city with friends or house parties etc. Ultimately deleted my account and never used it again.
4. I don't like movies, TV series or music which are IN. I don't LOVE the Avengers and american sitcoms like FRIENDS are non existent to me. I've heard good things about a few shows on Prime and Netflix but contrary to popular binge culture, I surprisingly can never commit to something that is more than 2 hours long. I prefer coding, reading non fiction or watching comedy instead.
5. When it comes to college and academics, I've never cared too much about my grades and have learnt what I know online and have done reasonably well bagging a couple of internships and I don't particularly feel affected by peer pressure to pursue higher studies or grind for on-campus placements.
6. I am okay with not having the best phone or not eating outside every week or two. 

My point is, I feel very disconnected from my peers. I didn't bother much after I realized my ""friends"" don't actually bother texting me until I do so first. I am not an introvert but find it unnecessary to make small-talk or conversation for the sake of conversation. I worry that I might be boring, over-mature or too silent for people my age. I haven't exactly had any life-changing experience nor have I ever wanted to have what is considered ""fun"" by many. FOMO has been kicking in lately and I want to know if there are people like me and if yes, what did you guys do to deal with this? Did you deal with this? Should you deal with this? Am I missing out on anything? What would you do?"

Im in the process of switching careers, pretty much got the basics down of HTML/CSS, started to learn Javascript, just need to practice. Also have knowledge of basic python programming with my uni course.

Anyway I've been applying to trainee positions and junior positions stating my current knowledge etc some have been willing to discuss taking on someone lower than the requirements guess means cheaper for them.

As I've been applying for about a year to different roles and have noticed an increase in requirements across the roles which is I guess expected, with continued developments. my list of items to learn is getting ever longer haha.

I came across this yesterday for a trainee role, which I had to double take.

**What You Need To Have**

* A technical degree that covers relevant subjects like IT, computer science, software engineering, and web design and development.
* A grounding in web development concepts, process, methodologies, and tools.
* Knowledge in front-end and back-end programming languages like HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, Python and MySQL.
* Some technical knowledge in areas like client-side components, server-side languages, database management systems, web application frameworks, and version control systems.
* A logical approach to identifying and solving problems as well as a strong ability to collaborate and communicate.

**As a Trainee Web Developer, you will**

* Learn about front-end and back-end development and be able to code using relevant languages.
* Plan, prototype and test applications in different browsers and environments.
* Create website and web pages to demonstrate your development skills.
* Receive guidance, advice and support from an industry expert to acquaint yourself with various areas of web development and grow your mastery in the use of different programming languages and development tools.

A degree is a requirement now for a trainee position??

I knew most internships required you to either be in the last year of a degree or just finished, but a trainee? its like apprenticeship level. Is it just me or am I missing something here."

I hold a BSc in IT and have 3 years of working experience (+ 6 months internship) and she just graduated in a Graduateship in Chemistry.

I currently work as a Software Engineer on a consultancy company (for 10 months for now) here (with CEO being a Swedish guy) working on a dev team for a Swedish company.

As being told, if it goes through we'll get many similar benefits to Swedish employments such as stock options, Swedish holidays, etc. And they've mentioned if we need we can visit there and work from Sweden.

So I'm wondering what are our (me and gf) chances of moving there through the company. Even if I can't go through the current company, would my experience working for them matters when I try to apply for jobs with visa sponsorship from an EU company?"

I’m an international student and a rising senior at a well known liberal arts college in the US, majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. I was fortunate enough to secure internships however they were all outside the United States. I was a software engineering intern at a mid-stage startup my first summer back home. Because of Covid, I had to fly back home and stay there from September 2020 till now and working as an intern in a well known startup in my country since October 2020, initially as a SWE intern and now in ML. Only work experience I had in the States other than part time work in my college was in research the summer after my sophomore year where I applied some Unsupervised Learning ML models. I know it’s more ideal to land an internship in the US especially to get that return offer and maybe because it’s more favoured by employers.

I have had one 6 week internship after my 2nd year, in a non technical company where I was basically  the only person responsible for all the IT things in the company, so I would say this was a very negligible experience. After my 3rd year I was supposed to do an internship with Amazon, but due to COVID it was cancelled, then I found a research-dev internship at my uni, however it was also cancelled, hence I left without any relevant internship experience going into my final year. I don't have any insane projects on my resume, I have 1 big project from uni, my final year uni project and an automation bot for a game which I did for myself, hence nothing insane either, trust me.

I have started doing leetcode around September 2020 (I have never done a single leetcode prior to that), starting with a 75 question list and I was so bad at it that I couldn't even do easy questions and would have to look up solutions for most of the time and spend hours trying to analyze them. But with practice I became better, I have done somewhere above 200 questions in total within the next few months, going from not being able to solve some of the easy questions, to being fine with most of the mediums. So if some of you reading are at the same place where you don't even know how to start an easy question, just take your time analyzing other solutions and the more questions you see, the more patterns you will recognize and will know how to do it in the future! 

I started applying to jobs in Singapore around November 2020 and tried both internships and full time positions and the start was pretty terrible I have to say... I only got like 3 OAs (from bytedance and some other companies) which I bottled completely since I wasn't anywhere close with my leetcode for those questions yet. I was receiving some emails of people asking me some questions, to ask if i'm the country and if I would need a visa to work there and upon answering that i'm currently outside of the country and need a visa they would just simply ghost me. I suppose this was the biggest deal breaker, since they're in such a lockdown that it's so difficult for people to come in at this time, hence it was really demotivating in my case since there was nothing I could do to change border control measures. Although I was very demotivated I kept on applying and grinding leetcode along with doing my final year of uni, which was really tough to focus on since I was too obsessed with job applications. Only in March-April 2021 I have started getting more hits and more invitations to interviews and for the first times I made past the initial stages of the interviews, which was already a progress, although I didn't change much. I guess this had to do with the hiring season time, but you never know. 

Finally, in April I applied to the company which gave me the offer on LinkedIn and I didn't expect them to get back to me, since i've already been rejected so many times, but surprisingly they got in touch with me 12 days after my application with the initial call and asked me to do their OA specifically in JS (which I haven't used for years). I told them that i'm having exams and I don't have time at the moment to learn JS, so I can only do the OA in 3 weeks (I said it since I though that they're not gonna hire me anyway so what's the point of wasting my study time now) and surprisingly they were fine with me doing it 3 weeks later. Although I didn't do the OA very awesome, I managed to get to a white board stage, where they gave me some logic, coding and DB problems which I managed to solve with some very minor hints, although they liked the logic and solution so they proceeded me to a next interview with tech director who asked bunch of behavioural questions, past projects, experiences, expectations etc and I managed to answer it in between the lines of what the person from the initial interview told me about their culture and the director was happy about it, hence he moved forward with me and in 2 days they presented me with an offer. They did not seem to be bothered by my current location or my visa status as they agreed that I can work remotely and figure out location or visas afterwards when the situation is clearer (they also gave me an option to go to their Paris office if I want to), so after 6 months of torturous applications I happily accepted their offer and will be starting to work remotely next week!

I guess the main idea of this post is that you should never give up, just keep putting in the effort, keep applying and one day you will find a company which will be happy to take you. You don't have to have 4 top tech company internships or some insane projects with 100k users to get a job. Some companies might look for graduates who have 2 yrs of exp straight out of uni, while some will be happy to train you. Some HR told me ""you have no idea how many indian applicants we get, who are incapable of anything at all, they don't even know the basic data types and have very little idea how to code a simple loop or a function"". Despite a job posting on LinkedIn having 200 applicants, don't be discouraged by it, since most likely at least half of them are surely worst than you, since there are so many people just applying to anything without even looking at the job descriptions, so don't be discouraged by the applicants number alone!

What kind of advice I wish I got if I were to start this period over again?  
1 - start leetcoding some months earlier before starting applying to jobs, I would say 6months before starting to apply to jobs, so you have enough time to prepare for any OAs they throw at you. 2 - don't be afraid to decorate your past experiences and projects you've done, to make it look more exciting, just be more cheeky about it.   
3 - keep applying and never stop grinding in order to reach your goals!"

The company I just started working for isnt known for being very “software-y”, but at least I’m working in the IT department. But the things I do aren’t as related to computer science as I would like, mostly disassembling computers or following other workers and watching them troubleshoot printers, computers, etc. I feel like I’m not being utilized fully or being involved and just doing things the other workers dont want to do. I’m just afraid I am going to leave without any real projects I could talk about at future interviews. Is doing boring things and not learning a whole lot normal for a first internship or should I ask my supervisor for some more software-involving projects?"

I'm a third-year student in a top IIT and from an upper-class family. I had this question boggling up my mind for the past few weeks after seeing the endeavours of the current government and people of India and reading a lot of post from this subreddit about migrating for a better lifestyle.

My family and relatives have always persuaded me to migrate to a different country. Still, I was always against that because I don't want to be a minority and be uncomfortable living there. And also, I went to 2 internships, both incorporates and hated the corporate life (maybe too early to decide); hence decided to build a business of my own (in future). So, If I'm not wrong, it won't be straightforward for me to start a business in a different country where I don't hold citizenship. 

After having a peak of India going in a degenerative path in every possible way, that I, myself (who does not want to leave the country even though all of my cousins went abroad), has no hope for it. The climates getting worse, the country's getting more corrupt, taxes are fucked up, everything is evolving just backwards. And got more spooked after reading a comment by u/Training_Ad_2086 in a post, ""By 2025, a mass exodus of educated and resourceful Indians is very likely to start"", I'm not sure how accurate is that. Still, I also have a feeling that will happen shortly hence making the migration process more challenging. 

I am pretty positive that I will get opportunities to leave the country, but only in a corporate setup; hence I'm not sure about that. And also, ""losing"" hope in India hence will not be able to run a business or a start-up peacefully. I'm way too inexperienced to contemplate what to do and how to do it. So please, I request the wise to enlighten me on this problem of mine.

So I have a few questions which I have in mind,

1. Is India doomed?
2. If it is indeed doomed, is there any way to save it from this degenerative path?
3. Is it possible to start a business in a country where I don't have citizenship?
4. If not, what options do I have

I really need some outside perspective to clear up this fog.

I graduated recently from a rather affluent and elite college. However, it took me, on/off, a total of about 6 years to graduate due to personal problems and mental health issues. 

I initially didn't even plan to go to school for CS; I took a programming course and discovered I liked to problem-solving. Then, by my junior year, I really had little to no other options in majors except CS.

With that being said, I never did any internships during college. I didn't have many friends or get to build a network or anything. 

I got a job offer for a small tech company (not a startup, a subsidiary to a larger company). The people and the manager seem really cool, the benefits are great, and the role seems to fit my skill set well. I honestly don't deserve to complain. But recently I've been reminded of just how many of my peers are going to FAANG companies straight out of college and getting paid twice my salary. It's just a little discouraging. It's also making me worried about working for a smaller company instead of a larger one?

Idk if anyone else can relate to this feeling of comparison. I'm not even super passionate about tech, I feel like I just kind of fell here. Thank you in advance to any advice and tips here."

I am a Mechanical Engineering student. In September I will go to the US in order to accomplish a three-month internship and to study for one term afterwards.
Unfortunately, it is extremely hard to get an internship in the US as a foreigner. I used all contacts I have, LinkedIn, and career fairs but after roundabout 50 applications I didn‘t even have an interview. My fellow students who are traveling with me have similar experiences. 
I think one major problem are our grades. We are among the best students of our year (that‘s how we got this opportunity in first place) but our grades are looking bad in comparison to grades of US students. Most internships are requiring a minimum GPA of 3.0. In my country we don‘t have a grade inflation like in the US, a lot of us have GPAs below 3.0. I think many recruiters are rejecting us for that reason.

Do you have any tips for getting an internship under this circumstances? How can I get in touch with companies besides regular applications? (We all have J1-visa and working permits, so we do not require sponsorships)

Thanks a lot for your help."

I’m always eager to help people, I’m pretty good at learning new languages and I’m pretty funny if I say so myself. I have plenty of other good qualities as well, but I know no-one will ever know because of my social anxiety.

When I was maybe six years old I remember talking to a parent of one of my classmates. I think we were talking about pokemon or something. I was really social back then and always excited to talk to someone. Anyway, this took quite a long time and the next day some of my classmates laughed at me. “Are you gonna spend the next hour talking to my mom again?” They made fun of me for simply having fun and talking to someone. I don’t know why this was weird, but hey, we’re six years old. Everything is worth bullying someone over. Since then I’ve had major struggles interacting with others in any way. Any social interaction became a chore to me.

A few years later I stopped playing sports. I made up a story about how my teammates in my football team were bullying me so that my parents wouldn’t let me play in that team anymore. This was just one of the ways I made sure to limit any social interaction I would have. There were other ways of course. For example, I would eat my lunch on the disgusting school toilets. Literally smelling shit whilst eating my food, but it was better than sitting in the cafeteria.

Fast forward a few years and I notice a lump on one of my testicles. I knew this was potentially bad news, but I was way too socially anxious to go to the doctor about it. It wasn't the possible diagnosis that scared me, but the social interaction. 8 years later and the lump is still there and you guessed it; I haven’t seen a doctor for it. This is my main issue now. Even if something is potentially life-threatening, I still won’t do anything about it. Social anxiety has completely taken over my life. I can’t see a doctor or a therapist, I can’t get a job, I can’t get a drivers licence, I can't pick up my glass of water during dinner without shaking and now I can’t even play video games anymore because I will start shaking from anxiety so bad that I have to turn it off. I can’t even do any risk-free activities like playing a laid-back single player game without my anxiety kicking my ass.

To top it all off I was supposed to be looking for an internship as part of my bachelors for the past month, but haven’t done anything yet. I can’t put a resume together that tells the entire world that I have no job experience whatsoever and I especially can’t imagine having to actually contact these companies for an internship.

The thing is, I know how to fix this. Medication like propranolol will help ease these physical issues like the shaking I’m getting. CBT could help me overcome my social anxiety, and I know getting it is easy enough. It’s just a few phone calls away. I can’t do it, though. For the first time in my life I feel like giving up on myself. I can’t stand another 20 years or so of therapy, medications and whatnot. Even if after just 3 years I’m the least anxious person on the planet, it’s just not worth it.

The most frustrating thing here isn’t my anxiety, it’s my potential. I know the type of person I could theoretically be, but I’ll never be that person. Not because of some illness that will literally kill me before I could get there, but because it takes so much effort to get there that I’ve given up on myself. I just don’t see a way out at this point. (I’m not suicidal at all for those of you who are worried.)"

I’m a business student but have a strong background in CS, have been programming since I was quite young. Done a software engineering internship  and have developed full applications, and am working on one right now with the fund Im at. 

My idea with the MBA is to pursue entrepreneurship and hopefully find co founders and build my network, ultimately pursuing building a startup/founding one in tech. 

I was wondering how much this experience (PE + tech background) could help in MBA admissions to HSW &amp;amp; Sloan? I thought it’d give me a unique background but wanted second thoughts. 

I know this is a bit preemptive ask but I’m  trying to develop a plan for what my next few years will look like. 

Could my experience with PE and technology/cs be seen as a strength for deferred programs I mentioned above?

I recently was accepted into both App Academy and Year Up.  I have decided to make the switch from construction estimating into the world of software development, but I'm not sure which route is the best &amp; was hoping for some advice.  I saw that there is a list of threads in the sub's FAQ, but most of the threads were 6 to 7 years old, and also none had the specific alternative of a program like Year Up addressed in it.  

Brief background:  I've been in construction estimating for \~5 years.  Most recent salary was $55k, but I've earned as high as $80k (super shitty job).  It's not that I hate estimating, but I never intended to be in the field for as long as I was &amp; I have a unique opportunity where **I can afford to not work for \~12 months &amp; focus on making a career change**.  I know that I could try to learn on my own and develop my own portfolio, but honestly I feel better about picking a pre-defined path with some structure.  Also, little to no coding background.  Most of my ""coding"" has just been in VBA, setting up macros for Excel (which I love to do).  **My minimum salary requirement is \~$50k/year** though depending on cost of program 

&amp;#x200B;

**Option 1:  Year Up.**  

\-6 months training, 6 months corporate internship.  (Starts in September)

\-Can start applying for jobs September 2022 (if not hired by corporate internship to stay on full-time)

\-No guaranteed job, but they do have job placement services following the program.  

\-Costs $0 and even has a small (\~$1200/month) stipend for living expenses.  

\-Language taught is Java.  

\-Average salary following program that is advertised is $40k, but I have a bit more general work experience and education than most students.

\-Side note:  This program is less-intensive &amp; the hours are better for holding a part-time job during the program, but it does come with a potential commute (if they go back to in person) of between 30 min-1 hour (depending on where my wife and I buy our new house).

&amp;#x200B;

**Option 2:  App Academy.**  

\-6 month bootcamp (Starts end of June)

\-Can start applying for jobs end of December 2021

\-""Guaranteed"" job placement (deferred payment until you have a job).  

\-Costs 15% of annual salary up to 3 years or $31k, as long as you are making a minimum of $50k.  

\-Languages taught are JavaScript and Python. 

\-Average salary is advertised at \~$80-85k, though I fear that is inflated by their main offices operating out of high cost of living areas (San Francisco &amp; NYC).  (Note: $80k salary, minus 15% comes out to $68k, but since this is paid after taxes, we'll call it equivalent to \~$65k).

'

I'm hoping to get any advice I can.  Obviously App Academy comes with a fairly high price tag, but getting to start working 8 months sooner helps alleviate some of that (depending on actual salary, of course).  I do have some personal connections through my family to the business that is running the corporate internship for Year Up, though, so I feel confident I could land a job there following Year Up.

Ultimately, while money matters, I want to make sure I'm making the correct decision to set myself up for a successful start to a new career path.  So any advice you can give me is highly appreciated.

EDIT:  Update, I have officially accepted the position at Year Up.  I'll leave the thread up just in case it helps anyone in the future.  Thank you to everyone who commented."

THIS is not a fairy tale. My story is the reality for a subpar Asian male student from one of the most competitive East Asian nations. *Happy endings* are an illusion for life, so we settle for the ones that seem more satisfactory.

I graduated a week ago in May 2021 as an intl. student. The end of the journey is always only the start of something new.

I hated and cried by the end of this college application season. I went around telling people that I AM CONVINCED Tufts will accept me in ED1 due to my overconfidence and then to have a rejection *thrown in my way*. Meanwhile, my classmates got in, and they celebrated while I was at the same place! I could not process the moments, so I started drinking vodka until I had to clean up my junior's puke. (I took care of her well, she eventually became one of my best friends on campus.) Everything starts to go downhill from here.

I only got into my EA schools and successfully failed to be accepted at any school I applied to RD. When I am a low-income, first-generation and international student, people tell me *to be satisfied* with the financial aid given to me already!

""*You should be grateful.*""

""*Rejecting the slot will be jeopardizing our relationship with the university!*""

""*Don't you know that your package worths more than your entire family assets?*""

I seem to treat their comments lightly, only in my mind, I feel *f\*\*king irritated*. There is a storm within me, and it's raging.

""No, I deserve more.""

A moment of silence.

""But what if I were *never* good enough?""

The waves dragged me down as I drowned in my misery. Some people are going to the same university as I do. They have stable friendships or are engaged in romantic ones. Meanwhile, I slave myself away at numerous venues for the past two years only to receive *this result*? No..., no, I cannot take this result. I have always abided by the rules, treated people with respect, and handled my work with responsibility. A classmate who ate instant noodles and stayed up until 4 am, got into an Ivy. They preached about participation culture yet did not show up for nearly any meeting until the end of our academic year, even for a *crucial one for wrapping up* our project on campus. They got into an Ivy. I sound like a bitter loser because I am, and perhaps I never have worked hard enough for what I wanted. The world does not see the fatigue or sadness that goes behind a high school student's mind. It is about the credential, outcome, and success. I've worked so hard, and now, someone will undermine my work by the name of my university.

""Why didn't you apply to universities in the U.S. from your previous high school? You didn't have to travel all the way abroad for an international school?"" *Fuck*, this question has been in my mind for so long. Now, I doubt my experience, the life that I've lived, and the memories that I've created. I've let elitism drag my thoughts into a pit of mud. When I was in a subpar (*kinda bad*) private high school, full of kids who had no motivation to study but to pass, I never pitied myself. I elected myself into Student Council, represented my country in environmental education, and tutored students of all ages in English. I always believe that a good student will shine in the darkness. However, now, I strongly question my abilities and the merits of working hard. For certain *depressing*, *suicidal* moments, *I pitied myself*. There seems to be no purpose. I will continue to have people saying that I'm hardworking and clever. Yet, I get fucking angry, fucking angry, when people said that. If I were representing such attributes, I wouldn't be here *venting on Reddit*.

After knowing that Wesleyan's waitlist had closed for good, my mind shattered. I struggled to finish my final English IB exam, for I was almost too depressed to step into the test center. Since I took Theatre, I tried to recall any good memory to survive the preparation period for the test and then, emerging out of it, burned out. I couldn't pull myself up together. Until today, I see my friends updating their Facebook profiles with the universities they are attending and posts on Instagram celebrating their success with the closest friends—I feel like a bitter loser again.

I've decided to take a gap year to start over. I want to take a break from the environment that everyone wants to get into a T20 and me feeling stupid. I should be aware that I am not anyone else for comparison is the source of true unhappiness. Maybe I will reapply to college, find a working opportunity, look for an internship, or don't go to college for as long as I want.

See you soon, r/A2A, I love you and will return if I decided to reapply to colleges. If not, it has been a pleasure to receive advice from strangers, for those (un)pleasant ones have encouraged me to look straight into my soul for an answer to keep going. **I will keep working on my passions and advocating for issues that I care deeply about.** This is not the end, but something new. 

P.S. Don't judge me, I wrote this while being half-sober, half-tipsy/drunk. Thank you, I just needed to be honest with how I feel. ;)))"

nnw9dn,7,2021-05-29,[UK] Robotics engineer offer,jimothybearimy,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/nnw9dn/uk_robotics_engineer_offer/,"Hi!

I've been made an offer for a robotics engineer role in the UK.

The role has a significant amount of travel included, but is quite software-based in duties (think Python, C++ for ROS).

As for me, my original background isn't CS (engineering, ~mechatronics), but I got a MSc in CS at one of the top unis in the UK (edit: but not oxbridge). Also have internship software experience and a year's experience where software was a tangential subject.

The offer is for 47K, 20 days leave (edit: +8 bank holidays), stock options and that jazz.

The salary is quite good, but leave a bit less so, this was kind of expected as my employer is US based.

Do I have room to negotiate for more leave? I think between travel and the average in the UK being around 25 days I can make a strong case. My last role also offered 24 days. It's also a really good fit in many ways that make me a somewhat unique candidate.

Any insights from UK engineers? I feel bad when the salary is quite good, but I do value my free time also.

EDIT: I'm assuming the salary is a very good offer. Is it as good as I think it is? Or is it just what to expect in CS? (It's a significant bump over my last role where I felt underpaid but doing it for experience)"

nnxbzs,14,2021-05-29,Ashamed of internship?,Mission_Carob6362,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/nnxbzs/ashamed_of_internship/,"Hi! I (20F) am a rising junior at a non-target school studying Finance, and I’ve always had a lot of trouble narrowing down what I want to do and where I want to go within finance. Especially being surrounded by so many people who have a pretty set roadmap ahead of them, this has created a lot of insecurities for myself and a sense of imposter syndrome with whether I am “meant for” finance. I’ll be honest and say that I’m not the best student, but I do well enough, and I’m good at sprucing up my resume to at least make it seem like I know a lot about finance.

This past year, I’ve been stressing myself out to the nines, working on myself, my resume, and my interview skills to work towards securing a summer internship for 2021, and towards the end of my semester, it seemed like everything was falling into place. After cramming interviews in amongst my last classes and finals, I started to get a couple offers, mostly from smaller companies and startups (that’s mostly where I focused my attentions.) Here’s where my issue starts to kick in— I accepted an offer as an intern working on this company’s payroll team, keeping in mind how much they would be paying me (substantially more than any other offer, and with COVID throwing my finances into a whirlwind— the money was definitely a welcome factor in my decision) and that the company is undergoing an IPO soon (honestly just a cool thing that I thought would be interesting to at least minutely take part in.) What really brought on my insecurity was the dreaded LinkedIn feed— I know that I’m assuredly going to get value out of this internship and learn a lot, but compared to some peers who are readily posting their “I’m so excited to announce...” posts, with “Incoming Summer Analyst @ Whatever BB” in their headlines, I feel so inferior! I know that I don’t want to take the same route as some of my peers (IB is definitely not a culture fit for me, and I’m still trying to explore some other options), and this company seems like a great option for me otherwise (culture, pay, learning— what more could I need?) While the team I’m apart of is part of the finance department, I can’t help but compare myself to my peers and feel inferior, especially when thinking about some of my more ambitious ideals for my career. I’ve talked to the recruiter in charge of me about wanting to branch out into helping across some of the other teams in the finance department, and what with this being a startup, I have no doubt that I’ll be able to take on small projects to help out others and learn more. I’m very aware that, as compared to others, I’m super lucky, and I should say that I am 100% grateful for this opportunity, but I guess I’m just curious if anyone else has ever felt a similar insecurity in their internships/jobs and how they dealt with it? I’d appreciate any insight into your own experiences."
nnxdbw,1,2021-05-29,Switching to CS my senior year,FinancialMongooses,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nnxdbw/switching_to_cs_my_senior_year/,"Right now I am entering my senior year of my Economics major, but I'm finding that I regret not making the switch to CS. I started taking some coding classes on the side this past year and found that I truly enjoy programming and find it a much more interesting and rewarding subject then finance. I started talking to the computer science school advisors and they said that I can add the software engineering or computer science major, but I'll have to graduate a semester late and continuously take courses over the summers. I don't mind the extra school and classes it if it helps me move into a career path I want and a subject I'm genuinely interested in. However, with that said I'm incredibly worried about what my job prospects would be after college if I did make this switch. From what I've read, graduating without an internship can be devastating to your job prospects and I don't think I'll be able to get one with my rushed classes and lack of availability over summer. I've read that you can supplement your resume by making projects on the side, but I worry that I won't be able to build a strong enough portfolio with the late transition. I've been lucky enough to maintain a 3.93 GPA over my time in college and know I can maintain it if I did make the transition, but once more from what I've read GPA doesn't matter much especially if your project are lacking. I feel so ashamed for having not realized my interests before college and picking the right degree. I want to make things right, but I'm so worried I won't be able to make it work. For anyone that did make a late transition, did you find that it was worth it or did it just waste your time?"
nnxh25,2,2021-05-29,How hard for me (graduating uni senior) to get into an IT related job?,ricedealer97,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/nnxh25/how_hard_for_me_graduating_uni_senior_to_get_into/,"Hi all, I'm a graduating university senior (this Fall) with a B.S. in Computational Data Sciences (machine learning focus) and will start my job hunt soon nearing when I graduate. I was wondering if I could possibly split up my decided career pathway between cybersecurity and machine learning engineer and go with whichever I get an offer for.

I worked as a lead sysadmin in high school for about 3-4 years at my uncle's local hospital so I have rudimentary knowledge of server hardware/software setup, networking protocols, virtualization platforms, general IT management, etc. I also got my A+ cert my junior year of high school but I might need to renew it since it's probably expired and I plan to renew it along with maybe a Network+ cert as I study in tandem with leetcode for my data sciences career path.

Despite that, my college career has been somewhat rocky. I didn't get stellar grades and will possibly graduate with a low 3.0 or even 2.8-2.9 GPA. I also didn't get any internship experience in data sciences so my future in this career is cloudy at best. Nevertheless, I did complete some relevant coursework in database management systems, SQL and NoSQL development and the like with decent grades, mainly due in part to my previous knowledge in SQL management procedures back in high school. I know you might be wondering why I never made use of my time in college to focus on machine learning projects or data science development experience, but that's another story

I was wondering how the job search will be for someone like me, and where/how I can start off with getting an entry level position either in IT or cybersecurity.  Do IT jobs have practical interview procedures like coding interviews for engineers that I need to study for? What kind of job positions could I expect to apply for? Thanks!"

I’m 14, so sorry if the shit I say comes off as odd. I’ll write the best I can

Anyway, I’m one of three kids in a family. All of us went/go to the same high school. Problem is? I’ve already done better than the two sisters I have. (Okay, I’m going to say here that there definitely is an exception here, because my second sister has a much different case. Forgive me if I say something that can be perceived as offensive.)

My first sister is currently 22. She was the first of us to go to high school. Unfortunately, she was also first place to have the worst grades her entire high school career. Her average was a C in freshman year (the year I literally just graduated from) and it was hell from there on out. She did one more year before switching to homeschooling, which the majority of time she slept instead of do any work. Then my dad, seeing how little she actually did, made her go back. But, her poor performance made her drop out of high school in 12th grade. Then she gets three jobs, MetroPCS, Goodwill, and SPENCERS. Fired from all three in short amounts of time. Gets more jobs such as Walmart and Target, and fired from those too for fights and excessive bathroom breaks (which were used to text people, not bathroom). She’s now a weed addict and works as a stripper due to extremely poor job record, and has an extreme victim complex if something doesn’t go her way or right. My dad warns me all the time to make good decisions and commonly refers to her about bad decisions. To be quite honest, I’m extremely scared for her future. I don’t want my sister to fail in life.

Then here is my second sister. **I am going to say now: May God bless her and love her for her entire life, and please know I do negate her from ‘failing.’** if that sounds odd. Let me elaborate. She was diagnosed with severe autism since she was a baby, and according to my dad, she has the mental capacity of a 10-year old. She graduated high school last year (Class of 2020) and is quite, for lack of a better term, stagnant. She will be in special education her entire life and my dad rants a lot about her at times, to which I usually say nothing because I don’t like venturing into things I barely know (ultimately I don’t know as much about autism as he does). She had an internship at the Olive Garden, but didn’t last long as she could only roll silverware. What I meant by negate was I know it is not her fault in any way, she cannot help it. My dad told me that she cannot ever be independent due to her condition. I wanna tell him that if she can get an internship once, I have hope she can get another. But I don’t know how to word this.

Then there’s me. I’m a 14 year old kid who just finished freshman year with honor roll both semesters. I’ve been working my ass off to have good grades because of not only my dad’s encouragement but just genuine pressure to be successful. I don’t think I have a choice anymore. 

I feel my life is going to be a dull, straight road with little turns. If I fail, my life is over. I don’t know how to feel anymore and I feel as though I’m on the verge of screwing up every day. I’m concerned about my sisters futures as well as mine, because neither are on the successful path my dad wants us all to be on.

I had been looking for internship opportunities since November, completed a lot of online coding and hard skills tests, did a lot of interviews etc. I decided to update my LinkedIn account (experience, education, skills, projects, languages, certifications), put a nice profile picture and a nice banner. I precised on my profile that I was looking for a summer internship.

When I was starting to lose hope, I was contacted by a Amazon recruiter, for a business data analyst position, via a LinkedIn private message. I applied for the position using her link, had a few tests and interviews, and got the role. I then spoke with my to-be manager about the incoming internship, and he agreed to focus it on data science rather than data analysis or business intelligence.

This is how I got a DS internship at Amazon, by keeping my LinkedIn clean, up to date, with the good keywords. I did not get any positive response from the other +40 intern positions I applied for.

Feel free to ask any questions. I might be a little bit flexing, but I thought it could really help you guys. Sometimes, you gotta let people come to you, but you have to prepare for this opportunity and not have a blank or basic LI profile."

I’m unsure if I should accept, because I don’t know that I’ll be competent. I’m a recent graduate from a degree that isn’t computer science, but somewhat related - my program focused on game development/ design and 3D/2D animation, with some programming courses (oriented towards building games in Unity). I took fundamental CS courses and struggled through them, failing two. So at all stages of the interview process, I tried to tell them I was no longer interested, because I didn’t think I was competent enough. The interview process was mostly me talking about my experiences in game development and the internships I’ve had. Somehow I was given an offer.

For the last 2-3 years, I’ve had sights set on a career in product design, by learning what I could on the side outside of school, and working on things for my portfolio.  I’ve been applying to UX/UI roles but I still have a lot more work to do on my portfolio, which would take probably months.

I tried to be a computer science major in college, but I struggled through coding classes, and could never get my code to work without help. The internship I had as a programmer solidified why I don’t think I’m meant for software, and would enjoy UX/ UI more. I could tell that my manager and team at that job was expecting me to be better at coding and have more knowledge than I did. For example, I was struggling to write SQL code and had to get help with more complex queries. He picked up on my lack of skill and gave me visual design focused assignments. My reviews were good at the end, but I think it had more to do with my work ethic. I didn't get a return offer.

I don’t want to be in a situation where I’m incompetent again. I’m willing to self-study and put in the work by practicing what I can for this job, but don’t know if it’s realistic that I’ll compare to SWEs with a whole degree in CS that I don’t have.

Throughout all my experiences in tech/ engineering, I’ve felt like an outsider who has little understanding of what’s going on.  On the other hand, design feels more natural.  I’m also just a lot more interested in solving design problems than I am in technical problems.

I’m considering taking this job as I continue to work towards a career in product/ UX design. My biggest concern is that I’m not a CS major and not a strong programmer - that I’ be an actual impostor.

As I’m hoping people here have more experience than I do, I wanted some opinions.

Is it possible to overcome the fact that coding isn’t a strength, while working on the job?

Is someone like myself likely to end up being a bad hire for the company?

Is it realistic to believe I could accept this job and work at being competent through self study?

Any resources I could use that helped you get better at coding and understand the concepts more clearly? this is what I've always struggled with."

I know that this sort of a question is best asked after completing about half of your internship during your mid-internship review or at the very end of the internship but I want to know if there is a sneaky way to phrase this question so that I can ask managers now (3 weeks before the internship starts) as to whether I can get a full-time return offer if I do well."

I got laid off from my software engineer job and took some time to re-evaluate things. I've been a Software Engineer for the last \~4-5 years, but I'm not sure if I'm cut out for it. I got my start in IT as a network tech and always enjoyed my Cisco networking academy classes which helped me earn an AAS degree about a decade ago. I stayed in IT ops for a while, but ended up going the sysadmin route and eventually wound up going back to school and getting a SWE internship (and worked for Cisco after graduating, funnily enough).

But I'm just kind of burned out on SWE, I think. I don't really enjoy trying to keep up with the combinatorics of front-end/back-end languages, technologies, frameworks, testing libraries, dependencies, etc. I enjoy problem-solving and logic, but I really struggle with the abstract mathematical thinking required for data structures &amp; algorithms, etc. I'm a reasonably talented programmer, but I'm best at scripting for performing/automating concrete tasks rather than designing/implementing new abstract features.

I'm hoping to get some feedback about what my options are. I want to be able to WFH 100% (even post-covid), so I'm thinking something cloud-based is probably going to be best. I had a Network+ cert that expired years ago, but could probably pass the CCNA after a quick update/refresher.

Cloud Network Engineer? DevOps? What's the reasonable play here?"

I’m currently medically withdrawn from school. I cannot believe I got to this place, but I got so depressed that I couldn’t get out of bed. 

So, in March, I admitted myself into a psych hospital’s partial-hospitalization program for 3 months. 

I’ve always struggled with mental health, but never took it seriously; my negligence  clearly took its toll. 

I need pragmatic advice for my next steps, please. Here’s my situation. 

I attend(ed) a small, but acclaimed, college for engineering. Until my junior year/mental break, I was doing very well. I had 4 internships in the 3 years I was there, published scientific research, orchestrated independent projects with my classmates, got invited to and attended major conferences in my field, and my GPA never dipped below a B-. 
Then, the second half of my junior year—with just two semesters left—everything fell apart. 

It started with my best friend dying tragically young in an accident. That broke me, but I tried my best to shove it all to the side and keep moving. Then, COVID happens just months afterwards. I guess the instability and shocking nature of the events transpiring in my life were just too much for my brain to handle. I stopped going to my Zoom classes, I stopped eating (not in an attempt to lose weight, I just didn’t care anymore) and went from 140 pounds to just 107. I lost my internship due to no-call-no-showing. I began abusing substances. It was a very, very dark 2020. 

I failed all of my classes. 

However, one day in March of this year, I decided that I need to swallow my pride before I killed myself, inadvertently or otherwise. I called a mental hospital and was admitted into a five-week-long partial-hospitalization program, where I would be from 8 in the morning until 4 in the afternoon. Due to the intensive nature of the program, I medically withdrew from my college. 

I feel so much better now and I am so grateful that I took such a big step in my recovery. 

I am moving to a new city and need a fresh start. I miss school so much, but my GPA is far too low for any school to take me. If I go back to my old college, which I loved so much, there would be no way for me to graduate because my GPA is so low there. What do I do?"

I'm not really satisfied because the career growth isn't proceeding, my only perspective for now is only to develop more code and maybe talk with other offices to find new opportunities, and I have no possibility to be employed by the client (software analysis is not a priority for those who work with engines). This was also my first job after graduation.

Last week i found a job post for a Field Application Engineer for Mechatronics Components, I'd have to deal with R&amp;D department and client requirements. The skills are quite met due to my Mechatronic Engineering degree. I know that the company environment is nice because i had an internship here years ago. It is a small company with few important clients. For this job i would have to relocate to my home town and be closer to family and friends.

To resume:

PROs : leaving a job that isn't satisfying and that isn't bringing me any growth, be closer with my family and friends, increase of salary (+25%), leave a type of employment (consulting) that exploit me

CONs: complete new experience and fear to leave something i can deal for a job that i actually i have to learn from the beginning. Fear to find stuck in that position due to the company dimensions.

Probably what i need is a kick to do it but i'd like to hear your opinion, especially from other engineers.

At the time I applied, I didn't look at the syllabus of ECE (with focus on Computer). Now, as it is the time for registration, I am really surprised about the strong presence of Electrical Engineering courses in the curriculum. I feel like I made a bad decision( by choosing ECE and taking Calc 1- Calc 4 in CC) and there has a 90% chance that, I will transfer to SAS for CS major after the Fall semester.

Now, I need your advice on my course selection for Fall that best works for me to transfer to CS. I did some research, and find that I can take CS 111 instead of 252. For CS 112, I am not sure about the prerequisite from reading the course description. But, I guess, I cannot take CS 112 before CS 111 as data structure needs exposure to the basics of programming. I did took an introductory programming course in python in my CC and also following a data structure course online. I am really disappointed that, I will not be able to complete CS 112 before Spring 2022 and that could give me advantages for internship interview on the next summer.

Beside CS 111, what other courses  can I take in the upcoming fall. I have plan to take bare minimum (12 credits, to maintain full time for financial aid). Below is the courses I took in CC for associate degree-

Calc 1 - 4, Phy 1 and 2, Chem, Eng writing, all required Hum/Soc courses, Comp. Arch and Asmb. Lang, Intro to OS , and a introductory python course."

This is my real, very first post on reddit so please be patient with me, and mods please if I do something wrong please go ahead and tell me so I can correct it next time.

Today, I'm a 23 unemployed Swiss dude with no papers or graduations whatsoever, or accomplishments in his life. 

(I'm sorry in advance if this is a mess, I'm writing this on the spur of the moment and have never been good narratively).

When I was a kid, I had a lot of problems (as probably like many others). I was heavily bullied in the small village I lived in, my dad had died when I was 3 years old of lung cancer which apparently had left some sort of trauma in me that I could never notice directly. My mom owned a restaurant/bistro which had living quarters upstairs and that's were we lived since when I was born. I lived with her, my half bro and half sis who were both 10 and 7 years older than me. As I mentioned, I was getting bullied almost daily by the kids in my village. I never had friends and was often thrown into the village fountain we had next to the bus stop to go to school, which made me backtrack and head back home often to change and had my mom stop work to drop me off there. The biggest problem I had and I'm, even today, extremely ashamed to admit it, but one of my problems (apparently tied to my dead father trauma) was that I could never go to the bathroom to relieve myself (feces) and used to wear diapers until very late. I stopped wearing them after being a few years old but the problem followed me further into my life.  When I got to the age of 8, we moved out of there and started living in a big city, where nothing was better. I joined a new school, where the problems I had were still very apparent. I didn't want to be with anybody and would still have the same toilet issues. It would smell bad and people obviously disliked it. I was then a year later thrown into a special class with only 6 other kids who also had problems and where the teachers would work with us more slowly. Its a good time to mention that I've never been smart at all or studious. I wasn't a troublesome kid but I had nothing good going for me. I don't really remember how many years I spent in that school, but at some point the problems I had were becoming increasingly problematic for a kid so my mom was forced to put me into a boarding school for 2 years after having spent 3 weeks in the hospital to try and help me out. This was a hard time for me, having to be separated from home and my family for the week. As far as I can remember, I had a lot of great experiences there because the teachers were great and the other kids wouldn't really bother me. I for the first time had a few people I could call friends, with which we used to play Pokemon on our Nintendo DSs and such. During those years, my toilet problems finally seemed to be gone and I could go to the bathroom and relieve myself like a normal person. After those 2 years, I was reintroduced into a more normal class in an other school, where again we would only be a few kids but we worked more on studies and grades. Next year was the year I finally was introduced into a normal class again. I was, at the time, 3 years away from finishing normal school. It was probably the worst class I had been in yet tho. I joined it mid-year for some reason and so was put into a class were people knew each other already and had groups left and right. I remember I was still very introverted and didn't want to attract too much attention, but the other kids let me know very clearly they didn't like me. I was very soon put into a situation so difficult that I couldn't process anything when I was at school, and my grades had dropped so low that they let me pass the year but put me into a lower-grade class for the remaining 2 years. Its during that hellish year that my older brother gave me his Xbox and I finally had something I could enjoy doing fully. I would play Mw2, halo reach, borderlands and such every time I had the occasion, I wouldn't do anything else during my free time anymore. I would even wake up 1-2 hours early each day to play the games some more with people I had met online. The remaining 2 years were fine, people were nice in my class but I didn't really have anybody I could call friends in it, but the ambiance was good enough so I could enjoy it. I then graduated from school.  but as I still had no idea what I wanted to do in life as nothing seemed to be enjoyable, so if I wanted to get into highschool I had to do an additional year with more difficult stuff to learn so I'd be caught up from the normal-grade class I was ''demoted'' from. During this year I found what I could call real friends which I still have contacts with today which is good to mention I believe. After that year which I passed with ok grades, I went into highschool since I still couldn't find an apprenticeship, I had yet to know what I wanted to do in life. I was at the time 1 or 2 years older than the average kid.

**Here is the part that starts to be a little bit more important in my opinion to today's events, but still part of my background.**

So I joined highschool, and the first and second years were pretty uneventful, I had failing grades in a few subjects but I still barely passed. I had some great times and most people were nice. Getting to my 3rd and ''final'' year, something had changed. I don't know why and how, but I slowly started getting depressed. I cursed to hell every day I had to spend there, and right around February, I lost the strength to go there. It started slowly throughout the first part of the year where I would skip 1 or 2 days of school, then at some point I just stopped going at all. Maybe because it was of the stress of finals coming and I knew I wasn't prepared, I could never remember anything I learned there for more than a month, So I got to my 3rd year without remembering anything I had learnt until now. I knew I was going to fail. School was very easy I always felt. You learned basic stuff, and there wasn't much of it. But highschool to me was different. I always got away with studying the night before because I just didn't have fun learning all those subjects and facts everyday there. German, history, maths, psychology, I just had no interest or fun in learning any of those things. I wouldn't go and would stay hidden in the dark in my room until my mom had left. Yeah, I'm a pos. I knew her and I knew she wouldn't understand, she would cursed me to death and would throw me back there by force if she knew, but I felt extremely anxious and out of place now in this class that I used to enjoy being part of. My mom was very strict in a lot of ways but only to some extent, she knew first hand I had a difficult childhood so she gave me space and time for the things I enjoyed doing on the side, but its different when it came to school and grades. I should have always done more and better to her, I could've been happy having good grades but she'd often them me it could've been better, so of course if she knew i was skipping she'd kill me. I didn't want to see or talk to anybody from that class either anymore, and I think it was the same for them. All those people I felt ''close to'' didn't give a shit that at some point I'd just stop coming all together. The stress and guilt were too heavy to try and go back, but the days she'd wouldn't have to work, I'd feign going in the morning and hang out in a café just waiting for the time to pass. I was so scared of going back, even when I left the house to go somewhere I didn't have the strength to bring myself there. After a month of fully not going, one day that my mom didn't work, we received a letter in the mail saying they hadn't seen my for a while and of course, my mom exploded. She called me while I was supposedly on my way to school telling me we received that letter, so I went back home, tried to explain myself and got the beating of a lifetime. She yelled, cursed, pulled my hair and said all sort of stuff you'd expect, rightfully so. My mom legit hated me for a few months because I had lied to her about going to school. At this time they sent me to see a psychologist, my mom never understood nor wanted to understand my problems, but my sis alongside our family doc convinced her to try and send me to one. After 6 seances, nothing really came out of it, I don't ever remember what we talked about with her but we just stopped because there was no point, I didn't want to go and talk to her, until now I never really felt comfortable talking to people about what I had inside my head without bursting into tears and feeling like shit. Remember that I've always been introverted to an extent, so outside of school and online friends  I wouldn't talk to anyone and didn't want to spend time outside of my room.  My mom since the moment she knew I didn't go she just wouldn't talk to me for a long time unless forced to. That had me fucked up for a while. I was still in a very bad mental state at the time, and since I had no other choice but to repeat the year and go back in August, which was like 4 months later, I just went. But I couldn't. I went there for a few weeks, but I felt miserable. All the time. I was around 3 years older than most, everyone knew each other and frankly speaking, I wasn't interested in getting to know them. I wasn't interested, but I still felt out of place and looked upon as a nuisance or a bug that shouldn't be with them in that classroom. So I did it again. But this time, I caught the letter they sent home and destroyed it. I didn't have the willpower or strength to go to school for every reason in the world, but I could never face my mom again with the same shit happening the next year, after I told her I'd go. I was in a pit hole getting crushed by anxiety and guilt. Every day and every night. I'd cry on my own and acted as if nothing was wrong because *I never felt understood anywhere*, what would the point be of trying once again to explain my situation, I knew how it would end up. So I just acted for months until the end of the year and just announced that I had failed. Even then my mom was pretty fucking angry and would yell at me and would constantly ask herself what she did wrong as a mother as if it was her fault, which I knew it wasn't, but seeing her like that hurt like hell on top of knowing what I had done this repeated 3 year that I didn't attend and kept hatting myself for a while. 

**Still background, but I'm gonna mention my professional life from here on out which is much more important than my school years probably.**

So, after those events, I had to go to the army(June to October 2019). It's mandatory in Switzerland so I had no choice since I was ''done'' with my studies, but I felt like it would be a great 4 months. I have no idea why, but I had positive apprehensions about it. Boy was I fu\*\*\*\*\* wrong. Probably the thing I hated the most in my life yet. More than anything. It was hell everyday, I felt like I was useless, I didn't know how to properly do anything, I always had to rely on my other comrades and I was exhausted to 200% everyday. I was getting yelled at everyday and the stress was on an other level. Some of the recruits were nice, but the other half were bullies. Once again. They would sometimes be ok-ish nice, and others utterly annoying and mean. Fortunately, when they saw I was having a hard time with anything ,even if they were a bit angry, they'd help me out. The other recruits who I got along well with were the nicest people out there. I was decently obese and asthmatic since I was around 10. So sports weren't really my thing, but they really pushed me up and helped me out when I needed it, even our sergeants. They knew I was trying so most of the times when it was something physical they'd be understanding that I couldn't do it as well. It seems nice at first, but it was still hell. This kind of environment wasn't for me, getting yelled at constantly, having to do things over and over and over, learning stuff I didn't like doing (out of all things I had to work as a firefighter in the swiss bunkers). I was given the little motivation I had in my by my friends helping me out constantly and trying their best to support me, but I felt like a weight all the goddamn time and I hated it just as much as everything else. I somehow ended my service like everyone else and finally got home.

Since I didn't have anything, my sister found me a job in the shop she worked a few weeks after I was done with the military and I started working there with an ''Extra'' contract, meaning I was an ''Extra'' and would just do the same work as anyone else but they'd just give me hours of work when they needed another person in the shop. I was still very much introverted and didn't want to interact with other at too much, but it was fine since it meant I was getting paid well for the low amount of work I had to do. I was still mostly happy tho, I had just come out of what I felt like was hell, and I could finally earn a little bit of money to help out. My brother and I were still living with our mom, my sister had moved out a few years ago already. That's why I could do it, only working a few days per week, sometimes 2-3, other weeks maybe 4, and of course for christmas I worked full time but I was still fine with it. as it was 1 month and after that I knew I could get new parts for my PC(only hobby). Then Covid came, and so I didn't have to work for 2 months, but during summer we opened again and I'd go work a few hours each week since there weren't many customers coming at the time. We got to November of last year and I unfortunately lost my job. My sis had quit since she wanted to start new studies and some other of my colleagues did as well, so the shop got a brand new staff and since they didn't need the ''Extra'' anymore as they had enough full-time employees, I was laid off.

# Today (main subject)

So after losing my job in November, my mom told me I needed to find an apprenticeship. I didn't finish highschool and had pretty much nothing in my hands. But the more I thought about it, the more I knew there was literally nothing I wanted to do. I had experienced a few things in my life already, and no matter where I looked, there was nothing I was interested in. I had been able to work only a few days per week because at home both my mom and Bro were working to sustain us. I felt like the least annoying thing would probably be working as a computer-scientist, so I started sending letters left and right, but I never received a single positive answer. At 23, I hadn't graduated anywhere and only had a little bit of work experience, so no one was interested in me. I was actually supposed to find an apprenticeship in 2020 but with Covid and me still being pretty confused about what I wanted to do in my life, I ended up still working at my previous job without looking for an option. 

A thing I forgot to mention concerning my health alongside that I'm pretty fat (100+Kg) and my asthma, is that since around being 20 years old, I started having a lot of bowel pains and painful, long lasting diarrheas. After some tests, we knew I was lactose intolerant (and not gluten), so I started avoiding everything containing it, but to no avail. It wasn't ever *too* annoying but it was still there, during the army there were plenty of time where I felt like I was going to explode, and so did the other recruits (most likely because lots of water+heavy exercises=bowel movement). Same during my previous job, but they were very understanding. It was a small gift shop without too many customers(Bliss since I don't like having to interact too much with people as mentioned, and that I don't enjoy working in retail), so I could just go have bathroom breaks whenever I needed them. But those past few months it's becoming increasingly more severe. I had done some sample tests mid-2020 that I send to my doc, but they all came back negative. no parasites, no IBD, nothing. He thought it was either stress or food allergies. I'd like to point out that those would happen very often, it could be fine for a week once in a while but then every day for a full months I'll be having abdominal pains and would be stuck in the bathroom for hours each day.

So after never getting positive answers to the letters I sent to get an apprenticeship, my mom was getting pretty mad and annoyed that I couldn't find anything, so she started pushing me to find something else, like in retail. I know for a fact I'd hate it with all I have, the one job I had was a dream job, but wouldn't be able to sustain someone on their own with the amount of hours I had.  The only reason I thought about being a computer scientist was because I knew a few people who enjoyed doing it, and since I was always in front of a computer it seemed fine, but the more I thought about it, the more thinking about being in that environment scared the sh\*\* out of me. Having to deal with people, learning stuff, getting yelled at for anything,  As the years passes, I feel like I wanna distance myself more and more from everyone. I don't talk to my 2 best friends I had back in highschool, working with customers is hell, I quite frankly don't like the people around me, the amount of time my family had been unfair to me in so many different scenarios has made me not want to spend time with them more than I need to. The only times I enjoy being *here* is when I'm online. That's the only thing I can say makes me happy. Not going outside, not seeing friends, not spending time with family, no sports, absolutely not working,

Up until now, as I said, both my mom and bro were working full time to sustain us. My mom especially as she's been working her whole life doing many jobs for long hours as she had to take care of 3 children on her own with a little bit of help from her boyfriend. Now she's getting to a point in her life where she's sick, tired, and would like to finally be free in a few years so she can leave and retire peacefully.

I understand that I need to do something so I at least tried, so when my mom managed to get me an  internship in a multimedia shop through some contacts, I accepted. It's only 2 weeks long and with the experience I got I thought it should be fine. But no, it actually wasn't. I hate it. That's my very first full time ''job'' in a long time, and I genuinely do not understand how people can do that for the rest of their lives. Wake up at 6:45am, and come home at 7:30pm being so fucking exhausted you can do nothing but fall onto your bed? How? How do people even do this. I don't want life to be this. You just wake up early, got to a god awful day of work, come back late and can't do anything so you just sleep? It would be even worse if I lived on my own and there was all the other stuff you have to take care of in the house. I hate how life is about this unless you've got all the money you want in life. It's not worth it.

I've been depressed for a few months now, I hate my life, I don't know what I want to do, I have my own health issues who prevent me from having a normal job-life if I were to ever get one, and I don't find enjoyment in anything aside being with my online friends. Life still goes on and I need to do something, but I don't know what and how to. My mom is killing herself working until my bro, my sis and I find something stable (my sister is in trouble as well now, but with money and still hasn't finished anything to have a stable job, my bro works at 80% but that's the only thing he does, he can't do anything when it comes to housework). I know it's mainly my fault and I hate it, but I'm not able to do anything. I couldn't finish my studies, I don't do anything interesting, I couldn't get a better contract at my previous job, I can't keep friends. I've pretty much been a failure my entire life, everything I've done was trash and I've only been a pest to everyone around me. I can't keep a job, I can't get an apprenticeship, because I know I will not be able to finish it like Highschool. I've never had the willpower or strength to finish or do anything properly for the few years I've been here. I hate who I am and what I've done, and I don't want to keep being such a burden to my family.  don't like saying it, but I've previously thought about suicide, to me it seemed like the best option. I'm against a wall right now, and it feels like the only way out is banging my head hard enough on it until I drop. On one side, if I can't find an apprenticeship, which my mom made clear was the only path that would lead me to a normal life, but I know I wouldn't be able to do it. But if I don't, my mom is gonna keep suffering from it and she shouldn't. I wished many time to not be there, not be a burden to everyone around me, not be such a failure who can't coop with work and people. I've only ever enjoyed and been able to do one single thing in life and it's gaming, that's why I thought ''if only I could get motivated enough to be a streamer, even a small one with the bare minimum to live with''. I'd like to do it because the way I see it, it'd solve all my problems. I'd also maybe finally have people who'd like me for who I am and would enjoy me and my content, while being able to care care of my bowel problems more easily. But who knows if it's going to work, who knows if it's now just another waste of time while my mom is working everyday until she can retire in a few years. 

I just hate what my life has become. I'm a loser, a pos, I can't accomplish anything and never will be able to. I wish everything had turned out different, and wouldn't have had to pester everyone by just existing.

This is my real, very first post on reddit so please be patient with me, and mods please if I do something wrong please go ahead and tell me so I can correct it next time.

Today, I'm a 23 unemployed Swiss dude with no papers or graduations whatsoever, or accomplishments in his life.

(I'm sorry in advance if this is a mess, I'm writing this on the spur of the moment and have never been good narratively).

When I was a kid, I had a lot of problems (as probably like many others). I was heavily bullied in the small village I lived in, my dad had died when I was 3 years old of lung cancer which apparently had left some sort of trauma in me that I could never notice directly. My mom owned a restaurant/bistro which had living quarters upstairs and that's were we lived since when I was born. I lived with her, my half bro and half sis who were both 10 and 7 years older than me. As I mentioned, I was getting bullied almost daily by the kids in my village. I never had friends and was often thrown into the village fountain we had next to the bus stop to go to school, which made me backtrack and head back home often to change and had my mom stop work to drop me off there. The biggest problem I had and I'm, even today, extremely ashamed to admit it, but one of my problems (apparently tied to my dead father trauma) was that I could never go to the bathroom to relieve myself (feces) and used to wear diapers until very late. I stopped wearing them after being a few years old but the problem followed me further into my life. When I got to the age of 8, we moved out of there and started living in a big city, where nothing was better. I joined a new school, where the problems I had were still very apparent. I didn't want to be with anybody and would still have the same toilet issues. It would smell bad and people obviously disliked it. I was then a year later thrown into a special class with only 6 other kids who also had problems and where the teachers would work with us more slowly. Its a good time to mention that I've never been smart at all or studious. I wasn't a troublesome kid but I had nothing good going for me. I don't really remember how many years I spent in that school, but at some point the problems I had were becoming increasingly problematic for a kid so my mom was forced to put me into a boarding school for 2 years after having spent 3 weeks in the hospital to try and help me out. This was a hard time for me, having to be separated from home and my family for the week. As far as I can remember, I had a lot of great experiences there because the teachers were great and the other kids wouldn't really bother me. I for the first time had a few people I could call friends, with which we used to play Pokemon on our Nintendo DSs and such. During those years, my toilet problems finally seemed to be gone and I could go to the bathroom and relieve myself like a normal person. After those 2 years, I was reintroduced into a more normal class in an other school, where again we would only be a few kids but we worked more on studies and grades. Next year was the year I finally was introduced into a normal class again. I was, at the time, 3 years away from finishing normal school. It was probably the worst class I had been in yet tho. I joined it mid-year for some reason and so was put into a class were people knew each other already and had groups left and right. I remember I was still very introverted and didn't want to attract too much attention, but the other kids let me know very clearly they didn't like me. I was very soon put into a situation so difficult that I couldn't process anything when I was at school, and my grades had dropped so low that they let me pass the year but put me into a lower-grade class for the remaining 2 years. Its during that hellish year that my older brother gave me his Xbox and I finally had something I could enjoy doing fully. I would play Mw2, halo reach, borderlands and such every time I had the occasion, I wouldn't do anything else during my free time anymore. I would even wake up 1-2 hours early each day to play the games some more with people I had met online. The remaining 2 years were fine, people were nice in my class but I didn't really have anybody I could call friends in it, but the ambiance was good enough so I could enjoy it. I then graduated from school. but as I still had no idea what I wanted to do in life as nothing seemed to be enjoyable, so if I wanted to get into highschool I had to do an additional year with more difficult stuff to learn so I'd be caught up from the normal-grade class I was ''demoted'' from. During this year I found what I could call real friends which I still have contacts with today which is good to mention I believe. After that year which I passed with ok grades, I went into highschool since I still couldn't find an apprenticeship, I had yet to know what I wanted to do in life. I was at the time 1 or 2 years older than the average kid.

**Here is the part that starts to be a little bit more important in my opinion to today's events, but still part of my background.**

So I joined highschool, and the first and second years were pretty uneventful, I had failing grades in a few subjects but I still barely passed. I had some great times and most people were nice. Getting to my 3rd and ''final'' year, something had changed. I don't know why and how, but I slowly started getting depressed. I cursed to hell every day I had to spend there, and right around February, I lost the strength to go there. It started slowly throughout the first part of the year where I would skip 1 or 2 days of school, then at some point I just stopped going at all. Maybe because it was of the stress of finals coming and I knew I wasn't prepared, I could never remember anything I learned there for more than a month, So I got to my 3rd year without remembering anything I had learnt until now. I knew I was going to fail. School was very easy I always felt. You learned basic stuff, and there wasn't much of it. But highschool to me was different. I always got away with studying the night before because I just didn't have fun learning all those subjects and facts everyday there. German, history, maths, psychology, I just had no interest or fun in learning any of those things. I wouldn't go and would stay hidden in the dark in my room until my mom had left. Yeah, I'm a pos. I knew her and I knew she wouldn't understand, she would cursed me to death and would throw me back there by force if she knew, but I felt extremely anxious and out of place now in this class that I used to enjoy being part of. My mom was very strict in a lot of ways but only to some extent, she knew first hand I had a difficult childhood so she gave me space and time for the things I enjoyed doing on the side, but its different when it came to school and grades. I should have always done more and better to her, I could've been happy having good grades but she'd often them me it could've been better, so of course if she knew i was skipping she'd kill me. I didn't want to see or talk to anybody from that class either anymore, and I think it was the same for them. All those people I felt ''close to'' didn't give a shit that at some point I'd just stop coming all together. The stress and guilt were too heavy to try and go back, but the days she'd wouldn't have to work, I'd feign going in the morning and hang out in a café just waiting for the time to pass. I was so scared of going back, even when I left the house to go somewhere I didn't have the strength to bring myself there. After a month of fully not going, one day that my mom didn't work, we received a letter in the mail saying they hadn't seen my for a while and of course, my mom exploded. She called me while I was supposedly on my way to school telling me we received that letter, so I went back home, tried to explain myself and got the beating of a lifetime. She yelled, cursed, pulled my hair and said all sort of stuff you'd expect, rightfully so. My mom legit hated me for a few months because I had lied to her about going to school. At this time they sent me to see a psychologist, my mom never understood nor wanted to understand my problems, but my sis alongside our family doc convinced her to try and send me to one.

I was still in a very bad mental state at the time, and since I had no other choice but to repeat the year and go back in August, which was like 4 months later, I just went. But I couldn't. I went there for a few weeks, but I felt miserable. All the time. I was around 3 years older than most, everyone knew each other and frankly speaking, I wasn't interested in getting to know them.

I was still very much introverted and didn't want to interact with other at too much, but it was fine since it meant I was getting paid well for the low amount of work I had to do.

Now she's getting to a point in her life where she's sick, tired, and would like to finally be free in a few years so she can leave and retire peacefully.

I understand that I need to do something so I at least tried, so when my mom managed to get me an internship in a multimedia shop through some contacts, I accepted. It's only 2 weeks long and with the experience I got I thought it should be fine. But no, it actually wasn't. I hate it. That's my very first full time ''job'' in a long time, and I genuinely do not understand how people can do that for the rest of their lives. Wake up at 6:45am, and come home at 7:30pm being so fucking exhausted you can do nothing but fall onto your bed? How? How do people even do this. I don't want life to be this. You just wake up early, got to a god awful day of work, come back late and can't do anything so you just sleep? It would be even worse if I lived on my own and there was all the other stuff you have to take care of in the house. I hate how life is about this unless you've got all the money you want in life. It's not worth it.

I've been depressed for a few months now, I hate my life, I don't know what I want to do, I have my own health issues who prevent me from having a normal job-life if I were to ever get one, and I don't find enjoyment in anything aside being with my online friends. Life still goes on and I need to do something, but I don't know what and how to. My mom is killing herself working until my bro, my sis and I find something stable (my sister is in trouble as well now, but with money and still hasn't finished anything to have a stable job, my bro works at 80% but that's the only thing he does, he can't do anything when it comes to housework). I know it's mainly my fault and I hate it, but I'm not able to do anything. I couldn't finish my studies, I don't do anything interesting, I couldn't get a better contract at my previous job, I can't keep friends. I've pretty much been a failure my entire life, everything I've done was trash and I've only been a pest to everyone around me. I can't keep a job, I can't get an apprenticeship, because I know I will not be able to finish it like Highschool. I've never had the willpower or strength to finish or do anything properly for the few years I've been here. I hate who I am and what I've done, and I don't want to keep being such a burden to my family. don't like saying it, but I've previously thought about suicide, to me it seemed like the best option. I'm against a wall right now, and it feels like the only way out is banging my head hard enough on it until I drop. On one side, if I can't find an apprenticeship, which my mom made clear was the only path that would lead me to a normal life, but I know I wouldn't be able to do it. But if I don't, my mom is gonna keep suffering from it and she shouldn't. I wished many time to not be there, not be a burden to everyone around me, not be such a failure who can't coop with work and people. I've only ever enjoyed and been able to do one single thing in life and it's gaming, that's why I thought ''if only I could get motivated enough to be a streamer, even a small one with the bare minimum to live with''. I'd like to do it because the way I see it, it'd solve all my problems. I'd also maybe finally have people who'd like me for who I am and would enjoy me and my content, while being able to care care of my bowel problems more easily. But who knows if it's going to work, who knows if it's now just another waste of time while my mom is working everyday until she can retire in a few years.

I just hate what my life has become. I'm a loser, a pos, I can't accomplish anything and never will be able to. I wish everything had turned out different, and wouldn't have had to pester everyone by just existing.

I've already posted this on r/antiwork but maybe it's good to post it here as well.

People, after reading this, what would you recommend? I will take any advice, no matter how dark or how mean they seem to be.

nogzem,55,2021-05-30,"Bachelor's Degree, Unemployed For Years, Zero Work Experience, Stuck.",Throwaway43534532412,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nogzem/bachelors_degree_unemployed_for_years_zero_work/,"Preface:
I’ve read through a lot of the faq’s and kind of had a few of my questions answered but not sure if I should leave them just so you can get a better picture of my whole situation.  Also I’m unsure if those answers would be different now considering some of those threads are 5-7 years old and the landscape could be dramatically different, what with covid and all.

I have a BS in computer science from the University of Washington: Tacoma and I also live around the Seattle area.  I graduated two years ago and intended to take a few months off.  Before I knew it, I had spent two years doing nothing.  

Most of the time I feel like I suffer from imposter syndrome but then I'll visit subreddits like this one and feel like I really do know nothing.  I'll come across job search horror stories on the front page of Reddit from people who applied to hundreds of jobs with little to no success and they have great qualifications and experience, of which I have none.  I was a pretty good student but I assume the real world work in this field is nothing like solving the random problems you do in class.  If it indeed is like solving advanced algorithms and using calculus on a daily basis then I'm in even more trouble, even though I passed and got the degree.

I've had a burst of motivation recently and want to get back on track.  I have zero experience in the field and have no idea where to even begin.  It's all so daunting but I need to start somewhere.  Like school assignments, the hardest part for me is just getting started.

What I have going AGAINST me:

* I have zero work experience in the field, not even internship(s) 
* I now have a huge gap in my general work experience and understand that's frowned upon greatly
* I don't know what to put in the projects section of my resume as I haven't really done much outside of school projects, of which all the other students have done so I can't differentiate myself from the competition.  Any projects I have done on my own are mostly incomplete or just very simple programs that I made for fun that relate to my life.
* I've undoubtedly forgotten a lot from school, but could probably pick it back up if I grind/refresh for a few weeks.
* Computer science is very broad and I'm unsure what type of job I should be applying for or even where I should be looking (LinkdIn, Indeed, etc?)
* I live in the Seattle area and assume the competition is way beyond me
* I have huge confidence issues but at the same time I don't want to sell myself short.  I've never had a job where I had to negotiate my salary/benefits.  I'm afraid of getting stuck in a job where I'm being taken advantage of.  I really have no idea what my worth is.

What I have going FOR me:

* I got a degree.  I almost burnt out in the last year of college and I don’t think I can/want to get a master’s degree.
* Some might think I'm lazy, but I'm actually a hard worker and can grind/focus for long periods of time.
* I was a pretty good student.  Not the best, but maybe top 20-30%?
* I live in the Seattle area and although competition must be high, there's hopefully lots of jobs?
* I'm vaccinated, have transportation, and don't mind working in an office/cubicle.  Although, I do like Washington and want to remain local and not move out of state for a job.

Thanks so much if you actually took the time to read all that.  I could have added more but this is just what I can think of off the top of my head.  ANY advice is greatly appreciated! :)

**tldr**: Have a degree, unemployed for years, no work experience in the field, no idea where to begin.  Any help appreciated!

edit: I'm receiving quite a few replies and want to thank each and every one and also every new one!

edit 2: I'm using a throwaway account so I'm going to make an edit now in case I lose access to the account.  I think I've gotten a better perspective on my situation and myself thanks to all your replies.  Here's a list of some of the things I plan to do from here (not necessarily in order):

* Highly consider therapy (have to get insurance sorted out, see what's covered, if anything)

* Go through all my assignments in college and see what I'm proud of or which projects demonstrate desirable traits and add them to my resume

* Get back into the coding mindset.  Maybe learn to make some simple apps that I can use.  Practice (Leetcode, Codecademy, freecodecamp.com, etc)

* Finish my resume and LinkedIn profile.  Add a bunch of people on LinkedIn that have tried to reach out to me.

* Apply anywhere and everywhere

* After an indefinite amount of time if I'm having zero success or improvement, consider boot camp options (A number of people suggested this but I can't deal with the cost right now). 

* Thanks for helping me"

To elaborate on the title a bit more:

I am currently in my 3rd year as a Finance Student. In regards to Finance, my only knowledge of it is the stuff I have learned in my classes. I don't have any real experience in how to actually use the skills and knowledge that I got from these classes and it's making me worried every time I look for an internship. 

Every time I look for an internship, I see all these responsibilities and knowledge that are expected of the applicants. I can't help but feel like what I currently have will only lead to major issues if I were to somehow get those roles. I don't feel like I have enough knowledge and experience to do well in any of these Finance Internships. 

I was wondering if anyone can offer any advice on how I can go about this? Are there any programs that can help with learning how to apply these skills and knowledge? Are there any books? Anything I can do to practice in my free time so I can be ready for the actual real job situations?

I don't know what I want to do in life. I feel like a failure. I took general studies and honestly, COMING FROM SOMEONE WHO HAS ALMOST FINISHED THE DEGREE, it is fucking useless. I graduate this coming fall. I am in huge amount of debt. If I told you you would not believe me. It is well over 40,000. Yes, for my undergrad only. Fuck me.

My gpa is 2.7 because I failed a semester last year due to my depression and anxiety and the pandemic situation. And another failed course a couple years back. Other than that, I am a B average. I want to make the world a better place, but how can I do so with such a useless degree? Also, I can't do certain work because of my migraines (ex, things that would trigger my ptsd or anxiety, such as...well...any job in peace and conflict......fuck me. Fuck my life. I am so incredibly depressed. I can't tell anyone about it because I don't want to be committed. But feeling suicidal here. Just a little. What have I done? Survived incredible traumas, and grown a lot? Hell yea, but how is that worth taking out thousands and thousands of loans? Oh fuck, I am so stupid aren't I.

I'll be working from 1pm to 5pm (the internship program is in conjunction with the school). 

Now the benefits of the program include:
1. $15k earned (before taxes) by the end of the internship. Tremendous amount because I need alot of fin-aid
2. Provides work place experience and i think it is great for my major, business
3. They also help with FAFSA and applying to colleges and getting scholarships

Drawbacks:
1. The major reason im not considering doing the internship is cos i wont get to take AP Calc nex year and Idk if NOT taking Ap calc would be a disadvantage to me.
2. So I basically immigrated from another country to the  U.S at the start of the junior year. Now where I'm from we finish h.s by 16 so i was basically done with h.s. But,  I had to go back two years when I immigrated and my new school only took 12 credits from my former h.s transcript. During junior year my counselor only let me take Pre-Ap pre calculus (i had already completed 3 years of math) and no other AP classes (even tho i wanted to badly). My school offers 23 AP courses, if i take the INTERNSHIP, I would only have 3 AP courses on my transcript because the internship only allows me go to school for 5 periods then I go to work after.

Please guys, what should I do?"

(as a 23 years old with no real tech education and no German knowledge),xicolo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nopqtl/tech_industry_in_germany_how_do_i_get_in_as_a_23/,"TL;DR I’m 23, I’m stuck in Germany due to life stuff and I don’t speak German, I want to purse a career in IT but Internships and University education is not really available to non-German speakers, I can’t move back to my home country to get a real Computer Science degree due to lack of money, in the meanwhile becoming a full-functioning German student able to do exams, tests and discuss thesis in German seems too far-fetched and it’d take me a solid 3-4 years to just be able to start understanding basic lessons, and I’m trying to figure out what’d be a good career path.

Hi Reddit, I’m stuck. I’m turning 23 in a month and still feel behind in life and like I’ve wasted so much time. 

I love technology, I’ve been tinkering PCs since age 13, during my teenage years I was doing stuff with Linux, breaking things and installing stuff, sooner or later I’ve discovered programming and started writing my first lines of code with Python, later on I’ve approached web development and started creating basic websites and cool stuff. I was exceeding in math and related fields, loved logic games and puzzles.

While I was in High School I was basically mentally set to pursue a fruitful career in Computer Science, to go to University and study some Computer Engineering and then start my professional life at some software company, and from that escalate the ladder and probably reach a very well paid developer job.

But at one point, things changed. I finished High School and didn’t go to University, I totally lost interest in programming, I was barely thinking logically, and I spent a lot of time pursuing other stuff like online hustling, reselling, art, videomaking, etc. So basically my idea was to become a Social Media Manager, or start my own Business, or becoming a videographer, or start a youtube channel, or do a little bit of everything while figuring stuff out. I took one year off working part time jobs and personal projects, and then another, and then another.

Fast forward 3 years I did nothing that really matters professionally (and economically) in any of the fields I was interested to, my personal projects failed and I built no real skills/experience either (in fact my personal projects were not even that serious and I was not even trying that hard). I made some money and that kept me thinking that “I was about to do it”, but in reality it was a pathway to nothingness and sooner or later the effects of my decisions materialised, hitting me in the back, revealing who I really was: a young adult with no education, no certificates of sort, no portfolio, no network, no skills, no money and no identity. A little bit of everything. A little bit of nothing.

At one point I moved to (I was forced to due to life and family problems) Germany, now this is my only home, I’m basically stuck here with no real appeal for the job market, the fact that I don’t speak the language is a giant obstacle in any career path (or life path for that matter). 

After different months here, lockdown, depression and total lack of willingness to do anything (while seeing my friends graduate and getting stuff done) I really decided to get back to computers and pursue a career in IT/Programming, I got back at programming again since a couple of months, but honestly I can’t really imagine what the path would be since I have different problems related to language/culture/network/?:

* Studying anything at university level in a language that you don’t know is impossible
* I’m too old to wait 3-4 solid years to reach a basic german level and then go with another 5 years of education, I’ll be 30+ and depressed
* I’m not enough German to start an *Ausbildung* (as they call it, basically an Internship but more comprehensive, you go to school and do some exams, it’s some sort of further education that you do after High School but not really college education and more practical)
* I can’t move back to my home town to get a proper University education due to lack of money.

I talked to some people into Facebook Groups and they told me that speaking German was not a problem at all for them since in their company everybody spoke English, but I think that does only apply if you’re an experienced worker which is relocating and not to a not-yet junior developer like me who doesn’t really have anything to prove his experience. 

So my idea is basically to bypass all of this and do my experience alone, studying stuff alone really good and create a solid portfolio of webapps / various projects that’d prove my skills, and after that applying directly as a real developer (in Germany, but all around the world too since I have no interest in living here for a long time) hoping that knowing German wouldn’t be as essential and I don’t have to go through the stress of studying stuff in German. 

In that case, what would be the smartest thing to do? Will a 6 months english coding bootcamp be enough for me to be desirable to the German job market? Or independent self-learning? Or will some certificates (like w3schools ones or similar) do it? Or just a good portfolio? Really, I’m going crazy.

So I am 21 this year and already have a slot in NUS Civil Engineering which i applied for in 2019 and went for NS after.

Up till recently, i never thought about what i really wanted to do in my life. After some REAL SERIOUS reflection i did when i ORDed earlier this year, i learned that i want to be in a career where im not desk bound, something meaningful and where i get to help others. 

This led me to research about the social sector and i realised that social work was something that really touched my heart as i too have received aid from them before.

Now i am really confused as i dont know how to proceed. I researched on the different pathways to become a social work.

There are 2 main routes being, taking a bachelors degeee in social work at suss/nus or taking a post graduate diploma in social work at suss/nus. 

With that said, i have applied for a change of course but i already know the chances of success are really low as my rank points is 71.25 but i would say the appeal letter was PRETTY DAMN GOOD. 

So now im waiting for the results to comeout, probably in a week or so. If i get rejected, i have 2 routes.

First would be to take a gap year, apply for internships at social service agencies/ MSF and volunteer during the weekends to build up a solid portfolio so that i can apply to nus under aba and also to suss.

OR i just matriculate this year, finish my engineering degree and take a post graduate diploma in social work. The requirements for the PGD is 1 year of relevant social work experience and if i do it part time, it would take me ard 1.5 years.

My friends are suggesting that i should go down the 2nd route as i will get an engineering degree which opens many doors and once i get a job, i can go for the part time PGD.

What i think is that civil engineering is something i wouldnt mind studying but at the same time, why study something when i know that im going to be working in a different profession. But realistically seeing, both social work and engineering are gonna cost me 30k and engineering opens so many doors which i can use as a safety net while i study for the diploma...

So i am really confused, what would you guys do? 

If you read this far, thanks alot! And any advice is appreciated!"

Will keep this short and succinct but need advice on how best to deal with this current situation.

* Am a mid-level marketing exec, responsible for some of the team, but not head of the department.
* Currently working on a piece of collateral which is overseen by both the manager of marketing (my line manager) and the head of another department.
* Last time, despite them having seen the document several days beforehand before hand and them telling me they only had a handful of notes for me, they proceeded to give me over 60 notes on what they wanted me to change that I had to write down myself in a meeting rather than me sending it over an email.
* This ranged from small picky details that could do themselves in a few minutes to huge overhauls of the presentation.
* This then ate into my own time when I was meant to be working on other projects and have spent days trying to implement their amends.
* New meeting this week to look at the changes and feel like the same thing will happen again, they'll see it before hand, say they don't have many notes for me, but then give me a huge amount with little concern for my own time.
* This document will be given to someone who is the same level as me but in a different department, so he could also be available to implement the rules.
* Have already invested more time in this than originally planned and want the next meeting to lay down some groundrules from the off to prevent this from happening again but not going over my bounds considering I am only an exec and not a manager.
* I am happy to help out but this project has taken ages and I feel treated like a glorified intern with this project.

Hi Reddit, I’m stuck. I’m turning 23 in a month and still feel behind in life and like I’ve wasted so much time. 

I love technology, I’ve been tinkering PCs since age 13, during my teenage years I was doing stuff with Linux, breaking things and installing stuff, sooner or later I’ve discovered programming and started writing my first lines of code with Python, later on I’ve approached web development and started creating basic websites and cool stuff. I was exceeding in math and related fields, loved logic games and puzzles.

While I was in High School I was basically mentally set to pursue a fruitful career in Computer Science, to go to University and study some Computer Engineering and then start my professional life at some software company, and from that escalate the ladder and probably reach a very well paid developer job.

But at one point, things changed. I finished High School and didn’t go to University, I totally lost interest in programming, I was barely thinking logically, and I spent a lot of time pursuing other stuff like online hustling, reselling, art, videomaking, etc. So basically my idea was to become a Social Media Manager, or start my own Business, or becoming a videographer, or start a youtube channel, or do a little bit of everything while figuring stuff out. I took one year off working part time jobs and personal projects, and then another, and then another.

Fast forward 3 years I did nothing that really matters professionally (and economically) in any of the fields I was interested to, my personal projects failed and I built no real skills/experience either (in fact my personal projects were not even that serious and I was not even trying that hard). I made some money and that kept me thinking that “I was about to do it”, but in reality it was a pathway to nothingness and sooner or later the effects of my decisions materialised, hitting me in the back, revealing who I really was: a young adult with no education, no certificates of sort, no portfolio, no network, no skills, no money and no identity. A little bit of everything. A little bit of nothing.

At one point I moved to (I was forced to due to life and family problems) Germany, now this is my only home, I’m basically stuck here with no real appeal for the job market, the fact that I don’t speak the language is a giant obstacle in any career path (or life path for that matter). 

After different months here, lockdown, depression and total lack of willingness to do anything (while seeing my friends graduate and getting stuff done) I really decided to get back to computers and pursue a career in IT/Programming, I got back at programming again since a couple of months, but honestly I can’t really imagine what the path would be since I have different problems related to language/culture/network/?:

* Studying anything at university level in a language that you don’t know is impossible
* I’m too old to wait 3-4 solid years to reach a basic german level and then go with another 5 years of education, I’ll be 30+ and depressed
* I’m not enough German to start an *Ausbildung* (as they call it, basically an Internship but more comprehensive, you go to school and do some exams, it’s some sort of further education that you do after High School but not really college education and more practical)
* I can’t move back to my home town to get a proper University education due to lack of money.

I talked to some people into Facebook Groups and they told me that speaking German was not a problem at all for them since in their company everybody spoke English, but I think that does only apply if you’re an experienced worker which is relocating and not to a not-yet junior developer like me who doesn’t really have anything to prove his experience.

As I write this, I’m sure there have been many posts such as this one and many people who have been in my shoes and figured a way out. Nevertheless, I can’t stop stressing about this and the anxiety is making me sleepless. About 3 weeks ago I graduated with a BS in biomedical engineering and minors in math and electrical engineering. I was never passionate about school but I’ve always been passionate about engineering and tech. I was never the number 1 kid in the class but I also wasn’t the worst either (3.4 gpa). Since graduation, I’ve been looking at entry level jobs and a slow cold panic has been setting in. My first reaction was “omg I picked the wrong major there’s rarely an entry job for biomed”. So I started looking for jobs in any engineering field. I noticed many jobs for software development and data analysis etc. (Comp sci majors) so I decided to go for these. However I only took an intro comp sci course and some basic digital logic and in short I didnt study comp sci in school. I have always been passionate about programming and have recently started self-teaching python. However I have run into some YouTube videos where the engineer talks about how programming isn’t for everyone cause coding and comp sci are two different things and that big companies pay big bucks for the comp sci guy who understands the fundamental concept and math behind coding and who can solve problems.
With all the above out of the way, now we get to my biggest fear. I have forgotten almost everything I learned in school already. For example if you asked me a question about Fourier transform I’d stare at you with a blank expression in spite of having done it for multiple semesters. This really worries me for technical interviews. A lot of biomed jobs ask for solidworks or other CAD but after not touching that stuff for a longtime I have forgotten those as well. My attitude towards these entry level jobs is to get my foot in the door and I will study my little heart out and learn anything they want me to but I’m really worried about securing a position to begin with.
I guess I posted this to hear the thoughts of professional engineers out there or tips and advice that help calm me down. I really hope I didn’t waste 5 years on engineering school for nothing. Thanks in advance. 

P.s. I couldn’t get any internship experience as I took a full load of classes every summer ."

I graduated with a BS in comp sci from a top 20 CS school (per USNews) last summer with a slightly sub 3.0 GPA. I never did any internships and didn’t make time to build a portfolio in college, but I did work part time all the way through college and held some substantial leadership roles.

Last summer I took the first job I could get after graduating to pay the bills, which was a sales and logistics role, I had a minor leadership role there and have a pretty good description of the time management and problem solving skills it required on my resume. I resigned because I didn’t want to pursue sales long term and it was too time consuming to allow me to pursue a different career.

Now, I can’t seem to even get an interview for SWE roles, even the lower paying ones (I’m looking primarily on the East coast), and I don’t know what to do. I understand the degree itself doesn’t prove I’m a good programmer, but I thought it would be enough to at least get me some interviews.

What steps do I need to take to become hireable? I am beginning to work on a portfolio but I know that’s going to take months to be worth much, I need to pay my bills so I can’t really dedicate weeks or months to a bootcamp.

Are there any jobs that are at least in the same field I can get with my degree alone? What are they and how do I look for them? I am okay with not being an SWE right out of the gate if that’s not feasible at the moment but that is my long term goal and I want to try and at least steer my short term career path back in that direction."

So I'm a Canadian student whose interning for 16 months with a company, but 4 months in I am seriously thinking of quitting. The main reason why I'm unhappy is here is I'm finding the work very dull (writing small Bash scripts automating things and editing config files all day), and I worry it won't help when actually trying to find SWE full time jobs when I graduate (btw my current internship isn't even SWE, its more IT/sysadmin). So I'm struggling justifying why I should stay for an additional 12 months. 

I took this internship because I was having trouble getting some call backs, and this was better than nothing. Anyways, I've greatly improved my resume with a few additional cool side projects (plus some actual work experience), so I've been thinking of applying for internships for Fall 2021 and if I can get an offer, then quit my current internship. 

Of course the only problem is that backing out of a 16 month internship while only 4 months in is very bad form. From my university as far as I can tell, there should be no repercussions for doing so. 

Any advice on what I should do?"

when I received the offer, it was a little lower than expected/lower than average and I tried negotiating with human resources within 2 days of receiving the offer. usually, i'd just take what I was offered and take the easy route, but I wanted to fight for what I felt like I deserved (for once in my life lol).

HR took slightly more than a week to revert (late Wed night), and I was out of office (Thu &amp; Fri) thereafter. i only noticed the response when i returned after the weekend. I informed him via chat that I will be accepting the offer but would need more time to submit the documents. (during the whole process he never mentioned any deadline, even when I asked if I could have more time). i submitted by wed.

now he claims that my documents were submitted late, and because of this my official start date is shifted by a month (hence losing one month of additional pay). also note that he only mentioned this to my superior, and never at all mentioned to me about this change in official start date..

should i bring this up to him? how should i approach it? i don't want to sound like I'm ungrateful for the opportunity, but i felt like the situation was really poorly handled. I'm not too in need of extra cash but this money would really help me in paying my student loans...

I viewed this as a temporary necessity to obtain a Cybersecurity career. However, it appears as though the people they hire to permanent positions work 60-70+ hour weeks. On salary, so no time and a half.

I also plan to get my B.S. while working‐-and also having a life outside of work. Like a CISO we had some brief time with told me yesterday, ""We want to work to live, not live to work, right?""

I feel like I'm suffocating, and while I could do this temporarily, I can't do it long-term. I'm also considering other IT careers, with an AAS in Database Development and soon AWS and Azure certifications.

Turns out that the atmosphere is very toxic at the company.

Here are the reasons

- Hired me as a backend developer and after a week told me to work on frontend.
- No Guidance from Senior developers
- Not giving me access to Jira board and constantly pinging me on slack to complete the task (WTF? I don't know the task yet). This happened for 3-4 days.
- After giving me permissions to view the board, setting unrealistic tasks (They know that I'm an intern &amp; TBH, I was looking for internships to enhance my skills, If I was already skilled then why would I join an internship?)
- Not even reviewing my code/PR
- Ghosting me on skype
- Tight Deadlines (Their words ""Ok, learn this new technology but don't spend too much time on it and do this task"", I'm not a smart person, I have to read a concept thrice or four times if I don't understand it)

I'm very worried right now. Sometimes I feel I'm not smart enough for computer science. I don't know what to do, I have only 2 months before I graduate. Should I look for a new internship or should I leave and self taught myself?"

It has also been terrible. And talking to mentors at the company, things won't be better elsewhere.

I am 19, I've been writing software for a while (since early middle school). I started off with C++, learned reverse engineering a bit, did graphics programming, UI development, etc. Around the end of highschool I realized that kind of work is ""specialized"", and really hard for a young guy with no degree to get a job with regardless of skill, so I started learning web development with VueJS, NodeJs, MongoDb, etc. I have been applying to anything on Indeed with the word ""intern"" or ""developer"" or ""web"" in it, and I've gotten 2 interviews so far in the last 2-3 months. First one was way out of my league (idk why they even bothered with me) and the second one, they interviewed me for an internship position that was already filled. Probably dodged a bullet there but anyways...

I don't know what else I can be/should be doing, I just want to make money with the many skills I've worked hard to learn. I have a personal website/portfolio with a few projects on it ( here: [https://lunaranomaly.com](https://lunaranomaly.com/)), from there you are able to download my resume and a link to my github if you feel like reviewing it.

I've also started trying to freelance (as of today, I re-made my [Freelancer.com](https://freelancer.com/) profile) and the kinds of jobs being posted on there are just, from what I can gather, either gatekept by the site itself or they are complete wastes of time; for instance, people wanting to hire someone to complete their coursework for them. It's obviously low quality, and low return. I also have done every step of creating an Upwork account besides upload a profile picture which I'll be doing tomorrow, once I get some sleep and don't look such a mess :P

I've just been fed up lately, I don't know what to do or what I am doing wrong, which is why I am here.

My questions are:

Am I advertising myself to the wrong people?

Am I applying on the wrong websites (such as Indeed)?

What am I mucking up?

Its really hard for me to tell these things as I am only 19, and never had a dev job, so I lack the relevant experience to know what it is that I don't know.

TL;DR: I've been trying to get a dev job for the last 2 months and I feel like I am shooting blanks with my resume/portfolio, not sure what the issue is but I know I am lacking something to attract employers.

Thank you for taking the time to read, and if you have any questions, advice, or critiques I will be very responsive to all and it would be \*greatly\* appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently a programmer, in my first job, even though I had some internships before this one. I want to become a better programmer. And I was wondering, is it worth to learn deeply a programming language, in my case JS, but it's something that I think everyone can relate to.

&amp;#x200B;

When I say deeply, I mean really have a good grasp of whatever is happening under the hood, but also learn some advanced concepts (e.g. generators).

&amp;#x200B;

Or is it just better to do some personal projects (I have a ton of it I want to do)?

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't want to be a ""javascript or node "" programmer, but a programmer, and I don't like the idea of being tide to a specific tool, but in the meantime having more tools in the toolbox is interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I don't really what should I focus.

Questions:

1. I have no experience (high school internships, ap physics cut off from electricity and magnetism when i took it junior year due to COVID, no coding experience). Should i worry? Is there anything i can do in the summer so i can play catch up and not feel left behind from everybody else?
2. Any teachers and classes i should take freshman year and still be on track to get my degree with the obvious stress but keep it as low as a college student would experience. Right now, i plan to follow this [link](https://catalog.utexas.edu/undergraduate/engineering/degrees-and-programs/bs-electrical-engineering/suggested-arrangement-of-courses-electrical-engineering/) throughout my four years. Teacher suggestions will be really helpful as orientation comes around. 
3. I need to keep a 3.5 GPA to keep my scholarship and I'm really stressed out about having to maintain that high of a GPA when I'm an engineering major. I heard ECE is even harder so that's not helping my stress levels lmao. Any great words of advice and tips about UT's resources and opportunities so that i can get through college and still maintain a good GPA?

np9fvr,2,2021-05-31,Some questions about dev jobs in Stockholm,plutolympics,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/np9fvr/some_questions_about_dev_jobs_in_stockholm/,"Hey everyone! I'm planning on moving to Stockholm this year (been seriously planning for about 18 months now but it's looking more and more likely by the day) and I just had a few questions about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

First question would be what sort of salary I should be expecting? I've heard anywhere between low 30k SEK to mid 40sk SEK, but I feel like that can be a massive difference in a city like Stockholm in terms of where I can live etc.  

\- BSc 1st class Computer Science degree (graduated last year) at a decent university, but not a red brick one. 

\- 24 months experience (did an internship and now a graduate role in a well known DevOps company) in fullstack development but not sure I could develop a full website by hand. I tend to prefer front end but it changes a lot so I can do both. Overall I'd definitely say I'm confident in junior level positions but could potentially do mid-level depending on what it entailed.

\- Technologies I've worked with in industry include: Golang, React, GraphQL, MySQL, Firebase

\- When studying I also used Java, C++, C#, R, SQL. I also studied some Machine Learning but I don't feel like I'd be competent enough to get a job in that at my current skill level (unless it is a junior position). 

&amp;#x200B;

Second would be what's the best way to break into the Swedish job market? I know it's a hard job market to get into and that lots of people (especially in junior positions) get started by knowing someone. I've met one person who helps with recruitment in a tech company so that's one way of getting into it, but other than that, how do I start? I'm from NI so although I'm from the UK I am in the process of getting an Irish passport (it's all ordered and everything looks fine, hopefully getting issued next week), so visas aren't really an issue. I've been mostly looking on LinkedIn and occassionally StackOverflow, are there any other ways or websites for job searching? I'd prefer to work in a start up but I know I can't be too fussy haha. Also a related question, are Swedish interviews just kind of your average tech interviews? Some whiteboarding, maybe a test screening beforehand, getting to know the applicant more than anything type-thing? I have little to no actual experience in tech interviews (only really had the one that I got the job for) so I have nothing to base it off of. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, is it viable to make friends in work? I know it's a stupid question, but I also know that Sweden is notoriously hard to make friends in. I'm working on learning the language (I'd say I'm B1 right now but going to continue learning it of course), so I know that'll help, but I guess a lot of people have told me that it's especially hard to meet friends at work.

&amp;#x200B;

Many thanks if you've made it this far! Any answers are appreciated."

And was fortunate to receive NTU offer for Accountancy with minor in DDA in 2nd window and now I'm in great delimma. 

I think both unis are great however I do think NTU's teaching style is more in my comfort zone, but I dislike about their internship as I feel 10 weeks is too short, seems to have no break if I were to take internship during summer vacation but please correct me if I'm wrong. I have also seen posts saying that it's hard for Year 1s to secure an internship and I don't want to take LOA or delay graduation as 3 year direct honour is what's attracting me. I have also read some posts saying that NTU accountancy doesn't seem to teach much on finance (I'm not sure if that's important? But I generally feel there will be less options or I will experience less as compared to NUS and SMU peeps who have more finance modules or more specialisations to choose from).

As for SMU I feel its somewhere where it can really force me out of my comfort zone (me introvert and that's one of the main reasons holding me back from SMU, I can talk to people but just really not good at class participation and presentations). And I like the career guidance, compulsory overseas exposure and chances to take up multiple internships in SMU. But I'm very not interested in their common modules as I suck and hate writing modules but I guess that's not an important factor now? And SMU is harder to get degree with honours and I'm not sure if that's important or if having more internships can cover up for that :(

I don't really mind about the travelling distance, number of years, hall life, whether my friends are going there etc. And I know both unis have class participation but SMU seem to be more strict and focus more on it. And I have read through many posts but still can't decide where to go. For now my plan is try get into Big4 after graduating and I know majority NTU graduates go there. But I greatly value the softskills that SMU graduates possess, more internship opportunities and options, and that they are able to learn more such as more finance modules and 2nd majors available. If I really like finance I might work in finance industry after going to Big4 or after grad but maybe I can give up on the finance and specialisations if I'm going to NTU.

Sorry for the lengthy post and it may seem I'm contradicting and thinking too much but I really need advice &gt;_&lt; Can anyone give me some suggestions or which uni you went and why? Thankssss."
npbpoo,0,2021-05-31,Going back on an offer,cstaway191919,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/npbpoo/going_back_on_an_offer/,"I've accepted an offer to a defense contractor as a software engineer  that required a TS clearence which is expensive and lengthy. Hence, I interviewed and accepted the positions half a year ago despite having another year of school to go. At the time I thought it was the best offer I could get.

Over the past half year I realized I am actually quite good at programming, and after starting my internship this summer (at a startup) I find that the problems my coworkers are having are things I haven't struggled with since freshman year, and I could do so much more. I finish my work in a couple of hours whereas it takes others several days to debug or figure something out. I'm not saying this to brag, I just genuinely never realized my school must have been preparing me at a much higher level (which makes sense as I go to a very good CS school). I just assumed compared to my classmates I was about average, but in the real world, I think I am very far above average.

I have no problem with the compensation, they are actually paying me quite well for starting. Not Google level salary, but well above average for a starting SWE. I am mostly concerned that I will be the only advanced programmer and having to deal with people who don't know the fundamentals. It really bothers me when I have to remind some of my coworkers right now what a tree is or doubly linked list is. Just the other day, one of my coworkers was tripping up on how to go about making a for loop and my heart just sank. I can't work in an environment like that for long.

Now I don't know anything about defense, but I've heard that you can run into some slackers and the work might not be all that challenging. I do happen to be placed at a very well known company in a very interesting division of the company, but I don't want to deal with coworkers who aren't real programmers. Sorry if that sounds harsh, but I think that's fair.

Next year, I want to apply and interview for other jobs, perhaps Google, Amazon, etc. (as well as non FAANG companies)  just to see if I can get an offer. Thing is, the defense company is paying for my TS clearence (it's expensive) and I've already accepted the offer, so I feel like I would be an absolute garabage human being for cancelling if I were to get an offer elsewhere. I'm not even sure I can back out. Also, I doubt I could ever come back if I decided I actually wanted to work there after all, and other comapnies were not the right fit.

So what should I do? Is it that bad to rescind my acceptance? Should I just stick it out and give it a chance see what happens for a year at the defense job and then transition to switch if it's not for me?

&amp;#x200B;

Side note: It's not that I don't like the defense company or the work they do. I actually think it's quite cool. I just can't be working on something that isn't above a freshman year coding level with people who struggle to make for loops.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if this came off as arrogant. No I don't beleive I am the greatest coder of all time, I realize I have weaknesses and there is a lot I don't know. I just didn't really know where I stood until now."

(Also this is my first post ever on Reddit!) Anyways, I've been really struggling this past year and with this diagnosis, I feel like I can use this to help myself grow and build a better life for myself. (I also apologize for how long this post is about to be)

 HOWEVER. I'm now just sorta realizing that this just... is my brain, and I won't be ""fixed"" just because I start taking medication. And it's really messing with me. I do have a psychiatrist and a therapist, who I have been seeing for a while for trauma, depression, anxiety, and now, ADHD. My therapist told me a year ago that she thought I could have ADHD, but I guess I just didn't listen, and I really wish I had, because I feel so behind. I'm about to turn 24, and I still rely on my parents for money. I have a job that I can work hours that I want, but I never want to, and never do (thanks, ADHD!) My parents are being super supportive and told me that they want to help me out while I figure this out, mostly because I think they feel a little guilty that I just got diagnosed now. I was mis-diagnosed with a processing disorder as a kid (I am a female, so checks out), and was put both into the gifted classes and in special ed. Teachers and students never believed I needed my accommodations, and after a while, I was convinced too. I graduated from college last year, and by that point, I had basically forgotten that I had been in special ed. I think my brain just wanted to feel normal. Both my siblings are extraordinary people--both went to Ivy Leagues and are going places. My parents own their own business and work insane hours and are very successful. My best friend was close to being valedictorian. My boyfriend is an artist who is constantly creating cool new stuff while he has two jobs. I'm practically surrounded by type A high achieving people. And I can barely get out of bed most days. 

I'm starting Grad school in a month and I'm terrified. I got admitted to a low-residency popular fiction writing program and I already feel like a fraud. The incoming class has a chat we frequently talk on and everyone is always talking about how much they write. I love writing, I want to be an author someday, but I cannot keep up. I have barely written anything this past year. I have written a few novels before, but I feel this is another level. My colleagues are reading and writing as a part of their daily routine. I barely have a daily routine. Reading books is often really difficult. And I write when I want to, not by default. 

I started medication but I can't figure out the right dose. It feels like on different days the Adderal does different things. Like one day will be productive and the next day I'll sleep until 3 pm. (If anyone has any advice for figuring out medication, lmk)

Beyond that, I am so terrified I will never grow up to be a proper adult. My room is always a disaster, even though I wish it wasn't. I have quit a lot of internships because I couldn't stand them. Which, as I have been told, you just have to suck it up and get through a terrible job to get to a good one. I am horrible with my money, I turn in taxes way too late, and I constantly need to call one of my siblings to figure out ""adulting."" I have a network of friends I feel like I can't keep up with, and constantly feel both FOMO and the strong desire to be alone. I just--WANT to function. I feel like if I could just figure out how, I would have a happy, successful life. 

I am working on it. I subscribed to How To ADHD on youtube, I bought some books my therapist recommended, and I'm researching good strategies, but I feel stuck. I hate having to use other people for support--it just makes me feel guilty. I want to be kinder to myself, but I just feel like a burden. So, if you made it through all of that, any advice? 

TL;DR. I was recently diagnosed with ADHD. How do you deal with medication/feeling behind/feeling like you can't keep up and any newcomer ADHD advice?

npenth,1,2021-05-31,Have master’s in math and can’t get a job?,vincetento,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/npenth/have_masters_in_math_and_cant_get_a_job/,"I graduated with my master’s in math last year (May 2020) and am seriously struggling to find a job. My MA and BS are both in pure math, and I have two undergraduate minors in finance and actuarial science. I’ve applied to over 100 jobs since graduating and only got 2 interviews, and of those 2 interviews I got 1 offer. Whenever someone asks about my job search they say something to the effect of “well you have a masters in math, you can get hired anywhere!” Turns out that is absolutely NOT the case.

My plan right out of graduate school was to become an adjunct instructor. I’ve applied for math adjunct positions at 2- and 4-year colleges in my area, but with no luck. Teaching at the college level has been my goal, and I have very little desire to teach at the high school/middle school/elementary levels. I am also not certified to teach in my state — based in New Jersey, US — plus my degrees are in pure math, not math education.

I’ve seen similar posts about people with math degrees struggling to find math-related jobs. Many sources online offer advice like “become a statistician” or “get into finance” or “work for the NSA.” These broad statements all sound very enticing and exciting, but apparently hold very little promise. Had I known this sooner, perhaps I would have gotten a degree in statistics or finance instead of pure math. I’ve even applied to work with the NSA (and other federal government agencies) as a mathematician since graduating — they said no.

Almost every job I’ve found outside of academia requires some programming or statistics or finance experience. I have essentially no programming experience (i feel like a liar even listing it on my resume), and my degrees are both in pure math, not applied math or statistics. I’ve applied to various entry-level finance/accounting jobs, and  a handful of internships, and it seems my minors don’t help to get me in there either. These along with all the “entry level math jobs” I’ve searched for on indeed leave me very discouraged.  Here is everything I’m working with:

* high school substitute teacher — the only job offer I’ve received since graduating (Oct 2020-present)
* graduate teaching associate (2017-2019)
* master’s thesis on the Kalman filter (topic in ""applied"" math, but was a theoretical focus)
* 1 undergraduate course in Python + very basic use of Python for master’s thesis
* participated in peer mentor program &amp; completed 3-course pedagogy sequence as a graduate student
* undergraduate teaching assistant (2015-2017)
* undergraduate math tutor (2015-2017)
* various retail customer service jobs (2014-2017)

The majority of my experience comes from teaching as a TA and from my master’s thesis research, which are the bulk of my resume. It seems employers don’t really care about the latter. A couple friends I graduated with started teaching at a high school, and I just reached out to another and found they landed a post-grad research fellowship (independent of degree programs). I’ve started looking into some fellowships but it seems most deadlines have already passed for this year, plus I’d feel embarrassed reaching out to my graduate school professors asking for a recommendation so long after graduating.

I am not completely opposed to going back to school (learn more computer science or something). However, I don’t think a PhD program is in the cards for me any time soon. I actually applied to a bunch of programs while in the second year of my masters program and was rejected by every school.

I’ve attributed my non-success over the past months partly to COVID, but now the world is starting to calm down and I’m still jobless. I think another part of this is that I come off as “overqualified” for entry-level jobs because of my education, but also under-qualified for anything else because of my work history. Am I missing something here about the math job market? Have other math graduates been just as unsuccessful in finding a job as me? Are there other math-related career paths I have not considered yet? Are there better ways to search for math jobs? This post ended up being longer than I expected, so thank you if you made it to the end :). 

TLDR: I have a master’s in math and can’t get a job. What gives?"

Today, I bought a laser printer for use during my internship (mostly for printing papers to read; internship is virtual so made sense). The difference is night and day. Quicker, more responsive, and can print on both sides. Don’t make the same mistake I did and buy a bad printer, just go the extra mile and get a laser."

Reol sat quietly, his tendrils coiling in agitation as he examined the mass spectrometry readout of the little leaf in front of him.  It was crammed full of compounds, some mundane like glucose and cellulose, found on many habitable carbon-rich planets, some more exotic, like chlorophyll.  That was not what attracted his attention.

""Merciful stars.  What is this hellish monstrosity?"" he whispered, staring in horror at a separated readout of toxins.  Neurotoxins crammed this leaf to the brim.  Reol had suspected as much, given that one of the unfortunate interns had to be hospitalized after touching the leaf without proper precautions, but even now, knowing it was sealed in an airtight tube and that those poisons couldn't reach him, Reol still felt as if he could smell the fumes.  He remembered the agonized look on his intern's face as the boy went down, convulsing violently.  ""No wonder Caish collapsed.""  By his count... there had to be at least eight known neurotoxins in that plant.  Reol's tendrils trembled slightly as he floated up from his seat, his buoyancy sac inflating slightly to reduce his density.  He glided to the plant and settled the report in its proper place behind the tube.

With a sigh of relief, Reol turned his attention to the next sealed tube, this one containing a thin slice of some sort of very juicy root.  He pulled the spec report and froze, his three heart-sacs beating even faster than before.  With a violent thrash his tendrils launched him away from the root and partway across the room; his buoyancy sac had inflated in alarm and now bumped into the ceiling.

""What's the big issue, Reol?"" Skellor, his fellow botanical chemist, asked, tipping slightly into the room, his thermal sensors widening slightly.  A slitted eye blinked in confusion at Reol's obvious panic.  ""You're bright red.  What happened?""

""I... here.  Have a look.  This is that root we were looking at.""

Skellor took the readout and made an incredulous bubble of noise.  ""What... *is* this thing?""

""It's a root we found.  The human said...""  Reol shivered.  ""The human said it liked this one.""

""My God.""  Skellor stared at the tox report in horror.  ""Is this some kind of horrific drug?""

""N-no.  The human– sorry, Mr. Je... Jessin?  Jonsen?""

""Johnson.""

""Right, Mr. Johnson said he just liked it.  To eat.""

""You're joking, right?""  Skellor's tendrils started to coil and uncoil while bright red spots flickered over his main body.

""No.  He told us how they prepare it.  Lots of glucose and cellulose and starch, with fat and... eggs.""  Reol spat out the last bit in disgust.

""Eggs?  As in, small humans?""

""Humans are viviparous, tubshell.""  Reol snapped.  Skellor's body flared a bit green at being called a tubshell, but he held his peace and let Reol continue.  ""No, they use something else's eggs.  Something called a shickun.""

""Chicken.""

Both Reol and Skellor launched into the air, their bodies flaring red.  Behind them, a loud and coarse sound that must have been laughter rang out.

""It's called a chicken.""  The human Johnson must have come up behind them.  His teeth were bared alarmingly, but the pair of botanical chemists had been working with him for some time and knew that this was not a gesture of aggression.

""Human Johnson.""  Reol contracted his buoyancy sac, letting himself down from the ceiling with all the grace he could muster.  ""I am afraid we must have obtained the wrong samples.  These are all very toxic plants.  It has to be a mistake.""

""Hm, let me see.""  Johnson ambled over to the sealed tubes, looking at them closely, then pulling the tox reports.  ""No, this seems about right.""

""Are you telling me that your people willingly consume these nerve agents?""  Reol had turned bright red again, but he had managed to avoid floating upward in alarm.

""Let's see... mint, yep, that's a mint leaf alright.  Ginger root... yeah, that's it.  Tea leaves...""  Johnson looked at the next tox report, one that Reol hadn't gotten to yet.  ""Ohoho, you're gonna *hate* this one.""  He handed it to Reol, who flew upward into the roof.

""C-caffeine– tannic acid– theobromine– t-theophylline– s-six different c-catechins, what is this?!""  Reol flailed furiously, thrashing in violent agitation.  ""Any one of these could be fatal!  And you voluntarily take all of them at once?!""

Johnson grinned slightly, again showcasing his teeth.  ""Oh, I see.""  He sighed and stretched out his hand for the tox report.  ""See, you have to remember that Earth is a deathworld.  Everything is doing its best to not be eaten.  Even the plants.  Honestly, a lot of these things are good for humans.""

""G-good for... ***WHAT?!***""  Reol's color turned alarmingly close to a deep purple-black.  ""These are poisons!  These plants are trying to kill you!""

""And they failed, which makes them taste better.""  Johnson chuckled slightly and tucked the tox report back behind the tea leaf in its carefully sealed jar.  As he left, he shouted back, ""Do yourself a favor and don't look at the report for the tobacco leaves!""

After a moment in which Reol and Skellor slowly restored their dignity, Reol reached for the next tox report.  He hesitated, reading the label on the small red fruit in the tube.  ""Bird's eye pepper.""  How bad could this one possibly be?"
