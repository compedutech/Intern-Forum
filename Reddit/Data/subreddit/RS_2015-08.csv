My boss has been driving me absolutely mad, to the point where I come home exhausted, frustrated, and upset. 

Background/context: I work for a conulting agency on a small team of 4 people plus my boss (5 total). This is my first real corporate job since college (I'm 25) and I'm having a really hard time with the environment on the team. 

Every single interaction has been micromanaged by her. I'm not allowed to ask my teammates questions or for help. I have to email her and she either answers it or ""passes on"" the question to a more experienced teammate if they have time. I've tried asking teammates minor questions in person, but was reprimanded for excluding her from the conversation. 

I can't do anything until I have been told to do it. When I have a project that I need help with I sometimes have to wait 2 or 3 hours at work for a response from her. This has happened several times when all I need is a simple yes or no answer that I could get from a teammate in 30 seconds.

As well, I was told that I would be given training on how to use certain software and perform tasks central to producing reports. When i need to learn something new I'm being handed ""How-To"" documents that were written the same day I have to do something with vague instructions. These vague instructions lead to errors because because I don't have enough information to do the job properly.

As well, when I have questions or make a mistake I'm dragged into hours long conversations where she just asks questions trying ""lead"" me to the answer/correction. Sometimes I feel lost, but when I express this I'm just given more questions and she refuses to ever give me a straight answer to any question I ask.

I love the work and I love the job, but I'm having a really hard time interacting with her. Her teaching style (how-to docs slapped together with hour long email conversations) leave me feeling exhausted, frustrated, and upset at the end of the day because I can't ever get a straight answer from her. 

I was extremely lucky to find this entry-level position with no experience. Every other entry level position in this industry either requires more experience than I have gained or is an internship (which I can't afford). 

I want to quit, but I can't afford to. Any advice on what to do?

TLDR: I love my work, but my boss makes my job really difficult and I can't really quit because finding another position that isn't an internship is difficult at best. Advice on how to proceed?"
3fcxlb,28,2015-07-31,Only post good quality code on GitHub?,maxucho,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3fcxlb/only_post_good_quality_code_on_github/,"I'm a college CS student looking ahead to applying for internships next summer, and I'm looking at my GitHub with an eye to what potential recruiters might look at. Currently I have up a number of small projects from high school, whose code quality I would consider to not be representative of my current abilities. The most recent commits on these projects are from several years ago, so it would be clear to someone who looked that they aren't recent, but I'm nervous that someone browsing casually wouldn't see that, and think that the code is indicative of my current skills.

Is this a valid concern? Should I even have these projects on github if they're that old? My rationale was that having these projects demonstrates a passion for CS from a young age, but I want to make sure the code quality doesn't end up counting against me."

The recruiter said I will be doing almost all my work in Java, were I to get the job. I told them that I have done a bit of Java, but am most comfortable with C#, so they let me take the initial coding test in C#.

As i'm sitting here studying data structures it crossed my mind that when I get there for the interview, they may decide to give me problems in Java, since that is what they will want me to do on the job. 

Has anyone had experience interviewing for a position using a language they were not as strong with? Did they let you interview in your language of choice, or should I be practicing in Java rather than continuing on in C#?"

I'm 26 years old.  I never intended to go to college.  I landed a few dead-end jobs that forced me to live paycheck-to-paycheck, as many of us probably do.  Last one ended with a company-wide layoff, and I opted to go to school for two reasons.  First was for the opportunity to find a job with a bit more job security, second was to keep my head above water with use of student loans.  The latter was pretty stupid, but it helped me get my truck paid off without fear of reposession.  
  
Fast forward about 4 years.  I'm 30 years old.  I've finished all my pre-requisite classes, I've obtained an AAS in IT Administration, as well as 3 college-issued certificates: Web Specialist, Microsoft Specialist and Unix Specialist.  I was also given a ""Marketability Achievement Award"", whatever that means.  
  
My internship was for a small business owner who wanted a web-based storefront for his company, but didn't know how to go about making it work.  Long story short--he didn't want to pay for anything, and the internship quickly turned into a lame duck and I received no professional experience from the project.  
  
Now here I sit, with a degree in hand, and I'm still bagging groceries at a local grocery store trying to figure out what I can do with this degree and where I can get a job.  My primary interest is in web design, database management, programming, and graphic design.  Where do I go, who do I talk to, and how do I get my foot in the door in the IT industry without having any professional experience and a 2-year degree from a community college?

Now for the details. I just finished my freshman year of college and am pursuing a BE in computer science and engineering. I live in CT and this summer I interned in MA with a mid-sized financial company doing web development. I'm aware that this experience alone has put me way ahead of the game and the company usually invites about 80% of its interns back so I'm sure I'll have an opportunity there. BUT... I started this early because I want to get some varied experience to help decide where I want to end up. So, my next goal is to move farther away from home and get a feel for the city life. The internship I landed this summer was done through the career fair at my school which is a great resource but lacks in geographical scope. This year I'm going to start early on looking for next summer and am planning on doing searching on my own through resources that will allow me to go farther and so I was looking for some advice on how to go about a search."

3ffbo1,6,2015-08-01,PEY Rant,[deleted],UofT,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/3ffbo1/pey_rant/,"I need to rant about my PEY term, because it's been a nightmare for me. I got a job with IBM working on their debugger this summer. My uncle, who also work at IBM, referred me to them, and that's how I got the interview. It took me two years to get a job with PEY. This my first job ever. I started out doing testing. My supervisor, who was an older intern, was a condescending asshole. Every time I'd ask him a question he'd be like, ""you should know this"" and ""figure it out for yourself"". I was confused and overwhelmed, but I kept up with it, because I heard the first 3-4 months would be like this. Two months later my manager calls me in saying I'm not meeting assignment deadlines. They never even gave me any fucking assignment deadlines. All they said was I not making progress every week on the ten different fucking things they assigned to me. I came out to my team lead as having asperger's, and she was understanding because one of her sons was on the autism spectrum. However, it was too late. One week later, my work term gets reduced from 16 months to 4 months because I'm not a good fit. I get reassigned to a research-based project on Apache Spark, an analytics tool used for machine learning. Granted this was a much better fit. It was self-paced, I only had one project to work on instead of ten, I got to learn a lot about machine learning and AI, and my uncle was able to help me with the project. The stuff I had to get done was so hard, though, that even my uncle, who has been with IBM for many years and is doing his PhD in engineering, had trouble with it. Luckily, we got them working, and my manager was so impressed with it, he had me demo my work in front of everyone at the monthly department meeting. Everyone was also impressed. I admit I felt proud of that, but I still have lots of anger towards them. My team lead said if I do a good job with this project my manager might extend my work term, but I don't want it extended. I would actually find it insulting if it was extended. It would basically be my manager's way of saying, ""Oh, it turns out you don't suck as much as we thought you did."" I hate this team. I hate this job. I do get to do research on really cool stuff, which I really enjoy, but the actual work I have to do is draining. I talked to interns on other teams, and they said my team is crazy. I agree with them. I never felt like I was given much of a chance. According to my team lead, I was expected to be fully transitioned after two months. I was supposed to learn 80% of the work by myself. They told me I wasn't doing a good job in subtle social cues, but I didn't pick up on it because of the fucking Asperger's. She said this was not a job someone with Asperger's could do, because it's too demanding and fast-paced. She said that if I had come out earlier, they could've found a better place for me at IBM, but it's too late now. How was I supposed to know this? I was afraid of coming out, because I know there's a lot of stigma against people with mental health issues, and I was afraid of getting fired. She told me to be more picky with the kind of jobs I apply to and to tell them off the bat that I have Asperger's. I don't know if this is a good idea. Then again, my next job might also tell me that I'm progressing too slowly and then punish me for it. I don't know what's the right thing to do in this case. I'm just so sick of this job and can't wait to go back to school. I just need my 600 hours to graduate, which was the main reason I took this blasted job. I feel very dissatisfied with myself, though. I don't blame myself too much. It was my first job, I did come in on the busiest time, and the fit was just not there. This team was fucking crazy. This did show me that machine learning/AI might be for me, since in my studies I did gravitate towards the more math-heavy theoretical courses, such as control theory and communication systems. Still, I feel like shit because of this. I wouldn't feel so bad if they didn't reduce my work term. Was that really necessary? Put me on a different project, sure. But taking away 12 months here just feels like a slap in the face; like they don't want me here. I'm afraid to get any other job. I'm afraid it'll be just like this. I feel guilty, because in my professional and academic life my family's always been helping me so much. My dad helps me with my courses a lot and now my uncle is helping me with my job. I feel like a fraud sometimes. I had to switch to part-time in ECE because I couldn't handle the workload. I'm going into my 6th year in the fall, and I still have two left. A lot of times I feel like I'm just not cut out for engineering. Like no matter how hard I try, it's never good enough. I'm planning on getting a research position in AI/machine learning with one of the CompSci profs at U of T next summer. I've been working on machine learning at my job, plus I've been taking a course on Coursera about it. I also downloaded a machine learning textbook pdf that I plan on reading. I'm also taking a machine learning course at U of T in the winter. As well, I'm planning to take a Java course in the fall at Seneca. I also want to get my DB2 and TCP/IP certifications as back-up. These are good plans, I know. But I still feel depressed and anxious. I haven't been sleeping well lately. It doesn't help that my girlfriend who I just started dating in June is away in Nunavut for three weeks for geology field work and I have no way of contacting her. *sigh* I'm in such a bad mood. I feel like shit."

3ffga0,0,2015-08-01,Windows Licensing hell,thehunt33r,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/3ffga0/windows_licensing_hell/,"Hi /r/sysadmin !

So I must confess, I did not expect this kind of trouble. I am at the moment an intern in a security consulting firm, and more or less Jr Sysadmin. 

This is a small firm, we're somewhere between 40-60 employees so nothing too big.
On Wednesday, Windows 10 got out so I decided to upgrade, thinking my PC was running 8.1 Pro, and learned that it was running Enterprise. When asking to the Sr Sysadmin, and after him asking around, we noticed that licensing is a COMPLETE MESS here.

Every PC is running 8.1 Enterprise unlicensed (there was a VL from Microsoft Silver Partner 2 years ago, but that ended so we shouldn't have those licenses (+ according to what I've been told, we're limited to use ~25 in house)).

That's why we have decided to rectify all that with Windows 10.

 Now... how can we do ?

We're thinking buying Windows 10 Pro licenses (our vendor quotes us 122€ per license), and reinstalling every PC. That would be very long but that's the game right ?

We were also thinking about VL but if I understood correctly, VL is only for upgrade licenses, therefore as our PCs OEM licenses are mostly all 7 Home / 8 Home, we could only upgrade them to Windows 7/8.1 Entreprise ? Plus, I don't know if we're going to break even with VL compared to the retail licenses.

We're also going to get the Silver Partner thing back this year, but we want to keep the in-house licenses for Windows servers.

What's /r/sysadmin input on this ? How deep in trouble are we ?

Thanks and have a good weekend :)

I was lazy in class and pursued other interests in school even besides CS (not partying/wasting time, but academic stuff like travelling debate, was president of a few clubs, organized campus events, etc. - I kept myself very busy, I just never got really passionate about programming/data structures/the typical coursework) 

Now I'm out of school, and faced with these realities: 

* I have a mediocre GPA: ~2.7
* I have no internships to my name or SE work experience
* I'm not *good* at programming because I just never bothered to learn too much in the first place. Now working on some side projects, I see how quickly I can pick stuff up, but right now I have a dearth of a skillset. 

So here's the situation: I applied for a web dev job in Manhattan. The pay is listed as 50k, which is why I suspect my non-competitive resume got through in the first place. I have an on-site interview on Tuesday. Let's say I do get offered the job. Some facts:

* I'm broke and could really use money, sooner the better
* I have no experience, and this would fix that
* I currently live with my parents in Brooklyn, so 0 current cost-of-living besides food and commute, but this may change soon, they're looking to move away and I'll have to live independently

With all that said, I know a 50k salary is very low for NYC. I don't think I'll be able to negotiate up, I don't have any skills or competing offers to back me. 

Will taking such a low-paying job damage my future career options? Or will I be able to much more easily apply for something in the 80-100k range in NYC after a year of actual SE/WD work under my belt + more studying what I lacked the past 4 years for future interviews? Should I take the money and exp now, or should I hold out and keep applying for other jobs?

I'd love to talk this through with some of you more experienced folks - would greatly appreciate any advice!"

Going to have a BA in Computer Science in 2 years (age 27). I plan on doing local internships as a Teacher's Assistant, tutor, or Technology Assistant at schools while my degree is in progress, and then living in Japan for an undetermined amount of time while teaching ESL.

I'm currently studying Japanese and plan to be able to read, write, and speak (not fluently, obviously) before my move.

My biggest concerns are as follows:

-With a TESOL certification, teaching experience locally, a BA and Japanese speaking/reading/writing, how difficult will it be for me to find a job as an English teacher in Japan?

-I've heard that working long-term as an ESL teacher looks poorly on a resume. As such, I'd like to transition to some sort of IT/computer industry related job after some time in Japan (assuming the move goes according to plan). Are there any resources that would be helpful, or useful advice that any of you can give to aid me in this process, or is this completely unrealistic?

Thanks in advance!"

I'm aware of some of the standard guidelines for transporting a computer (namely taking the graphics card out of the tower so it doesn't fall in transit, transporting the hard drive in shockproof foam, etc.) but I'm wondering whether it's safe to take the tower with the mobo, psu, cpu, etc. still inside, packed in the box/foam it came in. I know that styrofoam can be bad about static sometimes, and I don't want to fry my baby.

First off, let's start with the basics I am currently in law school about to enter my 3L and final year before graduation. I hate it. HATE IT. The problem here is I'm good at it. I have a 3.89 GPA. But right now I feel like I would rather put a needle filled with air into an artery rather than go back on the 17th. BUT. It is one year and I can graduate with a Magna Cum Laude JD assuming I don't tank it hard this coming year. I feel like I don't want to practice law. There are certainly things I find interesting and absolutely love about the law but so much of what I love is surface stuff. I had 5 classes last semester, only one made me not want to kill myself **Note: I am not actually suicidal I just really really despise law school and am expressing that in a bad manner but the only manner I can to show just how much I dislike it** My SO has been my cheerleader to get me though those super dark I hate law school times have really been what's gotten me this far into the program. And I'm not sure I can do another year completely on my own there  I also didn't get the summer internship I really wanted - so I just stayed working at the chiropractor's office and I also helped TA a summer law class (the only class I enjoyed from last semester) so it's not a career ender but summer 2L clerkship/internship is pretty important. It's just so hard to say fuck it and throw the towel in when I have such a short time to go and am doing as well as I am (GPA wise).

I took a part-time job as a Chiropractic Assistant (CA) at a local wellness place that is just a mile from my apartment. Which has got me thinking about pursuing a RN program rather than law school. (If you need more info on this part I can give it just cut out a lot because this while still messy is less messy and took it out for post condensing purposes. 

My SO and I have been together off and on (a 4 month break 3 years ago) since 2008. He recently graduated from grad school and was offered a job in another state (about 8 hours from where we are now). I asked the question (today) ""where does this move put us?"" as in a what happens to our relationship. His answer was he didn't know, hadn't had much of a chance to think about it, which is fair this job thing has been a bit of a whirl wind for both of us. I told him I didn't expect an answer that very second, or even today or tomorrow I just wanted to bring the subject up because we are going to have to talk about it at some point, sooner than later (his job starts the 17th) and that I mostly brought it up so we could begin thinking about what this move means. 

I've looked into it there is a law school in the town he is moving to, it's not as good as the one I am currently at but it is also not anywhere near bottom of the barrel I would say it is a solid somewhere in the middle school - which if I'm not planning on practicing law serious at Big Law - would be a fine option. I've looked into the requirements and my school has 'reciprocity' with this other school. Meaning that basically all I have to do is submit a week or two in advance my request to utilize the tools and classes at this other place (basically like study abroad) my degree will still say the school I am currently at, the credits transfer just fine I just go to this other school for my last year. I still get to stay with my SO and finish law school (mostly the win win without if you don't factor in the hate of law school)

I haven't mentioned the option of law school reciprocity or even my thoughts of pursuing an RN degree with my SO yet - I've just been working up the courage to even as the question what does this move for him mean for us. I've just been so scared that he will either say he doesn't do long distance (that was part of the root of our break 3 years ago) or that he will say he doesn't want me to follow him to this new town and that we may try to make it work but it eventual turns from a nightly phone call to a weekly call to a monthly and slowly but surely we just drift apart because of the distance and before we know it what we have is gone and there's no bringing it back. And I love this man I really do I would be absolutely devastated to lose this. Just the thought of it makes me sick to my stomach. 

I've never really dealt with depression but this might be it. I have also been super sensitive the last few days. It was like I did a post earlier on a different account and someone was like this is dumb and I responded trying to show reasoning and someone else commented you're an idiot. I know I'm not but damn it hurt me and usually things like that bounce right off but for some reason this super got to me - maybe because I feel like I don't know what to do in life and feel like I'm an idiot for not being able to figure it out, not able to adult as well as I feel I should and so this person calling me an idiot just reconfirmed what I already knew and it somehow made it real? Anyways I'm rambling now. 

1. Stay in law school for another year where I am no matter what it does to my relationship and no matter how much I hate it? 

2. Drop out of law school completely? Then what? 

3. Move with my SO (assuming he wants that) and figure things out as we go? 

So I know I've hit people with a lot - probably too much - I'm just a jumbled mess and like my title said I've got more questions than answers to life right now and I'm starting feel like I'm suffocating and the only thing that gets me is ""Twitchy"" the squirrel that comes to get nuts off my porch every morning the only problem with Twitchy is while he is an awesome listener his answers kind of suck. 

Edit 1: Sorry if I chose the wrong flair I could only pick one and there is a lot going on in this post so I figured personal was a pretty broad spectrum category. 

**Edit 2 TL;DR: Looking for advice on if I should stick with law school, which kind of hinges on what happens with my relationship I suppose, and also some random seeking of advice regarding my part-time job situation. So I've got, school, relationship, job advice circulating in all of this.**"

[UPDATE 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3gezrw/am_i_overreacting_update_2/)

Things have been a little tense lately between me and my friend Logan. Everyone’s telling me I worry too much, and normally I’d agree with them, but this time… I don’t know. You tell me.

I’ve known Logan for a while. We actually went to the same high school, but we didn’t become friends until our first year of college, when we started taking a lot of the same classes. 

Last summer, we pitched in with two other students to start renting an apartment three blocks from the university, since the dorms summarily kick everyone out after sophomore year. The apartment’s actually pretty sweet. Nice view, spacious, all the modern amenities. Rent sucks because we live close to Silicon Valley and the rich computer nerds set the price, but it’s manageable when split four ways. 

We get along well enough, too, mostly because Logan’s the type who gets along with everyone. Social glue, basically. He somehow knows half of the people on campus, and actively seeks out the other half because he, unlike antisocial me, likes people, and will not hesitate to greet near-strangers from across the quad. It’s the kind of easygoing confidence I wish I had.

Unsurprisingly, he made about fifty billion contacts at the winter job fair, which helped him land an eight-week water resources internship in El Dorado county that he‘d been gunning for since last year. 

Once he got the job, he wouldn’t shut up about it. Spring Quarter stress really wore him down, more than any quarter thus far, so it was nice to see him genuinely excited about something. I’ll admit I was a little sad to see him go, since the summer would be half over by the time he got back, but I figured we could text and snapchat and skype and whatever else to keep in touch. He was going off to do something he loved, and it’s not like he was going to Mars. 

For the first seven weeks, he gave me daily updates on the project, still as excited as ever. It’s some big river diversion thing, where they’re digging a canal through a forest to join a smaller river with another, much bigger river. It’s supposed to prevent flood damage to a nearby town. It’ll take at least a year to complete, so he’s only working there for a small fraction of the ordeal. 

They were still in the process of clearing a path through the forest when Logan arrived, so most of his work involved measuring elevation and calculating slopes, cut, fill and flow capacity. Lots of field work and technical terms that I vaguely understand. Not sure why they didn’t start before an El Niño year, but whatever. I’m not the civil engineer.
	
A few days ago, he called me around three in the afternoon. Usually, a phone call wouldn’t be worth mentioning, but what he said, and especially *how* he said it, didn’t sit well with me.

When I picked up, I heard him breathing hard on the other end. Not in a creepy way, but like he had just hiked up a mountain, and considering the job location, it was entirely possible.

“Logan? Dude, what’s up?”

A long pause, then an intake of breath. “Sophia?”

Never in my entire life have I heard his voice sound so brittle and unsteady. My chest tensed. “Are you okay?” 

He didn’t answer. 

“Logan, what happened?”

Too quickly, he sad, “Nothing happened.” He made a few clicking sounds in the back of his throat, as if he were unable to find the right words, and I imagined him raking back his hair in bewilderment. “I don’t think-” He trailed off. “No. Nothing happened.”

“But you’re not entirely sure?” My mouth was going dry. “Logan, why did you call me?”

“I shouldn’t have… sorry, Sophia. I don’t know why I called you. I need to get back to work. Talk to you later.”

Even as I pleaded with him to keep talking, the line dropped. I immediately called him back, but he didn’t answer. I called again. No answer. I threw him a slew of texts, snapchats, more phone calls, and later some skype messages, too, but received no reply. Logan had instated complete radio silence. 

I texted his sister, but he hadn’t talked to her. I asked Mariah and Kyle, our roommates, but they knew nothing, either. 

They tried to comfort me, saying that he was probably fine, if not totally thoughtless for taking so long to call back. That if something had happened to him, his coworkers or his boss would have taken care of him, since it looks really bad for the company to have interns dying left and right. Maybe he was working on an intensive project. Maybe he was just having a moment. 

Even though they had a point, they hadn’t heard the way he’d sounded on the phone. They didn’t talk to him every day like I did, so how could they possibly understand how frightening his silence was? 

At that point, the anxiety was getting a pretty good handhold. I couldn’t get his voice out of my head, so distracted and unsure, so entirely opposed to his usual demeanor. If he’d lost his phone or charger, he would have at least skyped me that night, because he knows I’m the world’s expert at assuming the worst. Maybe he really had died and the company covered it up? I could have called his employer, just to see, but that would have meant acknowledging my growing panic.

I scoured the newspaper websites from El Dorado county, searching for any report of a hapless intern’s disappearance or admittance to a local hospital. No luck. 

Meanwhile, my snapchats remained unopened. My skype messages remained unseen. My calls remained unanswered. 

After two full days, Logan finally reestablished contact, and inevitably, it didn‘t go the way I thought it would.

	[Logan 4:12]: hey dude, what‘s up?
	[Me 4:12]: wat
	[Me 4:13]: Logan ffs I was having a heart attack over here, thinking you got into a fight with Yogi and lost. You can’t call me like that and then leave me hanging. You sounded really upset, and I thought something bad happened to you. I was about to call the cops. 
	[Me 4:14]: What were you even doing, man? Did they lock you in a dungeon? Make you dig the canal by yourself? Or did the trees eat your cell signal?
	[Logan 4:30]: haha something like that
	[Logan 4:32]: I was sick for a few days, but I’m fine now, no need to worry. Sorry I scared you. 
	[Me 4:32]: So sick that you couldn’t let me know you were still alive? You better be sorry. I’m glad you’re okay, but please don’t do that again, at least not without giving me a warning first. 
	[Logan 5:01]: Will do. Sorry again. 

Keep in mind that he’d been effectively missing for the entire weekend. Maybe it’s because we’re different people, but if I dropped off of the radar whilst staying more than three hours away from home, I’d want my friends and family to make sure I was okay. He had to have seen all of my attempts to reach him, too, so he must have known how scared I was.

Am I not supposed to care? He could have been dying in a ditch somewhere, completely helpless, like Schrödinger’s Murder Victim. I’d been expecting to get a text from him saying he‘d been fired from his internship, or maybe even a call from his sister that he’d been found out in the woods by a couple of hikers, dehydrated and delirious. Instead, he was acting like nothing had happened. It pissed me off, especially him telling me not to worry, just like Kyle and Mariah did. No one had taken the situation seriously at all.

In any case, even though his cavalier attitude concerned me, things kinda went back to semi-normal. This tentative sense of routine conversation lasted about twelve hours.

I always turn my phone to silent before I go to bed because I don’t want random shit waking me up in the middle of the night. If it’s important enough, they’ll call the home phone. So, the morning after Logan re-established contact, I woke up to this:
	
	[Logan 1:24]: warning first
	[Logan 2:41]: and lost
	[Logan 4:12]: sorry again

I’m not entirely sure what it’s supposed to mean, like if he thinks he’s being funny or if it’s just some phone glitch, but it‘s weird. He could be trying to lighten the mood by making a joke, but if so it‘s gone totally over my head. I showed it to Kyle and Mariah and they seemed a little skeeved out, but ultimately they shrugged it off, and for the eighth time this week, Mariah said I worry too much. 

I’m beginning to wonder if I really am just blowing everything out of proportion and letting my fear get the best of me. Wouldn’t be the first time. 

Maybe it’s a prank? Logan isn’t the kind of guy who pulls stupid pranks, though. Which I guess makes him the perfect person to do something like this. Right now I’m not sure what to think, but he comes home on Tuesday.

I’ll have to figure this out by then."

What rights do I have?,newstarttn,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3fkda4/title_ix_usa_school_not_responding_to_title_ix/,"So last semester, a small incident happened with a professor where I had a visiting professor (taught a class for a semester) request a hug and started kissing my neck while I was making up an exam during office hours.

After that, I stopped attending class due to being nervous about the professor and my grade dropped from a low A to a C. While this isn't horrendous, it was certainly lower than every other grade I had and negatively impacted my GPA.

I waited until the next semester to report as I didn't want to ruin the guy's career if I was just overreacting. I thought ""he didn't actually sexually assault me, plus he's taught all over the world; it was a big honor for my school to have him; he's a fullbright scholar; i dont want to ruin his life"". During the beginning of second semester though, I heard a few rumors that other girl(s) had been speaking up about sexual harassment (though I haven't had any proof about those).

By then the professor was done with his semester on our campus and he had left. I didn't really want much done as I just wanted the whole issue to be done with. They offered my counseling (which I took) because it brought up some past issues with being sexually assaulted. The main thing that I asked for though was to have the class struck from my record as a retroactive withdrawal and the Title IX coordinator said he would work on it. This was in January of this year.

My friend who had different circumstances (a poorly ranked professor) in a class requested a retroactive withdrawal and got the acceptance within a month.

I emailed the Title IX coordinator at the beginning of the summer asking about it and he said he had heard nothing back and it didn't seem to be of high priority to him.

Now I'm getting close to applying to jobs and internships and potentially transferring from the university and the grade is still on my transcript with literally months after when this issue should've been taken care of and no end in sight. This still affects my GPA negatively and I don't feel like this is right.

I don't even know if there was an investigation done or what is going on with the school. They seem to feel like it's very ""case-closed"" but I don't feel satisfied with what happened as I feel like they brushed me off and still are. 

What should be expected in cases like these? What rights do I have? What do I do?

Essentially, May 2016 I will be graduating with an MBA in finance.  I did my MBA concurrently with by BS, so my only experience is my current internship, but it's full-time, fairly relevant, and I'll have been at it for over a year by the time I graduate.

When I graduate, the only obligations I'll really have are my student loans (they're fairly manageable, I didn't take out many).  My parents are splitting up, my brother joined the military, and I don't have many friends, so I want to start fresh when I finish school, and I've always wanted to see more of the world, so I was thinking about going to Europe.  Scotland keeps sticking in my head, although I don't have any particular reason to gravitate towards there.  I've also considered Germany/a German speaking country as German is my minor and I'm alright at the language (I've been studying it for the past 7 years), but I'm a bit intimidated.

Anyways, I guess at this point my questions are fairly basic--does anyone have specific suggestions in regard to my situation/possible locations?  What is the timeline I should be aiming for in terms of finding a job and applying for a visa?  I looked at the website for getting a visa in the UK, and I wasn't totally sure what I would be doing, so if anyone can advise at what I should be looking for I would appreciate it.

If I hadn't been using Windows side by side with Linux the past couple of years I don't think I would have been been able to do the work I am doing now as I use cmd and powershell quite extensively. And VS is a hell of an IDE. The debugger blows everything else I have used right out of the water."

I worked hard and got various things done. However, my independent project was horrible. 

I had two supervisors.  One who was brand new and I would see often. She would say everything looks great and such. The other who was the director and I didn't see too often. She would basically say I need to be more focused and improve my quality of my independent project while the new one would just sit quietly. I took my director's comment seriously and worked to improve. I will continue to but that was only criticism. I got a lot of work done on other things that they needed ie special events and daily implementation of things.

I am 24 and I am a current Masters student and next year I graduate from a great program (with hopefully great grades. My GPA is well above a 3.5). I have held previous internships and a job with no issues. 

I am planning to get another internship and not ask for references from this place. Is there any other suggestions? I just want to make sure I grow from this and it doesn't screw up my chances of a job. I am also trying to get a little better with prioritization since I think that was key to this issue.

I have already completed two CS courses over this Summer at community colleges, which are equivalents of CS 101 and Discrete Math at my college. I took three other programming courses during my freshman and sophomore years. I still have 2 years and an extra semester added to graduate for double majoring which isn't bad at all! I boast a 3.76 GPA with about 80 hours done and have a Summer IT internship which will be done at the end of this week.

Before starting CS I had decent-good knowledge of things like arrays, various loops, if statements, variables, and other basic things like that. Since I will be completing my CS degree on a slightly different time frame than most students I am afraid I will not grasp things as well or miss out on learning things the best I could.

Maybe I am freaking out (don't have to tell me twice), but where should I be focusing my efforts? I want to be a really good programmer by the time my graduation rolls around with the obvious much to still learn. Am I at a disadvantage or is 2.5 years left still plenty of time to learn a lot? My discrete class this Summer really helped, but I did not grasp everything the best I could. Math and hardly having any free time this Summer really put me at a disadvantage. I also learned PowerShell this Summer and for the 7-8 weeks I made a lot of progress!

So, maybe I am looking for stories or something to put me at ease, I am not sure. Thank you for your time and replies!"

Currently, I'm interning at a medium sized company as an IT BSA intern. So far, the majority of my job is interacting with users, gathering requirements for projects, and some basic IT work (server upgrades, getting databases to work, fixing apps for people). 

I like what I have been doing at my internship, however I'm afraid of getting stuck at a place like this forever. I'm currently going into my junior year of college studying computer science and engineering, and although I like working at this company, it doesn't really seem to relate to my degree very much. I would be perfectly happy working a job similar to this (maybe with more technical pieces) however I don't want to live in my area (rural, would rather live in a city). 

I just wanted to hear from some people with jobs as a BSA (or similar to a BSA) about what they typically do at their work. I know that every job is going to be different, however I will probably end up interning here for another year, and I don't want to find out after graduating that my experience is pretty much useless and I'm gonna be stuck at this company forever. 

TL;DR: What do BSA's actually do?"

""Other Disciplines"" Topics on EIT -- http://ncees.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/FE-Other-CBT-specs.pdf

I'm Construction Management and General Engineering (biomaterials concentration). I'm trying to decide what FE / EIT I should sit. My end goal is to be a building science / materials / sustainability consultant in design-build (i.e. be involved from the concept to EOL, and work with &amp; coordinate between the owner, contractor, architect, engineers, and CM -- if I'm not the CM). 

Given that I'm not a proper Civil Engineering major, there's some scope gaps for the Civil: 

1. Transportation Engineering  8-12 questions (All sub areas)
    A. Geometric design of streets and highways
    B. Geometric design of intersections
    C. Pavement system design (e.g., thickness, subgrade, drainage, rehabilitation)
    D. Traffic safety
    E. Traffic capacity
    F. Traffic flow theory
    G. Traffic control devices
    H. Transportation planning (e.g., travel forecast modeling)

2. Environmental Engineering 6-9 questions  (All sub areas) 
    A. Water quality (ground and surface)
    B. Basic tests (e.g., water, wastewater, air)
    C. Environmental regulations
    D. Water supply and treatment
    E. Wastewater collection and treatment

3. Hydraulics and Hydrologic Systems 8-12 questions (Sub areas A, C, D, F, and G)
    A. Basic hydrology (e.g., infiltration, rainfall, runoff, detention, flood flows, watersheds)
    B. Basic hydraulics (e.g., Manning equation, Bernoulli theorem, open-channel flow, pipe flow)
    C. Pumping systems (water and wastewater)
    D. Water distribution systems
    E. Reservoirs (e.g., dams, routing, spillways)
    F. Groundwater (e.g., flow, wells, drawdown)
    G. Storm sewer collection systems


That being said, I'm already well prepared for the Ethics &amp; Professional Practice (have written subcontracts in my internships) Construction (multiple internships), Surveying, and Materials sections from having worked with a civil contractor, as well as creating asphalt mix designs during a summer research program. 

Those aren't going to be on the ""Other"" test. And the ""Other"" test contains areas that are rusty. 

It's been 5 years since I took Gen Chem, 3 since OChem. I think I'd be fine on the sections concerning Instrumentation and Data Acquisition as well as Safety, Health, and Environment. 

However, it seems that there's a strong focus on Fluid Mechanics (let me put it this way, I'm retaking it my final quarter), as well as Thermo (I got an A in that...), and Heat Transfer (taking it this summer). I haven't had much experience with Electricity, Power, and Magnetism outside of freshman physics and what I've experienced in my construction internships (not much). 

For those of you who have taken it, what would you do in my situation? 

Mods: If this is an improper post, please remove. I don't think this falls into questions regarding degree / major choice, or job applications, but I can see how it's close. If it's too close, I'm sorry.

I need some advice. I'm about to start an MS degree that combines cs, stats, and economics. It's at a top school and the program is very much expected to train me very well to become a good data scientist (that can do more than just code). Right now, I work on data projects with R, Python, and other more development tools like Django, HTML, CSS, etc. I have taken many stats courses so I already know quite a bit of theory, but expect the MS to teach me more. 

Anyway, I currently have a few projects going on:  I work for a professor as an RA (not too many hours), have a contracting gig for a few hours doing some of that data development stuff, and will maybe get some hours working at a data science shop in my city. 

Cue a few weeks ago. I got an email from the CTO of a 3-month old start up. He said he saw my github and was interested in me as a data science lead position. I don't have unicorn-level code in my github but whatever... I was clear that I would not be able to work more than 15hours a week (but I'm aware how startup culture is), especially after they wanted to schedule meetings at 7pm. They hope to get funding later on, but if I take this on now, I'm going into it knowing that $$ probably won't come out of it. They seem to have a good head on their shoulders (even though they are young 20s (so am I)), and they have a very good product idea. I'm not sure they have much of an idea of what I could do with their data, but they are looking ahead to what can be done. They asked if I wanted to later on be a lead role, and sure, sounds nice, even though I still feel I can learn so much more. 

My question is:  is it worth taking up this opportunity with all of my other commitments? There will not be money involved, but would having a lead position, a position to play around with data and say what's going to happen, be beneficial right now, early in my career? Is the opportunity cost of not getting paid here v. maybe getting more paid hours elsewhere (but at more of an ""intern"" level) worth it?

Thanks for any thoughts!"

The problem I have with going to the job fair so soon is that I won't have any completed coursework or grades by then, and that I heard recruiters aren't really looking for freshmen.

I had just started taking phone calls and we were fresh off the start of the week. I was exhausted and, at the time, wasn't as familiar with the various setups our clients had as I am now (and even then I'm nowhere near as familiar with it as the senior techs and long-term interns).

&gt;$FrontDesk: Hi, $Customer is having an issue with their third party emails. Thanks! *I take the call*

I haven't interacted with this customer much before and at this point I haven't learned to distrust the user yet, although I am starting to. She tells me none of their third party emails are coming through, but the most important one is one of their business partners. I see, in the ticket queue, that one of their onsite tech guys has opened a ticket for it already. The email chain consists of the frantic user getting gradually snappier with the tech until he shoves it off to the helpdesk.

&gt;$migbits: Got it, let me just whitelist that domain in our spam filter and we'll wait about twenty minutes to see if it goes through as a test. What did you say the address was?

&gt;$Customer: It's domain.com.

So I add it to the spam filter and end the call while I get started on another ticket. About an hour later a message pops up on my screen from the onsite tech. Yep, it didn't work so the now very frustrated client called their IT guy. Again.

&gt;$OnsiteGuy: Hey migbits, this is about the third-party issue from earlier, so you were able to log in to the [other hosted email service] portal to white list the address?

&gt;$migbits: No, I went through the spam filter and added it to the list.

Here's the thing, the helpdesk can access certain services that our onsite tech guys can't. Reverse also applies, they'll have access to programs and server credentials that we don't. This can cause a lot of confusion between both parties when one is using something the other is not familiar with. In this case, $OnsiteGuy doesn't use either of the services we have for spam filtering or hosted email with this client. Not all techs are willing to admit that the helpdesk knows certain things better than they do (think of the doctors/nurses relationships in hospitals).

Obviously I have no idea what I'm doing at this point in time either, but $Workaholic is helping me out by reading the messages over my shoulder and telling me how it works.

&gt;$OnsiteGuy: Ooookay, so what is the level of filtering that is being done on the domain?

&gt;$migbits: Define level of filtering?

&gt;$OnsiteGuy: Well last time I looked at the spam filter there was a slider bar that determined how thoroughly it looked through emails. That was a while ago, was wondering how severe it is right now and what websites are blocked etc.

At this point I'm very confused because I haven't seen *anything* like what he described in our spam filter. I turn to $Workaholic.

&gt;$migbits: You know what he's talking about?

&gt;$Workaholic: Nope. I guess just check the spam filtering policies and see how specific theirs is. Also their quarantined emails.

It turned out they had their default settings and only a few quarantined emails from a domain with a similar name, not the one the user gave me, which were reasonably blocked as spam (*get twenty percent off your next purchase* etc.) and nothing for that particular user. I relay this to the tech.

&gt;$migbits: *blah blah explanation* ...So the spam filter acts as a buffer and catches the emails. If they weren't quarantined that means they already went through, that's what I'm seeing in the logs.

&gt;$OnsiteGuy: Is there any way you can let the quarantined messages through to be delivered?

&gt;$migbits: Yes, but if the message itself isn't in quarantine, that means the messages were never sent in the first place. And all I'm seeing are these 20% off emails, I don't think those are the ones you want. Want me to white list this other domain?

&gt;$OnsiteGuy: Yes, can you also whitelist it on [hosted email service]?

&gt;$Workaholic: I don't understand why he keeps talking about whitelisting it on our email service, THAT'S WHAT THE SPAM FILTER IS FOR. Here, let me poke around and see what I can find.

Meanwhile I go about adding it to the whitelist and following up with the tech.

&gt;$migbits: When exactly did this issue start?

&gt;$OnsiteGuy: It's a new issue.

&gt;$migbits: No I mean as in what date? Yesterday? Today?

&gt;$OnsiteGuy: Today.

&gt;$migbits: Is it just this one user?

&gt;$OnsiteGuy: As far as I know.

Already splitting off from what the customer claimed, that's not a good sign.

&gt;$OnsiteGuy: Both domains are now whitelisted in the hosted email service right?

*Sigh.*

&gt;$Workaholic: *from across the room* I got it, he's talking about the additional filter [hosted email] has. We don't use it because we have our own spam filter.

I once again relay this to the tech.

&gt;$OnsiteGuy: So it goes through the spam filter first, right?

&gt;$migbits: *really starting to get irritated now* Yes, it does, the spam filter catches it. I'm pretty sure the feature is disabled for their hosted email.

&gt;$OnsiteGuy: So the service isn't running at all?

&gt;$migbits: **NO.**

&gt;$OnsiteGuy: Oh. I didn't even know we could do that.

It also turns out that after this, the issue supposedly persisted and the customer who called kicked up such a large fuss that this onsite tech was *convinced* it was a DNS issue, among other things (turned out the issue actually started that Friday, not the day of). In the end it wasn't affecting the entire company the way the customer claimed, nor was it a DNS issue like the onsite tech claimed. The original problem was limited to one specific domain for one specific address, and after the dust had settled for a few hours they realized all their emails were coming through from that address and they stopped caring. I got called out by my bosses for this the day after for a status update, that's how much of a big deal this became. I'm pretty sure either the customer complained or the onsite tech escalated up the chain when he shouldn't have.

I wish I could say this was the last bad experience I had with this tech, but unfortunately there's one other tale to be had.

TLDR: Professional tech stubbornly plugs his ears whenever the help desk interns open their mouths."

While I did do a couple of projects for courses during undergrad and I feel like I have a strong grasp of the fundamentals, I basically have no experience with software outside of coursework for my minor and a few for-fun online courses.

I'm currently enrolled at my community college and am not taking a single computer class due to the fact that my school offers very little and my current schedule just doesn't have space for it if I want to graduate in the next three semesters(I messed up my first two schedules and failed Calculus so I have to stay for 5 semesters instead of 4.) My schedules for the next 3 semester only consist of general education classes, and I didn't plan on taking anything related to Computer Science until I transferred into a 4-year university as I didn't want to be stuck doing the same general education courses at a very high price. 

Should I be concerned or is this normal for any student at a community college? Should I be learning coding on my before transferring? If so, where should I start?  

I do plan on doing internships to gain some experience, but am I looking at that wrong? Should I already have experience to be able to do an internship? 

I basically have no idea what i'm doing and i'm stressing over it. Any advice would be appreciated. "

3fox10,4,2015-08-03,What if they offer me a position? (junior CS student),fuckthatbrougham,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3fox10/what_if_they_offer_me_a_position_junior_cs_student/,"I've had a well paying internship this summer making about 30/hour doing full stack development.  I have about two 4 month semesters to go before I complete my undergraduate degree.  I've gotten a lot of positive responses from management regarding my work and how they want me to come back.  Sometime this includes comments about if I would ""come back after I graduate"" and other times they ask me questions regarding how I would feel about working there (""you want to work at &lt;company name&gt;, right?"").  No offers though, it just seems like there might be a good chance based on the response to my hard work.  

I'm older than the average undergrad (early 30's) and I'm eager to start my career.   I'm kind of perplexed as to what my gameplan would be if I got an offer at the end of the summer, particularly if they ask if I would consider working full time right away.  They know I have 1 year to go before I'm finished.  I would lose a little respect for them if they asked me to ditch school/go to school part time to be honest, but this is what I've been working towards, I'm on the honor role as of this year as well.  The pay is decent and I'd get to stay in California (not bay area) for starters.  I just don't know the best plan of action.

Hypothetically, what are the chances they would offer me something that allows me to come back after I finish school? If they did offer me a full time position right away, could I or should I counter with me being willing to come back in 6-9 months?  Should I take the offer and finish my undergrad in CS over the next 3 years...?  

If anyone has been in a similar boat, I'd love to get some more insight.  I've read many posts in this sub regarding this type of issue but I think it deserves further discussion.  A lot of posts I've seen about this seem like a no brainer because of the low pay, but this position pays at the entry level for software devs in my area.  I like the company enough,  I just don't know.

I'm going into my final undergraduate semester this fall. I just received a full time offer from a company I have been interning at over the summer and I have to respond by mid-September. I'm really excited about this opportunity but I have a few concerns. 

I recently put in ~30 applications for entry level positions in and out of state. Hoping to get an interview or two by October and I plan on attending the university career fair which is also in October.

I'm caught in the middle of not wanting to let this opportunity go and not wanting to miss out on other, potentially better, opportunities (which obviously may never come).

I feel it would be immoral / unprofessional of me to accept the offer and turn around looking for a better offer. If I accept the offer and back out I assume I would be burning a bridge with this company. Same goes for negotiating the offer after accepting.

The offer is for 59k with a 4.5k signing bonus in the Phoenix area. I feel this is low. A lot of my peers have gotten much higher offers from much smaller companies with zero internship / side project experience. I have about 2 years worth of software engineer internship experience. Not sure if that even matters for entry level salaries.

I'm also concerned about the growth potential. The software team is small (~15 people) and all of their projects are built off one code base which is strictly in the .NET stack. While I understand a lot of employers like to see .NET experience I don't particularly care working in it and working here I'd have no escape from it."

3fpzov,1,2015-08-04,Looking for a path,ibundergrad,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/3fpzov/looking_for_a_path/,"Background:
So I have lurked on here a LOT this summer and been learning quite a bit about what I need to do to get into finance like networking, excel, internships, etc.. but I'm going into junior year and I want to know if my plan to counteract my mistakes during freshman and sophomore year will be enough to get into IB before I get an MBA.

Resume:
[Here](http://imgur.com/O3WnUxV) is a link to my resume, scrubbed of identifying data but hopefully not so much that looking at it doesn't give you an idea of my situation. I go to a big, well-known state school that has a good reputation.

School/Internship experience:
As my 3.4 GPA and lack of finance-based work experience shows, I didn't really know what I was doing when I started school. To make things worse, one of my parents had major medical issues (doctors at hospital A said there wasn't anything they could do before we switched hospitals) about a month into my first semester, and I was going to school on the opposite side of the country. I wasn't really focused on school at all, and I got the worst GPA of my life that first semester. Since then I've brought it up, but it was so bad initially that I'm still on probation with the honors department. I'm assuming that there are no excuses to an IB recruiter, so I don't tell this story in interviews, I'm just providing it for some context. Until recently, I didn't realize just how important research was, and I'm only now getting around to talking with professors and looking for a topic that I want to write a thesis on. I also didn't know exactly what career path I wanted until midway through sophomore year, so I went for a political internship that doesn't seem to hold much weight with any finance companies. This year I did get some more responsibilities at the same job, and sped up our workplace by googling VBA commands and using my programming knowledge from C++ and Java classes. I've been training new interns and even actual reps for the senator on our software systems, and presenting some awards at local events when the senator isn't in the district office, which (to me) seem like the most marketable things I've learned on the job aside from taking verbal abuse over the phone from old people who don't realize that state legislators can't single-handedly defund Obamacare or Planned Parenthood.

Excel:
So far, my Excel skills don't include VLOOKUP or pivot tables, so I am looking into online courses.  I plan to go on macabacus and learning on there, but I've also seen [this](https://www.coursera.org/course/compfinance) recommended. I started it last week, and it seems valuable in general, but I don't know/can't tell if it is exactly the kind of Excel stuff I should know for internships. Do you think it would still be useful for me to take in addition to macabacus, or should I be just focusing on my Excel right now?

Networking/Internship search:
I've started reaching out to both older and very recent (this summer) alumni who work/worked in IB, and I'm inviting some to speak with the investment club. My goal is to get a coffee chat with them as well and then ask who else I should talk to in order to get a view of the industry etc etc... hopefully this gets me some leads for jobs next summer. Unfortunately I am one of the people who thought that ""your important internship is after junior year"" meant that ""you don't need any important internships until junior year.""

If I am able to get my GPA up, do some research, and get pretty competent in the Excel functions I need for IB, what sort of internships are my best bet to focus on? Should I bother with BB or just focus on boutiques? If I can get into commercial banking credit/loan analysis, would that put me on a good path to get into IB before I get an MBA? I think if I work my ass off, it's doable, but I'm looking for outside opinions that can point out anything I've assumed here that is wrong.

Thanks!"

I live in South Korea, I studied here for a bit, went back to the US and came back to teach recently because i liked it here so much.  

I've been incredibly depressed since i got here, this society is very depressing to me and its very bad for my mental health and honestly i dont see myself living a few more months if im staying here; life is so much different working here than it is as an international student.  I don't even like the culture anymore and felt like i wasted 4 years learning the language; and its not a friendly place to live for someone of my mental condition.

I don't know what to do to get out though, I don't know where to go.  I graduated in International Relations and am Bilingual (Eng/Korean), I didn't do internships in university and wasn't able to build a big network of people.

One thing i am is flexible with location as long as it isnt a complete deserted rural area or just an absolutely horrible country to live in. 

Does anyone have suggestions? I'm interested in work or graduate school, but im limited on money."

I'm nearing the end of an internship going into my senior year, and I'm starting to think seriously about what I'll do when I'm graduated. I've found out this summer that I don't really want to a full time job doing what I've been doing though. However, there are openings at the company, and since I'm already here it is much easier to apply, and I think I'd most likely get an offer for one of the positions. The problem is that I'd likely get an offer for either a position that I don't really want to stay in, or at a location I don't really want to be at.

Should I still apply and if I get an offer, keep it in case I don't get an offer from a company I'm more interested in working for? Or is it generally frowned upon, since I likely would say yes until December or later, and then quit, possibly screwing over the manager that I had said yes to?

I've talked to some people that said the managers are usually okay with it because they want whatever is best for our careers, but I'm not sure if that's generally accepted, or if what I'm thinking is just kind of a douche move and I'd possibly be burning some bridges.

Does anyone have any insight into this and know what might be best to do?

Thanks."

My work laptop during my internship has been a Macbook pro 13"" 2015 and I've loved the experience. That being said, I really enjoy Windows and don't quite want to give it up yet especially with the release of Windows 10. My ideal laptop would be a Razer Blade but it's too expensive. The Alienware 13"" seems to be a great deal but many people don't like it?

* Country of purchase: USA

* Budget range: $1300 ideally but flexible if needed 

* Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): gaming &amp; data analysis

* Screen size preference: 13-14"" strictly

* OS preference (Windows/Mac/Linux): windows (dual boot linux)

* Gaming requirements (list example games and desired fps/settings): should be able to play modern games at medium graphics at 60 fps... perhaps Skyrim @ 60 fps is a good benchmark? i'm looking for a very mid range GPU - not as bad as integrated graphics but i don't need it to be amazing

* Other performance requirements (video editing, CAD, etc.): i would really like 16gb RAM and a 256gb SSD with a nVidia video card

* Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business compatibility): my most recent personal laptop was a Dell which I bought for their support - I was very disappointed. I had bad support experiences back with HP in 2008-2011 and a great experience with a Sony Vaio from 2012-2014. Apple seems to be expensive but their support is easily accessible should something go wrong with the laptop and that's very valuable to me. I've also heard that Acer laptops are unreliable, and Lenovo put malware in their laptops recently..? I'm very confused about which brands I should be preferring and would love some advice on that front.

* Any particular style that you like (examples are great): MacBook Pro, Razer Blade are really my ideals. I was also considering the Alienware 13"" but the brand seems to get a really hard time on some forums.

**Which of the following qualities would you prefer? (Choose one or two)**

* Long battery life -vs- Low weight -vs- High performance: Performance and weight (I'm good with a 3-4 hour battery life)

* Build quality -vs- Low price -vs- High performance: Performance and build quality for sure!!! I didn't emphasize build quality earlier but I would really like a solid build quality. I feel like at this point though there aren't any laptops that meet all of these requirements.

* Low noise/heat -vs- High performance -vs- Low price: I'm okay with fan noise. High performance &amp; low price.

**List any critical features:** As mentioned above, 256gb SSD would be great along with 16gb RAM (8gb minimum), along with a nVidia video card and a solid build.

**Which features would you pay a premium for?** (eg. high resolution screen, great keyboard/touchpad/audio) A nice touchpad would be great. I don't use the audio too often because I have a lot of headphones, so for what it's worth that's an area where I'd be willing to skimp.

A few more notes:

* I've tried going through the sidebar and other sites/threads before posting myself but somehow I still don't feel often. A lot of the laptops on the sidebar are Acer laptops which all of the people I know personally have had issues with, and I'm not sure what's going on with Lenovo. Furthermore Asus' store website has been down whenever I tried it over the past few days and they have so many products that I feel lost.

* I feel like I'm being unrealistic by expecting all of these specs to be in the price that I've listed, so if there's something that you know of with a price under $1700 I'd still like to know about it! Perhaps I could look out for deals/sales if I know of a specific model.

* I would prefer *not* to have a touchscreen display or a 4K/QHD display! I personally don't want to spend a premium on those features."

It started as an intern for $10/hr while I was going to college for CS. I was doing well in college but only took three semesters (for personal reasons that I don't think are relevant). At that point, I started working for the company full time and got a $1 raise. Maybe six months later, they said they were really impressed with me and bumped me up from $11 to $15. The next two years have been crazy, but I've learned a lot. I was the main developer for our latest product. My manager and coworkers constantly come to me when they have problems. I decided to ask about the possibility of another raise since it had been two years since my last one. I had a performance review and it was extremely positive. That was 6 months ago and I'm still at $15. I've brought it up a few times, and they say they're working on it, but I'm getting frustrated. I'm having to work a second job to afford everything and that's starting to affect my performance.

I'm not sure what I'm expecting out of this post, but one thing I'm curious of is how much I should be making. How much does someone with my experience typically make? I can provide more details if necessary.

If this raise doesn't happen soon, or if it's small, I might just put in my two weeks. I'd hate to do that though because I really like my job. I like what we do and I like the people I work with. The only issue I have is the money."

I interviewed for an intern position today and while I think I got the job, i don't know if I should take it. The pay is not good at all, which is to be expected, but I'll be working on a tech stack i enjoy a lot. The developers seem smart and competent. The internship is for a month, then they'll consider me for a fulltime position.

I have another(much higher paying) offer but it's for a shady IT contracting company based out of Virginia. I would very much prefer to stay in NYC so I'm trying to get something local. I also want some experience so my next job search isn't so painful. Should I take the internship or the job?"

Basically all of our Dell Optiplex 390s will randomly BSOD and sometimes not detect hard drives after rebooting (after blue screen). The problem is incredibly persistent but doesn't occur in a way that allows us to simply a 390 out of production and run it til it BSODs (sometimes the BSOD will only occur after weeks of being powered on). I've only be here this summer, so, I'm unaware of whether hard drive testing has been done in the past but we're going to attempt to test it with one we currently have in the office. The problem also seemed to develop over the course of the machines being in use, so it could simply be dying hard drives, but the quantity of failure seems to odd.

We're currently trying to get a hold of a Dell rep in order to either fix the 390s or get them replaced. Has anyone else experienced problems similar to this?

P.S. I've looked into the sales hold that was placed on the 390s due to deep sleep and our problems seem to differ than those experienced by the deep sleep issue."

I spent the summer of my junior year as a software engineering intern at NASA JPL.

I, you know, kiiinda wanna brag about it and I think it looks pretty good, so I'm tempted to do that to make my resume look better at a glance.

I'm a new grad (I spent the summer relaxing okay shhh) who went to a pretty average state school for my BSc in Computer Science and ended up with an okay-ish overall (3.55) and pretty solid in-major (3.7) GPA, so it's (probably?) worth mentioning those things prominently, too; I'd just like to know if something like this is acceptable or not and what you'd change!"

I'm taking a class next semester on Statistical Computing, aka R. I want to put some stuff on my resume with R as well as genuinely get experience with the language on projects, since I see myself using it in the foreseeable future. 

My school luckily is a large research university; research assistant positions are relatively easy to find (but that doesn't mean that they'll be meaningful positions). I found a short list of teachers whose research looks very interesting in the CS &amp; Biostats departments. They all deal with data analysis &amp; decision making

I'm just curious if this is the best way to get experience working on R, both professionally (something on a resume) and educationally (actually knowing how to use the language). I'm hoping a professor would begin by giving me some data sets work on and clean, all the while giving me exposure to the kind of work a data scientist would be involved in. As I complete my course on R, I hope he/she work into a more involved role

The risks I see is just that I don't know any of the professors I'm about to contact. I found their names because a fellow intern did a summer program involving Biostats Research. I was wondering if anyone here who has done research found it a useful experience for the industry

Also, would a business school use R for any research (Is it a factor in Technology &amp; Operations, Marketing, or Finance)? The CS &amp; Biostats departments have plenty of grad students doing research. The Business school has less grad students and much more $$$$, so they might have more meaningful positions for projects with plenty of funding. I may be able to find a stronger position there, but am not sure if any of them leverage data science"

Situation:
Recently, I posted my resume on some job boards. A placement firm contacted me about some IT opportunities in Hadoop. After initial phone call, went in for a 30min-talk the next day. Basically, they told me that, based on my school experience, they can hook me up with projects (contract roles) that pay $40K for the first 6 month, $50K for the next 6 months (however, this information is NOT on the contract). 
All I have to do is attend their “job oriented training” for 3~4 weeks, free of charge. I looked at their course content, it's just some really basic Hadoop, Hive, Pig, conceptual stuff. They do have a final project at the end. If they couldn't find me a placement in 2-3 months, I don't have to pay anything. Albeit, the “job oriented training” time would be wasted.

I googled this company. It has a few positive reviews on Glassdoor. It seems like a legit company?! But I am not sure. I have been trying to find internships and jobs on my own but with no luck.

It was a plus because it had all my movies, games, and music on it too so lunch was a lot more fun in the office.

So one day I have an intern working at my desk and I'm sitting in a chair in front of the desk with my laptop sitting on the chair's armrest (foolish, **foolish** mistake, I tell you!) and I'm updating a spreadsheet when I hear a rumble outside. It could be some of my clients fighting with one another so I need to go and see what's going on.

Lucky me, as I got up from the chair, my thigh brushed against the laptop and it fell flat on its bottom on the floor. I thought it was nothing and I'd pick it up when I came back into the office.

After sorting out the situation outside, I head back into the office and pick up my laptop, brush it off, kiss its little webcam forehead for any boo boos, and try to begin working again.

The screen starts to act really weird. Microsoft Excel is open and it is acting really strange, the window is moving from side to side and not letting me type things in. *Oh boy...*

I close Microsoft Excel but it won't let me save the changes I've made!

I go to the Desktop and it's still acting weird. I try opening Computer (Windows 7) and it isn't opening. No icons on the Desktop will open. I try to shut down, but it won't let me shut down either...so I decide to pull the battery.

I turn on the computer, hoping it was a temporary bug or maybe even a virus *at worst* and a black screen appears with the white letters:

&gt;No bootable device -- insert boot disk and press any key

After opening the laptop and trying to read the disk on another computer, I determined that the fall damaged the hard drive.

TL;DR: Don't be an idiot like me and put your laptop where it can fall

Fortunately, I had a warranty and was sent a brand new drive. I only had to pay the shipping on the old drive. It also gave me a chance to upgrade my laptop so it wasn't all bad. Luckily most of my information was backed up on hard drives I had lying around, on various cloud services (Thank you Jesus for Google Music!), and all of the work stuff was stored on our local server. I did lose the changes I had made on that spreadsheet, though...felt like wasted work."

We're a small shop: one desktop support (me), one network admin, one data assurance/anything that doesn't fit neatly in one of the other job descriptions, and one director/web developer (a.k.a. /u/jwhardcastle).  Despite the fact that we only have four people in the department, we're in charge of a lot of devices.  Probably 500+ PCs, an undetermined number of iPads and Chromebooks, printers, a projector for each room, and about 40 Macs (and that's not even getting into the infrastructure).  This story is about those Macs.

The network admin handles everything regarding building and maintaining imaging and management solutions for the 500+ PCs, and for a long time he did the Mac stuff too, but finally he decided it wasn't worth the Herculean amounts of effort it takes to get Macs to play nice in an enterprise environment, and I was willing to take on the responsibility to gain network admin experience, so he gladly pushed it off on me.  I did a 10.8 image, a 10.9 image, and as of earlier this year, I started an update to 10.10.

Now, I'm sure that any Mac admins on here will be familiar with the utter lack of support Apple provides for enterprise networks.  Apple devices are great if you follow the ""one device, one user"" model.  However, as soon as you try to use multiple user accounts on one device, or even worse, one or more user accounts on multiple devices, things get hairy reallll fast, and Apple is reluctant to help.  

Our previous infrastructure had largely been set up by an Apple Professional Services consultant in 2010, at considerable cost.  It was getting a little long in the tooth.  Our venerable XServe was still running 10.6, and the hardware did not support anything higher than 10.8.  So I started from scratch for the 10.10 deployment.  New virtual server running 10.10,  Profile Manager for restricting permissions instead of an OpenDirectory domain, latest version of DeployStudio, join to our Active Directory domain as part of the workflow, Munki, lots of customized packages for software installation, even a custom inventory script triggered by a LaunchAgent.  It was a lot of work, but the end result was shaping up to work much better than before.

Until I decided to have a student intern do ""final"" testing of all the installed software before deployment.

&gt; StudentIntern: It's asking me to change my password, and I can't log in.

&gt; Me: That's weird.  Our password policy is that passwords never expire.  Can you try this other Mac?

I got the network admin involved.

&gt; Me: Our AD password policy is that passwords never expire, right?

&gt; NetworkAdmin: Yep, has been for a while.  We have a GPO for password policy in place on our domain.

&gt; Me: Then why are these Macs asking for a password change?

&gt; NetworkAdmin: That seems like a weird bug, and these kinds of weird bugs are the reason I punted Macs over to you in the first place.  But I'll help.  Let's do some troubleshooting.

We discovered that accounts that were explicitly set to have a password that never expires were fine.  So were accounts with recently changed passwords, even if the new password was the same as the old one.  We tried machines with 10.8 and 10.9.  No problem.  We hit up Google.  We tried ADPassMon.  No dice.  We tried setting the loginwindow.plist to have a password expiry of 0.  No dice.  This was a showstopper bug; we couldn't deploy the image to labs with this issue.  And oddly, Google wasn't very helpful.  It seemed that nobody else had had a similar problem, ever.  So I did the logical (ha, ha) thing.  I called AppleCare.

Luckily, we had recently purchased a Mac that was waiting on this image to deploy, so it was sitting on my desk.  I punched in the serial number, and got a human.  I explained my problem, and was forwarded to Apple Professional Support.

&gt; ApplePro: So I understand you're having an issue with AD integration and passwords?

&gt; Me: That's correct.

I explained the problem and the troubleshooting steps.

&gt; ApplePro: I have a couple of steps I can try, but it's likely we're going to have to talk to an engineer about this.

&gt; Me: Okay, let's try them.

They basically amounted to stuff we had tried already, plus setting the computer account password to never expire.  (AD has computer accounts as well as user accounts, with a password set upon domain join; passwords eventualy expire and the domain sends over a new one.  This troubleshooting step didn't work either, since we were having problems with user accounts, not computer accounts.)

&gt; ApplePro: Unfortunately, I've reached the end of what I can help you with.  In order to get any more technical, you're going to need to talk to an engineer.  The price to talk to an engineer is $695.

&gt; Me: That's ridiculous!  This is a bug in your product.  You advertise AD integration as a feature, so any bugs with it should be fixed for free.

&gt; ApplePro: I'm sorry, that's the policy.

&gt; Me: I'd like to speak with your supervisor.

&gt; ApplePro: I'm the highest escalation level for Apple Professional support.

&gt; Me: Well you must have a boss.  I'd like to speak with him.

&gt; ApplePro: He's not reachable by phone, but I can give you his email address.

&gt; Me: Since when is a tech support supervisor not reachable by phone?

But whatever.  I got his email address, hung up, and emailed requesting a callback.  No callback for 3 days, so I called again.

&gt; Me: I've been told I cannot move forward with my issue without paying $695.  I'd like to discuss this with a supervisor.  

&gt; ApplePro2: Supervisors are not reachable by phone, but I can give you an email address.

&gt; Me: Yeah, I already got one, and have not received a response for 3 business days.  I'd like to get one on the phone, now.

&gt; ApplePro2 [unsure tone]: Well, I guess I can call him on another line and see if he's available...

&gt; Me: Sure!   Sounds great!  I'll hold!

Damned if I wasn't going to talk to someone about this...

After a long hold, the supervisor came on the phone.  The gist that I got out of him was that this was a non-negotiable policy, but that the $695 fee would be reversed if it wasn't an issue with our configuration.  I was skeptical, but I asked for him to email me so that I could respond back once I got approval from my boss (TechDirector).  He did.

I got approval from TechDirector.  What were we going to do?  This was a showstopper bug.  I also did a little bit of digging on my own.  I have a friend from college who actually works at Apple on the iPhone team.  I called him around lunchtime, not thinking about the fact that Cupertino is 3 hours behind the East Coast.

&gt; Me: Hey, how are you doing?

&gt; Friend: I'm fine.  Just cooking breakfast.  What's up?

Oops, I'm interrupting his morning routine.

&gt; Me: Well, I'm having this issue with Mac OS.

I explained the issue in brief.

&gt; Friend: It's not my area of expertise, but send me an email with what you just told me and any other info you have and I'll do some digging to see who might be able to help out.

&gt; Me: That's great!  Thanks!  I'll let you get back to breakfast.

I sent the email and heard back from him:

&gt; Friend: I forwarded your email on to the guy who maintains the AD bug queue.  I'll see what he says.

In the meantime, I called Apple Professional Support back and gave them the corporate credit card number.  They charged $695, and set up an incident.  This was on Friday afternoon.

Monday morning, I had responses from both an Apple Engineer, and my friend.  Both asked for diagnostic info.  I did what they asked and sent the info along.  I heard back from the engineer shortly.

&gt; Engineer: It looks like the computer is pulling a password expiration of 180 days from AD.  What is your policy set to?

I got ready to write back that it was set to 0 days.  But then something told me to verify that setting, just to cover my butt.  I fired up Remote Desktop to the domain controller and opened Group Policy editor.

&gt; Me: That's funny, I can't find the password expiration policy.

I looked around for a while.  Still couldn't find it.  So I edited the default policy.

&gt; Me: Son of a biscuit!  The MinPasswordAge and MaxPasswordAge policies are showing as ""not configured""!

I added each one with a value of 0, and tried logging onto the Mac with my test account.  Lo and behold, the login worked!  I came to the realization that the setting was never configured because Windows's default policy is that passwords never expire.  If you want passwords to expire on a domain, you have to configure those settings, but there was no reason for us to... until now.  I just assumed that the GPO was configured.  Turns out, the OS X 10.10 bug was not that it was reading the setting wrong -- it was that it was reading no seting and substituting its own default, which was not the same default as Windows, or as 10.8 or 10.9.

Finally, I talked to my intern.

&gt; Me: Can you try logging into the Macs again?

&gt; StudentIntern: Okeydoke.

5 minutes later...

&gt; StudentIntern: It works!

tl;dr: Trust but verify, especially when it comes to Apple products.  You might save yourself a lot of headache and a lot of money."

I'm a 21-year-old university student who'll be starting his senior year in the fall. This Friday, I'll be wrapping up an database systems internship (SQL Server stuff) with a top IT firm, and that would have been my only IT-related experience that I could put on a resume. 

Is there a way for me to somehow land a gig for some experience in TCP/IP/general networking in the winter to better prop up my resume prior to my anticipated graduation May 2016? How would I go about doing this? My GPA isn't hot at all either, I have a 2.7. I'm retaking two classes though, so I can easily push it past a 3.

And if I don't find anything, am I thoroughly screwed when it comes to finding an entry-level position in networking? I enjoyed my SQL work, but I highly doubt that I'd want to do this for the first five years or so out of school."

I spent some time traveling, intending to do some serious job-applying when I returned home but instead I've been working part time and living at home for the past few months. Programming skills are dwindling, and I've just recently gotten serious about brushing up the basics and working on projects. Definitely starting to feel the urgency to get an actual job for both personal and financial reasons, but I feel sooo out of practice. 

Additionally, one thing I'm really worried about is a lack of personal projects and experience. I did well in school but I never did any technical/programming internships. The one thing I have on my github is some front-end work on a school project, and I'm not all that proud of my code in it. 

I have yet to apply to any jobs because I'm worried I wouldn't do well in the interview, and I feel like I should have some code on github to show companies before even trying. I don't know if that's just an excuse to put off applying to jobs though. I guess my primary question is should I take the time to complete a small project before sending out resumes? Or in my situation would it be better to apply anyways and work on projects while job hunting?"

Rising college junior here looking for some advice. I'll try to keep it short and sweet, but I'll make sure to answer any comments asking for additional details as they arise. 

I just completed my 10-week summer internship at a media investment agency in Los Angeles (my hometown). For next summer, prior to my senior year, I'm hoping to look for an internship in an investment management firm (hopefully still in Los Angeles) to gain more experience on the finance side of things and hopefully use that experience to make some smart decisions about where I want to work in the future.

Do any of you have any particular advice going into the fall when I begin my internship search? I want to be able to best leverage what I've learned this summer in media investment towards my summer goals, but I'm not exactly sure how I should be doing that in terms of networking or what kind of firms to be searching for.

Have any of you made the transition from media to finance? Or the other way around? Do you have any general advice?

If it helps, I can show you my very entry level resume or LinkedIn to help get a better idea of where I'm coming from.

Thanks in advance for the help; I genuinely appreciate it.

3fy5l1,31,2015-08-05,Am I Overreacting? [Update],SockOverlord,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3fy5l1/am_i_overreacting_update/,"Some background information: [First Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3fk61n/am_i_overreacting/) - [Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3gezrw/am_i_overreacting_update_2/)

Logan came back yesterday evening. Things are definitely odd, but the oddness is just subtle enough that I might be reading too much into everything. 

At first, he seemed perfectly fine. Normal gait, normal clothes, normal expression. I’d received no more 2am texts, and he managed to drive two and a half hours without incident. He’d even made record time. 

Our apartment complex is boxed-in by an iron perimeter fence and he hadn’t brought his key on the trip, so I had to go down and unlock it for him. When he came trudging up the walkway with two month’s worth of luggage, I offered to help with his bags, but he politely declined. I held open the gate for him instead. 

A concrete pathway winds around the building, with increasing odd addresses to the left and decreasing even addresses to the right. He paused, staring at the numbers for maybe three seconds, before heading off toward our apartment. It’s a confusing number scheme, sure, but he’s probably been up and down that walkway upwards of one thousand times since we got the place. He should have known where he was going. He was probably just tired, or had a moment of nostalgia. Either way, I pretended not to notice.

The night was still young, and as soon as he unpacked, Kyle suggested we go out to dinner to celebrate the successful internship. It came as a surprise, because Kyle almost never goes out of his way to engage in social interaction. Thus, it came as an even bigger surprise when Logan said no. I had expected him to jump at the opportunity to drag a willing introvert (technically two willing introverts if you count me) out on a social excursion. 

Logan apologized and said he wanted to relax for the night and that maybe we could do it some other time, which I completely understand. But Kyle only ever offers once, and after he’s been turned down,  he won’t agree to it later on. Logan knows this. 

I guess it’s not that weird of a thing to do. Maybe I’m over thinking it.

In place of celebratory dinner, Logan and I settled in the living room with a couple of beers and switched on the television, but we ended up talking over the programming anyway. He described his coworkers, how much of the project they’d completed before he left, and all of the other things that hadn’t been worth mentioning via text.

As we spoke, my mind kept looping back to the panicked call and its aftermath. He still hadn’t brought it up and I wanted answers.

“So,” I eventually said, trying to sound casual as I drummed my fingers on the leather armrest, “were those texts you sent between one and four in the morning supposed to be a joke?” The words came out harsher than intended because I’d let the question fester for the past few days. I should have asked sooner. 

He gave me an uncomprehending stare. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”

Rolling my eyes, I showed him the nonsensical texts. Warning first. And lost. Sorry again.

He stared at the screen, then slowly shook his head. “Doesn’t ring any bells. I didn‘t send those.” Pulling out his own phone, he scrolled through our conversation, and held the screen up for me to see. “I don’t have them. Must be an error.”

My frown deepened. He wasn’t lying, which meant it probably was a glitch, then.

Unless he deleted them himself.

A few more minutes passed before I mustered the courage to ask, “Logan, what was up with that call, anyways?”

With a protracted sigh, he rolled his head back against the couch cushions. “Oh, my God, I’ve already told you-”

“No, you haven’t. When you called, I legitimately thought you had been shot or mauled by a bear or had seen a coworker die. That’s how bad you sounded. And then you left me hanging for two days. I thought that maybe *you* had died. I think I deserve an explanation.”

He refused to make eye contact and continued to watch the program, sipping his beer with infuriating tranquility. I grabbed the remote and turned off the television, starting to get really pissed that he wouldn’t acknowledge me or what I was saying. “Logan, please.”

Leaning forward, he set his can on the table and, pressing his palms together, rested his forehead against his thumbs. “Look, Sophia, I’m sorry that you’re freaked out, but-”

“What happened?”

His mouth twisted down at the corners and he squeezed his eyes shut. “Nothing happened.”

The vulnerability in his voice brought me up short. I sunk back against the couch cushions, resting my hands in my lap. I opened my mouth to say something, anything, if only to comfort him or maybe apologize, but no words came. 

“Nothing happened,” he repeated, sharper this time. “Stop asking me about it.” Rising from his seat and refusing to make eye contact, he said, “I’m going to bed.”

His footfalls receded down the hallway, culminating in a forcefully shut bedroom door. I stared at my hands, feeling rather like dirt and hoping that the slammed door hadn’t woken Kyle up. That was one more argument I didn’t need. 

A cupboard closed in the kitchen. I looked up and found pajama-clad Mariah leering at me from across the counter.

“You should drop it,” she said, stirring a mug of expensive tea, the likes of which were invariably recommended by some fashionable health blog. “He’s obviously not interested in telling you. Probably because there isn’t anything to tell.”

She had a point, though I hadn’t known the topic would upset him so deeply, and if I had, I wouldn’t have asked. But it isn’t such a bad question, is it? If he doesn’t want to tell me, that’s his business, but I can’t be in the wrong for simply asking.

By this morning he seemed to have gotten over it, at least insofar as he was willing to talk to me and wasn’t pulling any passive-aggressive bullshit like he sometimes does when he’s pissed. I didn’t bring up the call or the texts, mostly because I was sure my chance had passed, and at any rate, he wasn’t going to answer. Also, I wanted to enjoy the peace before I managed to screw it up again.

While making breakfast, I set a skillet over the heat and waited for it to warm up so I could start frying some good ol’ fashioned pork products. I needed something routine. 

Cue the strangest maybe-normal-maybe-not event thus far.

Our cooking space is deceptively limited. Poor design by the builders, mostly. When one person is using the stove, contortionist-level skill is required to utilize a good portion of the kitchen, so we‘ve piled the utensils next to the stove for quick-access. 

As such, Logan reached across to grab a spatula and accidentally brushed his wrist against the handle of the skillet. With a hiss he recoiled, wringing his hand and gritting his teeth, and hurried over to the sink to run cold water over a welt already discoloring the inner-skin of his wrist. The skillet - non-treated cast iron because Mariah is a hippie - had only been over the flame for thirty seconds, a minute at the most. Definitely not enough time to conduct the heat necessary to leave a burn like that. 

Experimentally, I tapped the handle. Nothing. I pressed my fingers against the metal, but it was still cold from the cupboard. Thinking he’d maybe touched the pan itself, I tapped the lip and even the center. It was hot, but not sear-your-flesh hot.

“You okay? Sorry about that.”

He waved it off. “It’s my fault. Just a minor burn.”

I said nothing further, afraid my voice would betray me, and absconded to my room as soon as my food was ready. I needed to talk to someone who wasn’t immediately involved in the situation, so I decided to call one of my friends from back home. Discussing some of the more believable events of the last few days might have helped me clear my head. My phone opened up to my conversation with Logan, which is where I‘d left it the night before. I almost clicked out, until I noticed something was missing. 

The three glitch texts were gone. 

They had been there. They had definitely been there, and now they weren’t. I didn’t delete them. I showed them to Mariah and Kyle, so I’m not the only person other than Logan who knew they existed. I don’t know what happened to them, but I have my suspicions. I should have taken a screenshot. 

Does it really matter, though?

I feel like I’m picking at a weeping scab. He isn’t dead, and he isn’t hurt, so I shouldn’t worry, right? No one else is showing much concern, so maybe, as per usual, I’m letting my anxiety get the better of me. They all seem to think so. Or am I just the only one who’s paying close enough attention?

It’s probably nothing, I know, but all of these little things keep piling up. All of these little, unexplained things. I don’t know what to do, or if there’s anything I can do, or if I should *do* anything at all.

I’m at a loss."

3fyzj8,0,2015-08-06,"23 [M], left school for a year, big CC debt, low cash, mad skillz.",[deleted],findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/3fyzj8/23_m_left_school_for_a_year_big_cc_debt_low_cash/,"I needed some ideas on what path I should take from where I am now.

As for education, I am 50% of the credits into an engineering technology degree and took some county college courses that can transfer in towards this degree. I didn't finish because of depression problems, so I was in academic suspension twice. I currently have the chance to appeal my suspension to get back into college, because I want to finish up my degree. I'm a spoiled kid with a parent who can afford tuition, so this shouldn't be included into my bills, but should be factored in to time.

I've been dealing with depression for over a year now, but I am getting help from therapy. Whatever I choose to do, it's important that I save time for therapy.

I have a good amount of credit card debt since I've been unemployed for around 2 years now. It's around $6,000 right now, and I only have around $200 in my bank. This can only pay for maybe the minimums on my accounts for this month only. (Paypal, Amazon, 2 CC's)

I had college loans back in 2010 that I paid off in full in 2011, but for some reason the company has no record of the payment of $1,750. They are asking for $50 monthly payments. I haven't paid them a cent, but I can't prove that I paid it because I can't find any records of it currently.

My old job was at my old college that I'm currently suspended from, and I don't meet the GPA requirement to continue working there. Also, I don't feel like it'll pay enough for me (it was only a few cents above minimum). It was an IT and repair type of job, and I worked there for almost 3 years before I left school, so I have a good amount of experience in those things.

Skillz:

* Basic programming with a few languages. Give me a month and I can probably learn more about any language I have basic knowledge of. A good chunk of them is for web dev.

* Basic IT and computer repair skills. I was originally studying for my CCNA, but it was difficult for me with my depression when I started studying for it. Still got access to an online course for it though.

* Mobile phone repair. I started this on the side. Friends give me phones and pay for parts and I fix em either on site or at home. I work on a pay what you want over parts system, but typically get double what I expect from people (which is still like $20 cheaper than mall prices, honestly)

* Leadership skills? Does this count? I held many executive positions in a fraternity, including president

* Probably other crap I can't think of right now

I just feel the need to get back out there, not because of my debt, but because I miss working places and doing things.

My current plan now is that if I get back into my old college, I'll go  take 1 or 2 classes at the latest times so I can work in the daytime. If not, I can probably finish up an associates at my county college in a year and a half while working in the daytime.

Sounds like I need at least $200 a month for my bills, but I'd like some money for other things as well, so I'd like to make at least $300 to $500ish if possible. I don't know what jobs I could do that pay that and could utilize my skills. I can potentially get a co-op internship (got a friend on the inside, but I need security clearance that takes like a month or something) thing that pays $30/hr and would count as 3 credits towards my degree, but it's programming and sounds a little depressing, so I don't know if I'd be happy doing that. It's also a far commute from both my home and both colleges, which would be quite a stretch.

I'm mostly asking for what types of jobs I'd be looking for. Also, if anyone has any advice on my degree, that'd be great too."
3fz635,1,2015-08-06,Taking a year off of college for a job,exload,AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/3fz635/taking_a_year_off_of_college_for_a_job/,"Hey guys, mostly a lurker here but came to post because I have a huge decision coming up in my life and I'm just looking for outside advice, really any advice, on what I should do. 

Some background:

I am currently a computer science college student who will be starting his second year at a University this fall. 

I have had an internship the past year at a software development company and have grown a good relationship with one of the senior programmers. Turns out this programmer (let's call him Bob) has been working on a project since grad school and it has finally come to a point where he will be able to make enough money to support his family with income from it. 

He and his partner (call him Joe) have determined that I am a very valuable asset to there team. Joe used the term ""programmer prodigy. "" They have offered me a full time position on their team.

Not sure if it is important but both Bob and Joe are very academically decorated (both PhDs). 

They suggested I ask for a low salary to keep more equity of the company. I asked for 50k the first year, 70k the next year, and 90-95k the following year. At the moment the company is very tight on cash but will not be very soon. This company has the potential to be a multimillion dollar business so owning a percentage of it could be very valuable in the future. 

My problem is I would need to drop out of school. My school offers a program where I can take up to a little over two years off of school for other educational purposes and continue right back up where you left off. I was thinking of taking advantage of this program as an insurance plan in case anything went haywire.

A second problem with this is that I would frequently, if not temporarily, move to a new remote location to work at an office. All living expenses, plane tickets, and car rides would be paid for while I live there. I would have to leave all of my newfound friends from my first year at college behind. I would also be leaving girlfriend behind. This is one of the hardest parts for me. 

Another thing about moving is that I am significantly younger than Bob and Joe (20-30+ years). I would not have many friends working in the remote location. I would almost feel isolated. 

I may have the potential to become quite wealthy from this. It is also a huge risk for me. I will need to decide soon. 

Even if I say no to this now, I can always come back and work for them. I would, of course, get less equity because now it would be worth significantly more. 

Thoughts? :) "

What are people's opinions of new grad schemes such as http://www.fdmgroup.com/ ?

Essentially it is 4 months 'free'/unpaid training followed by a 2 year (underpaid by ~30%) contract with one of their clients, which are many of the large banks in the us/uk/canada.

I do not have any internship experience - do you think it's worth it to be locked in for 2 years at a low salary (40k) for the sake of gaining experience? Or should I keep applying and practice interview questions/ work on side projects? I've gotten through to a couple technical interviews so far  but didn't pass.

If anyone has specifically gone through this scheme, that input would be appreciated as well, thanks."

Next summer should I intern for a third time at the same company? Or look for something else? What will look better on my resume? Getting asked repeatedly to come back and work for them or to diversify? (Next summer will be right before my senior year)


Last summer I got a internship at a fortune 500 company. they pay AMAZINGLY ($17.75 an hour. 40 hour weeks). I worked hard, I did mostly IT stuff (replacing/imaging/testing some security stuff a ton of new computers in like 3 different labs) as well as working hands on with this huge contract (I had to get a security clearance to work on it). This summer I solely worked on this contract, mostly doing troubleshooting and talking to field techs on the phone on repairing equipment. I am being paid $19.75 this summer.

That being said, I LOVE the team I work with. But I literally have no interest in the field, and the whole team is engineers and I'm heading towards the MIS/Business route (my major). I'm leaning towards working here again (They've already hinted at asking me to come back) because the pay is amazing and its a pretty well known company in the area and I'm comfortable with the team.

I recently graduated with a degree in Statistics. At the moment, I am in a data science internship using primarily R. I hope to find a job in the data science field soon after the internship, but have this gnawing question: Is it worth investing my time into learning python. I consider myself not bad at R, and am quite familiar with various machine learning packages, data manipulation tools such as data.table and dplyr, and graphical packages such as ggplot and lattice.

Would learning Python, while already being good at R, be a benefit to my career? Or, should I scrap python all together and focus on something like Spark, which, though useful does not seem as promotable in the job fields. I would really appreciate some input on this."

Sem1: F Intro CMPSC course. Had a hard time adjusting to college

Sem2: C (Same course as the first sem one.)

Sem3: B  (Second course)

Sem4: A  (Third course)



If I dont include my first sem grade my CS GPA is around a 3 which is much better than my overall. My first sem really screwed it up. Is that allowed or even legal?

I recently decided to switch to CS, and completed the first introductory course this summer. I attend a top 5 CS school, and honestly feel as though I have no way of competing with my peers who are far more advanced than I am. I did well in the intro course, and am taking my school's data structures course in the fall.

I'm mostly concerned about what I should be doing in regards to internships for next summer. I don't believe I have the credentials to apply this coming fall, so I'm wondering what I should be doing this fall to hopefully be able to apply for internships in the spring (if that's not too late...), and whether or not I'll even have enough knowledge by spring to apply.

Company was a contracting company that did construction in the DMV area. I made mistakes from the beginning when I got this job.  
  
When I went to the career fair, I only chose positions in the DMV area. I had a LDR with a guy from Richmond, and I wanted to be closer. My university isn't close to this. **Lesson 1: avoid constraining your location preference if possible.**     
  
I snagged an interview with these guys. My GPA was shitty, it was spring of my sophomore year, and I was desperate because everyone else was getting a co-op and I wasn't. I think I only joined the co-op program ""because that's what everyone does"". I got the job without asking very many questions about what I'd do. **Lesson 2, 3, 4: avoid peer pressure. Be patient. Ask questions in interviews!!**    
  
I was given a $700.00 stipend per month to find housing. I took that as a $700.00 maximum on my rent because fuck paying rent with my own money. I found a woman renting out her spare bedroom 7 miles away for 700, and 2 college kids looking to sublet a room 12 miles away for 800. I googled the woman and found awful things about her, including financial troubles with a restaurant, her shitty treatment of customers for her laser hair removal services, etc. On the phone, she mentioned that her landlord doesn't pay attention (read: her landlord won't know about me) and that she has a ""friend who comes over to use the computer in the spare room sometimes"". This ""friend"" was her 15 year old son and *he stays in the room on weekends because there are 2 single beds, something she didn't mention over the phone*. I elected to stay with her (because money and distance) and drove 160 miles away to my SO's on weekends so I wouldn't have to share a room with her underage son. **Lesson 5: Don't be cheap about housing.**   
  
The co-op was shitty. Literally. Here is a comment I made last summer describing it:  
&gt;I work at a sewage pump station. We are rebuilding the site currently, so we use these sewage bypass pumps to push the wastewater to the next station.  
However, these bypass pumps aren't perfect, and get clogged. Toilet paper, shit, clothes, plastic, etc builds up and you must unclog it.  
That is where my job comes in. I am an intern. I signed up for a project management co-op position. Not a fucking shit raker. One of my jobs is to turn off the pumps, let the pressure out, unhook the giant, heavy tubes (pictured above), and pull the clog out at least once a day.  
Yesterday, the clog in pump 1, the primary bypass, was abnormally large. I was checking the pumps before I left the site (6pm). Now, everyone is getting home around this time and using the bathrooms, so the pumps are working hard. Anyway.  
I turn off pump 1, wait for the pressure to go down, and unhook the tube. I slowly pull out the gigantic shitmass of toilet paper, feces, and god knows what else. As soon as I pull the last bit out with a satisfying ""thwop"", the backed up wastewater shoots out at me. I got covered in it.  
I threw up. I wanted to light myself on fire. The lukewarm shitwater soaked my jeans. I quickly reconnected the tube and ran to the trailer, where I soaked myself in hand sanitizer and ripped off my jeans. Thank god I took the advice of my supervisor and had a spare pair with me.  
  
This, plus having no plumbing on site 3-5 days a week, getting a call from the pumps at 2am (they are automated) because they are clogged and to perform what I said above, plus my boss being a total dick, are why it was shitty. Problem is, I never did anything about it. I never said anything to my co-op office. I never said anything to my boss or the people who hired me. I never quit. I cried every day. I became depressed.  
**Lesson 6: Respect yourself.**  
  
*tl;dr shitty co-ops are shitty. I am a completely different person because of this co-op. I went through a horrible experience, sacrificed my self respect, my dignity, and a whole summer because I felt it was necessary. Do not ignore the red flags. If you feel uneasy about a co-op, do what is best for yourself professionally and personally. There is no shame in not getting a co-op your sophomore year. There is nothing wrong with doing internships instead of co-op - do not feel obligated to do one or the other. Trust your gut.*

Should I reach out to my supervisor, or leave because ""it's been like this forever"" according to my co-worker (14+ years working with them)?  
&amp;nbsp;  
I initially started my help desk job as an intern my junior year of college. When I graduated this past June, I was offered a full-time position and could not be happier. I love the company and helping people every day. The firm has AMAZING benefits and the overall culture is definitely what brings IT and the end users together. There really isn't any sense of entitlement or even a pyramid-type social structure.  
&amp;nbsp;  
My issue isn't with the end users who call day in and day out, although I've had my fair share getting yelled because something doesn't work. Rather, my issues and concerns are with the attitude and work ethic of the other IT teams in my department.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I understand help desk is basically the middleman between the heavy lifting IT teams and the end user. I feel like I'm constantly going above and beyond for both parties, ensuring I gather as much information in order to avoid constantly sending multiple emails and making different calls throughout the day. I do this to both educate myself and to share the knowledge with the rest of the help desk so they won't need to troubleshoot their entire day for an answer like I just did.  
&amp;nbsp;  
However, despite my efforts, I'm often met with the teams replying to me saying ""no there's no issue going on"" and then they close their ticket. Do they actually expect me to tell the client who is experiencing an issue that there is no issue?! Whenever I ask questions for follow up, they're dismissive and don't take the time to inform me of their process even though it would benefit EVERYONE if they did. I talked to 5 people on the server team before one of them took the time to review all my documented troubleshooting and whitelisted the IP address we were having problems with.  
&amp;nbsp;  
My co-worker has been employed for over 14 years at the firm and he always tells me that it's been like this forever. I don't feel it's fair for the help desk to put in so much work and the other teams just dismiss us like we're overreacting.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Is it like this every where? Should I inform my supervisor and talk to him about it? If it's been like this forever, does that mean people have tried to talk about it and no changes were made? Is it worth staying here if working with these people makes me unhappy and hate the job I grew to love?  
&amp;nbsp;  
I apologize for venting, but I don't want to become jaded and begin to hate doing this work.  "

How do I proceed?

I'm a college grad, and I recently went in for an interview at the company I interned for the summer of my junior year. I didn't really enjoy the work I was doing, and the salary is the lowest (42.5k) of the current prospects I have, but I dodged a call from them today that I'm 80% sure was going to be a job offer. I'm only going on a gut feeling just based on the way the interview felt, they message they left to call them back (same thing happened when they offered me the internship), and the fact that it was for a position I was an intern for doing the same work for the same company. 

I'm more interested in some of the other prospects I have though. I'm on to the 2nd round of interviews with another company in a better city with a higher salary, and I have a lead I want to see through at another company. I don't know the salary for this one, but based on Glassdoor it would be higher that the first company (at least) and in the best location of all my prospects. 

Though there are a lot of things going against the first company, it wouldn't be terrible working for them. But if I got another offer from either of my other two current prospects, I'd certainly take them over this one. So is there a way to have it all and put off making an official decision about the offer until I finish the application process with my other prospects? Or, should I just say no and hope something better turns up?

So, as the title says, I'm a recent grad with a BS in Computer Science. I unfortunately don't have any internship experience from college. I've been graduated for about a month and a half now, and during that time I've been doing a mix of the following:

1. **Learning new skills** -- I've been doing some online tutorials for things that I'm interested in. For instance, I have a new found interest in web development, so I've been trying to teach myself things like web frameworks (RoR, Django, etc.) and databases. 

2. **Working on side projects** -- I haven't done a ton of this, mostly just small/simple projects in HTML canvas / JavaScript. I have some ideas for larger scale website projects, but I'm not sure if investing in them would be well worth the time and effort.

3. **Applying for jobs and studying interview questions** -- I've done more of the former and only recently began doing the latter as I had two interviews where the technical aspect I found was harder for me. (On a side note, I've begun reading *Cracking the Coding Interview*; are there any other good resources anyone knows of for practicing interview questions? Also, if I'm interested in web development, are data structure and algorithm questions as relevant?)

So, should I be doing an even mix of these things, or should I focus more on one or two of them? I don't really have a firm grasp of what new grad and entry level software engineering jobs are like from the start -- do I just have to prove I'm good with programming, algorithms and data structures to get a job, then spend time learning once I get there? Or am I expected to know a decent amount about what software/frameworks etc. they're using once I start? 

Any helpful feedback is greatly appreciated!"

I've been stuck in minimum wage job for about a year now, and I don't think my situation will get any better by just apply-and-wait approach.

* Washington State FE License 

* Minimum wage job 

* Know how to code with MATLAB, JAVA, C++, Python (No GUI interface programming experience though) 

* 1 year experience as a line cook

I've been thinking that maybe pursue career in programming? Since I do know how to utilize algorithm and been trained for OOP, why not? And it seems that while ChemE career is going stagnant or even going shit, (Thanks Saudi!) programmers are wanted everywhere.

Should I then think about applying to local CC and then try to get in 4 year program afterwards? or should I be self-taught by using resources like Code Academy and Udacity?
Or should I try to pursue my ChemE again by going to grad school or even looking for unpaid interns in other countries?"

Got paid well. Worked from home a good amount. Got to learn a lot of open source tools. My team and manager love me.

Problem is, sometimes I have nothing to do and it occasionally drives me insane. I just got an email where my team expressed interest in having me another internship next summer and maybe a job after graduation. 
 
1. Should I do the ""if it aint broken dont fix it"" mentality and just accept another internship?
2. If not, how do I tell them I want time to look at other companies without shattering my chances with them in the future?

3g6vjb,83,2015-08-07,Razer Quality Control IS AN ISSUE: How I had to RMA my $2700 Blade 4.5 TIMES over my freshman year in college with TERRIBLE Customer Support (And why the Microsoft Store is the BEST EVER!),tusing,pcmasterrace,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/3g6vjb/razer_quality_control_is_an_issue_how_i_had_to/,"Ah, Razer. It seems to be the hot topic of debate, these days. ""You must be the only one with a broken mouse,"" some people say. ""You must be the only one with a bad keyboard,"" others say. Regardless, I'm here to share my experience with the Razer Blade ($2700 on paper and $2860 with tax).

#### It all started in ~June 2014. I was super-excited to get my new laptop - I had been saving up for it for most of highschool. 
The Razer Store didn't have it - it was in super-high demand, it seemed, sold out wherever you looked - except the Microsoft Store, because who looks at the Microsoft Store? Anyways, I ordered it from there - got it quickly (2 days, free), with fast shipping and great packaging. This turns out to be an incredibly important detail towards the end.

The honeymoon period begins - installing everything I can on this laptop. Pushing it to its limit - it didn't outperform my desktop, which was only about a year and a half old at the time, but it was pretty damn good for a laptop. A true Master Race laptop, I thought, and my hard-earned money was *totally* worth it.

---

About two months later, I start college - mainly, computer science classes. I notice that the laptop is having a tiny flicker, especially when looking at grays or browns. I ignore it - probably a trick of the eye, or something. As my classes progress, though, I start to notice more problems. The flicker *is real* - I can't use my new favorite theme in Sublime anymore. The backlight on the back of my Blade seems to have dimmed to almost nothing; the Shift key has started to come loose. Problems I can deal with, but a niggling annoyance, anyways. More problems start to happen, though. The rubber feet at the bottom start to peel off, the heat created by the laptop melting the glue. One out of three USB ports on the laptop basically stop functioning, intermittently connecting and disconnecting at will. I can't plug in my full suite of wireless headphones, mouse, and USB drive any more.

**My first RMA happens** - I send it over Thanksgiving, giving my about a month until my second midterm and major project. Customer Support promised that it would take no longer than two weeks. I'm excited, of course - my laptop was probably a one-off dud! Two weeks pass. I ask Support what's up - apparently a part is missing. Wait another week, and ask Customer Support to find an alternative. The part still hasn't arrived, and Customer Support sets me up with (supposedly) a brand new Blade. It takes another week to arrive. 

But over those weeks? I did not have my laptop with me. I had to do an *entire computer science project* on a Microsoft Surface Pro (first gen) with the tiny keyboard. I had no other computer through which I could study for my midterms. Midterms passed with me not having a laptop on hand, and it was quite difficult to use the tiny screen of the Surface to study. *I shouldn't have to expect this from a $2700 laptop*, I thought, but I brushed it off - it really was probably only a small and rare issue. Still, it was annoying.

---

Over the next few weeks and winter break, I started noticing issues with the rubber pad again. The USB ports were acting up towards the end of winter break, just as they were before. 

**I RMA once more**, and receive the laptop back after about two weeks, around when the new semester starts. The speed of the RMA process doesn't really impress me, but I can deal with it. Armed with yet another brand new laptop, I can begin the school year.

The laptop has more issues, however, in the mere ~5 months I have it. The fans start to have this annoying click-click noise, which I ignore because I couldn't be bothered to send it in again, and my musical tastes were renewed so I wore headphones anyways. USB issues were minor, but popping up here and there. Rubber feet start coming off again. *What the fuck is wrong with Razer Glue,* I think. I also had ~4 BSODs in that period of time and my laptop wiped once. *I'm kind of used to loosing all my data,* and my Blade has taught me to keep everything in Google Drive after those RMA's and BSODs. I send it in again, with a good month of shipping time.

**Razer doesn't pay for laptop shipping boxes.** I learnt my lesson the last time, and I keep the new one with me.

---

Once I get it back, I'm kinda happy again. After all, that's probably it, right? I use it for the rest of the year, and the rubber feet/pads start coming off again. Dammit. I'm not sending it in for repair just yet! Once I get home for summer and start my internship, I notice this clicking noise that is coming from the fans again. It is starting to become an issue, as I work in quiet spaces now and that intermittent clicking is driving me crazy. When I'm home, I leave the laptop in my bag and I don't even feel like taking it out. My home rig is here anyways, and I just use that, even if it doesn't have a QHD screen. Still, my trusty Blade decides to BSOD once, and I RMA it again. This time I'm quite frustrated - I ask for a different model, because their Quality Control on this one *sucks*. They refuse. Get my laptop back in just over two weeks, though.

---

Out of the box, the new laptop has a clicky fan. They *promised* me the issue would never happen again. *They told me they would run it through tests before sending it to me*. I send it back, annoyed, frustrated. I demand a refund, they refuse once more. Losing all of my data 4 times due to RMAs and other issues is enough for me - I give up on this laptop, realizing I'm afraid to use it for anything important. That's something that *no one with a $2700 laptop should ever feel.*

---

Once I receive my fourth, brand new laptop, it seems to work fine out of the box. The Blade has taught me to use programs like Ninite and Chocolatey to quickly create a working environment. I still don't use it, though. Not unless I have to. The fans are still clicking and I don't have it in me to return it. Eventually, though, I get curious on how some games play - and I quickly realize it has a faulty PSU or GPU and I can't play any game on load without the laptop shutting off without warning.

---

That last time, I vent on Reddit. Some kind soul suggests that I talk to the Microsoft Store again. I realize I've never thought of that before - and since I have my desktop rig with me, I can go without a laptop for some time. Curious, I call, and I ask for a refund. The Support lady politely declines, but I use my pro customer support skills, hardened by talking to Razer Customer Support, and ask for her manager. She sounds kind of (amused? happy?) and transfers me.

**Holy crap.** 5 minutes into the call with the manager and I feel like a king. The refund is arranged without question. I'm assured a speedy delivery and refund. This past week has been great - I've received emails every night detailing the progress of my refund.

#### **A *full* refund!** How awesome is that?

I'm elated, and my (full, including tax) refund has been processed by Microsoft. Their store has the best customer support *ever*. My new laptop is arriving in less than a week.

---


*Other Thoughts:*

* Tried out the Razer Blackwidow Chroma Stealth when it came out - hated it and returned it. Got a K70 RGB later on, and I'm loving it.

* I have two or three empty Razer boxes lying around in my garage, probably the best-built thing I've seen from Razer, as those boxes are awesome

* The laptop I was able to get with the refund absolutely blows the Blade out of the water

* My Logitech G700s mouse has taken more of a beating than I think my laptop or any Razer mouse ever could dream of handling

* My Logitech G930 headset has done the same, and has been going strong for a few years now

* Razer's only semi-decently made piece of software is Cortex; everything else sucks

* I am led to believe Razer product reviews are only positive because reviewers are a) given products with better Quality Control and b) only own the products for a few days. Linus from LTT is super lucky to be able to use his as a daily driver.

## TL;DR
* Had to RMA the Blade 4 times (should never be expected from a $2700 laptop)
* Was without a laptop during critical periods of time because of Razer's time estimates
* Almost RMAd a 5th time when Reddit suggested contacting the Microsoft Store, where I originally bought it
* **FULL REFUND** and absolutely *wonderful* Customer Support from the Microsoft Store


*Edit: Since some have asked, my new laptop is Gigabyte's Aorus X5.* It has an i7-5700 HQ, 32 GB RAM, 2x GTX 965M in SLI, 3x 256 GB m.2 SSDs in RAID 0, and a 1 TB secondary SSD. It also has a 3k GSYNC display. *All for a lower price than the Blade I just returned.*"

So I've landed a big interview on Wednesday and I'm probably going to have to name a salary. I'll explain my situation in depth as it seems a bit unique.

So I have been attending a vocational school over the past year. Network technology to be specific. I have obtained the A+, net+, sec+, and project+ comptia certs. I am currently working twords my CCENT.

I recently put in for a position and got a interview. The interview went well, and they contacted me. I didn't get the position I was interviewing for, but they want me to interview for another position. This comes under a few stipulations as described by my HR contact:

* I will work as a paid intern locally until school ends
* After school is done and if they think that I'm a good fit I will jump into their ""project integration team"", the job title is integration engineer.
* I will need to relocate (don't know if its paid relocation) to a city 5 hours away to work in their home office. 

Now the thing is I don't know what I should base my salary expectation on. I have 0 relevant expiriance and not even yet qualified for the position. So i guess my questions are:

1. what are some reputable sites i can use to see up to date average salaries? should i look for job title or use my certs? Are the salaries on the site including benefits/vacation?
2. how much should expiriance effect my starting salary?
3. the company offers profit sharing and productivity bonuses, should these be weighted against my salary? (if i ask for say 50k and they offer 40k but then say the bonuses will make up the difference, should I accept that?)
4. Is the relocation a leverage point for me? Its a risk I'm willing to take as I want the job and the area is nice. Should I use the cost of living as a negotiation point?"

Its worth noting that I have one app that does not generate revenue and I have considered making it open source on my github profile(which is empty at the moment). I have a website which shows off each app that I have developed in a nice looking manner as well.

Can anyone advise on how I can improve my chances of landing one of these internships? What should I be putting my time into? Should I wait until I'm older?

Any help is appreciated, thanks. "

3g947e,0,2015-08-08,[Build Help] Upgrading Almost everything,interstellarshadow,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/3g947e/build_help_upgrading_almost_everything/,"Hi!
I have a computer that I built a few years ago on a ~$600 budget. Now I am looking to upgrade it. At the beginning of the summer, I fell in love with the R9 290X, and got it. However, I have been having some troubles with my PSU and my processor is showing its age.

So I was going to go here and ask you guys for help. I am a pretty avid gamer, who plays games like Space Engineers, Fallout, EUIV, and NBA2k (weird selection, I know). I'm shooting for 50-60 fps at ~1080p on my main monitor, even while perhaps having a youtube video or twitch stream at 1080p on the other monitor.

However, I'm not looking to spend a huge amount of money. I think my budget for the rest of this upgrade should be under $500 (despite a summer internship, I'm still a poor college student). For reference, I am in Northeast USA.

Computer I have now:

- CPU: AMD Phenom II x4 960 Black edition
- MoBo: Asus M5A97 (Rev 1) (AM3+ compatible)
- RAM: Mushkin Enhanced 8 GB (2x4GB DDR3-1333)
- GPU: XFX R9-290X 4GB Double Dissipation Edition &amp; GTX610 (holdover for VGA connectivity)
- DVD Drive: Some cheap-ass one.
- 3 laptop harddrives.
- Case: APEVIA
- Power Supply: Failing old 550W power supply of forgotten origin.

So I have no desire to try to rehash the DVD drive or the HDDs, but I feel that a processor update, a new case, and a new PSU. I'd consider switching over to Intel for processing if that makes more sense--if upgrading the MoBo is recommended, then I'd actually prefer Intel.

I guess I'll make a draft build for y'all to critique:

- CPU: [AMD FX 8350 8-core at 4.0GHz](http://www.newegg.com/Product/ComboBundleDetails.aspx?ItemList=Combo.1594318)
- Mobo: [Asus M5A97 Rev 2](http://www.newegg.com/Product/ComboBundleDetails.aspx?ItemList=Combo.1594318)
- RAM: [G-Skill 16GB DDR3-1600 (2x8GB)](http://www.newegg.com/Product/ComboBundleDetails.aspx?ItemList=Combo.1594318)
- Case: [Rosewill Carbide](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811139038)
- PSU: [Corsair CX-750M](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139051)

Total Price: $448.96 (using a combo including the Mobo, CPU, and 1 stick of ram).

Will this accomplish what I desire? Are there better deals or components for only a little more? Any critiques, etc. are welcome!

Thanks

I am a final year student who will graduate in next semester.

The problem is that I still have a couple of months left before graduation. And I hope I can land in some bigger/well known company. However, I am not confident in myself, as I have never did any internship with BIG company nor a tier 1 programmer. So I might not be able to get into any BIG company.

Did anyone have experienced anything similar? What will you do?

3gbe6h,0,2015-08-09,"going into the final semester of a masters program, not sure what I want to do, applying for big 4",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3gbe6h/going_into_the_final_semester_of_a_masters/,"I'm graduating from a pretty decent school in December with a MS in Comp Science, my undergrad is in something different. I've been moving pretty quickly, from 0 programming experience to prereqs to MS in 28 months. Also, no internships as I went through everything so quickly and had a pretty good paying job most of the time. 

It's been rough, but I enjoy the work and try to do all the right things like read Code Complete, CTCI and practice Leetcode when not doing classwork. I actually quit my non-CS job a couple weeks ago to concentrate on my summer course and those things. 

I finished all the assignments for that course and have pretty much have a month before the schools' tech career fair as well as before I start applying for full-time positions. 

The problem is that I'm not sure what direction I want to go in. I've made a few Android apps and would be interested in also taking up iOS and doing mobile development. I've also been doing some penetration testing and security stuff lately and liked it. I'm also taking a Computer Vision and Computer Graphics course next semester because I think Oculus is the coolest thing ever. I've actually spoken to a Facebook recruiter and they said they're looking to hire for that team, but would want someone with a little more experience in that those fields. I don't even mind business logic application stuff and it'd be pretty cool to work for a game company although I've heard they're treated terribly. 

I made a Facebook clone last year for a project with the LAMP stack and while it was alright, I didn't really fall in love with the web stuff as much as the other stuff I've done. 

So I figure I would apply to the big 4 because you can go in as a generalist. I was going to concentrate on the data structure/algorithm stuff for the most part this month. However, I wasn't sure if I should go C++ or Java, I know them both equally well at this point. I figure if I do C++ it'll give me a leg up for my Computer Vision and Computer Graphics course next semester. I was considering making an Android app over the next month which would look good in a portfolio if I don't get a Big 4 job so the fact I'd be actively coding in Java would really ingrain the syntax for potential white boarding situations. 

Does my plan sound reasonable? I was also going to apply to other companies of course, but I'd say Facebook and then Google would be my top choices. But if I don't get those I'd be open to pretty much anything. I also live in NYC so there's plenty of stuff here but I'd be open to moving if there's an incredible opportunity.

3gbg1k,1,2015-08-09,I feel like I'm not good at anything...,LaLechuga94,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3gbg1k/i_feel_like_im_not_good_at_anything/,"Hey, r/advice,

I'm not sure if this is the place for this, and be prepared for a semi-wall of text because this has been killing me for awhile and I've gotta get it off my chest.

I feel like I'm not truly skilled/good at anything... As a preface, I'm going to be a junior in college come the 24th of this month and I'm studying Economics. I love economics and the ideas that it encapsulates, but I feel like there isn't one particular thing about it that I'm crazy about or really good at. I pass my classes and do well in school, but nobody wants a well-rounded Joe Shmoe with a college degree anymore. You've gotta be good at something these days and despite my interest for the field, I feel like I don't have any uniqueness about me. 

Now, aside from what I go to school for, there are certainly things I enjoy doing outside of school. I build computers, mod videogames, tinker around with software here and there and am just generally tech-savvy. I've toyed with the idea of starting my own company upon graduating that helps people build and maintain computers, but it's not original. 

I've done a couple internships near where I go to school in the field of Econ/Politics and I loved them but I just feel like if I don't get really good at something in the next couple years then I'm going to be just another college graduate looking for work with no *real* unique skills or abilities.

My worst fear is financial stability. I don't want a huge mansion or super nice cars. I just want to be able to pay my bills and enjoy my life. Obviously it isn't as simple as that most times, but if there's one thing I'd give my all to be able to control, it would be my financial safety. I know many people in my hometown whether it be from mutual friends, school, church, family friends and acquaintances, etc and so I feel like if all else fails, I could network and find *something*, but I don't want to rely on that.

I'd love to graduate college and have something to offer companies. Some sort of service that I can do for people that other run-of-the-mill graduates can't and right now, I don't feel like I can do that.

Any tips, advice or words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated. Especially if anything I've mentioned about myself is something up your alley in terms of what you do for a living.

Thanks in advance, everyone. "

So, I've always wanted to go to Berkeley since freshman year of high school. I was (and still am) an excellent student in terms of academics and extracurricular activities, but unfortunately was rejected by the school upon my first application at the end of senior year. I spent my freshman year of college at a state school on a full ride, and I have continued to perform well academically as well as pursuing my interests outside the classroom. I just finished up an internship this past summer, and I am looking to try my luck again and transfer to Berkeley in the Fall of 2016. As of now, I am a political science major, but I have a very strong inclination of going into business. 

I was wondering if I would be able to transfer to Berkeley, specifically into Haas, and double major in political science and business administration. I know Berkeley is a fairly competitive school to get accepted in to (all too well...) but I think I'll have an even better application this time around! I want to keep my doors open to both private and public sector opportunities, and right now I really can see myself going down either a path of law school or entering the business world.

Too busy(lazy)  to go to the dentist that day I phoned up my shamanic consultant (my grandma)  and cried about my tooth ache (im 21). She tells me to buy garlic and onions.  Put the garlic in my ear and chew on onions. 

I tried that and there was no pain relief at all. 
So I go lookup a dentist for tomorrow (a sunday). 
Found some dental care Institute next to medical University. 

I couldn't sleep all night and wake up at 11.20 am. The dentist there closes at noon. 

Extremely tired, I quickly put on clothes without showering. 

I get there in time

An hour later I get x-rayed. Then a  nurse guides me to my dentist chair. 
I sit down and then the dentist approaches. 
She's a 30-35 year old milf. 
As she turns to my X-ray pictures,  I quickly do my hair,  reposition myself to look as sharp as I can in a reclined dentist chair. 
Then to the left and even hotter intern approaches. 

We make eye contact and she ask me what's in my ear. 
I touched my ear only to find that piece of garlic I left in my ear from freaking yesterday. The intern looked disgusted,  the milf doctor starts laughing really loud. mockingly loud.

As they take a look at my tooth.  She pulls out a small onion ring. That's been stuck between the swollen up gum and my teeth.  At this point they didn't  say a word and she put the onion ring next to the garlic.  I just wished she would have laughed like before.

TL;DR  put smelly vegetables in my body cavities, went to hot dentist who managed to recover both of them. But couldn't recover my tooth. "

Now I am going to a university that I will be living at for the year, but I know I don't want to go there next year. Next year I want to apply to the physics program at UCLA, as well as a few other schools with similar acceptance rates. My question is this, if I do very well this upcoming year and can pull a GPA of 3.8 or higher, will I have a good chance of getting in, or will the lower 3.2 GPA from community college hold me back from being considered. I know a lot more goes into this stuff than just GPA, I have no internships, and didn't take the SAT. So I'm just wondering if anyone has known someone in a similar situation, and whether or not one very strong year would be enough to get into a really good school. Also, would contacting admissions at the schools I'm looking at and asking them these questions be appropriate or no? Thanks in advance!

TLDR, 3.2 GPA in Computer Science for 2 years at a community college, now going to university as physics major, would 3.8 GPA for one year be enough to get schools with similar acceptance rates to UCLA to accept me or are my hopes too high?

Edit: By the end of the year I will be a junior in my physics degree, but I *really* do not want to continue going to the school I'm headed for this year, I want to try going farther away from where I live."

Kyle had left to go on a weekend camping trip with his family, which left Mariah and me as the sole inhabitants of the apartment. We don’t live in a dangerous neighborhood, but I figured it would be an opportune time to drag my baseball bat out of the closet for easier access. Mariah always goes to bed before ten so I had to lock up the house, as per usual. I triple-checked every door and window, and, once satisfied, turned in for the night.

I awoke at 2:42 in the morning. 

Through a light haze of sleep, I heard the front door creak open as someone eased it across the hardwood floor. My eyes flew open and I sat up in bed, straining to determine whether or not a key had been used. I couldn’t remember the sound of the key in the lock. If I cocked my head to the side, I thought I could hear faint, scuffling footsteps. 

Edging out of bed, I leaned down and wrapped my hand around the baseball bat, momentarily comforted by the smooth wooden grip. Even though it was probably just Logan coming home at an ungodly hour, I wasn’t taking any chances. 

I tiptoed out into the hallway, heart hammering hard enough to vibrate my shirt. More scuffling. Definitely someone in the kitchen. 

This someone turned on the faucet, and my shoulders fell by a fraction. No robber would use the sink, right? Water splashed into the sink in irregular intervals. It was Logan, probably washing his hands. I don’t know why he wasn’t using the bathroom. 

Wanting to make sure that it really was him, I crept to the threshold and knocked on the doorway. I was so high on adrenaline that my lips barely cooperated. “Logan? I thought you said you were going to stay at Isha’s place.” 

Back turned toward me, he paused with his hand at his mouth, water running down his arm. I almost took a step closer, until I noticed the water was the thin, sickly orange of heavily diluted blood. My breath hitched. 

“Are you hurt?” I asked, thinking he’d been in a fight. It would explain why he was home so late. 

With infinite precision, he turned on his heels to face me, nose bruised and still swollen from an earlier encounter. A few splotches of red clung to the front of his shirt, though I couldn’t see any wounds underneath the partially dried cloth. He seemed paler than normal. 

He took a step forward, hand falling to his side, and I instinctively tightened my grip on the bat. Glancing at my weapon of choice, a soft smirk broke the icy planes of his face. He laughed. “Sophia, what are you doing?”

I resisted the sudden urge to hide it behind my back like a misbehaving child. “Just in case.” More defensively, I added, “Why are you home so late, anyways? You almost gave me a heart attack.”

“Seems I’ve been doing that a lot lately.” He looked back at the sink and shrugged. “Some guy got shitfaced and threw a couple swings. The first one caught me off-guard.” Nodding toward me, he said, “Sorry I woke you up. I was trying to be stealthy, but I guess that failed.”

“No worries,” I said, letting myself relax by a fraction. The intensity of his expression was making me uncomfortable. I offered him a nod of my own. “Goodnight, then.”

Holding up his hand, he turned back to the running water. “Goodnight.”

Only when I was halfway asleep did I realize the blood on his shirt couldn’t have come from a nosebleed. It had come at an angle. 

Like a splash pattern. 

On Saturday morning, Logan wasn’t home and the kitchen was spotless. I decided to go for a short walk, and when I didn’t see Logan’s car on the curb or in the parking lot, I figured he must have gone to the grocery store or CVS to get some bandages. My mind wandered to the guy that had punched him and how the fight had started. 

When I got back, Logan’s car was parked on the street, and I found him eating breakfast in the living room. I almost asked why he’d left, until I saw his face, skin perfectly unmarred. No bruising, no swelling. His clothes, the same he’d worn last night, were clean, too. 

“What happened to your nose?” I asked, unable to conceal my utter confusion. 

His brow furrowed. “Huh? Is something wrong with it?”

“You said some idiot punched you in the nose, which is why I found you cleaning yourself up in the kitchen last night.”

He dropped his spoon in the empty bowl and stood. “I have no idea what you’re talking about. I was at Isha’s house for the whole night. Decided not to drink and drive.” He set his dishes next to the sink. “Y’know. Like a responsible adult.”

“But we talked,” I said. His words didn’t compute. He had to have come home last night. Either he was lying… or it hadn’t been him. “You said someone got drunk and punched you in the nose.”

Pursing his lips, Logan shook his head. “Noooo.” Frowning, he placed the back of his hand against my forehead. “You feel a little warm. Might have caught what I had. You must have been delirious-”

I swatted his hand away. “Forget I said anything.”

I called Isha, but he offered no conclusive information. Apparently, he blacked out around one in the morning, and awoke to a house brimming with hangovers, one of which belonged to Logan. The timeframe was wide enough that Logan could have just driven back to Isha’s house and pretended to have been there all night. I asked if anyone else had seen Logan leave the night before, but he started getting annoyed with all of my questions and told me that, even if he asked, the house is so big and everyone was so drunk that no one could say for sure. Then he hung up, and I left the conversation with as much knowledge as I'd arrived with. 

Logan could have been there the whole night and told the truth. He could have left, returned, and lied.

I’m *not* crazy. 

Ok, maybe a little. But I’m definitely not crazy enough to hallucinate an entire conversation.

Plus, when I went back to my room, the bat was leaning against my wardrobe, which is where I‘d left it after talking with Logan the night before. So I couldn’t have made it all up, otherwise it would have still been laying across my desk. 

In desperate need of solid answers, I figured that the company who offered the internship would likely be my only source of reliable information. Unless they were covering something up, but that’s a different matter entirely. 

This morning, I looked up their website, which seemed legitimate, and waited until Logan left the apartment before I punched the number into my phone. I hesitated before pressing send. Perhaps I wouldn’t like the answers they offered. But I needed an answer, likable or not.

A sharp, feminine voice answered after the second ring. I explained my situation, trying to sound as formal as possible, all the while feeling her bored irritation oozing through the receiver, and asked if she could offer any information about Logan’s time at the company.

At the other end of the phone, a pencil tapped out a simple rhythm. “Employee records are private, ma’am.”

“I don’t want a record. I just want to know what he was doing on the 31st of July, and if anyone noticed anything different about his behavior.”

The tapping rhythm came to a halt. “What is this about, ma’am?”

I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to feign desperation, but I found that playing pretend wasn‘t necessary. With my volume lowered to nearly a whisper, I said, “I’m concerned for his mental health. Ever since he came home he’s been acting strange, but it all started on the 31st of July. Please, just help me understand what’s gong on with my friend.”

A long pause, then a sigh. “Personal records may be private, but activity logs and status reports are not. Give me a moment.” The faint sound of fingers flying across a keyboard. “Friday, July 31st. Let’s see. At 3:30 in the afternoon, his supervisor reported that Logan and one other coworker were suffering from flu-like symptoms. They clocked-out one hour early, but showed up on time on Monday with no health complaints. No further incidents were reported.”

I bit my fingernail. So Logan hadn‘t lied about being sick. “Okay. Thank you so much.” Before the woman hung up, I thought of the strange timeframes for the glitch texts. “Wait! Do the numbers 1, 2, and 4 have any significance in the company? Like standard operating procedure?”

“That’s rather broad, ma’am.” She sighed again. “They could be times of day, or it could be a measure of time or distance. Surveying teams are grouped by number, as in team 1, team 5, team 12, et cetera. We also label surveying sites by number. There are currently 20 active sites. Numbers 1, 2, and 4 were among the first. They are no longer active.”

“Okay,” I said, crestfallen by the plethora of possibilities. “That’s all I needed to know. Thanks again.”

She wished me luck and ended the call.

Instead of putting my phone in my pocket, I left it on my desk and decided to go watch some television, just to get my mind off of the situation for a while. Upon reaching the living room, I saw Logan’s keys hanging from the rack. The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end. At some point during the call, he’d come home and I hadn’t noticed.

I hurried back to my room, where I found him scrolling through my phone.

“What are you doing?”

He looked up from my phone, and maybe it was the angle of the light, but his eyes seemed a few shades lighter than normal. Almost silver. “You called my employer?”

His severity caught me off-guard and I couldn’t think of a good cover story. I backed into the hallway as he walked toward me, posture simultaneously non-threatening and utterly terrifying.

“Why would you do that?” he asked, tone flat, as if he’d suddenly lost interest in the conversation. He paused, then placed the phone in my hand and left the room. So low that it could have been an afterthought, he added, “That was a mistake.” I don’t know if he was talking to himself or talking to me.

A feeling of deep unease, which had been building up over the past two weeks, finally came to a head. With all of the unnatural things that have happened since the phone call, and his increasingly erratic behavior, I refused to spend any more time under the same roof as Logan. I dragged my suitcase out from under my bed and packed three day’s worth of essentials. Underwear, two changes of clothes, pajamas, toothbrush, money, license, chargers, laptop, phone. 

On my way out, Mariah gave me a confused glare. “So you two get into a fight, and then you just leave?”

“Actually,” I said, conjuring the most convincing smile I could, “my mom wants me to come down for a few days to celebrate my aunt’s birthday.” 

I don’t know if she bought it. I didn’t want to leave her to face whatever danger Logan posed, but I wasn’t going to make myself look any crazier trying to convince someone who would never believe me. Plus, I don’t think Logan is interested in violence, at least towards people he regularly interacts with. It would be too suspicious. 

For the time being, I’m holed up in a shitty hotel, far enough away that no one can find me, wondering how I’m going to get all of my stuff out of the apartment without having to deal with Logan. I told them I went to visit my parents, and I don’t care if they believed me. I paid in cash, so the owner doesn’t know my name. 

No one who cares knows where I am."

I have a Bachelors degree in CS from a small private school and have done pretty well for myself in general. I was able to land a software development job at a large corporation after graduation. I worked there for a year but decided to change companies due to a lack of challenge and relevant technologies. While I was there, I built a small tracking program for an internal website and was able to collect and analyze a lot of usage data which I thought was very fascinating. I moved to a small consulting company that specializes in BI and analytics so I could do more of this type of work. This is the company at which I am currently employed.

I have done some Data Warehousing projects which I truly enjoyed but have lately been placed onto more web programming based projects. While I struggled with this at first due to it not being quite the direction I wish to take my career, I was able to see these experiences as a positive for my professional career where I could focus on other skills as well. After all, I did all web development at my previous job.

I believe I am a decent programmer. I have never really had a lot of complaints about my work in general and I am able to meet deadlines a large majority of the time. I work hard and my bosses and colleagues notice it. My friends and family think very highly of me and a recent promotion also adds to their opinions.

The thing is though I feel like my code is never good enough and that I can always make it better. When I am asked questions at my current client, such as, What is the purpose of this line? Why did you do this? I freeze up and have a hard time explaining my original train of thought. I feel like I have all the answers when I am at my desk and have everything in front of me, but when asked simple questions, I just don't understand. I am not a dumb person but I feel dumb when I am not able to provide a decent explanation on the spot when asked. 

I have never really had any code reviews because I have always been on projects with tight deadlines and there hasn't been a whole lot of time for code review or refactoring. What I would really like is a solid code review but my current project is under NDA and I cannot share it with anyone outside the company. As a consultant, I am supposed to be the expert and it sucks to feel like I am not. To add to the situation, there is currently an intern from MIT at my client who built their current framework they are using for my project. He is highly regarded and is generally very nice, but I find he can be a little arrogant at times. I have asked him for his opinion a few times and when I explained my train of thought, his response answer always seems better and easier. This leads me to believe I sometimes lose sight of the big picture and also adds to my feelings of inadequacy. 

My questions are the following 
* What are some steps that I can take to help feel less adequate?
* I am not socially awkward but I feel awkward when trying to explain my code. I feel like it is very personal since it reflects how I think. What are some ways I can help improve the communication of my thought processes?
* Are there any tips for keeping sight of the big picture and not getting lost in the details?

I apologize if some of this is unclear. I am more than happy to expand or clarify on any points. Thank you for taking time to read and help me out. I greatly appreciate it."

3gfcd3,1,2015-08-10,Facebook Won't Interview me Because I Dropped out of Highschool? (Details Inside...),[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3gfcd3/facebook_wont_interview_me_because_i_dropped_out/,"/r/cscareerquestions,

I've been applying for Facebook jobs for several years now, and can't even seem to land an interview. I was hoping you guys could give me some suggestions on what I need to do next to improve my odds. 

Basically, here's my history:

I grew up in a small town, and got interested in computers so I taught myself to code. As a result of bad family life w/ violent mentally handicap mother &amp; father who worked/lived in a different city I dropped out of high-school freshman year to live on my own and work a min-wage job.

Started a social networking site for a certain sport, grew it to a few thousand members and 100k+ posts. Very niche. After that, I started building more websites and web businesses. Soon I was building fan-sites for video-games, growing the traffic through SEO and targeted marketing and selling them on Flippa. I decided I wanted to either work at Facebook, Moz, LinkedIn or Twitter. All of of whom had products I had a ton of domain-knowledge surrounding and enjoyed. Both of them pretty much require a degree so I enrolled at the University of Washington.  
  
After getting into UW CS, I've been doing everything I can to maximize my odds at getting a PM job at one of the companies above. I got a internship at a fortune 500, and a VC funded startup - both with referrals and great reviews. I didn't get a FB internship though even though I applied every year. Not even an interview. Taught myself mobile app dev, built several android games to help my resume. Didn't help. Wrote an eBook on full-stack development, sold over 1000 copies and netted 4.5 stars on Amazon. Didn't help.

I started really teaching myself as much as I could about business and economics. I enrolled in an econ minor, finished it with a 3.5 and started meeting up with local start-up CEO's for coffee to ask them about things like how they learned about business and entrepreneurship since I know these are really important to the bigger companies. I started spending 40+ hours per week outside of school reading books on entrepreneurship, business and economics. Launched a contracting company with a friend to build websites for local businesses, netted ~$50,000 in revenue over about two years.  
  
In the last year, I started another social networking project and I've since grown it to over 500k unique's/mo peak and ~11k customers over all affiliated web properties. I've taught myself a ton about branding, video/photo editing, lean management, agile, and even marketing (the project has gone viral several times). It's paying my rent, food and some of school right now (I have to pay 100% of schooling out of pocket UW hasn't given me any fin aid. All cash or loans.)
  
It's at a point where I'm literally working myself 80-100 hours per week regularly for the past year. I've absorbed tons of data, applied it, and applied it over again. It's hard as heck to afford school to begin with without any fin-aid, and I've worked a number of jobs over the past four years just to survive. Add in trying to become an optimal candidate and it's even harder.

I've compared my skill set to bloggers who got jobs at these big web companies, and I feel as if I have gone above and beyond getting the knowledge and skill required for one of these jobs. The reason I'm so passionate about getting a PM position at one of them, is because I've really put myself out there and by trial-and-error learned a ton about how to really build a product that customers want. I think it's a niche that most engineers don't excel at, and I'd feel great if I could contribute to the growth of a product that customers and the engineers can both agree upon.

To summarize, I've been up all night looking at every little detail and trying to figure out why I can't get into any of the big social web companies. The only thing I can think of is the fact that I don't have a high-school degree. I'm graduating from CS in 6 months, and have no idea what I can do at this point to increase my odds. 

I'd love some input on what I can do to improve my chances if any of you can help.

**tl;dr** I've done everything you guys said to do, everything they said to do, and everything everyone who was successful in landing a position has done. It doesn't seem to be helping :/

Having second thoughts.,course-or-selfstudy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3gg9gj/planned_on_taking_a_one_year_course_at_a/,"Hi all, thanks for reading.

I have a MPhys in Physics (from a UK university), graduated a few years ago with a not very good mark. Since then I've kind of wandered around a bit, but now I'm pretty sure I want to get a career as a programmer. I started a personal project making a website, realized I can't do front-end stuff very well, but the back end side of things interests me more and more. I've taken the Udacity courses on web development and intro to algorithms which I enjoyed lots.

So I got some careers advice from my old university and they suggested I could take a one year conversion course to computer science. I did my searching, even applied and got accepted and I can pay the approx £7000 for the course. But the more I've been talking with people they think it's quite expensive and perhaps not worth it.

For me I see some clear advantages: It's a structured course, it will give me access to people for networking and advice. I chose this course because of some of the modules they have. It will put me in a studying frame of mind, hopefully separate me from distractions given the location. It should give me some theoretical background that I hope will help me later on, and perhaps put me above those who just have a practical background. It should make me job ready within a year instead of some unknown timeline and then help me get an internship.

I'm about one week from starting to find a place to live near the campus, but should I? Is it the right option for me? I'd appreciate some outside perspective from you guys. Thanks."

Welcome back to the **FINAL ROUND** of *Intergalactic Space Cookoff*! That’s right! It all comes down to this. Our chefs have been slaving away at creating the most delectable delicacies this side of the Virgo Supercluster! But first, a word from our sponsor!” The alien dropped his mic, as the cameras all turned away from him. 

“Mister Xarlax, we’re going to be live again in 20.”

“Alrighty, can somebody get me something to drink?” Xarlax slithered over to the center stage, the live studio audience mumbling quietly among themselves. The three contestants had formed a small line at the center of the stage, fidgeting nervously. Three plates, each covered, sat before them. 

“Five seconds Mister Xarlax!”

“Does anyone have my damn drink!?”

“Sorry sir.”

The spindly alien snorted. Oh well. 

“3...2...1...aaaand-”

“Welcome back to *Intergalactic Space Cookoff*! After countless trials and tribulations, it’s time to meet the contestants!”

Xarlax slithered over to the first chef, a tall, blocky Roggan. “Here we have chef number one! Krachhks, from Rogga Prime! Krachhks made it here by cooking a rack of ribs, sourced from his opponent, Xeelax! (May he rest in peace.)”

“Our second chef, Xaaaalx!” The crowd cheered wildly. “Xaaalx is the four-time winner of this competition, and made it here by literally causing our judge to pass out in foodgasmic pleasure, with his signature recipe, Hoopa Fillet!”

“Aaaaand our final competitor, representing the young Human race… Bill? Your name *is* Bill, right kid?”

The human nodded. “Uh, yeah.”

“We don’t know how Bill got here, nor should you care.”

The human stepped forwards. “H-hey that doesn’t seem-”

“ALRIGHT, NOW IT’S TIME TO MEET OUR JUDGE!”

Bill hung his head. “Okay.”

Xarlax pointed a tentacle to a long, black table, where a tall, shadowy figure sat. 

“That’s right folks!” Xarlax yelled. “None other than…” The lights over the desk boomed to life, revealing a massive frogman. “Ubboooooooo MANCHAAAAAAA!” Thunderous applause echoed around the set as the audience screamed adorations at the judge, who raised a small, webbed hand. 

“Now, let’s get on to tasting! (After these messages)”

--------

The covered dishes were arrayed before Ubbo, who stared at each one expectantly. Xarlax lifted the top off the first dish, prepared by Krachhks. A small chunk of meat, with several seasonings sprinkled on it, gleamed tantalizingly in the bright, artificial light. The crowd gave several *oohs* and *ahhs* before falling silent. Ubbo lifted a fork, and stabbed it into the steak, which he swallowed whole. The set was silent as the titan of cuisine slowly chewed the meat.

Ubbo nodded. “Very well cooked, Roggan.”

“Thank you, sir.”

“The hubba root really counters the overall meatiness of the… meat. Well done.”

“Thank you.”

------

The second dish was brought forth. Xarlax uncovered it, revealing it. It was a culinary sight to behold. Meat from all corners of the galaxy had been requisitioned for this dish. A glorious arrangement of salads sat atop the meats,  themselves lying upon a bed of rice. The whole thing was sprinkled liberally with all manner of herbs and spices, and it exuded an aroma so powerful, the front row of the audience collapsed in ecstasy. Xaaaalx smiled smugly, if a curling of facial tentacles could be considered smiling. 

Ubbo lifted the platter, and poured its contents into his cavernous maw. A large grin spread across his face. “Very good.”

“As always.”

Ubbo sighed. “I think we may have to take a break. I need… a moment.”

---------

After a brief series of extra-terrestrial horrors, courtesy of one ecstatic frogman, the competition resumed. 

Bill’s dish was brought forth. The crowd booed madly. Bill wrung his hands nervously. The top was lifted off the dish. The crowd cringed. It was disgusting, far too disgusting for them to look at. A brave intern threw himself before the camera to save the retinas of the galaxy from the ghastly sight of human cuisine. 

Ubbo reluctantly extended a hand, and flipped the meal into his mouth. 

The great frogman froze, his eyes widening. He sprung up, sending the desk and dishes crashing to the ground, and raised his forearms to the sky. “Ye gods! This! This! This is the finest thing to ever grace my taste receptors! I remember it all! My first meal, my mother’s cooking! None of it compares! You win human! You WIN! The flavor itself is nigh indescribable! Like a delicate ballet of gusto on one’s tongue! My boy, please, what do you call this most delectable concoction!?” 

Bill shoved his hands in his pocket and looked towards the ground. 

“Well, back on Earth, we call that…. a-a-a, um…”

“A WHAT, my boy?”

“A peanut butter and jelly sandwich.”

These guys are good enough the only comments to be made are about their design decisions, but I'm only really okay at finding syntax or formatting errors (the former, of course, is nonexistent with these guys).

What are some good habits and tips for peer reviewing code?

I am currently working in a startup where they lent me a macbook pro, which I used at work, but also at hackathons and for personal side projects.

Now that my internship is almost over, I want to buy my own mac, and if possible, to copy the exact configurations of my current mac on the one I'll buy, which will be the exact same model.

How could this be done with a non-apple hard drive ?

Sorry, I am a real rookie when it comes to apple products !

I'm coming on here because close friends and family have been unable to help, or unreliable, and I'm running out of time. 

I have a decent resume for a new grad. Lots of good experience, some jobs during school, multiple internships...but I can't find anything. I think I'm simply not looking in the right places, but what's more, I'm too intimidated to apply for anything, and don't know how to search properly. 

Now, I'm in a really bad situation. I'm stuck here; I don't have anyone I can live with, and nowhere to go...I've sent out a few applications over the last month since my graduation, but haven't heard a peep from any of the places I applied to and followed up on. I'll be completely out of money in about 3 or 4 weeks, and then I won't be able to buy food, let alone pay for rent. I stayed in this city because I really like where I live, but the longer I go without knowing what to do, the more I just check online job sites, look for an hour, and close them out of frustration. I've become pretty depressed here. 

This is pretty terrible considering how hard I worked to get here, all the things I managed to do as a college student and more. I feel like I'm looking down the barrel of a gun and there's no way out. I don't know how to look for jobs. I'm scared of applying to any that are out of my field (writing), or that seem soul-sucking (like retail). It's almost as if I'd rather die than take something bad short term....but I think I'm just worried about being unable to take a good first step and getting stuck in the poverty spiral. 

I have 2 degrees, an MFA in poetry, and a Bachelors in English. I have two minors, one in Theatre and the other in Anthropology. I was a campus leader, I've taught classes at both schools I went to for the degrees, and I did editing, publishing, and leadership internships. I've been a director, a club president, and I had good gpas at both universities (despite that not being relevant later). 

I just don't want to die. I wake up each day at odder hours, I'm stressed out, and feel paralyzed. I have no idea what I should be doing. 

Can anyone help?

I am a rising Senior at a private school in the Northeast (has a good business/engineering reputation in Northeast but no so much outside of it) majoring in Computer Engineering.

&amp;nbsp;

I live in the Northeast, but it has been my dream for the longest time to be able to work in Cali for a company (not necessarily Big 4) doing Software Engineering that pays fairly well, treats its workers well and is challenging.  Like I said, the company doesn't have to be huge, but obviously I'm going to aim high.  

&amp;nbsp;

As far as my background in the tech field, I have 1 year of technical work experience (internship this Summer as a Test Automation Engineer for an insurance company), but aside from that I'm a programming tutor and am working on a senior project sponsored by a well known company this Fall semester.  I am looking for something else in the Fall to do as far as work goes, but I am definitely going to be working as intern in the Winter for the same insurance company (to get more experience) if I don't find anything different.

&amp;nbsp;

Honestly, how do my chances look?"

I have considered some how salvaging my degree by combining with a Business degree or even working for two years and getting an MBA. I am a good student (3.7, 3.9 GPA) so I am fairly capable. Currently I have almost no relevant job experience (only past 6 summers have been odd full-time summer jobs), but will be actively seeking internships this coming fall.

   I am highly interested in technology, the tech world, computers anything related.

   I am highly interested in science, processes, concepts generally logical and intellectually stimulating things.

   I think I am apt to write things like stories, poetry and the likes. 

   I LOVE to present, talk to audiences about things I am knowledgeable about. - would love to act if there was more $$ in it

   I enjoy solving problems if I have the necessary tools to do so.

   I enjoy learning new things and am hyper focused on personal 
development and success (audiobook addict).

   I am always planning, thinking 2-3 years in the future

   I have been told I am a natural leader and enjoy doing so (however, I am at fault as I have barely any existing Extra Curricular activities to show for - besides jobs perhaps)

   I enjoy talking to people, acquaintances and am generally fascinated by people.

I'm tired of sign-in codes, clearing browser cache to sign-out of Office 365 and all related and unrelated services. 

I'm sick of getting different errors in every browser, including IE, in regards to usability. I mean, I tried to setup ADFS with Office 365 for the first time a few weeks back. I was prompted on Office 365 that I could only use Internet Explorer. Okay, cool. This is probably going to actually do something. Nope! Just some pretty documentation on what I should and shouldn't do.

I'm also still really tired of signing in and out on multiple browsers just to get to my account. Did I mention VLC? I had an intern here last week unable to login and they were sure they were doing something wrong. I mean, seriously. A little unrelated, but why do I have to click somewhere 4 times when activating Office? Once for a username, another for work / personal, another at the redirect page. I get this is part of ADFS, but still -- shit's broke. It's not too great without ADFS, either. Trust me, I was using it that way since release. 

Oh well, at least we don't need a totally separate billing account for each Office 365 account like we did during the good ol' days of BPOS.

3giel8,1,2015-08-10,Opinion on first big-boy job out of college?,CaptainCommissar,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/3giel8/opinion_on_first_bigboy_job_out_of_college/,"Well, it happened.  I got a job offer for a System Engineer at the company I am currently interning for.  I'm in a bind whether or not to take it.  I would be starting as a full-fledged System Engineer working on a team of others of the same title starting at $63k USD.  I believe that's on the high-end for fresh graduates, usually I feel like IT grads have to start helpdesk or similar at ~$40k, if I'm not mistaken.  Online research on the topic seems very skewed or bloated.  However, researching Sys.Engineers/Admins and they average, as a title, at ~$75. 



To make it easier, pros/cons:

Pros:

- $63k (I think) I pay for entry-level

- Awesome benefits/medical coverage.

- Paid for certs and further education.

- Already decent knowledge of the network layout and ""how things work"" at this company. Can hit the ground running.

- Great experience, newly formed medical company that's still building network and also dealing with crappily handed down one at same time. Get to have feelers out on everything: Server Hardware, VMWare, Hyper-V, System Center, Linux, Palo Alto /Firewalls, Hitachi Storage, SQL, Powershell, etc. 

- Mostly awesome coworkers, and close friends that have accepted jobs here as well.

- Seemingly cheap cost of living (3 bedroom apartment, huge space only $750, similar solo 1-2 bedroom for $450, etc)

- Won't have to worry about finding a job during senior year. (this year)

- Starting here for just 5 years would give me an extremely solid resume/experience (or so I've been told) that will give me a really good shot at other better jobs.

Cons:

- Girlfriend will have a dirt job.  Her Corporate Retail/Merchandising major does her no good around here; closest corporate jobs that aren't at miserable salaries/benefits are 2 hrs away from my job. (so living in the middle is still a 1hr transit every morning for both of us...)
- GF will make significantly less than me if she does happen to find a job, like only $35-40K, and will be professionally miserable for that 5 years.
- I will be locked in to the job for a few years minimum, meaning if I just happen to get an offer/interview with one of those $75k jobs elsewhere close to a place my GF can actually work, I won't be able to take it even after I graduate.

- The future of this company is very shady.  It's only a year old, and ultimately, can tank or become really big in the next year (while I'm still in school) depending on the success or failure of some large projects being done.  (Job uncertainty)

- Potential to make more


To determine my chances elsewhere, my overall (very general) professional experience is:

- 2 Years as a High School Assistant Network Administrator
- 4 years volunteering at a local library as their IT support.
- 3 Years as a University Helpdesk Technician and Quality Assurance Technician
- 1.5 years as a Helpdesk Manager
- 3 months as a System Engineer Intern
- CCNA - Security (Studying for R&amp;S now, failed first time)
- CCNP - TSHOOT 
(I know those are networking certs but I got them through school so I'm not complaining.)
- 4-year degree in IT Management
- Also do a lot of home tinkering in labs, host my own public MC server, VM network to test things and play around. Passion.

Am I over/under/justright qualified for this job? Should I take it? other things to consider? Your experiences? And thank you infinitely for any and all of your feedback. 

I've been a frequent and long-time visitor of /r/sysadmin and aspire to go far and do some of the great things I've read people experience here, as well as learn a lot."

For next summer I want to get a hardware engineering internship with a company like Qualcomm, Intel etc. or anything involving low level programming.

My internship was web-dev so experience from it isnt very useful so I guess I just have to make a project or two to show off proficiency in C or something in I don't have any projects written in low level languages and I don't know what to make. Everything I can think of or that I see suggested is something like a website or phone app.

What kind of projects can I write in low level languages like C to help me get an interview for a hardware engineering position? If anyone whose got an internship like that could share their resume that would be helpful.

I have an arduino starter kit lying around somewhere but I'm not sure I can make something meaningful without a tonne of sensors and parts."

3giwr9,2,2015-08-10,I got a job offer.. sort of. Too good to be true? Not my area.. help.,themoofinman,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/3giwr9/i_got_a_job_offer_sort_of_too_good_to_be_true_not/,"I just need some advice.

I graduated from my undergrad 3 years ago. I currently have 2 semester left in my grad program. Everything I've done up to this point has had an international focus. My first degree was internationally focused and I was able to travel extensively. I had some internships doing leadership development and marketing. I worked retail for those 4 years as well.

Went to grad school after I graduated because I couldn't find work. Shortly after I found work. Funny how that works. For the last year and a half I've worked in international education. Lately it has sucked pretty bad. Really bad leadership which has gone from the top down. My wife and I have both really wanted to move abroad, but wanted to wait a while to really be able to find a solid job to do so. I don't want to just teach English. Nothing wrong with that, I just don't want to do it.

Last week I ran into a not quite friend but acquaintance. I knew he was pretty well off and from the tech world. He had recently bought a place I used to work at to invest in it. While chatting I said sort of flippantly that I wasn't enjoying work and that I should come work for him, what he does.

He then asked me what I did and what I was interested in and started telling me about multiple start up business he was doing. One specifically located in the Hague. He told me that he thinks I'd make a great TPM or TSE for his tech start up. Gave me the name, talked a few logistical details and set up a meeting to talk about it more in depth this week.

What I know so far. The company is in cloud computing. It must have taken a lot of capital to start it up. He has connections to some huge business that have been verified. I'd have to do training in the Hague for about three weeks, come back and tie up loose ends, and then move with my wife. 

I point blank told him I don't really have any experience in this field, why did he offer me something like this. He told me that I have an extreme attention to detail, I follow through, and I'm an amazing communicator. Plus, I asked the question, and that's what he had available.

What is this? Is this real life? It sounds legit, but is this too good to be true? I've been researching the field non-stop since then and have a lot of questions, but have no experience specifically in the tech start up world.. especially in the Netherlands.

What do I need to ask? How do I potentially not get screwed? Is this a scam? I don't think so since I sort of know the guy, but I'm so in the unknown here. Can someone help?"
3gix0c,3,2015-08-10,MBA Applicant Profile,Malluce,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/3gix0c/mba_applicant_profile/,"Hey /r/MBA,

After seeing another thread about MBA applicant profile, I decided to throw out my info and see what the sub thinks!

* Male/ Asian (Chinese)/ mid-twenties/ US Citizen
* Undergrad: UC San Diego/ Computer Science/ 3.3 GPA
* Work: 38 months FT experience when MBA starts (08/2016)
* Software Engineer at a second-tier tech company
* Quit after two years and co-founded my own startup, currently still at seed stage, has two VCs backed and raised about 1M seed capital
* GMAT: 730 (taken once)
* Schools Applying: HBS/ Stanford/ Wharton/ Columbia/ MIT/ Haas/ UCLA/ NYU - all Round 1
* Thoughts: Personally I think the startup experience either will boost my chance or backfire. However, I did address the reason why I want an MBA now in my essay, and it is fully supported by the board and my business partner (co-fouder). My goal is to intern at an established startup during the summer and go back to lead the team once I get my degree.
* Rec Letters: One will come from my startup co-founder who currently serves as the CEO. He is also my ex-boss from the previous company, we both quit to launch the startup. Another one will come from the angel investor who joined as chairman, he's also an alum from UCLA and a high profile leader in the biotech industry. (Again, this can backfires too)

I don't have an exceptionally high GPA or GMAT (consider the median for HBS is 732, not to mention those Chinese applicants with their 780 scores...), and not as experienced as the average applicant (5 - 7 years work). I'm simply betting on the unconventional path I have, but to be honest, I don't think founding a startup is as rare as before, so I don't know how it will turn out. 

I would love to hear the thoughts and opinions from this sub. Thanks!"

I have taken an intro CS class with Java and Calc I. This semester I'm taking the continued Java CS class, Calc II and discrete math.

Due to poor decision making my first year, I am at around a 2.77 GPA. I'm trying to make a solid Resume so when I start applying for internships this fall that I actually stand a chance at maybe getting one. I haven't had any coding jobs before, but I have experience in Java and Swift.

What I'm looking to get answered is:

1). What can I do to make a solid resume? Since I probably won't put my GPA on it, should I include that I've worked on some projects with Swift/iOS development? What makes a good CS resume?

2). Where do I start looking for internships? I've heard of linked in but never used it before. Is this what most people use for finding internships?

Thanks!!

I’ve seen quite a bit of improvement since I started working there, yet there are situations where I face a problem for a couple hours and find that the fix could have been implemented in ten minutes.  I’m feeling anxious all the time, during and away from work, because I feel like they would just let me go at any second.  I read about it earlier this week and it’s called ‘Imposter Syndrome’, which is the feeling of incompetence work and the fear of others discovering this incompetence.  So far, they haven’t given me any warnings about my work or given me any warnings about the time in which I finish my tasks, but I can’t help that feel I’m not measuring up to their standards, even as a junior developer.  I don’t want to worry, because I feel like that will certainly slow down my work.
Have any of you guys felt this where you work?  If you did, how can I get rid or alleviate these feelings?  When did these feelings go away for you guys, or do you still feel them at times.

I've been though 6 interviews since graduation that each ended without an offer because of my lack of experience.

I have 2 more interviews lined up, and I'm very afraid they're going to end the same way, and I'm not sure there's anything I can do to show them that I'm a more than capable person, just that I don't have a relevant work history (except for an 8 month internship). I've taught myself a considerable amount of what I know, and I know I can pick things up quickly; certainly faster than some of my peers at school.

I guess my question to the veterans out there; what is going through the minds of the company when considering hiring someone fresh out of college? Does experience matter to such a degree that I would be too hard to train up or couldn't provide any kind of value? Is there something I can say during my interview to prove to them that I am a quick learner and that my lack of experience does not equate to incompetence?

Sorry for long post, I'm just rather frustrated. Any feedback would be super helpful. Thanks!"

Prologue: I currently have an internship doing computer stuffs, today I was helping a colleague set up a few computers for external use in a small room.

Story: My colleague asked what music I was into, I openly replied indie/alternative rock. He then suggested he put on some of his music since he liked rock and suggested it was very similar to what I listened to, at this point I thought he meant some Red Hot CH or Kings OL, but how wrong I was. His definition of rock was the hardest fucking metal you've ever heard, so in this closed small room I was stuck having my ears dominated by head banging screaming death metal at full blast. I was too embarrassed to ask him to change the 'rock' music so I sucked it up for the next hour or so.

Conclusion: I am now sitting at my desk wondering why I have a headache and no desire to ever mention rock to anyone again.

TL;DR: Told someone I liked rock, I was then audibly dominated"

Hey guys!

Before I get into this, I just wanted to mention that I've read through the Wiki and a ton of posts here. This subreddit is awesome and has provided a lot of valuable information for me these past few months.

Like many of you, I'm hoping to break into consulting one day (specifically tech), and was wondering if any of you had any advice for my particular scenario. Also have some questions at the end. Here are my stats:

- Target / Top 10 University (AFAIK all the big consulting companies recruit here)
- STEM Major with a 3.1 GPA (this is the big hurdle I'll have to overcome it seems)
- Project Management internship at a F500 firm in the industry I'd really like to consult for. Internships at a small IT consultancy firm and in a software dev position at a medium sized manufacturing firm.
- Multiple officer / VP positions of student orgs. I'd like to think I'm pretty involved on campus. 
- Also have some unique hobbies (think athlete/DJ/yo-yo master)

Here are some questions I have for you guys:

- First off, what do you think are my chances at consulting firms. I realize MBB is out of the picture with my GPA, but what about Big 4 and others? Still not a chance?
- I got to the final round of a Big 4 summer internship last year but didn't get an offer. I know enough to stay in contact with the recruiter and apply full time, but is there anything else I should do?
- My goal is to get into a firm and become an SME in the airline/aerospace industry. What are some good firms to look at? And how big is the airline/aerospace industry in terms of consulting opportunities? Will I be able to get staffed on a project within this industry, or will I be expected to take anything I can get?
- What else should I be doing with the little time I have left? I know networking is on the agenda, but should I bother with things like case competitions at this point?

Whoops, looks like this got a lot longer than I initially expected. Sorry about that! I'd really appreciate any help I could get from you guys. Thanks."

I probably have one of the top 3 grades among CS students at my school.

I don't want to omit it, because from all of the articles that I've read and I'm sure people who read resumes have also read, that means you have a bad GPA. This would also limit my choices, because many companies large enough to be willing to look at foreign graduates have GPA requirements. Also, I do have American citizenship from my parents and am fluent in English, but I grew up in South America. However, I assume most small companies wouldn't consider me anyway because of the risk.

Can I just put a 3.5? The thing is that even looking at my transcript isn't accurate, for example in some course I got the highest grade with an 80 when the average was a 40, but that information is lost when I put a meaningless number on my resume.

I applied for internships last year and couldn't even get an interview, and internships aren't as common where I am so all I can do is work on personal projects.

3gnmpv,12,2015-08-11,Take entry level position in the middle of nowhere or keep holding out for a job in a major market?,reformedslacker,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3gnmpv/take_entry_level_position_in_the_middle_of/,"I'm a 28 year old with a nontraditional background for an entry level candidate. I half-assed a degree in History, worked for a while in unrelated jobs, and then did a second bachelor's in Computer Science part time. I've finished my degree this year without being able to secure an internship (bad, I know). I have a few personal projects and I'm trying to work on bigger/better ones whenever I get the chance. I've spent over a year practicing interview questions and I've killed the interviews I've actually managed to get.

I just can't seem to get anything but an automatic rejection from anywhere I'd actually be interested in working. I've had numerous friends in the industry review my resume, I've spent practically all of my free time applying for every new entry level position that I can find. On rare occasion I'll get a phone screen or I'll be asked over email for some more information and end up getting rejected because I don't quite fit the profile they're looking for. 

The problem is I only get interviews in places where I get the feeling there's not as much competition. I've never had a single reply when applying for companies in most major cities. Maybe it's because I graduated without any internship experience, maybe it's my background, maybe it's because I'm out of state. I've applied for the few jobs in my state that I can find but there aren't all that many, at least not that I'm remotely qualified for.

I started applying to companies in places I thought I'd never consider moving, managed to get a few interviews in pretty quick succession (both Skype and on-site), absolutely killed them, and got some offers that, while not fantastic, are more than sufficient for me. I think I could do any of these jobs well and I think I'd like working at any of the companies.

I just don't know how long I can stand to live in the middle of nowhere. I went back to school for CS dreaming about living in Seattle or SF, not Fargo... or places even smaller or more isolated. Will sucking it up for a year or two and getting some experience help me move onto somewhere else? Will living in frozen interior of the US actually put me at a disadvantage when I'm looking to get to somewhere else?

It's pretty disappointing since I live in a shitty area now and had been kind of clinging to the idea of getting to move somewhere exciting and having more opportunities while I was still somewhat young-ish. Moving to a backwater feels like basically giving up the rest of my twenties but maybe what I need to do now is move wherever I need to, work hard and learn as much as I can, and shoot for moving to somewhere I want to live when I'm in my early 30s."
3gnzfm,25,2015-08-11,We discovered Strain 3.,Worst_NA_Zed,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3gnzfm/we_discovered_strain_3/,"We discovered it. We finally did. It was on accident too. I don't even know what to say. I should be ecstatic. I SHOULD be on the news being praised. I SHOULD be receiving the Wolf Prize in Medicine. Yet I sit here, in my lab typing this. Posting it here. Here of ALL places. I don't care if you believe me. I don't care if you bash me. All I care about it having it known I discovered it first. I was the one who told the world. I was the first to discover it and will be the last to die from it. Read this. All of it. I believe it will be my last statement and only communication with the outside world. I don't even know if this will get through.

I am Dr. T.Z. Hu. I have worked in virology all my life. For those who do not know what that is, it is stated in its own name. I study viruses. Ever since I graduated from UPENN in '83 I have worked privately for one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies. My team and I have worked for this to be unnamed company under a sector only the CEO and a handful of higher ups know about. We are the group that have been constantly feeding data to lower sectors that have helped to create vaccinations for hundreds of diseases over the years. The sector I work for was taken over by me in '85 when my mentor succumbed to Strain 3. This company I work for has changed many names over the years but has always had one main goal. To prevent any more Strains from entering the general populace. They were originally part of the British government but branched into the U.S. and went independent. You won't be able to figure out who I am talking about. Don't try. For your own safety.

Before I start spewing information I want to give some background on what the Strain is. No, it is not the popular new show on TV about vampires. As creative as it is, a virus like the one shown in the show would become much more rampant and completely uncontainable.

As interesting as the show is, I am not going to be talking about that. I am going to be telling you about the Strains. Simply named the Strains. The first strain was discovered and explained in the 1800's but not named. It was recorded but nobody suspected that to be the cause. The cause of the extinction of the dinosaurs. There are hundreds of arguments throughout the world about how the dinosaurs died. Scientists have come to the general consensus that a meteor or a catastrophic event from space ended them. It was not. The original Strain developed and got out of control too quickly. It had no time to evolve with the rate it spread. It could not put itself into hibernation. The dominant creatures that roamed earth.

The theory of the original Strain is that they evolved from an unknown virus. A virus that affected plants but did not harm them. It was dormant until eaten by an herbivore. It then would mass reproduce. If the herbivore survived long enough into adulthood past their mating age, the virus would become active and kill them. It would essentially eat them from the inside out. If they were eaten during their prime, the virus would pass onto a carnivore. It could also spread through bites. Much like a zombie virus, except it did not enslave their hosts. It eventually affected so many generations that nearly all organisms were affected. It caused a mass dying out. It died out so fast that whatever organisms were not affected (namely avian dinosaurs- reason unknown) simply went on living. They did not die simultaneously as many would suspect, but in a very marginal time slot.

The Strain went back into a dormant state after they died off. It seems they are able to communicate somehow. Their means of communication are unknown.

Strain 2. This was something most of us know about. It affected Europe. The Black Death. The Plague. Strain 2 worked similarly to Strain 1. It seemed to affected humans accidentally. It was dormant in plants. The Strain passes on through the generations, evolving as plants do. Why it was dormant for so long we have not figured out yet. We ran some tests and realized if isolated in a small area, once it affects everything, it systematically starts to eliminate all contained organisms. From the top of the food chain to the bottom. 50% of the bottom of the food chain survive. Reason assumed for self preservation. In Europe Strain 2 was consumed by Marmots and other rodents. Fleas then drank from these rodents. The rodents were on caravans and spread. It is believed that due to a sudden mass spreading toward new organisms, Strain 2 was activated. After more mass death, Strain 2 went back into hibernation. Obviously, this is not a detailed explanation for how Strain 2 got so rampant. Different records indicate different things. I am giving a general summary.

Now to the most important Strain. Strain 3. Two months ago my team finally cracked it. We cracked what killed my mentor. For the longest time we assumed he died of a brain aneurysm. We were wrong. After sifting through our data one of our newest scientists figured out how to finally isolate the genes of the Virus within my mentor's brain. Yes, we preserved it because the way he died was extremely suspicious. To work in our facility you go through a monthly full body exam using the most advanced human technologies purchasable by money. The tech we use can literally figure out if you have lung cancer or X% potential for it 3 months before it even starts developing simply from analyzing your breath. This stuff may never get into public hands. Simply because it would cause an even greater population spike.

When we found the isolated gene our computers instantly matched it at a 77% to the most commonly preserved version of Strain 2. We dug up bodies and took samples in their bones. Yes, the Strains mix into genes and can be found preserved in bones and muscle. The moment the computer made a match the entire facility went into lock down. The air within the facility started becoming recycled, the entire lab went into solar powered mode, and the water systems started purifying waste water. Most of the lower ranked scientists (basically interns that have been sworn into secrecy) started freaking out. They had never experienced this before. For most of us who had worked here for longer than 15 years we didn't even flinch. This occurred at least once every 4 or so years. We would stumble upon a new disease and it would match up to more than 50% with Strain 2. The entire lab would shut down and become self sufficient. It would not let a Strain 2 match leave. We had to create a controlled environment. I was excited. This was the highest match percentage we had ever had. My inner group of 4 others gathered into my office. This was rare. Basically nobody was allowed in my office. I would exit to meet with them but I had told them in case of a lock down they were to report to me immediately. The 4 of them were followed by a swarm of about 17 total other scientists. Basically drones to do the busy and menial tasks while my inner circle and I would seek to create vaccines for more complicated or increasingly rampant diseases. After a brief explanation of what was happening I set them all off with different tasks and tests to run.

Shit. I am running out of time. My fingers are going numb. I spent too much on the history of the Strain.

After a lot of testing, cloning, and finally isolating, we were able to make a full sample of Strain 3. The 77% match was accurate. It was Strain 3 evolved. We did a lot of testing and finally figured out where this Strain had been hiding. For the last 500 years the human population has experienced unprecedented growth. We have become the dominant species. Don't argue with me about which species is dominant. We are. We were. Strain 3 isn't in the air. It isn't in the water. It's in us. It has been in us, dormant. After Strain 2 spread through Europe, Strain 3 remained inside humans. It spread using our genes. Nearly, if not all humans, have it. We don't know how long it will remain dormant. We do not know WHY it remains dormant. We can only assume it is waiting for our population to peak.

But the one thing we do know. It reproduces using light. We have always known sunlight to be what kills most viruses and diseases. The purifier of sickness. This virus is not like that. Sunlight only makes it stronger. It feeds off of it. Something we did not expect was how quickly it could adapt to our lifestyles. This has never been seen before. Not only does it use sunlight to its advantage, but also artificial light. It thrives when faced with artificial light.

Rat test 32 (R-T-32) showed that when faced with extended periods of artificial light, Strain 3 would become nearly visible in the eyes. It looked like a tiny cluster floating across the eye, swimming toward where the brightest artificial light was. We injected R-T-32 with a buffer. It sped up Strain 3 so we could view how it killed its host. We thought it was a brain aneurysm. It wasn't. Starting from the back of the eyes it would start eating away. At a rate that would match a rat eating a human's eye. It would then stop eating, causing blurriness (assumed), and force its host to stop moving (out of dizziness). The host's body then loses motor functions, but internals continue to work. The brain starts firing off signals in panic to attempt to reactivate the body. This only causes the heart to pump faster, bringing blood through the body and brain. R-T-32 started squeaking frantically but without movement. The brain then stops functioning and dies. From reading R-T-32's vitals we could tell that it suffered. It had parts of its brain eaten while it was alive. This took half an hour to happen. R-T-32 could do nothing about it. We could do nothing about it. We can do nothing. Nothing.

After dissecting R-T-32 we learned after killing the host it would become untraceable. We found no remnants of it in the body. The only evidence it was ever there was the miniscule holes in the brain and back of the eyes of R-T-32.

That was 2 months ago. We had spent 2 months locked in this lab, sending encrypted data to our sponsors. The only food we had was the 6 month store inside our lab. We had been drinking cleaned piss water for at least half a month. We were ready to leave. We were all ready. But that's when it happened. We forgot about our own tests. We forgot. How could we forget. We were isolated. We had been. How we had not thought this through was beyond me. Jefferey, one of the 17 scientist drones, showed the initial symptoms while at our supposed last meeting. At the end of that meeting he had stood up, looked around, and sat back down. Most of the drones brushed it off but a few suddenly backed away from him. I noticed as well. Jefferey didn't move. He couldn't. He turned his head and opened his mouth to speak but only a gargle of noise came out. His head then slumped back onto his chair. This had happened in the course of less than 2 minutes.

Instead of helping him move on we all put on containment suits and studied him. We could see his eyes moving, hear his breathing, his attempts at speaking. We could have simply put him out of his misery, but if we did, what kind of scientists would that make us? We dissected him. While he was alive. Yes, while he was still on the chair. We didn't want to create an excess of extra variables. He died soon after. From blood loss, not the virus. We were no closer to cracking it.

In the following 2 months everyone started exhibiting symptoms. We became paranoid. We started hiding in our rooms or offices, boarded inside with water and food. The effect onsets slower when isolated and alone but it still onsets. I feel it setting in. My left hand has stopped working completely, I cannot stand, and I cna hardly see. I am going on how I remember hte keyboard.

My theory on how it works is once the virus multiplies enough, it will activate if their host becomes isolated. I think this is because thry hope another organism will feed om the corpse so it can continue to survive. I don't know how to fix this. I simply need it to be known. Some powerful people already know this exists. They have their hands on it. My company knows about my family. I cannot reveal them. There is no hope. I am sorry."

First of all I'm really sorry for the probably big wall of text I might end up writing.

I'm an 18 year old (19 in a few months) male from Portugal who from late May to early July had the opportunity to live in your country as a Praktikant in a Firma. I'm now back in my home country but might go back to Germany between late August-early September, since I have the option to do a Ausbildung as a CNC-Zerspanungsmechaniker. Now, here is why I'm not so sure about going back (at least so soon):



I did in Portugal what is called a Curso Profissional (translated to english what would be a Profissional Course/Degree, or what someone would do (at least similarly) at a Berufschule, I think, or maybe at a Fachschule), that gave me an equivalence to high school, plus a professional certification, plus I did an internship at a design company. Said course/degree was as Multimedia Technic (official title). Basically I picked an education that gave me knowledge to work with IT, Media and other industries, but a somewhat abstract level, meaning I didn't get to add a lot of depth to those areas, maybe with the exception of software geared towards computer animation/modelling and design, and a little bit of programming, things that I like and want to build on to make a career out of it.

Obviously that has pretty much nothing to do with Mechanics, and after doing the Ausbildung I would want to switch my antenna to what I already know and love. What I ask is: could I go back to Germany and (successfully) search for a Praktikum or a go straight for an Ausbildung geared towards the areas that I like, based on my Education plus little work experience (an intership in Portugal and in Germany (although in a non related area)?

I must say that in the future I want to go to Uni, but I didn't do national exams in Portugal. I was told that, with an Ausbildung that would not be a requirement. I'm not sure about that, could any of confirm? Or could I go straight for Uni instead of an Ausbildung? I don't think that's possible since I didn't do national exams). Or maybe there are other types of work/school systems you think could be more adequate, I don't know.

Any question that you think would help you help me, I'm more than happy to answer."

I looked at /u/deineblauenaugen's step-by-step guide to studying in Germany, but I was left with a bit of confusion. The way deineblauenaugen made his/her guide, it seemed like it was geared towards US students who had just graduated high school. I already have a few other academic accomplishments though, including attending a technical college presently. I wanted to run my extra academic accomplishments through this subreddit and see if you all think I have a good chance of getting accepted to a German University. Here are my accomplishments, as well as my academic goals relating to studying abroad to give you all a better idea of what I want to do:

Academic Goals

1.) Would like to major in mathematics at a German University

2.) I am planning on taking the SAT this fall

3.) I am planning on taking English 102, Calculus 3, Differential Equations, and Audio Editing 101 this Fall at the technical college that I am currently attending, which is called Trident Technical College.

4.) Will be attending a language intensive program during the Christmas break in Germany to develop my proficiency in German.

Accomplishments:

1.) Currently have earned 51 college credits and have a 3.1 GPA at my college (Note: I had failed some classes when I first started college, but I have retaken those classes and have made A's and B's in all of them)

2.) The most recent classes I have finished are Calculus 1 and Calculus 2 for the summer. I made A's in both classes.

3.) I am currently employed by my college as a paid math tutor through their nationally accredited Learning Center Program.

4.) Worked as an Intern at an Information Technology Company for about three months.

5.) Had a GPA of 3.4 when I graduated high school.

Let me know what you all think and if I have a chance of getting accepted.

TL:DR version - Looking to get accepted into a German University. Look at Academic Goals and Accomplishments and see if I have a chance of getting accepted.

I've joined one of those training+placement agencies that train you (unpaid) for 3-4 months in enterprise java topics before placing you with a client (banks) on a 2 year contract (underpaid by 30%). I have no internship experience and getting phone screens/interviews is scarce (maybe ~5-10% phone screen response rate, less for technical interviews). I am still able to leave the scheme before the massive training fee/penalty is in effect (which keeps you locked in for the 4 months + 2 years) and want to know how I should move foward. Of course, ideally I wouldn't have to go through this agency to obtain those first couple years of experience, but being underpaid and locked in for 2 years may be better than not being able to find anything relevant at all and staying unemployed for even longer (graduated May this year). At least with the agency I will be well positioned to look for other jobs in the industry after the contract and I recognize that everybody starts from somewhere - especially someone like me with no experience. I can think of it as my ""internship"" if you will. What do people think? Bite the bullet and sacrifice personal choice/job quality/salary for 2.5 years or leave and continue applying for jobs on my own?

Advice is appreciated,

I'm a fresh graduate looking to break into the asset management industry. Just a brief background on myself: Have a bachelors and master degree from tier 1 universities in the UK, multiple internships at global and local financial institutions, bilingual in Chinese and English.

I currently have 3 options: 
1) Management Trainee position at a local bank in HK for Retail Banking and Wealth Management
2) Analyst position at a boutique investment bank - working on Chinese IPOs
3) Reject both and try to find an internship/job within AM

The first option is a management trainee position so it heavily encourages career progression at a strong local bank, however it is in retail banking and wealth management which is not what I want to do and I'm not sure about the transition into AM? 
The second option is great, with great pay and a very hands on experience; however its working within a Chinese company with a very rich Chinese culture and client base, and I personally prefer working under an international setting 
The third option is the riskiest, practically betting on myself to make it.

3gp6kg,0,2015-08-12,The Board,Luease,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3gp6kg/the_board/,"All of these events began a while back when I was in high school, currently a senior in College, and have been progressing since. 

I was a sophomore hanging out with the guys in our intro to Architecture class. In highschool we'd simply finish our assignments and have free time until lunch. The usual was going on all up until Alexis decides to add some excitement to our normal relaxing time off. A group of about 8 to 10 guys ranging from sophomores to seniors gathered around, all good friends of ours. We dimmed the back lights, our teacher was there but really didn't give a damn since we all behaved for the most part and finished our projects. We gathered but had no idea what was to come next only that Alexis had instructed us not to freak out. 

We all sat there staring at it. We've heard stories from family members and friends about how playing with this could lead to terrible things but we didn't give a damn. We just wanted a quick thrill and curiosity took over. 

We jokingly began moving the eye piece around the board every letter after another spelling out some idiotic question. Nothing came of it really. We all laughed at each question and then decided to ask serious questions like ""who's here?"" Or ""what's your name?"" But still nothing came out of it... or so we thought. 

At first it was nothing just lights flickering here and there and hearing weird noises from time to time. My family is a bit superstitious but I've always been the one to lead everything back to some logical explanation. I'm sure it was just a coincidence that as I entered a hall way or drive down the road alone a light would completely shut off out of no where. Gradually it became noticeable for some odd reason and it woulf happened more and more all leading up to my Freshman year in college. 

The summer of my freshman year I landed an internship at a lab which had me back and forth between college and home. I'd visit home and my older brother would stay on the couch in my room just so we could all hang out while I was in town, saved him time from commuting from home to my parents place. The night was hot and muggy and I was having a little trouble sleeping that night drifting in and out for a good set of hours. It was about 2 or 3 at night and all of a sudden I could feel someone staring at me. I've been all too familiar with getting the death stare from my mom throughout the years to wake me up and get ready for school however this one felt different and why would she so late? The piersing stare and uncomfortable, uneasy feeling of someone standing next to my bed was enough to slowly drift me out of falling to sleep. Slowly I opened my eyes ... I looked up just as slow and found myself staring at a girl with long dark hair and a white dress staring back at me. Her uncomed, messy hair draped down her fave only reveling a little bit of white from her eyes. 

As I stared up at her I could feel sweat now pouring down and my heart beating faster than I could ever imagine it be humanly possible. I'm sure it was only a second or two until I began screaming bloody murder and my brother awoke but it felt like several minutes being frozen in fear. My brother jumped and quickly began yelling at me ""what the hell is wrong? What's going on?"" I looked at him now on my knees on my bed telling him there's someone in the house. I was only about 2 feet away from the light switch but couldn't get myself to move. My brother jumped up slapped on the lights and ran around the house to check it out.

Nothing/No one was found.

The next aternoon my brother got off work early since it was a Saturday and found me watching TV in the front living room as if nothing at in the world was wrong. I smiled at him and he asked ""hey ... do you want to talk about last night?"". I was confused at first and didn't know what he was talking about. He saw the look on my face and said ""you know, you waking up in the middle of the night and the whole neighborhood with it."" 

It all rushed at me and I quickly remember the image. It all seemed so real but I thought it was too silly of a thing to believe. I honestly would have just dismissed the entire thing as a nightmare that I just awoke from and would have even forgotten all about it by now if it wasn't for all that had happened next.

3gpcor,1,2015-08-12,What are my options? Political science/computer science double major,170orDie,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/3gpcor/what_are_my_options_political_sciencecomputer/,"So I am entering my fifth year of undergrad to finish out my double major. My GPA is 3.6 and I go to a small private school. Originally I went into this double major thinking I was going into Patent Law. I'm studying for the LSAT right now and practice testing at the 171+ level. However, I'm wondering if law school is really for me. I hear all these horror stories about an average of 70 hours/week, and that's just not something I want out of my career. What keeps me very interested though is the median salary of patent attorneys ~150k, I also keep hearing that the job market is very good for people with my degree combination (assuming I get into a top law school). 

But I am looking for some advice and guidance on the options I may have in case I decide against going to law school. I know I can obviously become a programmer/developer. But honestly, since I've been so intent on going to law school I have not put in the extra time to hone my cs skills nor have I gone into any internships or major side projects. I feel that I am pretty behind the other students in terms of experience and skill. I also do not really see myself becoming a code monkey.

That being said, what are my options? I'm thinking there may be some careers that I don't know about that may work for me. If so, I'd like to know what I can do as of right now to better prepare my way. Im really terrified of leaving my undergrad with no job, and no plan for the future. 

Law school right now is plan A, but I would really love some backup plans or alternative routes to ponder. I know this is a huge pivot point in my life and I just want to see all my options to make the best move I can.

Thanks guys! "

I currently have a job in sales that I view as a ""stepping stone"" until I get a marketing job I want. 

I have been applying and even got interviews with 5 different companies over the past 3 months. 2 of them I knew I was underqualified for but went any ways not expecting to get the job (which I didn't).

The other 3, however, I have gone to numerous interviews with each company and was told I was top 2 or 3 in each of the interview processes. Safe to say, I did not come down with the job at the other places. I feel like I am a good interviewer and I keep reaching those final rounds of interviews as of late. I just feel my confidence taking a hit, as I have been unable to acquire that new job. 

For one of companies, I asked what I could of done better in terms of the interviews. They literally said ""Nothing, you did fantastic. It was very competitive and we really had to get nit-picky to single you out.""

To give you a little background, I am currently in my first full time job out of college (sales) and have been here about 7 months. But, I had an internship in social media, as well as a marketing reasearch assistant experience. 

I am all about improving and doing what I have to do to get the job I want, but I feel I have been approaching the process correctly.

Anyone else experience this? Any tips?

3gpw2e,2,2015-08-12,Employer changing intern status unexpectedly,throwawayintern101,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3gpw2e/employer_changing_intern_status_unexpectedly/,"Hi all.

I'm a PhD student in Data Science, currently interning at $smallish_company doing general software development work.

I started here this past May, with the expectation that I would continue as a full-fledged employee doing Data Science after the internship was complete.

I was accepted to a top-tier conference that just happened last week. Right before the conference, my employer told me they would bring me on during the semester for general dev work, but only as an intern and at intern pay. I thought about my experience, decided that I would use my opportunity at the conference to network with people doing what I want to do, and then interview while still interning at $smallish_company for positions starting this winter (mostly startups). I felt extremely strongly about this plan, and networked my ass off during the conference.

So my presentation comes and goes, and yesterday, my manager gives me the ""good news"": they want to bring me on as a real part-time employee doing general dev work for the semester. This comes with a substantial pay increase (33%), and I foolishly said I was interested without really thinking about the implications (that I would be staying more than the 6 months I planned). I think the reasons for this change of heart are twofold- first, I became more valuable from the conference itself, and two, there's been a lot of churn on my team lately and I overheard one of the newer programmers is about to leave (I think they're desperate).

What I think would be ideal is if I were able to keep as an intern while I interviewed at the connections I made at the conference. I really don't want to just continue doing regular dev work. Is this possible? What should I do? I've considered negotiating down my title back to intern, so that other companies don't see the 6-month term in my history. I've also considered asking for unreasonable requirements during the salary negotiations, so I could use that as an excuse for leaving. Is there anything I'm missing? Is there a way to handle this politely and maturely?"

Please help.,Throwawayescapep,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/3gq3la/overbearing_parents_losing_control_please_help/,"As a 20+yold living with parents I realize there isn't much liberty for me to live how I want to, and there are rules for me to abide by while I live under their home. While I am looking for a job, and have gotten an internship atm, this is not enough to satisfy my parents expectations. It's difficult when everything I do seems wrong in their eyes. From the way I do chores, to simply request some time for myself, if I don't do things up to their standard I am to blame. And they certainly make it known to me, insulting me by showing what a failure I am. I lost all confidence in myself because of these talks with my parents, because I feel that I am always to blame for every action or disharmony. 

While looking for work, all I ask is simply to be able to use the Internet freely on three days. Some days out of the week I get some freedom. And I cherish this privilege. But tonight, a night that I mentioned was one of those nights, without saying a word, they removed that privilege and just got rid of the modem. I mentioned to them before that we should have clarity in our expectations and clearly this wasn't clarified. I feel like they are imposing their decisions on my life and I find it extremely difficult to maintain my independence. 

I am looking for work. I want to just move out. I want my freedom. But I'm finding it difficult to live up to my parents expectations of me. I have trouble making my own decisions because I will never be able to please them. If I say something to them, they say I'm not listening or I'm just saying it as a cop out. I lost all credibility in their eyes and I feel like nothing I say matters. Nothing I do matters. It feels like I am the cause to all the problems and it would be easier if I wasn't here to cause it.

Two weeks in my boss gave me an assignment: basically migrating their sales database from Excel spreadsheets to a real honest-to-god one on AWS.

I have zero experience with databases.

I can run a query, but I know little to nothing about architecture, et al. I heard about MongoDB, and used that (for our purposes, a non relational database is okay). Over the past two weeks and half, I've struggled through deploying a prototype on my computer that in no way shape or form can be accessed by multiple people at once. I'm taking MongoDB University's DBA course to get a better understanding of this stuff, but they release material once a week. I've gone through all their released material at the moment.

My boss isn't happy about this. He wants results by the end of the week. I can't give it to him. I know this project will take a long time, and I like how I'm developing this skill, but I don't think I should be handling this project. Even though I've devoted a lot of time to it, I'm an amateur, and it's distracted me from my primary job by a lot. There's no one else in the office with tech experience, as our CTO is out of the country.

I worked as a student worker for minimum wage while in school. I tried finding a job before I graduated, no luck. After about 6 months of being turned down for every single job I could find, including gas station attendant, grocery store stocker I got a job with a truck driving company. I'm a truck driver but I don't like it. 

I have plenty of job offers to drive of any number of truck driving companies. But I still get told ""Not interested"" for anything thats office work, even a positions like part-time bank teller that pay $8 an hour. I've offered to volunteer for free at many places, got turned down. Tried to apply for internships, get turned down for all of them. 

Truck driving pays better than most service jobs. I want a middle class/white collar office job of some sort. 

I've tried job fairs ended up with ""your overqualified/underqualified"". I've tried temp places like Office Team, Robert Half, Accountemps, etc. I've been told I don't meet their requirements of any positions they have because of no previous office experience. I've gotten no help from temp places/job placement agencies.

I've tried call centers to get ""office"" experience but I get turned down for that as well. But thats not what I want. 

How can I get a ""good"" office job. Seriously, I don't know what else I can try. My college has just told me ""The economy sucks good luck"". 

Not that I have any offers, but I am not looking at quitting truck driving to go to a  part-time low wage call center/service job. I want a real middle class/white collar office job. 

I'm making better than most right now with the trucking and it will just go up from here. But I took the truck driving job as a ""temp"" thing while I tried to start my career after college. The problem is I am not getting anywhere and I am lost what I can do next.

I came in as a freshman with no previous background in programming or experience with circuits and any of their components. 

ECE 110  and 120 (back then it was 198JL) when I was a freshman at the time for me was extremely hard even though the concepts were the basics. At the time, I was trying really hard to scrape by and thankfully my lab partner was a really nice guy who would help me understand what was going on whenever I was confused.

However, one of my biggest issues coming into UIUC was that I found it really hard to ask people for help with homework or anything. I grew up with the idea that I had to be the one to figure things out, I had to stare at the problems that I'd be stuck on until I figured it out, and if I never figured it out then it was my fault. Everyone around me, to my knowledge, was a genius. They understood everything right away, and in my sophomore year, were already interning at Google or Microsoft or any place. Anyways...

In the Fall of my sophomore year, I took 210 and 220 (what was back then 198KL), and I ended up getting C's in those classes. The entire time I kept getting phone calls and texts from my parents to pick my shit up and stop wasting their money. I had a long discussion with them and they gave me an ultimatum during winter break: Get at least B's or we will pull you out of college. So I ended up retaking 210 and 220, where I was doing really well but still only managed to get B's in those classes.

This summer I did some research with a professor and took 313 expecting to go in and have it be a cinch, but I may not even pass it now...

My parents might pull me out of UIUC this coming fall semester and I'll losing any motivation to even continue college...

I want to do better, but I haven't even gotten an internship. My GPA is only a 2.3 and I feel it's way too low to even bother considering looking for them for the next summer. Is there even any point in me going back to UIUC?

I'm signed up for classes and I feel that I can really make a big turnaround this semester, but the possibility of not even having a chance to is very demoralizing...

I've been afraid to talk to people for fear of being judged as a lazy person who puts no effort into their work. Given, I may not put as much effort as I need to, but I certainly don't slack off.

Are there any words of advice that you guys have? Is there any light at the end of this tunnel? Should I just drop out of college? 

Everything is getting so...depressing. I'm not in any mental state of depression but I feel so down. I'm lost and I need any direction that may help."

It was going to be Android but it turned out that web development has a lot more job openings so I just learned it, made some hobby web projects to show off my skills, did a 3 months web dev internship, and tweaked my resume to make it seem like I have been a web developer since the beginning. So now I'm a web dev, and in fact I just got a full time job at it.

I'm worried about the future of this strategy though, because I'm under the impression that, even though its easier to get an entry level job at making websites, stuff like Java or .NET (large projects) gets better jobs on the long run (5+ years). 

Do you think I'm fucking up my career? And if so how do I switch? Thank you guys"

I'm asking because I'm still completely unsure of what career path I wish to take.  I interviewed for a sysadmin role and the interviewers mentioned I'd be more suited to a security research role which lead me to an interview with the Security Architecture Specialist at the company and now I'm less than a month away from starting my internship.  

Quick breakdown of the Sysadmin interview:

* General networking related questions
* OSI model questions, what does layer X do, how does it do it
* Route summarization questions
* If I send a 40gb file from this UK server to this US server, why would I be getting a slow transfer rate
* Several topology troubleshooting questions

This is all pretty basic stuff but then again, this is for an internship.  I guess interviewers have to bare in mind that as potential interns, we have no experience of using software/hardware on the industry level (universities are cheap!)

The other interview (with the Security Architecture Specialist) was based heavily around threat intelligence.  I talked a lot about exploits I've researched (poodle, heartbleed, logjam, you know, the big ones), spoke a lot about CTFs and I mentioned that I'm currently building up skills in malware analysis &amp; reverse engineering.  Oh and I had to give examples of and explain multiple different social engineering attacks &amp; phishing attacks.

I've rabbled on a bit here but can anybody figure out why they might have 'detected' that I'm better suited to a security role?  I mean, what could I have been missing that renders me unsuitable for a sysadmin position?"

I am a third year Biochemistry major, who has no aspirations of becoming a doctor. I have read all over the net about how un-useful a science major is in comparison to ENG or Compsci (both fields I am more than capable in but unfortunately did not enter).

I have considered some how salvaging my degree by combining with a Business degree or even working for two years and getting an MBA (mainly to do consulting). I enjoy leading teams but also love the technical stuff.

I am a good student (3.7, 3.9 GPA) so I am fairly capable. Currently I have almost no relevant job experience (only past 6 summers have been odd full-time summer jobs), but will be actively seeking internships this coming fall.

I know I am capable of any path and willing to put in more than enough work (be it maths, stats, engineering) but I want to find a career that fully engages me and my interests and is lucrative (100-300k some day). 

I am also HYPER success focused [Think about it about 8-12 hours out of the day]. For this reason, I thought entreprenuership would be a good path for me - atm however, my risk tolerance is low but i am working on it!

 Below I will list some of my interests and I hope you might be able to suggest some things.

- I LOVE technology, the tech world, computers anything related.

- I am highly interested in science, processes, concepts generally logical and intellectually stimulating things.
- I enjoy the technical side of things very much but also the people and relationship side too
- I am highly extroverted,however, have often sequestered this talent in terms of networking, joining clubs etc, due to false beliefs that GPA is everything.
- I enjoy making innovative ideas, designing things, thinking of new ways accomplish or connect something
- I am fairly eccentric but can flip personalities to fit the landscape (ie. professional vs. entertainer)
- I don't mind writing and sometimes enjoy the use of language if its with a topic I like
- I LOVE to present, talk to audiences about things I am knowledgeable about. - would love to act if there was more $$ in it
- I enjoy solving problems if I have the necessary tools and know how to do so.
- I enjoy learning new things and am hyper focused on personal development and success (audiobook addict).
- I am always planning, thinking 2-3 years in the future
- I have been told I am a natural leader and enjoy doing so (however, I am at fault as I have barely any existing Extra Curricular activities to show for - besides jobs perhaps)
- I enjoy talking to people, acquaintances and am generally fascinated by people.
- I strive to be more entrepreneurial (lots of innovative ideas) but think I often lack the risk tolerance and failure-immune characteristics to carry through.
- I don't mind being a loan wolf and am probably willing to put in 80 hours weeks if the job is engaging enough.

As an entry level, where do I stand?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3gw5c2/will_working_at_an_accounting_firm_limit_my/,"The story so far: (If irrelevant skip to next paragraph.)

I graduated back in May 2015 and have applied to around 20-30 job listings I found online (Indeed, LinkedIn, Dice, Glassdoor). Most of them were from some sort of staffing/recruiting company. I had 3 phone calls so far and no in-person interviews. One said I lacked experience and don't have a high enough GPA (2.9). Another (recruiter) hasn't contacted me for 2~ weeks. It was a contract job for a hedge fund so I assumed they found someone better or just don't want an inexperienced individual like myself. I didn't look through my school's career center because they were revamping their platform but it has recently been released and each day I see more listings so I'm optimistic that I may find something there as time goes on. Now what I noticed is there aren't many entry level jobs. Most jobs require professional or years of experience I don't have. I've heard both cases where HR don't know what they're looking for or they're there to weed out new graduates, whatever the case is it's made it more difficult. Of course I haven't talked to them yet and don't even know if I would be considered.

To the question at hand. 

My latest search has brought me to a posting by an accounting firm looking for a Junior Programmer. My worry is that this position is not a development role and might make it harder to find a software development job in the future. I don't want to make my options narrower. Here are some of the skills they ask for:

*Basic Java

*Microsoft SQL (How different is this from using MySQL?)

*Basic Programming experience possibly in .NET or Visual Basic (I don't know what is .NET, I will be searching up everything after this post but how hard would it be to get into these 2?)

*Familiar with Web Integrations or Cloud based systems (No idea what these are either.)

*Prefer someone who has worked with NetSuite CRM or similar CRM systems (I'm guessing these are business/accounting software)

I also heard of something called ERP Accounting System which I think deals with databases?

Will I learn valuable skills as a software developer from this job that can prepare me for future opportunities or should I keep looking? I'm expecting more entry level job postings as the semester begins, is that right? Say I did get an offer, should I take it or wait? I appreciate your time!

Finally I hope you can review my [resume](http://i.imgur.com/tErunn8.png), suggest some technology I can learn and perhaps rank me on how far off am I as an entry level developer? My lack of experience and poor choices in college (grade/lack of personal projects/no internship) is killing me. If anyone have tips or advice in looking for entry level positions fire away. I am only looking at NYC. NJ is too far from where I live and I don't plan to move. Once again thank you for your time!"

I ended up working for a significantly smaller finance firm as a developer this summer, and I did love the work, but I can't help but feel at least slightly discouraged when I witness the success of other people in my grade level who are also in CS. Several people I know got offers at large companies such as such as the big 4 and more for this summer (so basically as sophomores). They just seem to cruise through anything CS related and have such a wide expanse of programming knowledge that seems to have come out of nowhere. They are part of several computer science organizations, and seem to cruise through their classes. I am not nearly on par with these people and I feel like it's difficult to catch up to their ability. I guess I am not one of those people who can just let things go easily, or feel motivated to emulate other's success when it surpasses my own, but in the path to improve myself I need to be able to at least put the success of others out of my head to be able to function minimally.

I'm not interested in electrical engineering or hardware so I've been very conflicted. I was accepted into Purdue University's CpE program this summer. I've thought about transferring there and changing my major to Computer Science. I've talked with them about this and it is possible however I won't be able to start until Spring of 2016. It could also take 3 years to get the Computer Science degree at Purdue. My original graduation date was suppose to be May 2016 but because of internships and Co-Ops it has been pushed back a bit, which was fine to me but now I am concerned if I transfer to Purdue that I will be wasting time. I know Purdue isn't the prestigious school to get a CS degree but it beats the private engineering university which no longer offers CS anymore that I currently attend. 

I feel like I could succeed more in CS. I have a little over a 3.0 which kills me on the inside, I feel it may be due to my disinterest. I always told myself I would never change majors, I would just adapt but I don't want to waste my time. Am I setting myself up for failure where I am at? My dream is to work in California or NYC someday, I suppose like everyone else. Maybe not the top companies but surely somewhere would hire someone ambitious as me. Most of my developing experience comes from my own time and internships but I'm scared that won't be enough.

&amp;nbsp;

I’ve always had a passion for tinkering with things and seeing how they work. When I was in fifth grade, my partner and I won the science fair by creating a makeshift hovercraft with some wood, plastic, and a leaf blower. That moment sparked my interest into possibly pursuing engineering as a career. Throughout high school, I was exposed to the rapid increase in technology-integrated classrooms and also developed a passion for computers. However, I still wasn’t certain about where my future would take me. Before starting college, I juggled a couple different degree options: Graphic Design (I worked for a t-shirt design company for a bit), Computer Engineering, or Mechanical Engineering (I also loved cars). Due to my extreme loyalty for my soon-to-be alma mater with sports and their highly renowned Engineering and Design programs, I only went on one college visit. Now, I’d heard daunting stories about how many hours the Design program required and how difficult Engineering could be and I’ll be honest I was very nervous. I ended up choosing Computer Engineering because I felt that it gave me the best chance at a job after college and that the field had a strong future. When I arrived on campus, I felt confident I had made the right choice. My first class was Intro to Programming. Our professor asked the class “How many of you have had prior programming experience?” I was shocked to see more than half the class raise their hands. I immediately felt unprepared and behind my peers.

&amp;nbsp;

Fast-forward two months in the semester. It’s 8:00 PM on a Friday after our first big exam in my Intro to Programming class. I’m feeling defeated as I received my exam score: my first failure. Any confidence I once had no longer remained as I solemnly called my mom. I explained the situation to her and told her I was thinking about giving up; just driving back home this weekend and calling it quits. She encouraged me to continue working hard and ensured me I’d eventually see results (thanks mom). With that spark of positive motivation, I got back to it and continued studying. After the conclusion of my first semester, I was left with a lack-luster GPA and an enormous amount of anxiety heading into the spring semester. Still struggling, I managed to pull through with a better GPA by a hair. I wasn’t satisfied by any means and definitely didn’t have confidence in myself yet. However, things finally started to turn around.

&amp;nbsp;

At the start of the fall semester we had our bi-annual career fair. This is an event where prospective employers set up booths and allow students to talk with them and potentially receive interviews. I put on my brand new suit, masked on a veil of confidence, and walked into the event like I was a 4.0 student. Amazingly enough, I ended up receiving an interview for a Software Test Engineer Co-Op (internship + semester). Now at this point the company didn’t really matter, I was just fortunate to have an interview. I once again mustered up enough confidence to succeed in the interview and receive the opportunity for an on-site interview. Long story short, I was offered the job. My morale was at an all-time-high. It finally seemed like things were going my way, and that this crazy dream of mine just might be a reality. This surge of confidence showed itself in other areas as well. My performance in the classroom improved and my GPA reflected that. I made the Dean’s List twice in a row during my co-op period! I was finally achieving in and out of the classroom and feeling more comfortable with school.

&amp;nbsp;

During the last stretch of my time at my co-op, I started to apply for other positions for next summer. My vision was that this prior industry experience would help me land a position with more ease. With my newly found positive outlook on Engineering and my grades to reflect that, I was offered another internship position. I’d heard great things from my peers at college about this company and the industry it dealt with had always intrigued me. Regardless, before even starting this position I began looking for part-time work for the fall. With my increased industry experience and my improved interview skills I was able to land a third internship for the fall.

&amp;nbsp;

Here I sit typing this message with three internships under my belt and on the fast track to graduating on the Dean’s List. I hope you understand this isn’t to brag, but hopefully encourage some other students out there feeling overwhelmed and defeated. I’m sure you’ve heard it a thousand times, but hard work does eventually pay off. Keep studying and keep applying for jobs and you never know where you might end up.

&amp;nbsp;

3gx9df,6,2015-08-13,How I got three internships with no programming experience before college (x-post /r/cscareerquestions),lrobinson2011,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/3gx9df/how_i_got_three_internships_with_no_programming/,"Here's a little story about my college experience and hopefully some encouraging words for the other students here.

&amp;nbsp;

I’ve always had a passion for tinkering with things and seeing how they work. When I was in fifth grade, my partner and I won the science fair by creating a makeshift hovercraft with some wood, plastic, and a leaf blower. That moment sparked my interest into possibly pursuing engineering as a career. Throughout high school, I was exposed to the rapid increase in technology-integrated classrooms and also developed a passion for computers. However, I still wasn’t certain about where my future would take me. Before starting college, I juggled a couple different degree options: Graphic Design (I worked for a t-shirt design company for a bit), Computer Engineering, or Mechanical Engineering (I also loved cars). Due to my extreme loyalty for my soon-to-be alma mater with sports and their highly renowned Engineering and Design programs, I only went on one college visit. Now, I’d heard daunting stories about how many hours the Design program required and how difficult Engineering could be and I’ll be honest I was very nervous. I ended up choosing Computer Engineering because I felt that it gave me the best chance at a job after college and that the field had a strong future. When I arrived on campus, I felt confident I had made the right choice. My first class was Intro to Programming. Our professor asked the class “How many of you have had prior programming experience?” I was shocked to see more than half the class raise their hands. I immediately felt unprepared and behind my peers.

&amp;nbsp;

Fast-forward two months in the semester. It’s 8:00 PM on a Friday after our first big exam in my Intro to Programming class. I’m feeling defeated as I received my exam score: my first failure. Any confidence I once had no longer remained as I solemnly called my mom. I explained the situation to her and told her I was thinking about giving up; just driving back home this weekend and calling it quits. She encouraged me to continue working hard and ensured me I’d eventually see results (thanks mom). With that spark of positive motivation, I got back to it and continued studying. After the conclusion of my first semester, I was left with a lack-luster GPA and an enormous amount of anxiety heading into the spring semester. Still struggling, I managed to pull through with a better GPA by a hair. I wasn’t satisfied by any means and definitely didn’t have confidence in myself yet. However, things finally started to turn around.

&amp;nbsp;

At the start of the fall semester we had our bi-annual career fair. This is an event where prospective employers set up booths and allow students to talk with them and potentially receive interviews. I put on my brand new suit, masked on a veil of confidence, and walked into the event like I was a 4.0 student. Amazingly enough, I ended up receiving an interview for a Software Test Engineer Co-Op (internship + semester). Now at this point the company didn’t really matter, I was just fortunate to have an interview. I once again mustered up enough confidence to succeed in the interview and receive the opportunity for an on-site interview. Long story short, I was offered the job. My morale was at an all-time-high. It finally seemed like things were going my way, and that this crazy dream of mine just might be a reality. This surge of confidence showed itself in other areas as well. My performance in the classroom improved and my GPA reflected that. I made the Dean’s List twice in a row during my co-op period! I was finally achieving in and out of the classroom and feeling more comfortable with school.

&amp;nbsp;

During the last stretch of my time at my co-op, I started to apply for other positions for next summer. My vision was that this prior industry experience would help me land a position with more ease. With my newly found positive outlook on Engineering and my grades to reflect that, I was offered another internship position. I’d heard great things from my peers at college about this company and the industry it dealt with had always intrigued me. Regardless, before even starting this position I began looking for part-time work for the fall. With my increased industry experience and my improved interview skills I was able to land a third internship for the fall.

&amp;nbsp;

Here I sit typing this message with three internships under my belt and on the fast track to graduating on the Dean’s List. I hope you understand this isn’t to brag, but hopefully encourage some other students out there feeling overwhelmed and defeated. I’m sure you’ve heard it a thousand times, but hard work does eventually pay off. Keep studying and keep applying for jobs and you never know where you might end up.

&amp;nbsp;

3gxc36,10,2015-08-13,Stay at home or live off campus for uni??,cindycane,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/3gxc36/stay_at_home_or_live_off_campus_for_uni/,"So I'm going into my second year of uni, and I have a house near my university. However, my family home is within driving distance to my university, and my parents want me to commute during my 3rd &amp; 4th year since it'll be a lot cheaper for me in the long run.

Problem is, I don't think I can handle living at home with my mother. I love her, but she never has anything good to say about me. She makes me feel horrible about myself, and she stresses me out. She considers me incompetent of essentially everything, and it's frustrating because she won't let me grow and mature into an adult. I WILL be incompetent if I can't learn to do things on my own. 

Living at home would be so much cheaper. Right now, I'm in a tough spot because I'm considering medical school after my undergrad which means I need to be in an environment where I'm able to study and use my time properly. At the same time, I also crave freedom like every other teenager. I want to be able to manage my time myself, and be able to enjoy my undergrad experience while also working hard enough to get to where I want to be. 

If I were to live at home, I would save money, and I'd be able to spend the summer of 2nd year as a research intern, and the summer of 3rd year/4th year (depending on the results and timing) preparing for my MCAT. Living at home also means that my mom would expect me to be home early, and to never hang out with friends. But, if I plan to live off campus for my last two years, I'll have to work full time during the summer again, which means that I won't be able to get research done, and I probably won't be able to study for my MCAT. 

I'd like to work part time during the school year, but I'm worried about how hard my course load is going to be as I take more upper year courses. Additionally, I'm hoping to join the First Response Team at my university in addition to volunteering at the hospital in my hometown every other weekend. I don't want to do too many things at once, otherwise something will slip. 

Right now I'm just so stuck between the two. Any advice or comments from you guys who have experience with this? "

I don't want to brag, but I do have more than 4 internships in my belt, and had high hopes for my first job after graduation. 

Now, since this company is large, there are various internal job openings in the company. I've found some openings that seem to be a better fit for me. Do you think it would be unwise if I apply to these positions, considering I was just hired close to 3 months ago?

This whole thing comes up as I feel like I have been progressing and becoming a competent software developer from experiences in my past co-ops. 

Most day to day job as a sde intern were not necessary algorithmic heavy (although there are equally hards parts to it). But in my future co ops, I would love to get jobs that could possibly offer me challenging tasks that heavily require problem solving abilities. I must be very good at abstract thinking in order to get those jobs. I know ""real life"" applicable CS courses are important but good companies always train their engineers on specific technical areas they want to learn. I don't think the ""traditional"" problem solving abilities are easy to gain from regular SDE jobs, but from math courses like COs. 

I am not sure if I am thinking it right but I guess it's cool to hear you guys opinion on this. "
3gxtxn,1,2015-08-14,"Currently interning at a startup with no CTO, thoughts?",oaij,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3gxtxn/currently_interning_at_a_startup_with_no_cto/,"I'm now interning at a startup as a software engineer for about a few weeks now. The CTO was the one who interviewed me and on my first day of work, I found out that he had left the company due to differences with the founder. I joined the startup with hopes of learning from experienced engineers like the CTO, but the team is mostly entry-level, with one full-time (his first job) and two interns including me. 

Our current codebase is full of legacy code, ridden with a deprecated framework which ought to be upgraded long ago (but for some unknown reasons we didn't). Because our framework version is too old, we can't use most of the open-source libraries available. Our website is extremely not aesthetically pleasing, so much that it is a significant contributor to our user churn rate. 

To address these problems, the founder initiated a long-term plan to rewrite the codebase using the latest framework and also give the entire website a design overhaul.

The upside is that since there are only so few of us in the web development team (3 people), we get to own significant parts of the codebase during the rewrite. There are quite some exciting projects to be done - recommendation and chat systems etc. 

But the biggest downside is that since we don't have any senior engineer to be the technical lead, we have to figure out everything ourselves. Every merge request has to go through the full-time guy, who is constantly overworked as he is in charge of the code quality, deployment and basically everything related to our web app. There are rumors that he will be leaving after his company-sponsored visa expires.

The founder is a nice person, and is very hands-on. The first version of the web app is coded by him even though he has no CS background. Without a CTO, he's now the interim tech lead. Yet I feel that his technical guidance lacks nuance and is not future proof in terms of scalability etc, largely due to his non-engineering background.

As for me, I'm pretty much comfortable with learning things unsupervised. But there are more than one way to skin a cat. While I can hack together a solution quickly, I'm not sure whether its code quality is up to par or it is scalable in the future. I feel that my career trajectory could potentially be affected if I continue to stay on. The internship programme lasts for one year and I can have the opportunity to switch to another company. I have rejected an offer from a startup which is quite well-known in the developer community, with a strong engineer team as seen from their profiles. If my school allows me to change, I can contact them to ask if they still have a position available. However, I have to make a reasonable case for the change as my school considers a ""mismatch of expectations"" a low priority case.

I'm thus at a dilemma now whether to stay on or seek greener pastures. Advice would be greatly appreciated.

EDIT: 

I have to mention that we have a remote team in China, but I can hardly communicate with them due to time zone differences (we are based in Bay Area) and their poor English. There's also an iOS dev team (one senior and one junior), but I hardly interact with them because I'm doing web dev. The founder also roped in his brother for help (who is a senior software engineer, but not in web development, more like embedded devices). However he works from home mostly and on separate projects like taking care of AWS infrastructure and so forth. Even when taking them into account, there's no one senior who can guide me in my scope of work."

Hello,

I'm currently enrolled in a 9-month intensive mobile application development program focused on iOS. I'm looking to supplement what I'm currently learning with an internship in the field. We have done a number of small projects, but nothing to big. We've recreated social network layouts such as Twitter and Instagram as proof to our comfort with using Auto-Layout. We've created small games like Hangman and Tic-Tac-Toe. Most recent project has been a Reaction Timer App where the user tries to beat their score by clicking a button as soon as it turns green.

This unit, we're focused on creating an application implementing table views.

I would say I'm very comfortable with the using the documentation to find out how to solve most problems &amp; using the basic concepts of programmings (loops, conditionals, classes, functions).

If you or anyone you know of has any opportunities for those who are eager and willing to learn, please feel free to share my LinkedIn and send me a message. Thanks!"

This girl I really don't want screw up...Please take a look,BroShaw,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/3gzi55/a_chinese_high_school_dude_need_your_guys_help/,"Hey, I am a Chinese high school student and currently planning to apply college in US. This time I really need you guys! Here is my situation(All the dialogues are in Chinese actually). I studying in an educational organization to learn English(not school) in Beijing. I am kind of a good looking guy but I had really bad social skills, let alone how to talk to girls.

Even a lot of girls at my high school expressed they liked me once I talked to them, they instantly knew I am a beta male and you know what happened next :( And last month, this one girl came to the organization , just gorgeous. I mean, I have never seen a girl like her before. She is just super beautiful and white as hell and very in fashion you know(probably most beautiful girl I have met).

The funny thing is the first day she came, I was learning eye contact skills and training myself. So at that day, I kept strong eye contact(Which is extremely rare in China) with every one . And that was the first time I saw her, we were walking opposite direction in the hallway I just stare at her but she immediately stopped looking at me. And then I went back to teachers' office to study and She came into the room and it was the first time she came to that organization so a teacher asked her some questions like her grades which shocked me again. Based on her look I just thought maybe she was a bad student(In China good students are always nerds like with few exception). But She grades were unbelievable.l am talking about nearly perfect SAT SAT2. Needless to say, I just became extremely curious about that girl.

The interesting thing is (Don't know if I was overanalyzing) that Next day, This girl was a little bit attracted to me... Like the next day She choose to sit next me in the studying room(where people study on their own) and that day I forget my cellphone in classroom so I went to get it and She was there with a teacher(1 on 1 class) and she kept looking at me with a big smile her face.

next day In the studying room, when there were only two of us, deep breathe, laser eye contact,open body language, I striked up a conversation. She was typing on her laptop while watching an iPad. So I said ""wow, what you are doing, seems really cool"" She was like""ugh you know for the essay"".Everything went normal but I just so nervous ,next ,which I regret a lot, I subconciously stop eye contact and closed my body language. And I said""well so how was your activities, I found it hard to fill the 10 blanks when you apply "" At that time, I was expecting something like I don't have a lot like many other students(Chinese students usually do not do activities)

To my surprise, she proudly said I had 30 activities and showed me on the laptop. Funk that. My mind went to blank. I did not know what I was doing,and next, which I just wish had not happened, I said something like"" wow, looks like I need to work on myself, I Really need to, haha, anyway nice to meet you, I need to go, you know"" super uncomfortable And She definitely found how awkward I am and look at me with a impatience looking (may be not that and?) I went out and I did not asked her Wechat(like Chinese whatsapp).

The next day I went to do an internship in a company and She went to her home city(She came there to study and lived in a hotel). And now after one month,my internship end, I saw her again, but this time seems she has made friend was a nerd girl and they always went out together.how do I talked to her and any Advices what should I do?"

All that remains is the CEO, the VP, and the Secretary.  The VP is the CEO's wife, and she really does not like the director of engineering, who was my boss.  He was a genuinely good person, and I can say I've learned more than I ever have before because of him.

The problem I have is that when I was asked to fill out and print up my time card for the work done this week, I was not allowed to sign it.  I found this quite odd, and was not given a reason as to why.  The other forms I had to sign (notification of termination forms) stated that I would be payed for my work this week.  

I feel like them not allowing me to sign the time card is going to be someway for them to not have to pay us.  I will find out in two weeks, but I (and the rest of the interns) essentially got screwed out of two more weeks of pay.  We had only two more weeks left in our internship for the summer, and they terminated all of us today.  

So I'm worried about that, but I'm also wondering if since there was no warning about this, that if they technically have to give us two weeks pay.  I understand that it is general practice to pay your employees 2 weeks pay if you have to lay them off without notice, but I'm not even sure if this is a firing or a layoff.  

I guess, do you guys have any suggestions, or should I just wash my hands of the whole situation and never look back at it?"

UPDATED,officerpooper1,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3h17he/tifu_by_using_the_womens_restroom_at_the_office/,"This is happening still. I can't believe what I've done. This could be the worst mistake I've ever made, and I'm certain people are beginning to suspect me for it.

I've taken a poop, you see. But not just any poop. It was a massive dump; long and thick and smelling ripe as a sweaty shoe. In my college days it could constitute bragging. But not now. Oh God, not now.

Around 9 this morning, I walked in rightfully hungover. Last night I'd been out till last call with some buddies. Tuesday's are generally slow around the agency so I figured, what the hell, I'll party on with some old friends. Little did I know a swirling cocktail of beer and whiskey would build a brick in my stomach the size, color and texture of a football. A brick that could - in the very near future - get me fired.

Because in my hungover daze, I slipped into the women's restroom this morning. The bathroom's here only seat one at a time. So when my football of booze suddenly decided to evacuate, I sprinted to the men's room only to find it locked. But this football wouldn't wait - couldn't wait - so I slid into the vacant women's room and locked the door, sitting with only seconds to spare before a literal shitstorm murdered a toilet.

Feeling much better, I went back to my desk. No one saw me that I know of. I thought my problems were drifting away, headed toward the sewage plant.

But I was wrong in every way.

After around 10 minutes, ""Diane"" entered the women's room, only to hurl herself out within seconds. She was literally gagging. Others came to her side, only to be repulsed by the odor and scurry away. A secretary pulled ""Diane"" across the floor like a scene from Saving Private Ryan. A couple dudes went over, confident in their foul smell handling abilities, but they too doubled over. Even I went over and couldn't help but choke. This was the most repugnant smell I've encountered. After several minutes of discussion, accusation and brave investigation, it was determined the toilet was completely clogged and a destructive tsunami of poop covered the ladies room floor.

I made some simple, unassuming comments and returned to my desk. Now I type this to you. People from other offices are coming by to check out the smell. Maintenance was called. When maintenance couldn't handle it, they called a plumber. A plumber came in a suit and mask I can only describe as ""Andromeda Strain."" When a wet vac hose was turned on, an intern puked in a trash can. The toilet will have to be replaced. The current charge is already up to $530 - before labor and taxes.

People are talking about the poop all around me. Who could it be? Well it definitely wasn't a woman. What kind of person would do such a thing?

Perhaps I've been silent too long. I've been catching glares. From the corner of my vision I see people holding their eyes on me just a moment too long. ""Paul"" in sales has joked about going to IT for a security cam check. That idea is gaining traction. I'm not so sure he's joking anymore.

Reddit, I'm afraid.

TL;DR - I destroyed a women's restroom, and my co-workers are getting suspicious.

EDIT: I originally posted this on Tuesday. But it was removed thanks to some silly rules the good folks at TIFU use to monitor material. You'd think a sub with the word *fuck* in the title would be down for anything...

However the initial response to my misfortune has prompted me to update the lot of you. 

Soon after my post I went on a lunch meeting. Upon my return a handful of plumbers met me in the stairs on the way out. I asked them if there was any news on the toilet situation, and they regretfully informed me that the pipes across the whole floor will need replacing. 
""The pipes were old."" the guy said. ""It only took one person to cause a catastrophe.""

Back in the office, people had named the event, *The Reckoning.* I laughed at first until I realized we could now only use a toilet one floor above us, making for some awkward elevator talk. *Don't you work on six?* Yes. *Then why are you going to seven?* 

Wednesday some plumbers came and started operating. For a moment there was concern the floor below would soon be littered with leaking shit. 

For the moment, I have gotten away with toiletslaughter. However, I have visited a neighboring gas station twice to poop, as I feel I will never use the office bathrooms again.

Would it look weird if I went from being a full programmer at a mid-sized company to interning again? I had this crazy idea of accepting the position, interning for a year, and then possibly trying to intern at the other big companies too before I finish my M.S. in Computer Science. I currently make over $60,000 in the Midwest and have good benefits. Is having the big name (think Google, Quora, Dropbox, Facebook, Intel) on your resume worth leaving a role you recently accepted? I'm thinking that it is obvious that I should accept the position, do my time and enjoy a new state for a year, and then move on to another company or perhaps the same company as a full role afterwards. Or does it look bad to leave a full position before you were there a full year?

By the way, I'm still doing my undergrad. I have about two semesters left unless I cram everything into one giant semester. And then it will take me about two years to do my master's."

In the summer of 2014 I was luckily enough to get an internship at a local web development shop in Tampa, Fl. I knew I was being underpaid at $10/hr, but I also knew I was young and was more than happy for the experience. The summer went really well and they hired me on as a part time developer. I asked for a raise at that time and they came back with $15. While I still felt undervalued, it was an improvement in the right direction. The company works around my class schedule really well as well as it is really easy for me to get time off, overall a very flexible work environment. I enjoy my team a lot as we are a smaller division of the company creating the next generation of the company's main product. We are creating a web application that specializes in finance solutions for commerce companies. My responsibilities are full stack with a focus on the front end as I mainly work in html, css, and javascript while heavily using the DOJO toolkit. I have also touched numerous backend services such as REST endpoints, object creation, and implementing new libraries and tools into our server. I am definitely a vital part of the team and routinely act as an adviser to other members in solving problems, answering code related questions and so on. A month or so ago I asked for another raise (about a year after the last one) to $25/hr. I believe that this is a fair market rate for my skill set. I stated that I believed that for my skills and value to the team that I deserve to be compensated more appropriately. About a month after numerous internal discussions they finally came back to me and said that the best they could do was $20/hr and that it was primarily limited by my part time schedule (I work about 25/hrs a week during the school year). While disappointing I still feel it is an improvement, however I am worried that I am setting myself up in a trap working for the same company all during my college years. I am afraid that having this single experience will hold me back when applying for full time positions as graduation unless I stay with this company. So reddit, here is my dilemma: Do I keep working at this company seeing how it is good experience while still in undergrad? I am not sure of the market for a part time dev without a degree, though I know I have the skills to help out any company. Also, next summer I am looking to get a more 'name brand' internship out of state and will most definitely be applying to the Big 4 type companies to boost my resume. 

Thoughts, Reddit?"

I did the paper job for free but expirience was amazing. But i saw that it isnt the job i want to do. Now i am 17 and thinking about what i will do after high school and i am starting to get passionate about programming again but it is hard for me to start again. I feel that right now i could be really good. I know that i should start now rather than never but i cant get the thoughts out of my head of being so far behind other kids. I understand that programming is not about knowing programming language but thinking like programmer. Programming is also not about being the best,i can learn from thouse kids who are better than me. But i feel some feer picking up coding again,i feel pretty interesting.
Can you help me overcome my fear?

3h3y0o,1,2015-08-15,Is pidgeonholing a legitimate concern for industry work?,saltx,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3h3y0o/is_pidgeonholing_a_legitimate_concern_for/,"I just finished an internship with a mobile development company, and received an offer at the end of it. I have problems with the company and they all relate to the level of challenge I found with mobile development. I went in thinking that this was something I was very good at and could really pursue and grow my skills. I came out thinking that the company (and I assume others because of the nature of the inudstry) hires for volume not talent, because mobile development is 'easy'. Because of this, the office is not full of very intellectual people, rather people who know their iOS and Android very well.

I have one year left in school. For the last two and a half years I've been struggling with a pretty severe mental health issue that I really believe held me back on a lot of fronts: socially, academically, and professionally. I am just now emerging from this issue with the help of counseling, meditation, exercise, and practicing communication. That isn't necessarily important, but what is important is that my grades were shot a bit. I have a 2.9 GPA in my major (math and computer science) and a 3.2 GPA overall at the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana.

I want to work in something more challenging, something that will surround me with other curious people and really push my intellect. I really enjoyed the material in my algorithms class, and am taking the follow up class this next semester. I want to pursue computational theory, and other maths. Online it seems like algorithmic trading is a great field to go into for quantitative analysis, and so is data mining and some others. However, it seems like those fields are out of reach for me, given my year in school and my grades, despite interest and the amount of time it took me to figure out where I wanted to be.

So I understand that maybe I won't be able to jump into a very interesting and analytic field of computer science right away, and in searching for jobs I may need to overcome a sub par GPA. I'm hoping a letter of recommendation will help with this, a bit.

My question is, worst case scenario, will going to work for a mobile consulting firm make my resume uninteresting to a company who is looking for more formal computer scientists and quantitative analysts? If I decide I want to go to grad school, will it be possible?

I'm just trying to get past the stress of having to catch up after a tough streak, and I don't know how or what to expect."

Current position:

I've recently started having (well I've had them for a while...)  some philosophical problems. 

I came to CS because I wanted to do cool things which required thinking and problem solving while being with smart people. And its mostly been good: I've enjoyed some classes such as algorithms etc., a few programing competitions (even won one!) even more and my own projects (mostly repurposing things for unintended uses i.e. using laptop webcams as ambient light sensors) most of all. 

Now, nearing the end of college, more than half of my class want to go to grad school. The rest are mostly looking for jobs. I would prefer not going to grad school atm because 1- I've mostly been told a Masters won't teach me much and 2- I don't think life in academia is for me (spent my whole life in schools thus far after all). So that leaves finding a job.

The problem is that most CS jobs in smaller companies (in my part of the world at least) require doing predominantly either of two things: web development and/or mobile development. Now, I know both fairly well, and I've even done a short internship at a mobile dev firm. What I understand is that there isn't too much problem solving or intellectual abilities involved; and indeed while at the firm I felt most of the people there weren't too intellectual but rather just good at doing the Android/iOS thing over and over again. I've had similar experience doing backend work with Rails; once you understand it its mostly applying the same solutions to most sites you develop. This sort of 'dead end' work scares me and I feel I'll just stagnate there. I'm sure not all software development is like this, people working over at Facebook and Microsoft must be doing some great work, but a cursory look at StackOverFlow careers seems to indicate that most jobs are indeed of this web/mobile type.

What I'm asking is: am I exaggerating this? What other jobs are there in computer science/software engineering that require significant problem solving and improvisation (algorithmic and otherwise)? Other than the 'Big 4' type companies? And lastly, are my assumptions about grad school correct?"

Hi there! So as the title says I am an undergrad studying computer science. I'm just starting my Jr year and have started to/am going to apply to as many internships as possible to try and land a good one for next Summer. I do not attend a target/top CS school so I want to make sure my own skills and my resume make me an attractive candidate for internships that are very competitive.

Unfortunately, I don't have a ton of experience internship wise and the bit of experience I have outside of my tutoring jobs involves front-end web development which I **DO NOT** want to pursue. However, because it is experience I have it on my resume.

I'm currently working on a small python project that I hope to complete and have on Github within the next 2 weeks and I have been practicing and will continue to practice a lot of technical questions/white board problem solving etc. I plan on applying to the typical big 4 tech companies as well as other places such as non-big 4 tech companies and interesting start-ups that I feel will give me the experience I'm looking for to gain experience as a software developer/engineer. 

I'd love any tips to improve my resume but also on how to get the point across during an interview when I get asked about web dev that I am interested in being a software developer and not doing anything highly web related unless it's back-end without seeming like I'm being really weird/picky. Ideally I'd be doing anything but pure web dev.

3h4rol,2,2015-08-15,Is doing a Master's degree worth it?,livesareatstake,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/3h4rol/is_doing_a_masters_degree_worth_it/,"I've asked this question on a couple of other subreddits but I got pretty contradictory answers to it. I just now found this subreddit, so I hope you don't mind if I ask here, too.

I've been dwelling on this topic a lot lately, as I'm starting my last semester of Computer Engineering in September. Eventually, I want to work in IT security, with the main goal of becoming a pentester. And one thing I'm sure of is that I don't want to get into academics.

People I've talked to about it have differing opinions. I have a couple of professors who always state that your formal education in IT doesn't matter, the only thing that matters is what you can do. There are also some who recommend pursuing a Master's degree as you can dive into the topics more, and get a more detailed perspective on them.

From what I've seen in previous posts about this topic, the consensus seems to be that real word experience&gt;certifications&gt;Master's degree. However, I still want to ask you for your advice because my case is a little different. 

For one, I live in Europe and I don't have to worry about tuition, which seems to be the biggest reason why people don't recommend doing it: it wouldn't be worth paying that much for. On the other hand, some of the certs I see recommended around here are either unavailable here or way too expensive for me. The IT security Master's degree I'm looking at seems to have a pretty interesting curriculum, it's not one of those management oriented degrees. It would also be at one of my country's most respected universities, which has great connections with big tech companies and has pretty good internship programs. The university I'm attending right now isn't that well regarded. I mean, it's not horrible, but graduates form the other university generally are much better sought after on the job market. Also, from what I know, having a Master's degree makes it easier to get a job abroad, which I eventually want to do.

On the other hand, there are a couple of up and coming tech firms in my area that are growing rapidly right now, and there aren't enough graduates for them to hire. I'm pretty sure I'd be able to find a junior level job at one of them pretty soon after I graduate. I already had an opportunity to go work for one of them but it would have been a full time job, so I had to turn it down. They also send their employees on day release courses to get certs regularly, which would be a good way to obtain some necessary certs for free. I'm also worried that their expansion will slow down by the time I would be done with my Master's and it would be harder to get a job.

I really can't make up my mind. As far as I know, after finishing a Master's degree with close to zero professional experience, I'd be eligible for the same junior level positions I'm gonna be eligible for after finishing my Bachelor's, and the 2 year work experience would look better on my resumé than a Master's with no experience. Also, not sure if this is a thing anywhere else, but here you have to be paid a certain wage for a certain level of education and you can become overqualified for jobs as companies look for the people who they can get away with paying the least to. I've heard of people taking their degrees off of their resumés for this reason, although not in the tech industry.

And while I could do the Master's tuition free, I'd still have to move to the city the university is in, which would cost a lot, and I'm honestly not doing that good money-wise. If I got accepted to a dorm it wouldn't be a worry because that's much less expensive but I can't really bank on that. "

I [27M] had felt things with her [25F, girlfriend] but we were just dating as friends. I then suddenly lost my mom to cancer and told her everything, she supported me a lot.

I was saying my speech at my mother's funeral, but couldn't continue, looked up in the church and saw like my mother's smile and my girlfriends smile (who wasn't my girlfriend but was becoming my best friend), I took this as approval from my mother and promised that I would win her.

Shortly after I get back to the country I plan to meet her, and said I will kiss her and never give up. She presented a never give up postcard that she saw at work in the hotel to me... We then walked through a forest and I finally kissed her by a river, hidden away. It felt amazing. We kept going out for several months until she invited me to her own country to meet her family. I learned her own language so I could communicate with her family. We stayed at her grandma's place (as her grandma went to stay elsewhere), we had a very romantic dinner and in general I wasn't thinking to have sex with her because I wanted to wait until marriage. But we had amazing sex. This continued.

I had to go back to my own country as my internship was coming to an end and so I can bought like a promise ring and promised I would never leave her, that I wanted only her.

I finish my degree and come back to the country where she was and find a job and apartment, she moves in. Things are great, but she missed out on a couple exams for her studies and had to change to another degree (that fits her better), I took this as my fault because we spent a lot of time together and she didn't study as much. So I start to get into the habit of standing back and not surprising her all the time with meals out or visiting different places... We did but mostly to visit family. Anyway, several months back she wanted to move onto the next step.

I wanted it but had planned after she at least has a Bachelors so that she has a Base. But I had a ring of my mother's, that I already showed to her. However when I asked my dad, he said he didn't know what it was for and from where... We planned a weekend vacation. I booked a nice fancy hotel, I had the ring, but it's not a diamond and to me feels plastic, it's a cheap gold silver ring. At the restaurant, my jacket gets checked in and I didn't know how to get the box out of my pocket without people seeing. We end up sitting in front of reception area so girlfriend would see if I go and take my jacket. Finally I kept thinking what the ring is, and feared it was from someone other than my dad... Decided to save up 6 months. However during this time, girlfriend was stressed and shouting a lot, I assumed it was mostly because we had bed bugs, her mother broke her leg, she had lots of exams, she was trying to find work for her family too and for her sister...

I tried to help, massage all the time, she was smiling and happy. But I didn't see the signs. I was too busy with work and always thinking about my projects (several people fired at work, so I had a lot more work and stress).

Anyway, she moved to her parents a couple months ago. She wants distance, says she is better away.

I say that I love her so much, would kill myself if I went with another, would kill myself if she went with another. She says she is happier but I am much worse...

Nothing but the thought of seeing her makes me smile. I already done many things in life, experienced living in different countries. Have ""friends"" around the world. But all I want is her and her family, and to start a family. I don't want anything else anymore.

I told her I would kill myself so she can be free, because I will always be near and make sure no one comes closer to her... But saying that makes it worse for her, she can't breath.

But I am serious, either we are happily married, or I take my life... I know that we would be happy, because every time we are together, we talk and do things she likes and never argued before this. We were so close, always holding each other while walking, always looking into each other's eyes.

She says it's childish and she wants a man, but I just try to get her to understand that it is only her that I will ever have."

I really couldn't find anything on the course, so I wanted to ask some questions regarding the class. 
Has anyone taken this class? How was it? Did it teach you useful skills that you might need in an internship/job? 
Do you use any software or programs in the class? Are there any cool,interesting projects (possibly ones you could add on a resume)?


If you have anything to share about the class at all, it would help me greatly! :- )

**And now my questions:**

1. How much time should i spend a day maximum and minimum on learning a programming language? I'm visiting school and want to focus on that a lot in the upcoming year of school.

2. I feel like i'm quickly distracted or not motivated. What can you do against that? (i would love to already know how to code but i know that it's going to take some time)

They're nothing revolutionary in form or in function, but they took some time to make and I think the experience taught me a lot. During production, I didn't use version control; there may be some bugs with the code, and it may not be commented very well. Despite this, is it worth including these on a resume, keeping in mind that at the moment, I have nothing else?

I'll also have my math done up to Calculus 2. Not sure if that matters. 

Anyway I was wondering if any of you had ever done this internship or heard of it. Was it a good opportunity and did you learn a lot from it? How hard was it to get in? Does it seem like I'll have a harder time getting in since I'm from a community college? What sort of things do they look for on the resume? Thanks in advance.

A little backstory, I applied and got into graduate school of my choice.  It was amazing.  I wanted to be on the ball with absolutely everything making sure I did not miss any deadlines.  One of the requirements of the graduate program is to maintain an internship for 16 hours a week for the full year to supplement the curriculum.  The school I'll be attending recommends us to internships and then we have to contact the agencies ourselves and attempt to arrange an interview.

I followed up with one of the recommended agencies, scheduled the interview, attended the interview, and within the hour, I got contacted back from them via email that the internship was mine if I was interested in what I would be doing for them.  It seemed like a perfect fit for me, and seemed like an amazing opportunity to network, grow, and challenge myself as an individual, so I responded back accepting.  I received an email back saying they need some basic information about myself and that if interested, I could attend a welcoming pot luck for all new volunteers and interns on 7/17/2015.  I RSVP'd saying that I couldn't wait to get started and meet my fellow coworkers.  I should also say that, in my defense, I was in the process of leaving my full time job to go back to school so I was wrapping up a lot of things on this end as well as making sure I was enrolled in all the classes I needed to be in and have everything I needed for the school.  It was going to be a large adjustment going back to school after working full time.  So I wrote in my planner and on my google calendar, for August 17th 2015, that I had a welcoming potluck to attend for the internship.  It worked out well because I had something at the college I'll be attending August 18th, it seemed intended and planned.

Well fast forward to today when I wake up, check for the email with the office information.  I read the email, see which office I need to be at and at what time.  I notice the date read 7/17/2015.  For whatever reason, this morning, it seemed off.  It clicked, July is the 7th month, not August.  I got that pit in my stomach feeling near immediately.  I quickly write an apologetic email explaining the issue and now have waited all day, but unfortunately have not gotten a response.  I am hoping to hear back tomorrow, during the actual work week, and that I will be able to make up for anything that I may have missed.

TL:DR:  Double check dates when people ask if you can attend things especially if they can the first impression you give people."
3h9opz,2,2015-08-16,C++ vs C# for interviews,BalianCPP,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3h9opz/c_vs_c_for_interviews/,"I have been hearing two conflicting opinions on selecting a language for interviews.

1) Pick C, C++, or Java. I have read in a few places that this instruction comes direct from some companies.

2) Companies don't care what language you use.

I would rather use C# for the same reason one would choose java, but if C++ is a way better idea I have time to freshen up. This is for internships, so I'm mostly concerned with the basics (not preparing for super language specific problems).

If I am asked to pick C, C++, or Java is it going to look really bad if I ask to use C#? Is practicing my algorithms from here on with C++ my best bet?

3h9xe3,2,2015-08-16,The Cabin,brduk,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3h9xe3/the_cabin/,"	Anna and I finally had a good day; a day without fighting, a day without work.  We had a day in which all we did was drink expensive beer by the lake and have sex in the cabin, our small one-room cabin.  It was the smallest cabin on the lake.  It was the runt of the litter, but it was ours.  We had recently inherited it from Anna’s grandparents.  Perhaps them passing away was what caused all the fights… It doesn’t matter now.  We lay there together in our underwear, happy and confident that we were going to make it through all our issues.
	The lake was isolated; it was on a small lake in the middle of North Dakota.  The small community that claimed this lake couldn’t be more alone.  It was nice.  It was peaceful.  We went there to escape, to relax.  And boy did I relax.  I hadn’t had a harder month at the office in the two years I had been there, not even during my internship.  With the half gallon of beer in my stomach and the sexual relief that I hadn’t felt in so long I felt more relaxed than I ever could have.  Babies don’t sleep this well…

BANG!!

Good God what was that? My eyes still closed but my mind was immediately awoken by a crash, like something was hitting a wall.  BANG! Another one? Only… Louder? Harder?  BANG … BANG…. BANG… BANG BANG BANG BANG!!! What the hell? Was the wind blowing yard furniture against the outside of our cabin? BANG BANG “LET US IN!!!” 

WHAT?!

I open my eyes.  I couldn’t even describe it.  The blinds are shut but I can see the shadows.  People surround the entire cabin.  They’re smacking the walls, they’re screaming at us.  “LET US THE FUCK IN WE KNOW YOU’VE GOT IT” What the hell could I have?! “GIVE IT TO US!!” I recognize the voices! It’s the voices of our neighbors. All of them.  What do they want?! “What do you want?!” I scream back.  “YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT” “LET US THE FUCK IN” “GIVE IT TO US” “YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE. WE WANT IT. WE NEED IT” I panic.  I have no idea what they’re talking about. I have no idea what they want.

I nudge Anna. Sound never wakes her. Being moved wakes her, always the heavy sleeper.  “ANNA WAKE THE HELL UP SOMETHINGS GOING ON” she moans and groans, how she isn’t hearing this is beyond me.  

Finally she wakes up.  She doesn’t look at me.  She looks out the window immediately and sees the shadows banging and smashing and trying to pry their way into the cabin.  

Dear God we’re going to get killed.

“LET US THE FUCK IN”
“GIVE IT TO US!!!”
“WE WANT IT NOW!!!”

Anna suddenly turns to me.  “What the hell is going…” She looks at me.  I’ve never seen the color fade from someone’s face faster.  She goes white immediately at the sight of my face.  But then

Something changes.  Her eyes. They aren’t hers anymore.  They turn black. 
She starts screaming “GIVE IT TO ME!!! FUCKING GIVE IT TO ME” 

I back away.  This isn’t Anna.  “WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?! WHAT DO I HAVE?!”
“YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU HAVE!! I WANT IT NOW” The neighbors are still smacking the walls trying to get in.  There’s more of them now, at least 100.  Dear God.  

“LET US IN”
“GIVE IT TO US”
“I WANT IT”

Anna stands up on the bed as if she’s about to jump on me.  I back out until I fall out of bed.  She lands on me.  I feel her grip my throat.  I didn’t know her small figure was capable of causing so much pain.  It feels like a noose around my neck.  I kick her off.  I would never hurt her but I panicked…. And this isn’t Anna.  This is something else.

“GIVE US WHAT WE WANT”
“WE’RE GOING TO GET IT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER”

Anna’s head smacked the bedpost.  She’s unconscious on the floor.  I crawl backwards until I hit the wardrobe.  Surrounded.  CRASH! I see a hand finally break its way into the window on the door and reach the knob.  

They’re about to get in.  They’re going to get what they want… but I have no idea what it is.

I am currently about to enter my senior year of college and I have done 2 internships at a very reputable fortune 500 company. They offered me a position, in downtown San Francisco starting at 85k, 10k signing, and 10k equity vested over 3 years. 

They have a decent relocation package that would basically cover my airfare and shipping out a car. On top of all that i've made a name for myself at this company, and also have the 100% backing/trust of a VP. 



The other offer is with a fortune 500 tech company that is world renowned and has been voted number 1 place to work almost every year for the past 10 years. (Take a guess) 

They have offered me a very entry level basically tech support position that could blossom into another real better position with enough networking/hard work (which i'm confident I can do). However, another thing to keep in mind is that this is a 2 year fixed term employment. 

They are offering me 50k with a 5k raise for the second year with full benefits of the company (free food, health care, dental, etc.)



The thing is, the lower offer is my dream company (as many people my age) and I have always wanted to work there. However, I really like the first company also and wouldn't mind living in SF at the ripe age of 21 making that much. Not to mention all the help my VP boss would give me moving up the ranks.

SO essentially this is the classic, take the money and good starting point or try for a fresh start (keep in contact with people at the old job for a fall back plan) and try to ride the opportunity train to something I probably couldn't even imagine. 

**TL;DR** Two big companies want me, one is a great job that pays well. The other is my dream company but not my dream job , but there is a lot of room for opportunity/growth.

I've formally taken Calc 1 and 2, Statistics, graduate level statistical analysis for public policy, Linear Algebra, and Discrete Math (twice now). I'd really like to learn/become familiar with Vector/Multivariable Calculus and Differential Equations because that usually rounds out the mathematics training all engineering students get, but at the same time, the only arguments I ever read concerning such classes is that it's beneficial to Computer Science students to build mathematical maturity and logical thinking abilities. I think I possess enough of those two characteristics if that's mostly what I'll gain as a computer science student in learning those subjects in the near term. 

The other option would be working my way through Rosen's Discrete Math textbook as there appears to be a lot of interesting material in there that we did not cover in our CS225 course, and I do feel I'll gain more applicable skills in the short term in doing so.

What's anyone else's take on this? Learn more Discrete Math as I can handle on my own? How much math outside of Discrete Math really is applicable in our other quantitative-leaning courses (I'm thinking Data Structures and Algorithms at the least)? What about in internships or anything anyone's observed in industry? I'd love to hear other thoughts as I'm really curious in relation between computer science and mathematics, and how much really is sufficient for most computer scientists (not thinking about PhDs, as I think that answer would be as much as possible). 

I always get the sense that the consensus is that mathematical ability is what differentiates the great computer scientist from the good, but I have a hard time believing that on face value because taken to the extreme, we'd all study mathematics then, and mathematicians would be the best computer scientists. I was trained as an economist, and believe in the law of diminishing marginal returns, so this would suggest that there is a limit to which the time spent learning more and more mathematics generates less and less benefit for the computer scientist. I always wonder what that limit is....and where that time spent could have been devoted to more pertinent knowledge, which would generate the most benefit in that time spent. "

3hbzpy,1,2015-08-17,What Happened at Watkins Landing,badabingbadabaam,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3hbzpy/what_happened_at_watkins_landing/,"You know, it's funny how life can take a sudden turn, just BAM outta nowhere. You think it's going to be a nice, calm night on the river, the calm before college starts and summer is officially over, and then a minute later, you literally start looking around for cameras, because obviously what is happening isn't *real life* and you're probably on some kind of TV show. And you hope beyond hope you see them soon, because the terror you feel at realizing this is the world you live in is all-encompassing and paralyzing and utterly, utterly heartbreaking.

I'm a long-time lurker here at NoSleep and though I got plenty of thrills from reading all of the wonderful posts here, I didn't ever foresee myself posting very much; life in the counties surrounding Richmond isn't very exciting, suffice to say. But then - last night happened. 

Now, let me set the stage. Deep in Chesterfield County, Virginia, there's a small boat ramp in the middle of the boonies called [Watkins' Landing](http://d38i5o6rgl7rvc.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/preview_watkins_large.jpg). You can look it up on Google Earth if you want. The river by Watkins is rather narrow, so during high tide, or after the snows have melted, or after a particularly torrential summer storm, the ramp gets entirely submerged in the torrent. As such, it hasn't been the most well-equipped ramp in the county. It has no electricity, unlike other boat ramps and marinas, so if you're unfortunate enough to be in the water in the dark, you have to keep your eyes peeled for the break in the treeline that is Watkins Landing, otherwise it's deceptively easy to zoom by it and end up in rocky shallows upriver. Another drawback to Watkins is that only a certain size of boat can be launched on it. Jetskis, 17-footers, and flat fishing boats are no problem, but larger boats like [pontoons](https://discoverboating.s3.amazonaws.com/boat-selector/boat-details/29/pontoon-boats-image-01.jpg) have no chance in hell. This becomes very important later.

I've sort of grown up on the water - boating every weekend in the summer, the sunburns, the water sports, the boat mishaps and yes, even rowing against the current because the damn boat just wouldn't start. If you'd asked me yesterday, I wouldn't have called being in the river after dark 'unfortunate' in the slightest; in fact, there's an unparalleled charm in cruising along the river at night, buoyed in your personal halo of light, the stars twinkling above and the water gently lapping at the sides of the boat below. 

It was my last weekend before college began full-force and I wanted to bid a small farewell to the carefree, waterlogged days of summer. My plan was to get to Watkins after dinner with a couple of sodas and snacks and just unwind, my legs hanging off the ramp in the water, surrounded by the drone of cicadas and crickets and whatever other noisy critters inhabit riverbanks. My girlfriend Willa was more than happy to come along and, in short, it was shaping up to be a perfect Sunday evening. 

The abnormalities began around 10pm that night. Most boating traffic is gone by 8pm, maximum, so we had the ramp and the river all to ourselves. Having long finished our snacks, we were lying down on the ramp, looking at the stars and the occasional plane lighting up the sky, and talking about the immediate future. Willa was a tiny, strong-headed, and big-hearted dreamer who was well into her veterinary medicine program; her classes start the week after and that night was our last weekend on the river together before she returned next summer. She was telling me about her plans after, her idea to intern in Yada Yada clinic and shadow Blankity Blank professor of hers, and I was staring at her arms above me, drinking in the sound of her voice, realizing just how much I was going to miss it. I think *because* I was so focused on her voice that I noticed how *loud* it seemed all of a sudden. Something was off. 

""Willa, wait."" I sat up, dusting off my cap.

""What is it?"" She hated to be interrupted. 

I held up a finger, looking around. It took a minute for the realization to sink in, mostly because it had for so long been relegated as background noise. The hum of the river was gone. All the cicadas and crickets had fallen silent; the constant drone of insects that signaled 'everything's okay' had disappeared, leaving behind a silence that was chillingly eerie. I could hear my own breathing. 

""Why is it so quiet?"" Willa looked around worriedly. ""Oh my god, do you think it's a bear?"" Her hand had a vise-like grip on my arm. Ever since we'd seen a large fish carcass, gutted and half-eaten on the riverbank a few years ago, she'd been convinced there was a rogue bear prowling around. Now that I look back on it, I wish it had been. I wish a bear had somehow bumbled into the area and chased us to our car and we'd tumbled into bed breathless, laughing, and that would have been that. I wish it was just a bear. 

The next sound we heard was the low hum of a boat, getting closer. Now, any boater will tell you that different boats make different sounds; fishing boats are higher pitched, mostly because their engines are entirely outboard and skim along the water. 17-footers and cuddy cabin boats have a lower register but still retain a keening whine. Larger boats have a deeper thrum, a low growl that is felt more in the water than heard in the air. Having grown up on the water all my life, I could easily tell the difference, even though there was no boat in sight. It was a larger boat coming closer, of that I was sure. In the disturbing silence, I could almost hear the water being cut, the wake being created, the whisper of the boat gliding closer and closer. A pontoon came into sight, although from our vantage point, all Willa and I could see was a dark rectangular silhouette. Boating regulations require boats to have lights on after dark, so the blackness on this boat was both suspicious and worrisome. It had to be deliberate. 

At that moment, I felt, very very strongly, that I did not want to be seen by the people on that boat. The wrongness of the whole scene was gnawing at me and my instincts were screaming to get cover. I squeezed Willa's hand and motioned to her. Slowly, we scooted backward until we were off the ramp and then nestled ourselves halfway behind a tree. In the darkness of the treeline, we were undetectable unless someone specifically shone a torch in our direction. 

At that moment, the engine shut and we heard the tell-tale *plop* of an anchor being lowered into the water. There was some whispering among the people on board and the lights flickered on inside the boat, neon blue, which allowed us our first glimpse at the people. Willa gasped quietly. There were about ten people on board, all wearing some sort of long cloaks, with hoods drawn so that their faces were entirely in shadow. It honestly looked like a Grim Reaper get-together - you understand? Long, drooping cloaks and pointy hoods, all dark and ominous. 

One of the figures stooped and the others joined hands. The next sound to cut the night air was a plaintive bark, a crazed bark, some dog just barking and barking like there was no tomorrow. Both Willa and I have had dogs since childhood and we know what kind of bark is the kind you don't want to hear and this one was exactly that. You could tell, this dog was fucking *scared*. A low hum emanated across the water and at first, I was unsure about the source of the sound until I realized that those people were chanting. It chilled me to the bone, that chant; I wish I could describe it. There was no musical inflection, just a drone of words that rose and fell, rose and fell, with the dog's frightened barking incessant in the background. 

After a minute or two, the chanting immediately stopped while the frenzied barking was at a fever pitch. Beside me, I could hear Willa crying. There was a silvery sound, like a knife being sharpened, and then the dog emitted a high pitched yelp. God, that yelp. The chanting started again, this time louder, and once again, when it ended, the dog yelped again. 

After the third time, the dog was constantly yelping. You know that yip yip yip a dog makes, when it's hurt? A high pitched whine, again and again. I could feel tears on my cheeks. Every part of my body wanted to go and rescue that dog, lost in the middle of a fucking Dementor circle, to make that yelping stop. Willa had one hand on her mouth, trying to quieten her sobs. The chanting became louder and louder and the yelping rose into a frenzy - just a constant, screaming *yip yip yip* until, all of a sudden, it was cut short. God, that silence. I had never thought silence could be so oppressing, so horrifying. It felt like we were in a suspended state; not a leaf moved, no breeze swept up the river, not a star twinkled. 

A plane droned overhead and I realized I'd been holding my breath. I put my arm around Willa's shaking form and pulled her closer. The hooded figures bent down and pulled a limp, furry bundle, legs akimbo, to the edge of the boat. One of them kicked it and the dog slipped off the edge into the water, leaving behind a slick liquid trail. All of a sudden, life started again - the insect hum was back, a slight breeze cooled the sweat on my forehead, and we could hear the water lapping against the ramp and boat dock. The lights in the pontoon boat cut off, the engine started, and just like that, the boat was going away, gliding downstream.

I don't remember what we did next. I don't remember the mad dash to our car or the drive back home. I just remember hugging my dog and crying, I remember Willa asking me to take her home, I remember laying awake in bed, staring at the ceiling, wondering what other secrets the James River was hiding, mourning the loss of Watkins Landing as I had known it. I don't know who those people are and I don't know what the hell's going on. I just know that there are truly terrifying, horrific things happening out there and it can happen even in the most calm, simple places. "
3hbzw1,0,2015-08-17,My job keeps giving me unfair title changes with unfair raises. What can I do?,nightwolf92,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3hbzw1/my_job_keeps_giving_me_unfair_title_changes_with/,"My company keeps giving me raises which seems great, however they keep giving me raises with more responsibility, however the raise is way under what I should be getting paid. Story below:

I was brought into a company working as an IT Specialist, initially they hired me at $15 an hour. I was right out college so I figured bite the bullet, I have a job out of college. After a month they wanted me to travel to their locations across the U.S. and bumped me to $37,000 with salary. Except now I am responsible for doing all of the networking and setups for their new locations across the U.S. 

Since then my work has consisted of about 30% travel and I now manage all of their IT needs for about 250 employees. 

My job duties consist of managing all support and administration of Office 365, Kipuworks (medical records service), phone support (8x8), networking at all locations, Remote support and any hardware that needs to be repaired or replaced. I have also done projects at the company such as change them from a small business to enterprise tier of Microsoft and implement HIPAA compliance across all communication services that they haven't had since they opened up. 

National average for an IT specialist is roughly  $72,000. I am at $37,000. I am up for my 90 day probation in a few days and I would like to go to $60,000. When I pitched that to my boss they said that the owners simply would not allow that. I understand that this is a huge jump to try to close but in reality I am not even asking for national average. 

While I am recently out of college I have been working in IT for a combined total of 4 years and have done internships with hedge funds and even Madison Square Garden, where I was a System Admin. 

However, in the next 2 weeks I will be undergoing a 365 migration, removing contractors from one of the locations which means I will be overtaking their active directory server and all support for that location as well. 

I love working for this company but they seem to be taking advantage and dumping more work onto me while purposely underpaying me. 

What can I do?"
3hc0nu,1,2015-08-17,Tick,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3hc0nu/tick/,"I just killed myself for breakfast.

I sat in my 100+ degree car, reeking of maple syrup and incapable of many coherent thoughts save for that one. It swayed through my mind like a dead leaf, falling into my consciousness by random assignment. I had been up since 4:30 in the morning after a fitful night of intermittent sleep, slogged out of bed and into my uniform just in time to make it for opening the restaurant. I remember smoothing my apron over my skirt, my legs already sticky with sweat, dreading the impending stress I was about to expose my already exhausted body to.

It was Saturday morning at a breakfast place on the shore, so we were swamped by 5:30. First the fishermen, most already smelling a little bit like hard alcohol and craving eggs and bacon by the pound, quick to swat at my ass when I bent over to clear their tables. Then the commuters at 6, hating their lives as they pulled an extra day at their theoretically 9-5, nervously tapping their feet as they waited for extra large coffees and breakfast sandwiches they could inhale as they ran to catch the ferry. Last but not least, blossoming bright and early at 8, the bennys on their way to the beach- huge families, dozens of discontented children lacking in fine motor skills, parents numb to the piles of half-chewed pancakes and artistic crayon endeavors on tables.

With a good night’s sleep, I can take it all with a smile and a wink, pocketing the tips and accepting the daily grind for what it is. For the past week, though, I hadn’t been sleeping well. By the time I got out to my car at 3 I was nearly in tears, my hand shaking with emotion and exhaustion as I put the key in the ignition and pulled out of the lot.

The waitressing gig was something I had picked up when I graduated from school to help tackle my impending mountains of debt in student loans, something to hold me by while I looked for something bigger and better that was actually in my field. I had worked at an animal clinic for years as an administrative assistant-cum-unofficial intern both before I started school and while I worked on my doctorate in veterinary medicine. 

Fourteen years trudging through paperwork and feces, all things said and done. I had always counted on going back there for my residency. I had never questioned it.

But I fucked up. And now I wait tables in a bubblemint pink skirt and black polo shirt with a stripy stained apron to protect me from being rained on with breakfast food. And I had just hit the one year anniversary of accepting the prestigious position last Sunday, which threw me in a tailspin of self-immolation and depression.

Which left me sweaty, sticky, and covered in artificially flavored corn syrup advertised and sold as maple syrup, in my junker of a car, literally stewing in my own filth as I putted through traffic. My body ached as a reminder of the last nine hours on my feet, my car echoing the protests of my joints. It was 16 years old and held together with duct tape and dreams, at this point. I was doing most of the repairs myself, from YouTube videos and the occasional desperate plea to my girlfriend, who managed her uncle’s auto body shop. I hated having to call her up after a ten hour shift and have her come over to fix yet another car, but I was pretty much out of options, so far in debt that I had been living off toast I pocketed at the end of my shifts and the one discounted meal I got a day at work.

Small blessing, my car was definitely not happy but was holding up in the broiling heat. I wiped my face to clear away the oily feel of melting eyeliner and pulled my shirt away from my chest, trying to get a little relief from the overwhelming temperature. The AC had gone before I even bought the car.  I shook my hair out of its ponytail and put it back up again in a tighter bun, then stuck my head out of the open window to try to catch a precious breath of the weak breeze.  I burned my fingertips on the metal of the door; I must‘ve made a face, the teen boys in the car next to me laughed. I flipped them off and rolled up the window, heat be damned.^click 

I was halfway home and half asleep, struggling to keep my eyes open despite the bright sun and the noise of the cars around me. I turned the music up louder, feeling the reverberations shake the car like a vibrating bed, oddly soothing despite the painfully loud decibel. The song was something from a local college station, it was old, foreign, jazzy, upbeat.  I liked it, even though I couldn’t figure out what language it was in. I was stopped at a light so I closed my eyes for a second to focus on the lyrics.

Everything went silent. Like life was winding down. 

Not just the car, but the whole world. I couldn’t hear the cars outside. I couldn’t hear the music. I opened my eyes, my pulse racing but everything else seeming to move in slow motion. There was a build up that reminded me of the slow whine of a boiling teakettle, then a pop that shook the car like a minor earthquake. I instinctively slammed on the brakes, trying to figure out the source of the problem through the heady rush of adrenaline. Either the car just exploded a little bit or I had just had a full-blown stress-induced seizure. The driver of the car behind me leaned on their horn like they were trying to give it CPR, swerving quickly to drive around. I glanced over through gasping breath and swimming vision, greeted with a hairy, tattooed fist flipping me the bird and a pair of accusing brown eyes set back in a wizened face. 

*Click.* A little jab my car threw at me; an insult to injury. 

*Click.* And another.

I pulled over to the curb, fingers trembling as I fumbled for my phone. Cars flew by, unconcerned with my spastic breakdown. I threw open the door and walked to the thin strip of grass lining the side of the highway. I sat down heavily, my tailbone sharply aching from the violence of it. No answer. I lay back, breathing in the warring scents of fresh grass and diesel fumes. Seconds or minutes later, my phone started vibrating.

I waited before answering, picturing her on the other end. I thought about her mouth, wide and fertile, blowing lazy nicotine-laced mint bubbles and snapping them…Her opaque lipstick over slightly chapped lips curving into a smudged smile; the way that smile felt against my skin. I thought about the way she must look right now, lips sinking into a frown, wondering why I called her at work, the beauty mark at the corner rising and dipping over her carefully chosen sentences like one of the dots in those old Disney sing-a-long videos. She would be leaning against the brick in the back of the building, her long hair sticking painfully in the divots, a detail that always slipped her mind unless I was there to buffer.

“What’s up, doc?” Her throaty greeting, the pet name that used to make me smile. I pulled some blades of grass and twined them together, instantly soothed by her voice. Like my own personal ‘50s movie actress, the unctuous femme fatale from a film noir. Sophie.

“The Lemon’s gone extra sour today, Soph.” She snaps her gum a couple of times and sighs. *Click.*

“What’s it this time?” 

“Took a nap in traffic.” She chokes a little bit. I smile to myself, guiltily pleased at getting a rise out of her. 

“Fucking you or the fucking car?” I considered that for a second.

“How mad would you be if I said I wasn’t sure?” I braided the grass together into my apron strings. The cars whizz by, soothing, like white noise. My car was still seething, a few plaintive clicks as the engine reluctantly winds down. I heard her sigh. No snapping, she must have spit out her gum. 

“I’m not mad.” The implied ‘just disappointed’ hung in the air with an annoyingly maternal ring. 

Anger started bubbling up in my stomach. Irrational and blind, unwarranted, stupid. I sat up, suddenly aware of being drenched in clammy sweat and the ache in my lower back. The silence on the other end stretched but I didn’t trust myself to speak. She cracked first.

“When did it start?” I described it, taking the now mutilated grass blades and rubbing them across my eyebrows, along my lips. I imagined I tasted pesticide. Or actually tasted pesticide. 

“It sounds like it’s probably just the radio, maybe the speakers. But you should bring it in just to be sure.” Sophie was fairly good with diagnostics, borderline House-ian, after so many years at the shop. She would makes jokes about it over dinner; the helpless mundanity of it all, the housewives stumbling over themselves to mimic the noises spouting from their engines. She had this great impression of a casually overdressed Fortune 500 guy on his day off, waltzing in with a puffed-out chest and a false bravado, eventually succumbing to his lack of knowledge and monkeying a charade the same way the housewives did. I wondered if she pictured me like that right now. 

“I’m not sure what I can do this week. Mike’s on a ride and won’t be back until next week and Butch is here till Saturday.” Mike was her brother- usually when the car really started acting up I would bring it into the shop for him to work on, he would just charge me for parts; occasionally he would just do the simple stuff outside of the apartment they shared. Butch was their uncle who owned the shop, fond of pinching pennies and willfully blind to his niece’s gayness. The few times I’d met him he’d alternated between ignoring me and being disgustingly flirty. Hearing his name made me think of stale cigar smoke and a hand too low on my back. Sophie was livid each time, trembling and fuming behind the receptionist’s desk. Once, after he left, she pulled me into the greasy garage bathroom and fingered me almost painfully hard. She hated it there almost as much as I hated waitressing, but she was working on her degree in IT and spent the bulk of the day doing homework and taking apart and repairing the computer.

*""Click.""* My car chimed in. I jumped a little, shaken away from my daydream.

“What’s the worst that can happen?” I sat up a little straighter, starting to prepare myself to get back in the shitmobile. “A Michael Bay-esque explosion that jettisons me out of the driver’s seat and into battle with a group of ninjas?” I mime karate chops that she can’t see. “I’m up on my krav maga.”

She laughs. I continued ninja shadow-boxing, my mood lifting. I untied the apron strings and curled it into a ball, happy to have the extra layer off of me. Why hadn’t I thought of that earlier?

“Rex was so stupid this morning, with his doofy cone and his lion cut. He got his ball wedged in between his face and the plastic. You would have peed your pants.” Rex was her 3-year-old St. Bernard mix. He had just been in for grooming and booster shots at my old clinic. I giggled.

“I miss that giant bucket of fuzz. I’ll come over and check him out soon, see if the cone can come off-”

“It’s ok, I’ve got it.” She interrupted. Abruptly. Maybe a little nervously. Fearfully. I felt tears welling up in my eyes; quickly squashed the feeling and stood upright too quickly. My vision darkened around the edges as all the blood rushed to my head. I shook my head, trying to clear my vision and my mind’s eye. 

*Click.*

“Well, obviously you would know better than me, with my nine years of veterinary medicine and whatnot.” I half-run towards the car.

“That’s not what I meant!” I jam the keys in the ignition, slam the door behind me.

“No. You know fucking better than I do. You’ve got this.” Annoying little flashes of emotions and memories ran through my head. I tried to fry it all with anger. 

*""Click.""* My car chastised.

“I DIDN’T MEAN IT LIKE THAT!” That was even worse, if she didn’t mean it passive-aggressively. That it just happened naturally, as a defensive response to protect poor dear Rex. I flipped on my turn signal and dove back into traffic, ignoring the beeps of the righteously indignant cars behind me. *Click.* Tlickticktick.

“WELL I DON’T MEAN THIS LIKE THAT EITHER, THEN.” I hung up, throwing my phone so hard on the passenger seat it bounced off onto the floor. I was so lost in thought I didn’t realize I drove all the way home, white-knuckled on the steering wheel, heart and head pounding. *Click.* 

I put the car in park and sat for a second, trying to calm myself down. My phone buzzed on the floor, spinning itself in tiny pirouettes. Sophie would have to wait. I had never been so done with humanity before.

*clickclickclickTICK.* My car shuddered a little as it cooled down, letting me know it wasn't having the best day either. 

I left my phone dancing by itself, slammed my door and headed inside with the sole purpose of alcohol. Immediately. I looked back as I was heading inside, considering bringing my phone for entertainment’s sake. I saw a ghost town of tired-looking cottages, an overturned brick perpetually falling out of the stairs, peeling paint like a waterfall frozen in time, cascading down the front of the house in rivulets and then faded blue confetti on the browning grass. What a party, I thought bitingly to myself. I turned away from the chaos, unable to think about tackling the mess in front of me, towards the cool silence of my shanty. 

I stripped my uniform at the door, walking to the kitchen in bra, panties and sneakers. I flicked on the light switch and fan, stared at the air conditioner for a mournful moment. There was no way I would be able to justify turning it on, not with my student loan due in a few days and the rest of my bills at the end of the week. I stood in front of my fridge, eyeing the spread. A styrofoam box with syrup-saturated pancakes from my shift yesterday. Mustard with a congealed shell on the cap. Half a gallon of Sunny-D. A cheap screw-top bottle of white wine. And the coup de grace in the freezer- an ice cube tray and 2 frozen packages of vegetables that technically belonged to Sophie. 

I grabbed out the ice cube tray, white wine and bastard orange juice and set about making myself a giant modified brass monkey. I chugged back the first, started on my second, topped it off and decided I was buzzed enough to deal with the next task ahead of me. I went to the bathroom and started running myself a bath. I started to turn the hot water on, thought the better of it and switched it to a lukewarm-borderline-cold. A fun fact from a psychology class a million years ago floated in the back of my mind- cold showers were good for depression. 

And in that same vein, other things that were good for depression- sedatives. Like the 3 tiny pills hanging out in my medicine cabinet, waiting for a rainy day, or in this case, blistering hot, hopeless day. I opened the cabinet up, catching my sweaty face in the mirror, surprised at how young I looked. And how haggard. I wrestled with myself on that on a daily basis. How could I only be 29 when I ran around town with a chip of failure off both shoulders and the wilted, slumping facade of a washed out 50-something diner waitress?

I shook the bottle in my hand like a lonely mariachi singer. Sophie’s brother’s name was written across the label in accusing capital letters. The last time I had slipped him cash it wasn’t just for car repairs. I started pulling at the corner, ripping off the label in tiny peels. I popped out one of the pills, split it in 2, leaving me with garbage in one hand, a crescent moon pill and booze concoction in the other. I stood over the garbage can, debating for a second on whether I should trash both, listening to the soothing sounds of the bath filling up. Almost without realizing it I made my decision, popping the pill with a gulp of brass-ish monkey, letting the little sticker pieces fall in a mess in and out of the can. 

I stripped and slipped into the water; drugs and thermodynamics mellowed my nerve endings into delicious lukewarm bliss. I let my thoughts unwind and dissolve, letting go of the pain one amorphous word at a time. Depression, late fees, regret, pancakes, exhaustion- dripping down my arms and legs in little rivulets. I grew annoyed with the tepid water; cranked up the heat and felt curls of delicious warmth rising up from the tap. A few phrases idled as I let my head sink and blew bubbles…I need to do laundry…call my aged parents to borrow money for rent, for groceries, for…

Then I was in the kitchen at work. It was the usual hustle and bustle, the sounds of grease sizzling and pans clashing together like they were in battle with the stovetop. It was cramped and sweaty as usual;  a fire-hazardous amount of people. I felt the weight of the pen behind my ear; my notepad in my apron, the clammy dampness of sweat dripping down the back of my neck and soaking my shirt. There were plates lined up in the window under the heat lamp, looking like stock photos from a food magazine; almost pornographic, glossy globs of scrambled eggs and plasticized dripping bacon. Faceless, hungry patrons loomed in the background like carrion eaters standing over the corpses of a thousand unborn chickens and sacrificed pigs. 

Sophie sat on the edge of the industrial dishwasher, the calm point in the storm, vibrating slightly and smiling that come-hither smile she gets when she wants to fool around. She was wearing old jeans and a white t-shirt, no shoes, no bra. Part of me realized this was a dream, another part of me didn’t care because the last thing I wanted to do was cater to the pissy, annoying, gentrified masses when I could have raunchy public sex with my hot, horny girlfriend. I walked up to her and put my hands behind her head and on the small of her back, feeling the warmth of her skin, the small hairs that made her feel like holding a gigantic ripe peach. 

We kissed, she tasted like mint and cigarettes. 

*“You’ve been smoking again?”* She smiled serenely and leaned to whisper in my ear. 

*“It doesn’t matter. You forgot to take out the trash. You’re ruining my life and you’re killing me.”* She lightly bit on the back of my neck, took my hand and moved it down the front of her jeans. I was getting foggy-headed with arousal, it took me a second to process what she said. 

*“What?”* Even my dream-self was confused. She arched against my hand, let her head fall so that I was supporting her weight with the other. She sighed.

*“Why did you do that?”* Her voice was an angry soft sob, thick with tears. I held her to me while she moved against me. There was a warm wetness against my neck, syrupy tears gluing her blonde hair to my neck. I pulled back, looked at her red-rimmed, sad eyes. They rolled back a little, she moaned in the back of her throat, almost a growl, followed by a clipped, clicking hiccupy noise as she cried. She leaned backwards onto the stainless steel, I moved with her to support her so she couldn’t fall. 

*“Why did you do that?!”* This time, it was barked like a shocked order. I looked down at Sophie in surprise, her face in profile, covered in hair. But she hadn’t spoken, she looked almost asleep. I looked around me to see what NPC dream character had decided to chime in. 

We weren’t in the kitchen anymore. We were in the clinic. My nostrils flooded with the smell of wet dog, piss, the heady pheromonal smell of animal fear. The acting veterinarian, Dr. Morris, face crumpled in confusion, striding quickly across the room to me. I lifted my arms back from Sophie in defense, something falling to the floor in tiny clicks- a scalpel. Something dripped down my wrist; I looked up, wildly embarrassed to have gotten caught having sex, even in a fantasy. It wasn’t the fun sort of glaze I was expecting. 

Coagulated blood, thick, black and old. I looked back down again. A dog with golden brown fur stared vacantly to the side, pupils dilated from blood loss. It had a huge, uneven gash in its neck. Dr. Morris shoved her aged hands over the wound, knocking the IV as she elbowed me away, trying to keep it closed. I backed away, slowly, my legs heavy in the way they only can be in nightmares. Her gloved fingers slipped, unable to hold it together. 

*“What the fuck were you thinking?”* I took another impossibly heavy step back.

*“I...My hand slipped...I was just trying to pull this off.”* I put my hand in front of me, displaying my handiwork like a child. A tick, engorged and round with blood. It hobbled to its legs comically, waddled up my arm. Dr. Morris looked at me in disbelief. 

*“I don’t see anything. Are you high?”* It left a little blood footprint trail as it made its way up to my neck. I thought about it. Was I? I had been taking so many pills to make it through exams. Uppers, downers, inbetweeners. The tick defied gravity with its corpulent little body, crawling into my ear. I put my hands to my face without thinking, spreading the warmth and rot across my cheeks, trying to dig it out before it made its way into my brain. I gagged at the smell. 

And I gagged in real life. I had fallen asleep with the water running. It had just made its way to my nose and ears. I shot upright, sloshing water out of the tub. I quickly shut off the water, my nervous system wracked with adrenaline, my heart was pumping so hard it was skipping beats, pounding in my ears, making me feel like I was still choking. I grabbed a towel and sat on the edge of the tub, trying to get my bearings on reality again. 

A minute later I realized the pounding wasn’t entirely composed of heartbeats. Someone was at the door. I looked at the window- it was still pitch black outside; it must have been the small hours of the morning. A brief, addled thought that it might be Dr. Morris to continue her tirade, even though that was dead and buried. I hoped against hope it was Sophie for a late night apology fuck, even though I knew she was probably at home, cuddled up with her dog, dreaming of far more pleasant things than me. Circuit boards and cotton candy and white picket fences.

I stand up, quickly realizing that I have both low blood pressure from my cramped position in the tub and a mild hangover from shooting wine and Sunny-D spritzers. I pulled the towel tighter, and debated going to the bedroom to put on something more substantial. The pounding intensified, almost as if the entity at the door could hear my thoughts. I resigned myself for immodesty, reasoning to myself: why the fuck not?

I padded wetly to the door like a confused swamp creature.

And then there was...no one. Just the Lemon, who greeted me with a boisterous:

*Click ticktick click.* 

I stared into my empty yard, suddenly, instantly furious with a white-hot anger that crackled like my stupid fucking car. I slammed the door, hands shaking, trying to figure out how to wait out the homicidal rage that was spewing through my veins like poison. 

I had done everything right. My whole life, I had tried to do everything right. 

I pounded towards the bedroom, reaching into drawers for a tank top and shorts, not bothering with any frivolities like underwear or shoes.  I glanced towards the cat clock, a graduation present from my parents. hanging playfully in the hallway. 4 am. In another reality, I could sleep another 3 hours before I needed to be in for the Sunday brunch shift. I felt tears well up in my eyes despite myself.

I had decided I wanted to help animals when I was 5 years old. I had worked hard, gotten good grades, spent hours and hours devoted to careful financial planning. I had parents that loved and accepted me when I came out of the closet. I was the motherfucking valedictorian of my graduating class. 

A shattering bellow from my car interrupted my angry self-loathing tirade. I could hear Barry, faintly, coming up with a colorful array of swears from his bedroom, a few feet away from mine, separated by paper thin drywall. I felt something snap inside of me. Something tenuous, something that had been wearing away for a long time- ticking away in me like a bomb with fuses winding around my veins and arteries. My face flushed with heat and my hands went numb and started shaking. Dimly I thought- this is fight or flight at its finest. If I were an animal I would have pissed myself and ran off into the sunset. Or ripped the face off of something.

I made it to the kitchen. Everything in my peripheral seemed to shimmer like water. I had no clear memory of my feet touching the floor- just the subconscious feeling of movement, almost like I was floating. Then, the sudden clarity and weight of my kitchen shears in my hand.

I had clarity of purpose. I had a car problem. A simple bum radio. And I had a way of fixing it.

I walked out to the car, enjoying the feeling of cool grass under my feet, the sharp tingling of gravel. I opened the driver’s side door, sat down and shoved the scissors into the edging of the radio. I heaved my weight down onto it, heard it separate with a satisfying shattering rrrrrrrrrrrip. I pulled the panel towards me, straining, adjusting my grip so I didn’t sever my fingers off. 

I held the bulk of it in my lap, cradling it like a baby, then wound the wires in the back into a bundle between my fingers. Each one came clean with a tiny satisfying click, finally releasing the demon box heavily into my arms and then promptly dropped onto the driveway. I felt a smile cross my lips, let it grow and set. I walked back into the house, serene, already thinking about the 2 solid sleep cycles that I would have, warm and cozy in my bed. As opposed to passed out in a bathtub.

Now, you’ll have to bear with me for this last bit. I’m not sure which parts are actual memories, versus what was relayed to me by the emergency responders and witnesses. What a funny thing, memory is, eh?

I know I woke up feeling more refreshed than I had in awhile. I slathered on makeup with fingers still wrinkly from the bathwater, I put on a mostly clean uniform, finished off the Sunny-D in the fridge, felt the pleasant rush of too-much sugar. I went out to my car, and went to put in a My Morning Jacket CD- I laughed to myself when I realized I no longer had a radio, rescued my phone from the floor and used YouTube to put it on instead. 

I had a bunch of missed calls and texts from Sophie, I started to type out an apology while I was stopped at a light. The next thing I remember is being dragged out of the Lemon, the car in pieces and leaking fluids like the tiny fragments chipped off in lemonade. 

Then, people screaming at me; at each other, at the world in general. At God.

One of the witnesses said I wasn’t paying attention and I rolled through a red light. She was in the car behind me, she noticed I was texting, she said something to that effect to her daughter in the front seat. That same daughter lost a hand- maybe more- in the ensuing crash; I watched her splayed form, her tear-soaked face as she was brought into the ambulance.

Another swears up and down that my car lifted off the ground of its own volition. That was an older man in opposing traffic. He slammed on his brakes when he saw, scared that I might have run over someone, or that there was an earthquake. His dog was in the back, obviously sans seatbelt. He had gone careening through the windshield, into another car, and now lay in the middle of the road in a mound of furry pulp.

A pedestrian walking by said my car was already smoking, flames dancing along the hood, when the accident happened. He claims that it was shrapnel, not me, that hit the family of four on the crosswalk. He says I couldn’t have seen the baby carriage. 

The father of that family of four says I looked him right in the eye and hit the gas.

There was so much traffic on the road, so many people itching to get to the beach. 

I’m not far away from where I was sitting yesterday. This time, I’m covered in blood instead of syrup. I’m surrounded by smoke and carnage. I’m fairly certain I need to get to the hospital, but I’m fairly certain I’m last on the list of priorities. 

I have pieces of windshield in my hair, clinking around in my apron pocket. The paramedic who was just standing over me has just power-walked away to another victim in need of more immediate attention, a writhing mess half-covered by a sheet peppered with blood and hair. It’s an inconceivable amount of bloodshed. Part of me wonders if I’m still dreaming. Part of me hopes that I am. Prays to whatever higher power there is that turned it’s back on me. 

A police officer asked me a few questions, I caught a few words here and there despite my shock. “Fault”...”drug test”...”emergency contact”…  A small flashlight in my eyes, dilating my pupils to check for brain damage. “No signs of severe trauma.” The glint of the handcuffs on his belt.

Sophie’s just gotten here, she immediately pulled me into an embrace, tucking my head in her neck. Her smell cut through the chaos, minty and feminine, soothing, like the antique concept of smelling salts. She’s been whispering in my ear, cooing calming things to me. 

I can’t think of anything to say. I can’t really hear her. I haven’t really been able to hear much of anything, to be honest.

All I hear is:
*tick*
*tick*
*tick*

3hc1qo,0,2015-08-17,Help with my future,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3hc1qo/help_with_my_future/,"I figured this is the best place to post this although there might be other sections I need to try. The grammar and organization of this post may be bad since I'm trying to get it all out at once.

I'm 22 at the moment and a Senior in college. I transferred so I lost some credits that put me behind. I have about a year left of college and I am at my limit of what I can handle. 

Long story short, I have always struggled with school. I have terrible learning skills and tend to not listen to anything but what I want to listen to or learn about. I have a learning disability that I don't even know the name of because whenever someone brings it up, I don't listen to them. I know I am diagnosed with ADD, Depression, Anxiety, and some other things. I currently have a script for Vyvanse but I don't like to take it because I don't want to rely on the medicine. My doctors have tried getting me on depression medicine but I really don't want that either. 

I moved out of my apartment and back with my parents because I felt I was becoming more lazy about life and school. I just finished up my summer semester, which went okay other than the fact I got a D in statistics and have to retake it. Once that semester was over, I was so happy. I went back to working out, actually talked to my parents, was overall more proactive about life. 

Today, the Fall semester started and I didn't even go to my classes. I actually didn't even know I had school until this past Saturday. Once I looked up when the semester started, I immediately got severely depressed. I already skipped class, didn't workout, haven't eaten today, stare off into the distance, and am doing absolutely nothing. The only thing that made me somewhat happy today was the idea of turning to Reddit for help. 

I can't stand the thought of going back and having to spend every day for how ever many weeks a semester is studying. I am terrible at school and it takes me an extremely long time to learn anything from College. Everyone else studies the day before a test and gets decent grades, I study all month and get a C or B. When I do go to class, I come home and spend the whole day reviewing what I ""learned"" which doesn't even stick with me. It's all a blur the next day. I was holding a 3.00 GPA even but now it is 2.86 because of the summer semester. 

I need advice on my future. My parents keep telling me that I just need to finish and get that diploma, which I believe them. I am currently a Finance Major and trying to figure out life. Since I am so bad at learning, I don't work nor am I in any extra clubs or services. I have no time because of studying. My resume is quite bland and my grades are average. I can barely hold a 3.0 GPA with this attitude. When I am in school, suicide is constantly on my mind and I don't want it to be. 

I feel as if I am not actually learning anything and when it comes time to apply for jobs, I will be screwed. Every class I have taken I cannot remember much from. I love Cars. I want to ultimately do something with cars but I'm not sure what I can do with a Finance degree. I also love gaming and working out. Everything I have been put in has not been close to any of those. I had an internship for a summer at a logistics company but left that because it was boring. I hated my job. 

Overall, I feel like I am progressively hating my life more and more as each semester rolls by. MY attitude declines and so do my grades. I feel deep down that I would like to be my own boss. I am not too happy with the idea of working for someone. 

One final point, I come from a very successful family. Everyone is either an Engineer, Lawyer, Business, Nurse, or Doctor. They all make an exorbitant amount of money and expect great things from every child. My sister just finished up Law School and is working for a firm. Even bought a house already. Then I'm here, just struggling to barely make it. I tried Engineering and left it and then went Business because that's everyones fallout plan. I don't hate it but I don't love it. I need advice on what I can do to help improve my happiness and get some kind of advice on what the future looks like. "
3hc8yu,7,2015-08-17,Systemic,numbe9,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3hc8yu/systemic/,"I just killed myself for breakfast.


I sat in my 100+ degree car, reeking of maple syrup and incapable of many coherent thoughts save for that one. It swayed through my mind like a dead leaf, falling into my consciousness by random assignment. I had been up since 4:30 in the morning after a fitful night of intermittent sleep, slogged out of bed and into my uniform just in time to make it for opening the restaurant. I remember smoothing my apron over my skirt, my legs already sticky with sweat, dreading the impending stress I was about to expose my already exhausted body to.


It was Saturday morning at a breakfast place on the shore, so we were swamped by 5:30. First the fishermen, most already smelling a little bit like hard alcohol and craving eggs and bacon by the pound, quick to swat at my ass when I bent over to clear their tables. Then the commuters at 6, hating their lives as they pulled an extra day at their theoretically 9-5, nervously tapping their feet as they waited for extra large coffees and breakfast sandwiches they could inhale as they ran to catch the ferry. Last but not least, blossoming bright and early at 8, the bennys on their way to the beach- huge families, dozens of discontented children lacking in fine motor skills, parents numb to the piles of half-chewed pancakes and artistic crayon endeavors on tables.


With a good night’s sleep, I can take it all with a smile and a wink, pocketing the tips and accepting the daily grind for what it is. For the past week, though, I hadn’t been sleeping well. By the time I got out to my car at 3 I was nearly in tears, my hand shaking with emotion and exhaustion as I put the key in the ignition and pulled out of the lot.


The waitressing gig was something I had picked up when I graduated from school to help tackle my impending mountains of debt in student loans, something to hold me by while I looked for something bigger and better that was actually in my field. I had worked at an animal clinic for years as an administrative assistant-cum-unofficial intern both before I started school and while I worked on my doctorate in veterinary medicine. 


Fourteen years trudging through paperwork and feces, all things said and done. I had always counted on going back there for my residency. I had never questioned it.


But I fucked up. And now I wait tables in a bubblemint pink skirt and black polo shirt with a stripy stained apron to protect me from being rained on with breakfast food. And I had just hit the one year anniversary of accepting the prestigious position last Sunday, which threw me in a tailspin of self-immolation and depression.


Which left me sweaty, sticky, and covered in artificially flavored corn syrup advertised and sold as maple syrup, in my junker of a car, literally stewing in my own filth as I putted through traffic. My body ached as a reminder of the last nine hours on my feet, my car echoing the protests of my joints. It was 16 years old and held together with duct tape and dreams, at this point. I was doing most of the repairs myself, from YouTube videos and the occasional desperate plea to my girlfriend, who managed her uncle’s auto body shop. I hated having to call her up after a ten hour shift and have her come over to fix yet another car, but I was pretty much out of options, so far in debt that I had been living off toast I pocketed at the end of my shifts and the one discounted meal I got a day at work.


Small blessing, my car was definitely not happy but was holding up in the broiling heat. I wiped my face to clear away the oily feel of melting eyeliner and pulled my shirt away from my chest, trying to get a little relief from the overwhelming temperature. The AC had gone before I even bought the car.  I shook my hair out of its ponytail and put it back up again in a tighter bun, then stuck my head out of the open window to try to catch a precious breath of the weak breeze.  I burned my fingertips on the metal of the door; I must‘ve made a face, the teen boys in the car next to me laughed. I flipped them off and rolled up the window, heat be damned. I was done with people for the day.


I was halfway home and half asleep, struggling to keep my eyes open despite the bright sun and the noise of the cars around me. I turned the music up louder, feeling the reverberations shake the car like a vibrating bed, oddly soothing despite the painfully loud decibel. The song was something from a local college station, it was old, foreign, jazzy, upbeat.  I liked it, even though I couldn’t figure out what language it was in. I was stopped at a light so I closed my eyes for a second to focus on the lyrics.


Everything went silent. Like life was winding down. 


Not just the car, but the whole world. I couldn’t hear the cars outside. I couldn’t hear the music. I opened my eyes, my pulse racing but everything else seeming to move in slow motion. There was a build up that reminded me of the slow whine of a boiling teakettle, then a pop that shook the car like a minor earthquake. I instinctively slammed on the brakes, trying to figure out the source of the problem through the heady rush of adrenaline. Either the car just exploded a little bit or I had just had a full-blown stress-induced seizure. The driver of the car behind me leaned on their horn like they were trying to give it CPR, swerving quickly to drive around. I glanced over through gasping breath and swimming vision, greeted with a hairy, tattooed fist flipping me the bird and a pair of accusing brown eyes set back in a wizened face. 


*Click.* A little jab my car threw at me; an insult to injury. 


*Click.*...And another.


I pulled over to the curb, fingers trembling as I fumbled for my phone. Cars flew by, unconcerned with my spastic breakdown. I threw open the door and walked to the thin strip of grass lining the side of the highway. I sat down heavily, my tailbone sharply aching from the violence of it. No answer. I lay back, breathing in the warring scents of fresh grass and diesel fumes. Seconds or minutes later, my phone started vibrating.


I waited before answering, picturing her on the other end. I thought about her mouth, wide and fertile, blowing lazy nicotine-laced mint bubbles and snapping them…Her opaque lipstick over slightly chapped lips curving into a smudged smile; the way that smile felt against my skin. I thought about the way she must look right now, lips sinking into a frown, wondering why I called her at work, the beauty mark at the corner rising and dipping over her carefully chosen sentences like one of the dots in those old Disney sing-a-long videos. She would be leaning against the brick in the back of the building, her long hair sticking painfully in the divots, a detail that always slipped her mind unless I was there to buffer.


“What’s up, doc?” Her throaty greeting, the pet name that used to make me smile. I pulled some blades of grass and twined them together, instantly soothed by her voice. Like my own personal ‘50s movie actress, the unctuous femme fatale from a film noir. Sophie.


“The Lemon’s gone extra sour today, Soph.” She snaps her gum a couple of times and sighs. *Click.*


“What’s it this time?” 


“Took a nap in traffic.” She chokes a little bit. I smile to myself, guiltily pleased at getting a rise out of her. 


“Fucking you or the fucking car?” I considered that for a second.


“How mad would you be if I said I wasn’t sure?” I braided the grass together into my apron strings. The cars whizz by, soothing, like white noise. My car was still seething, a few plaintive clicks as the engine reluctantly winds down. I heard her sigh. No snapping, she must have spit out her gum. 


“I’m not mad.” The implied ‘just disappointed’ hung in the air with an annoyingly maternal ring. 


Anger started bubbling up in my stomach. Irrational and blind, unwarranted, stupid. I sat up, suddenly aware of being drenched in clammy sweat and the ache in my lower back. The silence on the other end stretched but I didn’t trust myself to speak. She cracked first.


“When did it start?” I described it, taking the now mutilated grass blades and rubbing them across my eyebrows, along my lips. I imagined I tasted pesticide. Or actually tasted pesticide. 


“It sounds like it’s probably just the radio, maybe the speakers. But you should bring it in just to be sure.” Sophie was fairly good with diagnostics, borderline House-ian, after so many years at the shop. She would makes jokes about it over dinner; the helpless mundanity of it all, the housewives stumbling over themselves to mimic the noises spouting from their engines. She had this great impression of a casually overdressed Fortune 500 guy on his day off, waltzing in with a puffed-out chest and a false bravado, eventually succumbing to his lack of knowledge and monkeying a charade the same way the housewives did. I wondered if she pictured me like that right now. 


“I’m not sure what I can do this week. Mike’s on a ride and won’t be back until next week and Butch is here till Saturday.” Mike was her brother- usually when the car really started acting up I would bring it into the shop for him to work on, he would just charge me for parts; occasionally he would just do the simple stuff outside of the apartment they shared. Butch was their uncle who owned the shop, fond of pinching pennies and willfully blind to his niece’s gayness. The few times I’d met him he’d alternated between ignoring me and being disgustingly flirty. Hearing his name made me think of stale cigar smoke and a hand too low on my back. Sophie was livid each time, trembling and fuming behind the receptionist’s desk. Once, after he left, she pulled me into the greasy garage bathroom and fingered me almost painfully hard. She hated it there almost as much as I hated waitressing, but she was working on her degree in IT and spent the bulk of the day doing homework and taking apart and repairing the computer.


*Click.* My car chimed in. I jumped a little, shaken away from my daydream.


“What’s the worst that can happen?” I sat up a little straighter, starting to prepare myself to get back in the shitmobile. “A Michael Bay-esque explosion that jettisons me out of the driver’s seat and into battle with a group of ninjas?” I mime karate chops that she can’t see. “I’m up on my krav maga.”


She laughs. I continued ninja shadow-boxing, my mood lifting. I untied the apron strings and curled it into a ball, happy to have the extra layer off of me. Why hadn’t I thought of that earlier?


“Rex was so stupid this morning, with his doofy cone and his lion cut. He got his ball wedged in between his face and the plastic. You would have peed your pants.” Rex was her 3-year-old St. Bernard mix. He had just been in for grooming and booster shots at my old clinic. I giggled.


“I miss that giant bucket of fuzz. I’ll come over and check him out soon, see if the cone can come off-”


“It’s ok, I’ve got it.” She interrupted. Abruptly. Maybe a little nervously. Fearfully. I felt tears welling up in my eyes; quickly squashed the feeling and stood upright too quickly. My vision darkened around the edges as all the blood rushed to my head. I shook my head, trying to clear my vision and my mind’s eye. 


*Click.*


“Well, obviously you would know better than me, with my nine years of veterinary medicine and whatnot.” I half-run towards the car.


“That’s not what I meant!” I jam the keys in the ignition, slam the door behind me.


“No. You know fucking better than I do. You’ve got this.” Annoying little flashes of emotions and memories ran through my head. I tried to fry it all with anger. 


*""Click.""* My car chastised.


“I DIDN’T MEAN IT LIKE THAT!” That was even worse, if she didn’t mean it passive-aggressively. That it just happened naturally, as a defensive response to protect poor dear Rex. I flipped on my turn signal and dove back into traffic, ignoring the beeps of the righteously indignant cars behind me. *Click. Tickticktick.*


“WELL I DON’T MEAN THIS LIKE THAT EITHER, THEN.” I hung up, throwing my phone so hard on the passenger seat it bounced off onto the floor. I was so lost in thought I didn’t realize I drove all the way home, white-knuckled on the steering wheel, heart and head pounding. *Click.* 


I put the car in park and sat for a second, trying to calm myself down. My phone buzzed on the floor, spinning itself in tiny pirouettes. Sophie would have to wait. I had never been so done with humanity before.


*CLICK.*


My car shuddered a little as it cooled down. I left my phone dancing by itself, slammed my door and headed inside with the sole purpose of alcohol. Immediately. I looked back as I was heading inside, considering bringing my phone for entertainment’s sake. I saw a ghost town of tired-looking cottages, an overturned brick perpetually falling out of the stairs, peeling paint like a waterfall frozen in time, cascading down the front of the house in rivulets and then faded blue confetti on the browning grass. What a party, I thought bitingly to myself. I turned away from the chaos, unable to think about tackling the mess in front of me, towards the cool silence of my shanty. 


I stripped my uniform at the door, walking to the kitchen in bra, panties and sneakers. I flicked on the light switch and fan, stared at the air conditioner for a mournful moment. There was no way I would be able to justify turning it on, not with my student loan due in a few days and the rest of my bills at the end of the week. I stood in front of my fridge, eyeing the spread. A styrofoam box with syrup-saturated pancakes from my shift yesterday. Mustard with a congealed shell on the cap. Half a gallon of Sunny-D. A cheap screw-top bottle of white wine. And the coup de grace in the freezer- an ice cube tray and 2 frozen packages of vegetables that technically belonged to Sophie. 


I grabbed out the ice cube tray, white wine and bastard orange juice and set about making myself a giant modified brass monkey. I chugged back the first, started on my second, topped it off and decided I was buzzed enough to deal with the next task ahead of me. I went to the bathroom and started running myself a bath. I started to turn the hot water on, thought the better of it and switched it to a lukewarm-borderline-cold. A fun fact from a psychology class a million years ago floated in the back of my mind- cold showers were good for depression. 


And in that same vein, other things that were good for depression- sedatives. Like the 3 tiny pills hanging out in my medicine cabinet, waiting for a rainy day, or in this case, blistering hot, hopeless day. I opened the cabinet up, catching my sweaty face in the mirror, surprised at how young I looked. And how haggard. I wrestled with myself on that on a daily basis. How could I only be 29 when I ran around town with a chip of failure off both shoulders and the wilted, slumping facade of a washed out 50-something diner waitress?


I shook the bottle in my hand like a lonely mariachi singer. Sophie’s brother’s name was written across the label in accusing capital letters. The last time I had slipped him cash it wasn’t just for car repairs. I started pulling at the corner, ripping off the label in tiny peels. I popped out one of the pills, split it in 2, leaving me with garbage in one hand, a crescent moon pill and booze concoction in the other. I stood over the garbage can, debating for a second on whether I should trash both, listening to the soothing sounds of the bath filling up. Almost without realizing it I made my decision, popping the pill with a gulp of brass-ish monkey, letting the little sticker pieces fall in a mess in and out of the can. 


I stripped and slipped into the water; drugs and thermodynamics mellowed my nerve endings into delicious lukewarm bliss. I let my thoughts unwind and dissolve, letting go of the pain one amorphous word at a time. Depression, late fees, regret, pancakes, exhaustion- dripping down my arms and legs in little rivulets. I grew annoyed with the tepid water; cranked up the heat and felt curls of delicious warmth rising up from the tap. A few phrases idled as I let my head sink and blew bubbles…I need to do laundry…call my aged parents to borrow money for rent, for groceries, for…

-

Then I was in the kitchen at work. It was the usual hustle and bustle, the sounds of grease sizzling and pans clashing together like they were in battle with the stovetop. It was cramped and sweaty as usual;  a fire-hazardous amount of people. I felt the weight of the pen behind my ear; my notepad in my apron, the clammy dampness of sweat dripping down the back of my neck and soaking my shirt. There were plates lined up in the window under the heat lamp, looking like stock photos from a food magazine; almost pornographic, glossy globs of scrambled eggs and plasticized dripping bacon. Faceless, hungry patrons loomed in the background like carrion eaters standing over the corpses of a thousand unborn chickens and sacrificed pigs. 


Sophie sat on the edge of the industrial dishwasher, the calm point in the storm, vibrating slightly and smiling that come-hither smile she gets when she wants to fool around. She was wearing old jeans and a white t-shirt, no shoes, no bra. Part of me realized this was a dream, another part of me didn’t care because the last thing I wanted to do was cater to the pissy, annoying, gentrified masses when I could have raunchy public sex with my hot, horny girlfriend. I walked up to her and put my hands behind her head and on the small of her back, feeling the warmth of her skin, the small hairs that made her feel like holding a gigantic ripe peach. 


We kissed, she tasted like mint and cigarettes. 


*“You’ve been smoking again?”* She smiled serenely and leaned to whisper in my ear. 


*“It doesn’t matter. You forgot to take out the trash. You’re ruining my life and you’re killing me.”* She lightly bit on the back of my neck, took my hand and moved it down the front of her jeans. I was getting foggy-headed with arousal, it took me a second to process what she said. 


*“What?”* Even my dream-self was confused. She arched against my hand, let her head fall so that I was supporting her weight with the other. She sighed.


*“Why did you do that?”* Her voice was an angry soft sob, thick with tears. I held her to me while she moved against me. There was a warm wetness against my neck, syrupy tears gluing her blonde hair to my neck. I pulled back, looked at her red-rimmed, sad eyes. They rolled back a little, she moaned in the back of her throat, almost a growl, followed by a clipped, clicking hiccupy noise as she cried. She leaned backwards onto the stainless steel, I moved with her to support her so she couldn’t fall. 


*“Why did you do that?!”* This time, it was barked like a shocked order. I looked down at Sophie in surprise, her face in profile, covered in hair. But she hadn’t spoken, she looked almost asleep. I looked around me to see what NPC dream character had decided to chime in. 


We weren’t in the kitchen anymore. We were in the clinic. My nostrils flooded with the smell of wet dog, piss, the heady pheromonal smell of animal fear. The acting veterinarian, Dr. Morris, face crumpled in confusion, striding quickly across the room to me. I lifted my arms back from Sophie in defense, something falling to the floor in tiny clicks- a scalpel. Something dripped down my wrist; I looked up, wildly embarrassed to have gotten caught having sex, even in a fantasy. It wasn’t the fun sort of glaze I was expecting. 


Coagulated blood, thick, black and old. I looked back down again. A dog with golden brown fur stared vacantly to the side, pupils dilated from blood loss. It had a huge, uneven gash in its neck. Dr. Morris shoved her aged hands over the wound, knocking the IV as she elbowed me away, trying to keep it closed. I backed away, slowly, my legs heavy in the way they only can be in nightmares. Her gloved fingers slipped, unable to hold it together. 


*“What the fuck were you thinking?”* I took another impossibly heavy step back.


*“I...My hand slipped...I was just trying to pull this off.”* I put my hand in front of me, palm open, displaying my handiwork like a child. A tick, fat and round with blood. It hobbled to its legs comically, waddled up my arm. Dr. Morris looked at me in disbelief. 


*“I don’t see anything...A-are you high?”* She was utterly incredulous. It left a little blood footprint trail as it made its way up to my neck. I thought about it. Was I? I had been taking so many pills to make it through exams. Uppers, downers, inbetweeners. The tick defied gravity with its corpulent little body, crawling into my ear. I put my hands to my face without thinking, spreading the warmth and rot across my cheeks, trying to dig it out before it made its way into my brain. I gagged at the smell. 


And I gagged in real life. I had fallen asleep with the water running. It had just made its way to my nose and ears. I shot upright, sloshing water out of the tub. I quickly shut off the water, my nervous system wracked with adrenaline, my heart was pumping so hard it was skipping beats, pounding in my ears, making me feel like I was still choking. I grabbed a towel and sat on the edge of the tub, trying to get my bearings on reality again. 


A minute later I realized the pounding wasn’t entirely composed of heartbeats. Someone was at the door. I looked at the window- it was still pitch black outside; it must have been the small hours of the morning. A brief, addled thought that it might be Dr. Morris to continue her tirade, even though that was dead and buried. I hoped against hope it was Sophie for a late night apology fuck, even though I knew she was probably at home, cuddled up with her dog, dreaming of far more pleasant things than me. Circuit boards and cotton candy and white picket fences.


I stand up, quickly realizing that I have both low blood pressure from my cramped position in the tub and a mild hangover from shooting wine and Sunny-D spritzers. I pulled the towel tighter, and debated going to the bedroom to put on something more substantial. The pounding intensified, almost as if the entity at the door could hear my thoughts. I resigned myself for immodesty, reasoning to myself: why the fuck not?


I padded wetly to the door like a confused swamp creature.


And then there was...no one. Just the Lemon, who greeted me with a boisterous:


*Click ticktick click.* 


I stared into my empty yard, suddenly, instantly furious with a white-hot anger that crackled like my stupid fucking car. I slammed the door, hands shaking, trying to figure out how to wait out the homicidal rage that was spewing through my veins like poison. 


I had done everything right. My whole life, I had tried to do everything right. 


I pounded towards the bedroom, reaching into drawers for a tank top and shorts, not bothering with any frivolities like underwear or shoes.  I glanced towards the cat clock, a graduation present from my parents. hanging playfully in the hallway. 4 am. In another reality, I could sleep another 3 hours before I needed to be in for the Sunday brunch shift. I felt tears well up in my eyes despite myself.


I had decided I wanted to help animals when I was 5 years old. I had worked hard, gotten good grades, spent hours and hours devoted to careful financial planning. I had parents that loved and accepted me when I came out of the closet. I was the motherfucking valedictorian of my graduating class. 


A shattering bellow from my car interrupted my angry self-loathing tirade. I could hear Barry, faintly, coming up with a colorful array of swears from his bedroom, a few feet away from mine, separated by paper thin drywall. I felt something snap inside of me. Something tenuous, something that had been wearing away for a long time- ticking away in me like a bomb with fuses winding around my veins and arteries. My face flushed with heat and my hands went numb and started shaking. Dimly I thought- this is fight or flight at its finest. If I were an animal I would have pissed myself and ran off into the sunset. Or ripped the face off of something.


I made it to the kitchen. Everything in my peripheral seemed to shimmer like water. I had no clear memory of my feet touching the floor- just the subconscious feeling of movement, almost like I was floating. Then, the sudden clarity and weight of my kitchen shears in my hand.


I had clarity of purpose. I had a car problem. A simple bum radio. And I had a way of fixing it.


I walked out to the car, enjoying the feeling of cool grass under my feet, the sharp tingling of gravel. I opened the driver’s side door, sat down and shoved the scissors into the edging of the radio. I heaved my weight down onto it, heard it separate with a satisfying shattering rrrrrrrrrrrip. I pulled the panel towards me, straining, adjusting my grip so I didn’t sever my fingers off. 


I held the bulk of it in my lap, cradling it like a baby, then wound the wires in the back into a bundle between my fingers. Each one came clean with a tiny satisfying click, finally releasing the demon box heavily into my arms and then promptly dropped onto the driveway. I felt a smile cross my lips, let it grow and set. I walked back into the house, serene, already thinking about the 2 solid sleep cycles that I would have, warm and cozy in my bed. As opposed to passed out in a bathtub.


Now, you’ll have to bear with me for this last bit. I’m not sure which parts are actual memories, versus what was relayed to me by the emergency responders and witnesses.


I know I woke up feeling more refreshed than I had in awhile. I slathered on makeup with fingers still wrinkly from the bathwater, I put on a mostly clean uniform, finished off the Sunny-D in the fridge, felt the pleasant rush of too-much sugar. I went out to my car, and went to put in a My Morning Jacket CD- I laughed to myself when I realized I no longer had a radio, rescued my phone from the floor and used YouTube to put it on instead. 


I had a bunch of missed calls and texts from Sophie, I started to type out an apology while I was stopped at a light. The next thing I remember is being dragged out of the Lemon, the car in pieces and leaking fluids like the tiny fragments chipped off in lemonade. 


Then, people screaming at me; at each other, at the world in general. At God.


One of the witnesses said I wasn’t paying attention and I rolled through a red light. She was in the car behind me, she noticed I was texting, she said something to that effect to her daughter in the front seat. That same daughter lost a hand- maybe more- in the ensuing crash; I watched her splayed form, her tear-soaked face as she was brought into the ambulance.


Another swears up and down that my car lifted off the ground of its own volition. That was an older man in opposing traffic. He slammed on his brakes when he saw, scared that I might have run over someone, or that there was an earthquake. His dog was in the back, obviously sans seatbelt. He had gone careening through the windshield, into another car, and now lay in the middle of the road in a mound of furry pulp.


A pedestrian walking by said my car was already smoking, flames dancing along the hood, when the accident happened. He claims that it was shrapnel, not me, that hit the family of four on the crosswalk. He says I couldn’t have seen the baby carriage. 


The father of that family of four says I looked him right in the eye and hit the gas.


There was so much traffic on the road, so many people itching to get to the beach. 


I’m not far away from where I was sitting yesterday. This time, I’m covered in blood instead of syrup. I’m surrounded by smoke and carnage. I’m fairly certain I need to get to the hospital, but I’m fairly certain I’m last on the list of priorities. 


I have pieces of windshield in my hair, clinking around in my apron pocket. The paramedic who was just standing over me has just power-walked away to another victim in need of more immediate attention, a writhing mess half-covered by a sheet peppered with blood and hair. It’s an inconceivable amount of bloodshed. Part of me wonders if I’m still dreaming. Part of me hopes that I am. Prays to whatever higher power there is that turned it’s back on me. 


A police officer asked me a few questions, I caught a few words here and there despite my shock. “Fault”...”drug test”...”emergency contact”…  A small flashlight in my eyes, dilating my pupils to check for brain damage. “No signs of severe trauma.” The glint of the handcuffs on his belt.


Sophie’s just gotten here, she immediately pulled me into an embrace, tucking my head in her neck. Her smell cut through the chaos, minty and feminine, soothing, like the old school concept of smelling salts. She’s been whispering in my ear, cooing calming things to me. 


I can’t think of anything to say. I can’t really hear her. I haven’t really been able to hear much of anything, to be honest.


All I hear is:



*tick*
*tick*

""How was working at company X?""

""Oh it was great I learned a ton.""

""What did you do?""

At this point, I recognize most people don't want the details, so a simple ""I wrote software."" can suffice.  Other times it's followed up with a:

""Oh, I see, what did you work on?""

I then usually try to explain it to them like they're five.  Which has varying results.  So, I'm curious what do you tell people when they ask?"

I went to a small public university (~3000 enrolled students) and got a degree in Computer Science. I landed an internship at a local software company working on web apps, got offered a full time job at graduation, and have been working there since.

Back in May I decided I wanted to make games (specifically in the AAA Industry) since that was one of my main motivations for getting into programming originally. 

I started scouring the web and looking at what some of my favorite studios look for in programmers. C/C++ with knowledge of 3D math seems to be a standard. Most also want 1-3 years of experience at the least.

Since May I've been spending most of my free time learning C++ and now C. I've played around with SDL, made a clone of Pong, started working on more complex clones. I'm about to start an edX course on Computer Graphics that teaches OpenGL and GLSL. I'm planning on getting into the Unreal Engine and trying to make something non-trivial soon. My ace-in-the-hole is that my girlfriend is an artist who is basically doing the same thing as me but trying to get an artist position in the industry. We can make a game together, me with the programming and her with the art.

I feel like I have a decent plan that with enough discipline should pay off. My only fear is that its not enough. I went to a no-name university. I don't have connections in the industry. The closest studios are a 3 hour drive away in Dallas.

How do I stand out when I go to put in my application against the other hundreds of people looking to break into the industry? Is what I'm doing going to be enough? Do I need to be looking at these expensive (in both time and money) graduate programs like Guildhall at SMU or Digipen etc instead of just trying to make it on my own?

Thanks for any help. I tried to find any previous threads about this subject and couldn't find anything helpful."

I would just like to share my situation and get some insight from you all.

I am currently a senior at university, will be having a part time semester this fall and then graduating. I was a Public Health major for most of my time here but I switched to IT halfway through my Junior year (which is why I am graduating a semester late). At school I have taken basic classes, mostly intro stuff. Networking, Java, Research in IT, Database Technologies, digital hardware, and 2 classes based around project management. I eventually want to go into project management as my career. However this summer I got a part time job at a small company as  the Network Admin's assistant and I also took the networking class this summer so I am starting to gain some interest here as well. 

Currently I am hoping to land an internship for either the fall or spring (I'll be done with school by then) and my plan was to try and get a full time offer from the place. However I have done some screening interviews with some big companies in NYC and they didn't go well which leads me to believe I'm seriously under qualified right now since I can't even deal with an interview for an internship. 

What can I do to gain some real knowledge? What certs should I take? And I am still very interested in PM so if anyone is one I would love to hear about your path to that position. 

Thank you all! There is some really valuable information here, really appreciate it. "
3hcike,5,2015-08-17,MS in CS at Top Tier Schools,csris,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/3hcike/ms_in_cs_at_top_tier_schools/,"**Background info:**

I'm a rising second year computer science student at UCSD. My goal is to get a MS in CS at a top tier school: Cal, Stanford, MIT, CMU. I have double legacy at Stanford, but my parents were not in the CS department. Does this help my chances at all?

**GOAL:** 

What do I need to do to get a MS at said schools, and **HOW** do I do it? 

**GPA:** 

My GPA is currently 3.77. If you only look at CS + math courses, I have 4.0. But I doubt schools care/notice that. Not terrible, but not great by any means. 

**Research Experience:**

I'm currently interning at a large tech company's research facility this summer. Should I bother attempting a rec from my manager/mentors here? I'm only here for 3 months. 

I want to intern as a software engineering intern next summer. Should I instead look to do more research? Will a software engineering internship at say Google/Facebook be less helpful than a less ""prestigious"" research position? Eventually, I do want to work in industry. I might do research in industry, but I feel like I will be outclassed by PhD holders, so I might not go down that path. I like being the best at what I do. 

Let's talk more about research. How do I go about getting research positions during the school year? I'm planning on cold emailing professors + talking to them during office hours, but I'm unsure how to casually ask about doing research under them. I'm not the best at networking with professors. Any advice/tips? Also, put bluntly, how I do get outstanding recs? 

Furthermore, how important are publications, specifically in regards to obtaining a MS in CS? How do I go about getting involved with publications? I know in high school my peers participated in various research conferences, should I be looking to do the same? (obviously not the same conferences). What can I do to learn more about this/get involved?

**Tests:**

Let's talk about tests. What tests should I take? Of course, I need to take the GRE; do I also need to take GRE subject tests? What subjects? Perhaps math? I think CS subject test was discontinued, is this true?

When (year, months) do people normally take the GRE? (For example: third year, fall). How does score submissions work? Let's say I take the test twice: can I choose to only submit the higher score? What if I did better on qual my first time, but better on quant second time. Can I combine or ""superscore,"" or do people normally submit both scores in this situation?

I haven't take full practice tests yet, but after glancing at the problems and doing a few I think I should be alright. Extrapolating from my SAT (2300/2400), and doing a straight conversion from my SAT scores to the old GRE scale (both are out of 800) to the new 170 scale, I should be looking at 170 Quant 168 Qual (using http://www.ets.org/s/gre/pdf/concordance_information.pdf). I'm confident I can get 170 Quant, but not so confident about doing well in qual. Any tips for improving qual scores? Any useful GRE resources?


Any advice on any of the aforementioned would be much appreciated.

I was dismissed from my university a few years ago for not going to class. I was computer science back then and my only two classes I passed were comp sci classes in which I got C's. Anyways, there is a program at my university in which if I get dismissed and then go elsewhere and get an associate degree, my cumulative GPA will be erased and reset. Not my major GPA, though.

So I'm sitting at a fresh cumulative GPA, but a major GPA of 2.0 (until I bring it up). I'm applying for internships now and I was just wondering - what would you list on your resume? As long as I have A's in all of my current classes, I think it should be fine to list 4.0 cumulative. However, once they check and see the two C's, they might question my 4.0 cumulative (even though it's true). 

What do you think? Thank you!"

3hd5w0,0,2015-08-17,Starting programming! For Real!,RexGrammer,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3hd5w0/starting_programming_for_real/,"Hello /r/learnprogramming!

Let me start with a bit of an intro.  

I'm a 18yo programmer with several years of experience. Several times national level programming championship winner. There's also a few national newspaper articles I can link (that are about me and my accomplishments). I'm fairly confident in my skills and ability to overcome almost any problem (with the help of SO and Google :D). My main field of expertise is C#.NET.  

This is not a programming question per se, more of a career question. I want to get more experience in the field by working more! What I'm struggling to achieve is to actually get a real job. All of my previous work was small contract work (don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining, I'm just looking for more). Even though I want to, I can't commit to a full-time job due to the fact that I'm starting my last year of high school now (already have a scholarship for a prestigious university lined up, also have references from several Microsoft Student Partners and one MVP(!) for paid internship in the local Microsoft Development Center - this starts when I start uni in 1 year). That's why I looked up some local startups asking if they can offer me flexible work hours and the ability to work remotely. Unfortunately I wasn't able to find what I was looking for. So this is where I ask Reddit for help. Where to from here? What I want is advice on where/how to look for a job with the requirements that I've listed. What I can offer is expertise, fanatic dedication and a young brain. So far I haven't been able to find what I'm looking for, any advice really is appreciated.

P.S. I suppose some will say that I should focus on school. I am currently in an IT specialized high school. The major advantages to that is that I'm learning what I like so I won't get bored so easily, I'm learning what I need for work later on. The biggest drawback is that I learnt 90% of what's being taught years before, which leaves me with incredible amounts of free time. I've decided to use that free time to further improve myself and get some real-life experience.

I graduated with a BoA in Computer Science, but had a somewhat low GPA coming just short of a 3.0. I had trouble landing a job for nearly two years after I graduated, likely because of my GPA and I never knew how important internships were. Eventually I got advice to do post-grad internships and part time work and I got hired to my first programmer position shortly after.

After looking for so long, I was pretty willing to accept just about any offer, but now a few months later I'm starting to worry I might have made too many compromises. 

The pay is very low, only $40K(minus taxes) with very little chance for advancement or promotion. They don't even have a 401k which I wasn't aware of when I was hired because they told me about their alternative ""retirement program"" which I later learned wasn't nearly as good. I was assigned to fixing bugs on the most outdated software the company has, while my boss' younger brother who started at the same time as me has already been pushed to working on the newest products. It's pretty disheartening because I'm the only one working on this old software so it's difficult to fit in with the others. I try to be friendly and focus on the work and have received good reviews, but not fitting in with the other people is a big red flag for me and has got me considering if it's worth staying at this company.

They use proprietary languages which makes me worry that my skills won't be transferable if I do decide to find somewhere else to work. I live in the Midwest but honestly, my dream is to move out to Silicon Valley and code for a company there. I realize the competition is tough but I still want to try my hardest to make it there as I have always been fascinated by that culture.

I definitely don't want to go back to being out of work as being rejected for so long was pretty rough, but at the same time I really would like to get a job I'm happier with. Do you think I should stick around this company for awhile longer to gain more experience? Or is three months long enough? I don't want to leave too early and have that look bad on my resume. I'd definitely be thankful for any advice you have for me!"

I've tried to do my best in meeting people but meeting people here feels like stopping someone in the streets who seem like they are in a rush and just want to have a small, quick conversation and move on. At my internship this summer I had such an easy time connecting with people, not just my age but much older, who basically took me in with open arms. I'm sorry for just complaining, but I really needed to vent. I don't see how I wouldn't be deserving of enjoying this school like everyone else. I've joined countless involvements, but we would all meet as individuals and leave as individuals. I'd suggest getting together in all sorts of ways, not desperately but in a very non intrusive manner, but no one seems interested. They all already have their own plans somehow or are busy. So I end up meeting a ridiculously large amount of people who recognize me but no one I can spend an afternoon with. Frankly, its killing me and I really want the college life everyone here seems to be enjoying. I do everything alone. I'm not the type of person that enjoys being alone 24/7 and it gets unbearable at times. The U of I to me as been one big nightmare for the past 2 years and I just want to smile again, wake up in the morning and actually look forward to my daily life. Sorry for the text but I could really use some advice here, or just a few words of anything.  "
3hf05d,5,2015-08-18,Research vs. Internship,NearItComes,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3hf05d/research_vs_internship/,"So this is more of asking for advice rather than a career question. I am a rising sophomore with a CS and Applied math major and over the summer I have been doing some work at my university in MATLAB under one of my professors. Although a lot of time was spent learning about softwares and libraries, this technically fell under 'research' and ultimately I was able to produce a MATLAB class containing many functions helpful in image processing. Because of my work, the professor I am working under has offered me the choice to continue my work during the semester (will take roughly 10 hrs per week). The goal as he states is to eventually get me to publish a paper or something of the sort by the end of the semester so that I will have some stuff to show so I can get hired by companies. 

My question is if taking this offer is actually worth it. If i turn it down I will be able to do some cs-related internship on my campus. The main worry I have about the offer is that MATLAB from what I know is barely ever used outside of Academia and doing 'research' at a relatively unknown university will not make a difference on my resume. An internship however would give me concrete experience that an employer would actually deem useful. I am not trying to go into research as a career, but I am still torn as this is a pretty big opportunity and I do not want to make the wrong choice."

Next summer I would like to be offered an internship at Google or another company of similar caliber. I know that there are 1000s of others like me that want to do the same thing. I know it will be hard, will very possibly fail, and will certainly test my knowledge. However, because I know all of that I think I am on my way to be prepared for the interview process and hopefully come out of it with an offer! 

I am taking Data Structures this fall and Analysis of Algorithms in spring so I will have taken the coursework needed. I just purchased the 6th edition of Cracking the Code Interview last night and will begin studying that as soon as it comes in. I had an internship as a Software Developer last summer and have been working as a dev for the same company ever since. I believe I have the skill and determination to accomplish this and understand what it takes. I am determined to do whatever I have to do in order to achieve this. It is a sort of dream of mine and I think it would set me up for my future career in the best way possible.

What else do I need to do to prepare for this whole process? I have a while until I apply and even longer until I would have to interview. Is studying the book and doing well in my classes enough? or are there other resources I should look into as well.

Thanks!

I am currently a rising senior in college (about to start in a week), and these past few weeks leading up to the start of college have me thinking a lot.

On one hand, I could land a good job right out of college that pays well and that would be that.  I see this as unlikely because I only have one summer of internship experience (and not even at a well known company) and a few projects.  So more realistically I'd land a job at a small company I don't want to work for and would be getting paid much less than I was hoping for.  Maybe I am short selling myself but I am trying to think of the worst-case scenario.  

On the flip side, I could go a different route and aim for an internship at a more well known company at a role I'd see myself doing as a career for the rest of my life (software engineer intern).  At the end of the internship, which would be around mid to end of August, I would then start applying to Grad School (deadlines are in December).  I believe I have the grades to get into a top school and with one more summer of experience I think that would put me at an even better position of getting accepted.  I've always wanted to pursue a Masters, and that'll only help when it comes to getting a high paying job. 

What do you all think I should do given my current situation (1 summer of internship experience and a few projects)?  "

Whilst I have a good understanding of my end goal of becoming a Project Manager, I'm wondering what the best way to get break in to the industry would be? I've started looking and applying for summer internships, but I'm really trying to find ways to help myself stand out. I've already started learning Java/Python (for fun) and I'm pretty well versed in things such as Excel and computers in general which I believe helps to fulfil the IT element.

I already have nearly 2 years worth of experience as a Fixed-Asset Accountant in an office which required plenty of analysis and computer knowledge on a day to day basis as well as creating reports for a large Government organisation and have had various other temporary job roles during the summer and before university. Would this combined with the degree be enough to apply for a junior role?

tl;dr is in the title, what's the best way to become a Business Analyst?

Our office staffs about 30 folks, so we're pretty small. The culture is relaxed and communication between the C-suite and everyone below them is not only encouraged, but open and available whenever it's needed.

My specific 'department' is made up of three people now: myself, and my two managers who both have the same title of Senior Content Manager. My role as a Staff Writer is to support them and the account leads in content/copy editing and drafting. 

I get along great with one of my managers. We work well together and produce great content while being able to share good, healthy constructive criticism with one another. It's a very positive professional relationship. 

The other, however, is a completely different story. As an intern she treated me just ""ok."" This didn't bother me because hey, I was an intern and these things happen. But over time I obviously proved my worth, and upon their learning that I was shopping for (and subsequently receiving) full-time job offers from other firms, my company turned around and offered me one as well – one that started before my internship was even over.

For some reason I think this upset the manager I'm referring to. In fact, she's treating me worse now than she did when I was an intern. She's delegated work to me so as to overload my already packed calendar, while also blaming *me* for scheduling mistakes that *she's* made. She's rarely in the office, claiming that she sometimes ""works better from home,"" which is fine by me except she misses out on and/or postpones meetings with clients, thus creating more stress for myself and many of my coworkers. 

I've been lucky to discuss my issues about her with some of my colleagues, including my other manager with whom I'm close. They all not only recognize the issues I've had with her, but they've also shared with me that they have all had similar experiences with her.

My question is, at what point is it reasonable for me to go to HR or one of the execs? I don't want to be labelled as a ""tattle,"" but I'll be damned if I continue to let her treat me the way she's been treating me. 

What advice do you have for me? Thanks, in advance, for any help you can offer. "

3hh4gj,6,2015-08-18,Graduating this May.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3hh4gj/graduating_this_may/,"So, I will be graduating this upcoming May. I don't have any internships and my GPA is slightly below a 3.0. I have a Github with some projects, nothing too serious. I'll be honest I've spent my fair share of college enjoying myself and what it had to offer. I get this sentiment may be unpopular in this sub, but it is what it is and I don't particularly regret it.  

Overall I have one year till I graduate and I understand I'm not the most competitive of candidates. I'm willing to do my best in order to have a shot at a job before graduation, (I've already started interview prep with a friend.) So I guess this leaves me with the following questions: 

* What should I expect out of my job search? 

* I could probably raise my GPA to a ~3.3 by graduation, should I consider a MSc instead of entry level work?  (To add to this I have EU citizenship so I could very easily apply to Grad School outside the US)
* As per above might it be easier to find entry level positions outside the US? 
* I have a two month long winter break, is it possible to find an internship for that slot of time? 

* I've tried to contribute to OS but have little luck with any meaningful contributions, the majority of my contributions is documentation and spelling corrections. Is it still worthwhile to put these contribution on my resume? 

* Should I focus on trying to find an intership after school? Generally internships are for current students but there surely has to be intership positions for new grads, right? 

* Is non-relevant tech experience applicable for an entry-level position or does it just look gaudy on a resume? 

* Is it better to focus on applying to the 'non-popular' tech areas? 

* The personal projects I have are all over the place, I have some in Python using an API to scrap data and using Matplotlib, I have played with some front-end stuff (RoR, Bootstrap, jQuery) to make some cool websites, a Brainf*ck interpreter in C. I don't really however have extensive knowledge in any one language. Would it be a better strategy to just focus on creating projects in one specific employable language? Then over the next year I can hone my skills and at least be competitive in one language than be a jack of all trades?

* Should I focus on creating a Linked in as a new-grad? 

* Lastly, and this might be snide, but I have about two courses to take for a Mathematics minor. Would it be a good strategy to retake a course or two and stay enrolled by extension, get my minor while raising my GPA to ~ || &gt; a 3.3? This would allow me to apply to current student internships this upcoming summer even though I have completed all my requirements for graduation, the intern salary could also offset tuition. Just an idea.

I am currently having a slight breakdown after being ""rejected"" from an internship interview. (They haven't even bothered rejecting me, but I know). I am about to enter my 4th year of an engineering major. Besides one year where I excelled in my courses and received straight A's, the rest of my academic career is quite horrible. 


I was rushed into school unprepared and unsure about my direction by my over protective, helicopter parents. I was immature and resented the fact that I have to be in this difficult program for my parents' sake. I had various opportunities to get involved, and make the most of my university career but I passed on them as my head was not in the game. Coupled with a learning disability and a major family tragedy (Which extended from childhood until last winter and contributed to my emotional immaturity, I believe) this lack of interest resulted in very poor performance all around: networking, marks, involvement.


4 years later (I failed first year), I finally find that I enjoy the profession I am working for and believe I am capable to excel in it  (Bad marks != didn't learn anything).  There is now a huge gap between my credentials and my ability.  And I worry that I will have a very slow start to my career. 


Being a woman, I know I have a certain time frame to get my career up and going before I reach the age when I want to focus more of my time on having a family.


I am smart and believe myself to have a bright future ahead of me. I have made a plan to improve my credentials and my network during my last year, so I am by no means just getting stuck on the present. However, in these moments of weakness I can't get the regret and the feeling of lost opportunity out of my head.


My dreams are to become an entrepreneur at some point, or get a job that will make a difference. I know my learning disability and my life experience will only help me with these objectives if I can put in the hard work to catch up on what I missed.


Now that my whining is over, I was wondering what stories, experiences, advice, motivations, recommended reads, etc. you redditors may have to help me get over this set back and head strongly into my future.


Thank you all in advance.

1) The first was a Dell Inspiron 15 from 2008. By today's standards, it was thick and ugly but it was my first personal computer so I loved that thing. Eventually ended up giving it to a relative.  
2) The second was a Dell XPS 15 from 2009 that I got for/from high school. My parents are still using this one today, though it's definitely riding the struggle bus.  
3) The third was an HP Envy 15 from 2012. Man, this was my favorite laptop ever in terms of design, much better than HP's current Envy line IMO. That Radeon 7690M was hella loud, though. It was stolen from me when I stupidly left it unsecured in my car after owning it for just a year. Lesson learned: don't leave your shit unsecured in Chicago's Chinatown.  
4) Lenovo Y500 from 2013 to replace my stolen HP Envy. The thing ran extremely well and I was happy with how much quieter the Nvidia 750M was than the Radeon card. Unfortunately, the GPU fried a few months ago, right before I had to leave for an internship. I salvaged the hard drive but haven't made any serious effort to remove/replace the video card.  
5) Asus Zenbook UX305 - my current laptop that I bought shortly after my Lenovo died since I needed a work laptop. It's a great little machine, but gaming on it is out of the question.    

That brings me to **my new build**. I ordered most of the parts throughout the summer while I was out of state, and my parents kindly took care of all the packages for me. Went to Micro Center to buy the CPU and case (and anti-static wrist strap!) as soon as I got off my flight back, and built the PC right afterwards. Everything was smooth, thanks to the Word document of step-by-step instructions that I had prepared specifically for the NZXT S340. The only minor hitches were that I hadn't paid enough attention and plugged in the front panel connectors into the wrong places at first, and that I plugged in the LED strip's connector the opposite way. Other than that, everything's been smooth and I couldn't be happier with Windows 10. I've used all the Windows since XP and Win10 is by far my favorite. CPU and GPU OCs are running great on it.

Sorry, no pics of the boxes or progress--I was too excited building. Cables on the desk look messy because this was right after plugging everything in.

3hhyjy,10,2015-08-18,"well /r/jobs, i got a full-time offer from my current internship... and they are asking me for a decision 10-months before my actual start date. i really need some opinions.",08041993,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3hhyjy/well_rjobs_i_got_a_fulltime_offer_from_my_current/,"i'm in middle of some very happy-ish dilemma here. currently i am a rising senior, and am interning as a UX designer at a large-ish corporation (~8000 ppl) at my hometown. I will be graduating in June of 2016. During the internship, there has been a talk of a full time offer, and i had always thought i'd have till this winter at least to consider my options. well, yesterday i got an official offer from HR, and they are asking me to take or reject the offer by next friday. basically, take it or leave it, which i completely understand.

* The offer details: The offer is extremely generous, considering where I live (Texas) and my work experience (near to none). They're offering me a 76.5k salary + a 5k signing bonus with competitive benefits, despite the fact that i put down 60k on the application for ""expected salary"" and was anxious about it. (though, if they had gone with that number though i'd be having less of a dilemma, so lol i guess they knew what they were doing.) My coworkers are really wonderful, and the work environment is very positive and super flexible; people regularly work from home 2 days a week or more. It's really a dream job and I'm very grateful.

Now that I've written this all down, it seems ridiculous that I am in a dilemma at all. i feel guilty even considering other options (although I know i shouldn't feel that way), partially because my hesitation stems from something that seems very trivial (or not?): location. 

growing up, i'd always imagined myself getting out of here -- and i did. i was fortunate enough to make it into an ivy league college, albeit ironically located in a 100x more rural town than my hometown. throughout my life, i've always looked forward to graduating and moving into a much more urban area in the northeast, like NYC or boston... point being, i really dont want to stay in texas. thinking about it all -- thinking of staying in texas for another two more years -- gives me a vague sense of ""what did i really work for?"" (i know, i'm being melodramatic)

on a less naive note, i am also concerned about my growth potential if i stay here. my hometown is not the most tech-oriented area, and i know that it just won't be up to par compared to the larger cities. i know myself well enough that no matter how hard i work here i'll be always lacking that sense of urgency that comes from having fierce competition all around me. in other words, i'll probably become *too* comfortable if i choose to stay.

lastly, i know that i'll always be full of ""what if's"" if i decide to accept this job. i was talking to my mother about it earlier and she said no matter how good i know i have it here, i'll never know how good i really had it here unless i get other experiences. i'll probably never be as thankful as i should be if i decide to accept this offer. and of course, on the other side, if i decide to reject this offer, i have to deal with the uncertainty and the overwhelming anxiety of starting the job search all over again. and asking if i can command a salary this high, will the work environment be horrible... will i even be able to get a job like this again?? 

i guess the question comes down to which option i will regret more: staying here and not knowing the unknowns, or leaving here and realizing i shouldve stayed. ultimately, i know the decision is up to me, but i dont really have anyone else other than my parents to turn to in these sorts of decisions. adults knowledgeable in american things were always lacking in my life, as my parents are immigrants (as am i). 

you guys here at /r/jobs has been incredibly helpful while looking for my internship, and i've always loved reading threads and advices here so i'm really interested in hearing your opinions and thoughts. thank you for reading if you made it this far:)

**tl;dr: graduating next june, full-time job offer of ~80k for when i graduate, and i have to decide by next week. not sure if i wanna take it because the ""what ifs"" are killing me and i really dont wanna stay in texas.**"

One thing I see a lot on this subreddit is to get internships during college, but I wasn't able to get into any of them because of my GPA (2.9). I don't have work experience outside of teaching and tutoring computer science, so it doesn't get me anywhere in software development.

I was thinking about changing up my resume and taking on OSS projects, but in the meantime, I heard that one of my cousins (majored in Bio) took an internship after graduation. I was wondering if anyone here has done that or seen someone do that for computer science and if I should do that to get some real software development experience, or if I should continue looking for entry level positions that don't require much experience outside of college.

3hi6bd,1,2015-08-18,International Student seeking advice on Masters in US,throwaway4mindia,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3hi6bd/international_student_seeking_advice_on_masters/,"Throwaway account. I apologise for  my mediocre English. I hope this is the most relevant subreddit for my query. 

I'm a student from India and I'm currently into 4th and final year of my Bachelors in Computer Engineering. I'm preparing to acquire admit in US universities for a masters in Computer Science &amp; Software Engineering.

The conundrum is that I'm not passionate about coding and I'm substantially inexperienced and lacking when it comes to practical knowledge. My expertise is limited to basic C++, HTML, CSS &amp; Java. Talking about other conceptual and theoretical topics, Algorithms didn't pique my interest during coursework but I managed to get a decent grade. Same goes for Computer Networks and Security. I haven't done any personal projects nor do I have any research experience. Albeit I have managed to obtain decent grades so far and may score an internship gig before the end of my degree.

I am fearful of going for MS as I'm not confident I'll be able to maintain a good GPA and complete the coursework and assignments on time. I'm not confident that I am prepared for the program. The education system in US will be drastically different and more demanding than the one I have been accustomed to for the last few years.

I don't know what to do at this crucial crossroad. As far as I know, these are the options:
1)Should I go with MS in US ditectly after graduation? (cons: lack of confidence, fear of failing)
2) Get a job in my home country (cons: meager pay, risible standards, handsome competition)
3) Due to dearth of graduate schools coupled with ever-increasing applicants, it shall be extremely tough to get into a decent graduate school here in India. I'd have better chance at getting into a Top-50 US university. 4.) Get experience in India and apply for MS after a year or two.

Hypothetically speaking, if I go for MS in US after completion of my degree, what could I do within 1 year before the program starts? How can I prepare myself for the rigors of the program? What would be a better bet for me: Computer Science or Software Engineering? People with MS and relative experience, what is your advice? "

[you can read a long, somewhat (ok mostly)  emotional side of things here if you want.](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3hhyjy/well_rjobs_i_got_a_fulltime_offer_from_my_current/) but i wanted to know what you guys think from a career standpoint.

**quick BG about my situation:**

* throughout the internship, there has been a talk of a full time offer (i think they really need UX ppl), and i had always thought i'd have till this winter at least to consider my options. well, yesterday i got an official offer from HR, and they are asking me to take or reject the offer by next friday. my actual start date would be in June 2016, after i graduate. basically, take it or leave it, which i completely understand. its a big decision to make... and i REALLY dont know. im naturally an indecisive person and i like to leave things open till the LAST minute so this is like the worst nightmare for me. 

**qualifications:**

* studio art major minoring in CS at an ivy (not HYP tho lol), graduating next summer (June 2016)

* currently am interning at my hometown at a large-ish corp (~8000ppl?)

* regarding how i was received as an applicant last time i looked for internships -- i sent out 43 online apps, heard back from 10 places (with some interest), outright rejected from five, the rest didn't bother replying. out of those 10 i actually interviewed with 6. i went onto second round interviews with 2 or 3 (idr) of them, but by that time i had an offer that i accepted right away so idk how the final turnout really would've been. but those are the number i have. hopefully my next portfolio will be much better with this internship. 

* overall, not brilliant by any means but not hopeless either (i think)

**my actual offer:**

* coming in as more or less junior ux designer, working on product and user testing

* generous, esp considering the area -- 76.5k salary + 5k signing bonus with competitive benefits

* coworkers are really wonderful, super positive work environment, people regularly work from home 2 days a week or more

* I'm really super grateful!!

**wtf? why aren't you taking it?**

* city is not tech-oriented, worried about my growth potential

* no matter how hard i work here, i'll be always lacking that sense of urgency that comes from having fierce competition all around me. i'll become too comfortable if i choose to stay. like... this is a job/environment i could see joining after ive had some experiences under my belt and i want to settle down with a family or whatever. if that makes sense 

* i dont want to stay in my hometown ;_______; (i know... but its a big thing for me) i rly want to live in NYC or boston

* so many ""what if's""!!!! they will kill me. i hadnt even begun my job search.

**ok, so dont take it??**

* i dont know if i can get another chance like this!!! will i be able to commandeer a salary this high? what if i get a crappy work environmnt.. or end up jobless?!

what are your thoughts? feel free to shit on me, or give me advice, because i literally dont know. ultimately.... i know the decision is up to me,  but i dont really have anyone else other than my parents to turn to in these sorts of decisions. adults knowledgeable in american things were always lacking in my life, as my parents are immigrants (as am i). so ive always turned to the internet for help and advice, i'm really interested in hearing your opinions and thoughts. thank you for reading."

I started with web automation at first, moved to android automation after more than half a year, and now I'm doing all of the automation (Web, iOS, Android) with another coworker ever since the rest of my team got laid off a couple of months ago. 

Now that I've graduated, I want to move on and transition out of automation into software development and put my knowledge to use, however I'm finding that my job search is turning out to be a bit of an uphill battle since prospective employers are looking at my QA knowledge rather than my Software Development knowledge.

Has anybody else come into a similar situation? If so, how did you resolve it?

Some insight: I don't have any opinions against automation or my current responsibilities, I enjoyed my internship very much and tried as much as possible to take advantage of the experience, however I don't see myself continuing with automation in the future.

Thank you all in advance"

I kept fucking up, bouncing from job to job, hitting dead ends and feeling utterly useless. In 2009, I nearly got to the little league field where I intended to swallow my Glock and call it quits. Police intervened because I had sent my mother a goodbye text, and they caught me less than a quarter mile from the field.

I ended up in inpatient care. After a nearly month stay, I was released back into society and decided I was going to go to school and focus on making something of myself. Even though I have three kids, I put school first. 

Since then, six years ago, I have had three different jobs (with periods of unemployment in between, and just got fired from my last during a hypomanic swing), have made less than $15,000 per year, a good chunk of which goes to child support. I only had my own place for about two years of these six years. 

I’ve been off medication for the majority of this time, just getting on medication in the past year thanks to the ACA. I’m starting to really take hold of what my hypomania has done to me, and how I’ve lived… and I want to go back and make sure that Glock goes off.

I owe over $26,000 in credit card and auto loan debt; I owe friends and family over $7,000; and I owe over $85,000 in student loans. My addiction, my coping mechanism, my escape… has been shopping. I’d take that money and blow it on clothes and shoes and whatever (hey, it’s the new iPhone!)… I always felt there’d be a golden ring at the end of the tunnel, I’ll be able to catch up, I’ll be okay. I had blinders on the whole damn way. 

I’ve got two years, with internships, of my master’s program left, and I don’t feel like I’m stable enough to work and complete the program. I’d have to borrow another forty grand to make it through. And at the end, what does a master’s in social work make? Yeah, pretty much jack shit. 

I’ve got 13 days until school starts, I’ve been unemployed for three weeks and my next position doesn’t begin until mid-September (guess where? Yeah, a psych ward… lol). I’ve finally slowed down enough to think and reflect, and I’m staring at over $100k in debt plus forty so more coming… oh, and I’ll be in my late thirties if I did finish school… 

I’m a shit father, and my ex (rightfully… oh so fucking rightfully) hates me. I’ve been living in my mother’s boyfriend’s living room for over a year, sleeping in a reclining chair, and still spending like a fool. My relationship with my girlfriend is crumbling as the house of cards collapses. 

I don’t see any way out of it all. I’m destined to live destitute; I’m never stable enough to maintain anything. I’m at my end, and I really feel the only option is death. 

I can’t do it myself, I couldn’t do that to my kids. I need someone to kill me. Or to drive 100 miles an hour into a telephone pole. I need to stop living a complete lie.

I'm afraid that I'll fall behind the whole 'need internship to get job' phase. Most of the internships I want to apply will be done next summer, but I feel like my application is incredibly weak. I have not done any side projects, mostly because I don't even know where to begin or what to even make. Since majority of the employers ask for github links, I feel like if I don't have one, I won't be taken seriously. I currently have a job on campus, as an IT Help Desk Student Technician and had a graphic design/web development internship beforehand, but thats as much experience as I have.

Do CS students usually have multiple internships, or will one be enough for full time employers? Because I'm worried that if I don't get an internship next summer, I'll fall behind and it might be even more difficult to find an internship before I graduate. 

But I guess what I'm most concerned about are my nonexistent side projects. How do I find inspiration/ideas to come up with something others haven't? I feel like all the projects I see from other students are pretty advanced, and I feel a bit intimidated."

New to reddit, but I figure this is a good place to voice my problems and hope to get a answer. Basically tonight I went to a baseball game with a friend. I am 20 years old so I just told the housekeeper that I would be out late tonight at a baseball game and she was ok with it as long as I let my mom know by calling since she is away on business. The thing is my mom has many issues and is controlling of me. If I had told her I was going to a baseball game alone then she would have freaked out and said no. I went anyways figuring she would find out that I went and figure there is nothing she can do about it. 

A little back story on my past. Few years back I went to another college and I did get a little out of hand with partying. The thing is my parents are completely against any type of drinking or drugs(Which is ok with me since they have their reasons and I respect their rules). Although since then my mom has gotten a little out of hand ""protecting me"". She calls me a few times in a span of a few hours when I am hanging out with my friends( Often times at 9 pm.... 9 freaking pm) and tries to make me come home. Often times on the phone she has a crying tone and tries to get sympathy from me since she is scared for me or something like that. She also tries to make an effort to tell me that I shouldn't have many friends because a lot of people are bad they'll get me into ""bad things"". She also feels the need to lie to me that she needs to ask me if I am smoking or drinking because ""our doctor asked her to"". One time I came back home at like 8pm from a restaurant with my friends and she had the nerve to nicotine and drug test me to check if I was doing anything bad. Also another time I got angry at my parents for not letting me go on the weekends to the city to work on a internship and they thought it was an excuse to do drugs so they woke me up in the morning to drug test me. Basically they feel like after finding me try various things at my old college that they need to make sure I am not going back to that. Instead of a college 6 hours away I now go to a college 2 hours away from home..... 

A lot of the time I can only describe a bit of a panic attack whenever it gets past 10 pm and I am with my friends because I am worried my mom will keep calling me and just bothering me to come home. Like at 11pm I need to bother my friend at a grad party while he was playing FIFA to drive me back home since I drove with him because my parents kept hassling me to come home.

The list goes on, but a lot of the time they call me overweight ( I am 5' 11'' and weight 178 pounds and 33 waist size.... you do the math ). They say I am oversensitive and that I am giving off a loser mentality since I keep complaining about them. I have said things to them like I feel like I am ""persecuted"".

So back to the whole baseball game story. Basically I decided to go to the game and forget telling my mom because all she'll do is say no(shocker? My dad would have probably said yeah but that wouldn't have really prevented anything with my mom). My dad was also away on business. I get on the train around 10:40 and I get a text from the housekeeper saying that my mom is mad at her for letting me go and that ""he is not allowed to go anywhere"". My mom calls and is literally sobbing asking me where I am and what I am doing. Keep in mind folks I am 20 years old. My friend said he can't really deal with my problems anymore since he couldn't deal with my melt down on the train contemplating whats going to happen to me when I get home( Will I be kicked out of college for this, etc). He said that he might have to stop hanging out with me, but I need to go to counseling. I feel like at times my mind is going to explode because of the immense stress my mom puts on me making friends and my mind in general. I don't think its healthy I want to graduate college and move far far away from where my parents live. Most kids want to be close to their parents but I feel like a huge wedge is between us.

This problem has gotten to the point where I have recurring nightmares of my parents coming home from their trips. Just them coming home from their trips and that is enough to give me a cold sweat. 

My mom feels all a counselor will say is ""your mom loves you very much and thats why she is doing what she is doing"". She feels she is doing this to protect me and she won't be done til I get married. 

At the moment I am a full time summer intern at a finance company locally and have performed very well there. At school I keep a decent GPA and have a good social circle. It seems when I am away at school away from my parents for a period of time I feel much better( I feel awful for saying that since they are paying for my school). 

I need to hear some different opinions and advice on this whole situation. Leaving college is not a option and living on my own. I don't know what to do."

I'm projecting that I'll be able to save at least $500 a month after all expenses...but here I can save $2000 a month easily. Which, for someone who wants to eliminate all debt fast, is amazing. 

So, should I spend a year not really saving much money...but having an amazing learning experience (not just regarding software engineering, but life in general)? Or is it better to finish my undergraduate studies, save up this nice amount of cash, pay off my debts, and hopefully try to get another interview down the road?

I've already accepted this company's offer BUT it's contingent on a few things including a background check. I have nothing to hide regarding the background check but I am a tad paranoid about the background check and the small probability that I'd go to California for nothing, only to have to drive back to the other side of the country.

Is it time to take a risk that many people would like to take, and perhaps go hardcore intern mode to save more? Perhaps by splitting rent with other interns or room mates? By eating nutritious but repetitive food for a year in order to save? Is it worth the learning experience and the nice name on my resume to leave my fulltime job as a full programmer for an internship at one of the top companies who has a background check contingency and also would prefer if I delay my undergraduate studies during the internship?

I would greatly appreciate any insight from the older and wiser software engineers who have done something like this or decided NOT to do something like this after being given the chance. "

I also regularly met people like this in college, but most of them dropped out after 6 months or so... For instance, there was a guy that LITERALLY claimed he built a generator out of magnets that can power itself indefinitely and generate 50 watt-hours continuously (yes, not watts, watt-hours) because FUCK the laws of thermodynamics!

I'm curious on your stories though! Share some of the frustration :) I know you guys have experienced these kinds of people..."

I just graduated from undergrad, and back in the fall, I accepted a full-time return offer (after a summer internship) from Amazon in a location and to a team that I had handpicked. However, I recently got an email concerning a team change. This is a big factor to the cold feet. I didn’t leave my internship with the most amazing experience, but with a team that I chose and was really interested in, I felt like it would be at least a great learning experience. I’m not terribly excited about the new team (or most of the other teams, tbh), and with the recent publicity of the work-life balance, I’m terrified I’m not making the right decision. But as it stands, I’m relocating and starting within a month.

I’ve been contacted by a recruiter from another large company and I would be interested in working with them and expressed interest to them, probably too soon and mostly out of panic. I’m really concerned with the etiquette of this situation. I know I should at least give my Amazon team a chance before I make any hasty decisions, but at the same time, I’m worried about wasting time and opportunities, and potentially becoming burned out.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance."

  Yay, this actually happened today; literally an hour ago.

  A bit of context: I'm in high school going into my junior year. Our school mandates a set amount of community service hours in order to graduate (and it looks good for college) so I had decided to volunteer at a local hospital in New York City.

  A bit MORE context: My school also has a research program that allows students to compete in science competitions like Intel and Siemans-for any of you that know of those. So, I had tried to get a research mentor at the hospital I was working at (I wouldn't have to travel too much then and since I already was volunteering) to help me with a natural science project. I contacted several professors and researchers, and surprisingly enough, I actually got a response from a doctor saying he would be willing to help me.

  Here is where I fuck up:

  My first day of doing research and I am sitting in the main lobby of the hospital waiting to meet the professor. I get a text from him that I'm going to be working alongside one of his medical students. He gave me the guys number and I proceeded to message him asking where he is and introducing myself.

  He ends up responding that he is in the general clinic lobby (he's a third year medical student who is doing clinical rotations, or something like that) and he tells me to wait outside this new lobby lobby (fyi, it is on the other side of the hospital).

  I say ok and begin to look for the new lobby; I end up finding it and it is PACKED-like balls to the wall full, literally. I manage to find an empty seat as a guy gets called up, and I sit down. Right behind me was an elderly couple who were talking about the news, more specifically, the Subway guy who was charged with child pornography charges. The old husband proceeds to rant outloud about how the government can watch everything we do, that we are never safe and that the government can access all of our computers through remote access.

  Well, I decided that since I would be waiting (presumably for a long time) I would at least try talk to someone so I joined in his conversation when the opportunity arose. My first sentence, what caused him to lose his mind, was ""yeah, and some people say they were able to do that decades ago. Imagine what they could do now; what if there are extremely tiny drones that can listen in to every conversation we have"". At this point the guy was just nodding his head, but in hindsight I realized he didn't think I was joking. Thus, my follow up sentence was ""Yeah, they probably are listening to us right now"".

  All of a sudden his face dawned with an understanding as if his deepest fears were confirmed. His eyes grew in size and his mouth opened wide. He started yelling out, ""THEY'RE FUCKING EVERYWHERE. IT MAKES SENSE. I TOLD YOU THEY WERE THERE"" as he proceeds to shout at a women to his right (eho wasn't actually his wife). 
  
  I just nope the fuck out of there as everyone else just gets quiet. As I'm leaving, a nurse comes up to him and asks him if everything was alright-his response, ""yes ma'am but this young gentlemen here has just confirmed my theories that the government follows us, has access to our private information, and can hear every damn word that we say"", as he points to me.

  As I walk out I see SECURITY guards hastily walking into the lobby I just left; I'm not sure if they are completely related but they looked seriously pissed off.
 
  The nurse just looks at him then at me, follows his finger to see me, and gives me the most ""wtf did you say"" look I've ever gotten. 

  I am now sitting in the corner of the original lobby wishing I never signed up for this as I can't show my face back there without getting strange looks by everyone in the nurses station.

  Tl;dr: Signed up for an internship, Waited for professor to come to the lobby, Proceeded to confirm an old man's theory that the government can hear everything we talk about, Chaos ensued.

  Thanks Obama.

  WILL UPDATE IF ANYTHING ELSE HAPPENS.

My results are above-average and I've had interviews from four different companies (and had moved to the next round of interviews from two of these companies).

I'm highly interested in software development of web applications and want to become better at it. As such, I've only been applying to entry-level (and intern) positions dealing with web application development. Also, I'm mostly applying for positions dealing with either .NET or JEE, since I'm most proficient with these technologies.

However, the job requirements for such positions ranges being knowledgeable in technologies I've not had the opportunity to learn (for .NET - WCF, AJAX, JQuery, ADO.net, etc. and JEE - Struts, Spring, Hibernate, AJAX , Jquery).

I'm okay with learning these technologies, but am unsure as to which I should learn as the job I'm being called for may be either .NET or JEE. So, while I'm focusing on getter better at JEE, the interviewer who calls me will be for .NET. Thus, leaving me unsure as to what I need to get better at for the interview.

Also, the interview process for these four companies have been widely different, how can I be better prepared to handle possible future interviews?

Another difficulty I'm currently going through is wondering if I've been wrong not to apply for jobs in desktop application development. My batch-mates have already got jobs working on desktop apps. The sole reason I haven't applied to these jobs is that I want to work with web apps and all junior/senior positions for these jobs require experience with the relevant web technologies.

So considering my situation, do you think any software engineering experience would be better than none if I want to eventually work with web apps?"

In February, I was hired for a full-time 1 year contract position at a major university. The overarching college gave each department some money to hire faculty and/or staff and my department opted to create my support position since they were desperately in need of staff. The money only covered my salary for a year, however when I interviewed they were extremely optimistic that this one year contract would turn into a permanent position. So I moved and took the job. 

Well the state decided to cut funding to our specific college and the Dean crossed my salary off the budget, despite the pleas of our faculty to keep my much needed position. I was informed two months ago that my contract would end in February 2016 no matter what. 

Turns out that my exact position has opened up about 20 minutes away in one of the most sought after organizations to work. I had an internship there in 2006 that spring boarded my whole career. I applied several times in the past, sometimes not even passing the phone screen, it's hard to get a job there. I had a phone screen yesterday and was instantly offered an in-person final interview with the director of the division on Monday. The HR person said ""we heard a lot about you and we are happy you applied to this job since it is the most relevant to your experience compared to the other positions you have applied to here."" Now I should mention I was one of two final candidates for a job there about 3 years ago after they flew me up for interviews. I didn't get that job but they said they were impressed by my skills and qualifications and they would let me know if something else came along that I was suited for. A week later they offered me a temporary job that I turned down because I couldn't justify, back then, moving for only a 6 month gig. I thought they would never want to see my face again. But here I am with a final interview Monday. 

Thanks for reading and for your advice!




My questions are:

1. Should I inform my current supervisors that I am actively looking for another job?
2. Is 7 months a long enough time to not feel like I have bailed on my current job?
3. Should I attempt or offer to put the potential new start date on hold to transition out of the University? I would definitely give two weeks notice, but it might need a month since classes will begin next week. "

I've really loved this subreddit ever since discovering it about a month ago, and would like to thank you all!!

I am a rising sophomore studying CS at an Ivy League university. I made the decision in about April to major in CS and have an internship lined up for the summer (finishing it in two weeks) which isn't relevant at all to CS.

I had no experience with CS before college, and so I'm doing my best to catch up and learn. I'm practicing coding interview questions online, learned Python this summer, try my best to go out and meet people / network, and am learning Xcode with the Stanford winter course on iTunes.

I know that recruiting for Summer 2016 internships will be coming up SOON, and as a result, I'm starting to get sort of nervous for the whole process. I feel much more comfortable with coding than I did three months ago when school got out, but I still have no professional experience coding and no real ""side projects"" to mention (outside of my academic coursework).

Is there any more that I can be doing to prepare? And, assuming that I do well on the technical interviews, what would you say my chances are? Does being from an Ivy help at all, or will recruiters not really care?

Thank you all!

I graduated in May with a weird degree (I don't want to outright name it bc anon, but I am pretty sure it is something my school made up) that included classes about things like MySQL, HTML/CSS, Python, JS, project management, graphic design and database security. I like design and how people use websites, so I settled into a job as an intern last January (2014). 

In my internship, I worked with WordPress- I managed current websites, designed and developed new ones and migrated from other CMS's. The company has a couple dozen websites that are accompanied by monthly magazines, so I am always working with countless people who don't know their ass from a hole in the ground when it comes to WordPress, despite using it all day, every day.

When I graduated, I was offered a full time, salaried position. When I was an intern, I was paid $12/hr. On my hire, my pay was raised to $15 and some change for a yearly salary of 32k. 

This doesn't seem so bad considering there are some people who have graduated and don't even have jobs yet, but I have looked at similar jobs other places and it seems like I am making at least a little less than I ought to be.

I'm looking for some general advice about getting a job in software development. I'll give you a little background on me:

As the title says, I'm in my last year of high school (actually it starts in a few days). However, I have been programming as a hobby for about 5 years.

Languages I've worked with:

* Python
* c/c++
* Java
* HTML/CSS
* PHP
* MySQL
* ARM assembly

Out of those I prefer c and assembly, and doing things at a lower level in general. I would most like to have a job where I could work closer to the hardware, but it seems that that's a relitively rare so it wouldn't be a requirement or anything.

Projects I've done (that I'd be comfortable letting anyone see):

* 2 small Android apps
* an HTML/CSS website for my school magazine with a full PHP backend and MySQL database
* a 3D game engine with realistic physics in c++
* a c++ program that simulates a processor decoding and executing instructions and an accompanying assembler that will produce binaries from source files that use a very similar syntax to Intel
* a simple real time operating system for the raspberry pi in a mix of assembly and c (this one is a work in progress)
* an underhanded c entry that I'm planning to submit for the upcoming contest
* 8 week internship modelling [local operations and classical communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOCC) trees in c++

In addition to the above, I am a big participant in my school's programming club and I have worked on several things with them I figure I'll mention. I was a participant in a conference discussing better ways to teach web development in local schools. This was spearheaded by a local software company. I helped teach a computer science summer camp for incoming 6th graders. I also participated in a [smart cities ""hackathon""](https://www.us-ignite.org/globalcityteams/about/), and I have been told that our groups project was very well received when it was presented at the conference with all the other participating cities.

What I am asking here I suppose is twofold. First, What other kinds of things can I do this year to improve my chances of being able to get a job? Second, do you think I can get a job straight out of high school? I was hoping to take a year or more after high school to get a job and help pay for college. Even then then I'm thinking about going into computer or electrical engineering if I can. Thanks for reading."

My question I guess would geared towards the more experienced computer science majors. Could you guys tell me what technical skills employers are looking for. It seems that each position I see on the employer database requires the applicant to know like 7 different languages and be familiar with all operating systems. I guess in the long run this isn't bad as knowing more skills will only be more beneficial to me but I just wanted to get a student's take on it as I really doubt most computer science majors know like 5-6 different programming languages really well, but then again, maybe most do? Since I haven't interned for a computer science company before nor have I gone through the interview process since I'm fairly new to the content I figured you guys would have better input in regards to this. 

Generally what are the skills that students who get hired to facebook, amazon, etc have? Is it really just connections, as I just can't fathom that the only students who interned at these top companies were those who had connections. Does GPA really matter to computer science employers or is it just having a ton of great things in your portfolio like mobile apps etc. 

Also am I way over my head in thinking starting salary for a computer science major is around 70 k. Some people have told me that but I guess it varies because online I see it is around 55 k - 60 k. Any advice on how to acquire a high starting salary would be helpful too. 

Also I will have CMSC 131, CMSC 132, MATH 246 &amp; MATH 206 done so I'll know JAVA and MATLAB pretty well. I'm also going to be teaching myself MYSQL during the year.

I am currently a senior, and over the past week I have been constant contact with an academic adviser about getting into a course that I need to graduate. It all began due to the fact a female friend that had intended to graduate with myself asked to be put on a waitlist for, let's say ""Class A"", 2 weeks after I did. We both initially had an intended graduation August 2016 (accounting internships in the spring and take a class in the summer). I have a 3.93 GPA, so I've done well in school, and in order to maintain that for my applications to graduate school I chose to separate ""Class B"" and take it in the summer so I could also focus my time on it. Well, my female friend that has more credit hours than me, the same anticipated graduation as myself, and a request 2 weeks after mine got put in the class because she received ""must-have"" status, and I did not.

The reasoning for this provided by my adviser is that they were only letting student who were graduating in December 2015 into the class. However, this girl did not ever plan on graduating in December, and I was a bit confused as to why she was allowed in but I was not. I only lack 21 credit hours, so I told my adviser that I will just graduate this December instead of putting it off till the summer since I am going to be forced to take ""Class B"" this semester either way according to them. At the request of my adviser, I applied to graduate to the university and provided her proof of doing such. I think she was a bit surprised I actually did it, but still refused to add me to the class even though I had done what she said she wanted to do to allow me into the class. 

Now, this has been the backstory, and now comes the legal part. Of course, I knew as I bantered back and forth with the adviser that she was not pleased with me and that I may be forced to step on some toes if I want them to let me graduate. On Monday afternoon she had not responded to my 2 emails, I needed to have an answer by 3:30 (when University fees were due), and at 11:30 the advisers were in a meeting the remainder of the day. I found out the director (all of the advising staff's boss) was seeing students that had time sensitive matters. I went in to see him briefly, and at that point I had not decided to graduate in December and he simply told me there wasn't enough room in the class for a non-December graduate.

Of course this ticked her off when she got wind that I ""went over her head"", when it reality I was simply seeking a timely answer to my question that she was not providing. His job was to see students with time-sensitive issues, and that is exactly what I did. At this point I'm disappointed and frustrated that I did everything she asked me to as far as proving graduation date and still refused to admit me to the class, but here's the catch: I also work in this office as a student employee. I have worked in the advising office for 2 years, and have never had any problems and have gotten along famously with everyone (even this adviser).

When I came into work this morning my supervisor (who is also the administrative assistant for the office) whispered to me that ""everyone in the office knows about the your class situation."" All day at work I received plenty of glares from advisers that I had once gotten along perfectly fine with. She had shared my academic information and issues with not only the director that I had reached out to, but also the other advisers AND the administrative assistants (essentially everyone in the entire office). I feel that she has painted me in such a bad light simply because I disagreed with her and did the things she asked me to in order to graduate. I am at the point where it has created such a hostile work environment I feel I have no other options but to leave my job, which I do not want to have to do.

I sent her an email and asked if and why she shared my personal academic situation with the entire office, and she simply said that advisers have to discuss things like that in order to make sure they are consistent. I understand if one adviser explains to another, ""I have a students that is ______."" However, the fact that I was clearly mentioned by name simply because everyone knew me, and my private situation was spread across the entire office to try to make me look bad hurts so badly. To me, the fact that the administrative assistants are aware of the situation is more than enough evidence that this was simply using my academic situation as gossip instead of truly trying to ensure consistency.

I am aware that students have privacy rights through FERPA, but I also feel like my reputation was compromised simply because I was trying to do what was best for me. I don't have very much knowledge of law, but I would think the University would/should take the fact someone used my academic information as office gossip very seriously. All of my friends and family I have discussed it with think I should file a report of some sort, and I have even had friends suggest contacting legal council. Do I have any kind of legal footing here, or is she able to share my information freely with whoever she wants to? Thank you so much in advance."
3hoddn,1,2015-08-19,I somehow managed to get an informational interview with the CEO of a successful software development company. What should I expect and how do I not mess this up?,bleepsnap,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/3hoddn/i_somehow_managed_to_get_an_informational/,"A friend of mine introduced us on Linkedin and he (the CEO) agreed to meet with me for an hour. There was no discussion of what the purpose of the meeting will be other then to introduce ourselves.

I am not really sure what to expect or more importantly, what should I be aiming to achieve from this. I am not shy or timid, and have no problem meeting with people, but having such an ""undefined"" meeting is a little confusing to me.

A little background on myself. My undergrad was not CS related, but right out of college I went into a support position at a small software dev company. I moved up quickly by teaching myself SQL and ended up in a solutions engineer position. After a few years of this I decided I wanted to formalize my education and decided to go for my M.S in software engineering.

My wife at the time was having success in her career so I quit my job and went full time to school. Things went great and I graduated with a respectable GPA. I had an internship at a large insurance company as a DBA which resulted in a job offer but I turned it down to finish school. I graduated in may and played stay at home dad for the summer. Now my wife wants a break from work and it is my turn to step up to the plate.

The main problem I have is that my coding skills are amateur at best. During school, we focused on the ""engineering"" side of software dev, project management, databases, SDLC etc.... but there was much less coding taught than I expected. As a result, I now have a masters in the field and can't code.

I'm trying to figure out where to go from here. I don't think I would pass a technical interview, so I either shoot for an internship or pursue something like project/product management etc...

How do I present this information to him in a respectable manner?

What exactly should be the goal of the meeting?

Any additional thoughts or input would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!"

After a year or so he went back to school but kept the Best Buy job, going to school full time and working full time.  he's gotten a few promotions in the store and is now in a lower management spot making 15/hr plus some pretty big bonuses both monthly and annually and also really enjoying what he's doing.  There's an opening for the next step above his position in the store that he enjoys working at and he says he's the best candidate.  This job would earn 22/hr, overtime, benefits, and even larger bonuses than he makes now.

The only drawback is he was planning on starting his final year of school this fall.  He has to do an internship so working while doing so isn't as option.  He's in school for IT and also enjoys that field.

From the sounds of it to me he'd rather take this management job and also has the ambition to even move up further in the company.  At first I told him just go back to school, but at the end of the conversation my stance was he should apply for this job and finish his degree at a later time."

I was fortunate to have a job at that point but I also enjoyed the company. The money was good enough for me, and I was able to build a bit of a nest egg. But I woke up one day and realized that wasn't what I really wanted to do for the rest of my life. I wasn't particularly upset or unhappy with my job, I just wanted to switch directions. I had always been interested in programming, and dabbled with it a bit at home. So I decided I wanted to go back to school for computer science and become a programmer. I had enough money saved up to pay for the program without having any debt, so I figured why the hell not. I am about half way through my new degree right now, and I am finishing up my 2nd internship and I am realizing I don't fit in to that culture and not sure I want to do this either.

In the end, what I want is to just have a steady job with good pay where I can save for a semi-early retirement. But I also want to get along with my co-workers and make new friends. Everyone at the two places i've had my internship (even my part-time IT job) are all incredibly socially awkward. Seeing my savings dwindle every day has really taken a toll on me psychologically. I do have a part-time job but I live in a very high cost of living area so it really only pays my electric bill and groceries. I guess what I need is for someone to tell me to just stay the course and it will be worth it in the end? I'm having trouble seeing the light.


A large part of me wants to just get back working before my nest egg is completely gone. But there is a small part that knows i'm investing for my future. I did e-mail my old boss and he said I was welcome to come back, and damn it is tempting.  I don't want to get a programming job and realize I don't fit in and burn out and change paths again in 5 years.

My options are :

1) Take my old job, make an above average salary with decent work hours and a steady future.


2) Continue burning savings to get a CS degree and have a potential for a better paying job in the future where I have to start my nest egg from ground 0 again.

Before summer, I landed an internship for a private company that works for the city. I get paid $15.50/hour and its in the heart of downtown LA. The traffic is brutal, and I have to pay $8 every day for parking.


The worst part is, I've been doing nothing but IT/SysAdmin work and very basic front-end web development (pushing new files to update links on the website). I have no interest in web development, and I was assuming we would be doing Android application development. 


Instead, my average day is just me imaging and deploying computers, doing inventory, helping tech illiterates with computer problems, and browsing through emails. Doing whatever my supervisors give me to do. Sometimes I have to move inventory in the basement and get super sweaty and tired. Sadly, these are my favorite days because I don't have to deal with IT support. The other interns are mostly older people from trade schools like DeVry that I have to teach now and work with since I'm now the most ""senior intern"". I have absolutely no interest in working for any type of bureaucracy after this experience. I feel like I do just about the same things as full time Systems Admin employees do, but I get paid less, no benefits, and less hours.

They let us stay until a few months after we graduate, but I want to leave sooner. I may be making it sound worse than it actually is, but it hasn't been a pleasant experience.

I'm really hoping someone can give some insight on what I should shoot for earlier in my career (post-graduation) to set myself up for a successful CS career in the **long run**. Work for the big four? Get a MS from a top tier school? Just code a ton and contribute to open source? Take as many online courses as possible? 

**td;lr What major experience early on in your career opened the most doors for you in the long run?**

Summary of my personal situation: I've got an EE (borderline computer engineering) degree w/ 3.5 GPA for an average but solid university and 2 dev internships + freelance work on my resume (none of which I can share on GitHub). However, after graduating, I spent 3 years as a system engineer where I didn't write code much, but worked with code every day. I loved developing and want to come back, but my skills are rusty. I'm debating taking a job now at an average development company vs. taking some time off to code some open source stuff and take online courses (6 mo - 1 yr) vs. applying to grad school. My overall goal is to become a really great, truly skilled developer.

Thanks in advance for any and all thoughts or words of wisdom!"

“Ophelia?” 

I breathed into the phone like a freaking creeper. 

“Who is this?” I asked the question even though I was pretty sure what this guy was going to say.

“It's Svien.” the guy replied with just a hint of some accent. 

I slammed the phone down in the cradle and quickly pressed the DND button. The DND or do not disturb button is strictly forbidden, the firm where I work would have popped the damn buttons off the phone if they were not leasing the equipment. But Lexi and her mod squad made a habit of pushing their DND's whenever our attorney's where out of the office. But it was the first time I ever pressed mine. I know, I'm a giant nerd. 

Svien, he did say his name was Svien. My heart was thrumming and my cheeks where absolutely in flames. Lexi must have put one of the summer interns up to this. The “baby attorney's” is what they called the young men who interned at the office over the summer. It's 2015, but it may as well be 1959 around this place. Our law office was definitely a “good ol' boys” club. They never took on female attorney's or interns. They were Stetson law students, but Lexi and company treated them like personal cabana boys. 

They must had recruited one of them to mess with me. But that was low, even for Lexi. Sure she was a little vapid, but they weren't exactly the Heather's either. 

I picked up the phone and made an unprecedented call to my Psych for an emergency appointment. His receptionist, Steve, called me back ten minutes later and told me to come in that evening at 6:30. After I hung up I feeling like an idiot. I mean really? Did I honestly think there was some Stephen King bullshit going down. But I did what I always did and played the  “My parents were junkies” card.  Woe is Ophelia, messed up by her mommy and daddy. Blame it on them, they should at least be good for something right?

I dismissed the call and continued to run on my hamster wheel. 

As 5:00 approached I had almost banished the whole situation, until Carol came barging into my small office with a fist full of sticky notes. Carol is awesome. She is nearing sixty years old and still wears shoes from Fredrick’s of Hollywood. The Lexi's are always making fun of her but I love Carol. I think it's bad ass that she's still torturing her toes in the name of sexy. She's cannot be more than five foot and she is all tits. I call her bobble boobs but it is only with utmost respect. 

Bounce, Bounce, Bounce. She clopped in and shoved stack of boring yellow post-it's under my nose. 
“Ophelia! You're boyfriend has called like twenty times. I don't have time to deal with drama!”  She slapped the pale yellow stack in front of me then bounced off leaving a some floral Victoria Secret scent in her wake. 

“Sorry, Carol!” I called after her as I stared at the notes on the desk before me. Good night! There must be like 20 of them. Man, the copy room must be having a slow day, why would an intern call me so many times? I picked up the pile of yellow paper squares and fed them into the shredder. 

It was quitting time and time to see The Rapist, I mean Therapist.  

I love my therapist, I mean that in the most sickest and twisted way. I sit on his plush leather couch and dream of defiling him in the most wicked ways. That's another story. What I mean is he is not bad on the eyes. He's also a staunch Christian, but I don't hold that against him. He is firm and keeps my demons in check. Just what I need, and want. 

But this session wasn't going well. He was channeling Sigmund again. I know he is a Christian but I swear he must secretly  jack off to some weird shrine in his closet that has red candles and photos of Freud and Carl Jung. And you thought I was fuck up.  

“So why did you feel it was necessary to make up a lie? Why do you think that you couldn’t tell this co-worker that you were happy just being single?”

Oh man, he was doing that  “these are not the droids you are looking for”, mind raping Jedi shit again. 

“Aww come on! It's not some deep seeded psycho babble shit, I just wanted to fit in. What so wrong with that? You mean to tell me that you have never told a little lie just to fit it. That doesn't seem too crazy to me.” 

“I never said it was crazy. I just asked you why you felt like you needed to invent an alternate reality.”

“Really! I just said I already had a boyfriend, when Lexi was trying to set me up with one of her rejects. It's not like I hallucinated some whole other life.” 

He leaned back in his chair and rubbed his chin, I swear he wants me bite his lip when he does that. I know....I have issues. Anyway, the sexy psychologist keep annoying me with words. 

“So what about this phone call? The one who claimed to be Svien? Could it be that you miss heard them? Could it be that the person said another name, like Ben maybe, and that you just heard Svien, instead?” 

I hated when he made so much sense. 

“It's possible...I guess.” 
And then he asked the question that I always dread. 

“Have you been taking your medication regularly?” 

“Uh, yeah...sure.”  Medication Shmashion. 

Its not like I am on super anti psychotics or anything. So what does it matter if I miss a few pills here or there. 

“Good. Now I want you to close your eyes for me. Take a few deep breaths, that's right. Now, I want you think about Svien. Out of the cosmos of your imagination, think about how you created him from nothing. Now, tell me Ophelia, do you think you are a god?

“No.” I smirked. “If I were a god it would be awful. I would be smiting all kind of bitches.”

“How would you feel if I told you that you didn't exist? That Ophelia is someone I made up. You're whole existence was created simply to be a buffer, just to ease a social anxiety. Would you be okay with that? Or would rebel. Cry out to the world, that you exist?” 

For the first time in his office, I began to feel uneasy.  I bolted up right, my eyes wide open.

“What the hell is that suppose to mean?”  I had a strange urge to bite his lips, but this time there was nothing sexual about it. 

“I think we are done here tonight.” he scribbled away. Always scribbling, scribbling on that stupid note pad. God, I really wanted to read that note pad and then shove it up his tight Christian ass. It felt strange to be dismissed by him, it was like getting dumped mid-prom for your way hotter best friend.  

How utterly weird. Was my doctor suddenly swinging for team psycho? I gathered my purse and cardigan and stomped out of his office like a petulant 14 year old. I am good at that. 

Dr. Rigby's receptionist, Steve chased me down in the parking lot waving an appointment card. I wondered if Steve was also a patient of Dr. Rigby because he had the whole weird/awkward act down pat. I really hadn't paid him much attention until tonight.

He couldn't be much older than myself, but something about him smacked of multiple cats and t.v. dinners. Not that I am one to talk, one bird can tell another I guess.  Although our shared kinship in weirdom didn't make me anymore comfortable in his presence. 

He came bolting at me waving a little white card, and didn't stop until I was pressed up against my Prius. The dude had no concept of personal space. 

“Here...your next appointment card.” he panted into my face. 

If there was space enough to fit a single Skittle between our bodies, I would have been surprised. 

“Thanks.” I winced while reaching behind me for my door handle. And I thought I was strange, but this dude took the cake and a gallon of milk with it. I took the card from his spindly Nosferatu life fingers, but he remained perched above me, a pale blonde vulture bathed in a phosphorescent glow of the parking lot lights.  

Small talk! I screamed at myself, make with some small talk. 

“So, uh...sweet gig you got. Working for Dr. Rigby and all.” 

“Oh yes. Dr. Rigby is great. I use to be patient before he gave me this job.”

Nailed it! I knew he was a weirdo...just like me...but weirder.   

“Well I should be going now.” I swear the back of my head thumped against my driver-side window as I tried to lean away from him. 

Finally, Steve backed away. 

“Good night, Ophelia.”

The way he said my name made me feel like I swallowed a slug. Did I make people feel the same way? Probably. Fuck it. 

I was feeling slightly better after my appointment. Perhaps, Dr. Rigby was right. Maybe I was a little jumpy. Maybe I misunderstood the guy who called. But what about the messages that bobble boobs, dropped off at my desk? But who knows what they said. I didn't even read them. I am just blowing shit majorly out proportions. Of course I am. But you know, I wasn't. 

I got home to my modest apartment and proceeded to wipe the Steve residue off my face when my cell went off. 

Private caller: I know you must be home now. 

Me: Who is this? How did you get my number?  

The last time I gave my number out it was when I filled out paperwork at my dentists office and I wasn't even close to a needing a cleaning. 

Private caller: You're silly, you know that. Did you wear that yellow sweater today? You look good in yellow. 

My stomach clenched as I looked to my cardigan, laying in a crumpled yellow ball at the end of my couch. My cell buzzed again and my heart was drenched in a shot of adrenaline. This is stupid, I chastised myself. Lexi and her stupid cabana boys must be having a slow week. Nothing to do but screw with the office geek.  

Private caller: I miss you. 
Strange how those three words had the ability to chill me right down to the marrow.  Suddenly my cozy little apartment felt cavernous.  Was is cold? Surely not. It's August in Florida, the closest you can actually get to hell without dying. Should I reply? Probably not. So I did.

I need help in school.,y0urplaceormine,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3hueld/future_looks_bleak_i_need_help_in_school/,"Currently in my junior year in university and I feel terrible and stressed out about school since it started a week ago. Tanked a couple of C's last semester and my GPA really went to shit. Doesn't look like there's any hope in salvaging it now, especially at the rate that I'm going. It was ok since I had the summer break to mull over stuff, however once school resumed I felt really depressed again and I feel so much dread going to school. My friends can feel it but I try to keep my feelings from my family - they don't know anything much about how I'm doing in school, maybe it's better that way. 

I'm having trouble choosing the classes to take simply because I am so lost. I chose to be a finance and marketing major, however I really don't think I can do well in finance. I just believed that I should learn something useful while in university. Problem is, with my GPA so low, I doubt I can land any internships in the near future that are related to finance, or marketing internships that I am interested in. At this rate, getting a job out of college would be very very tough as well. What should I do? I feel so lost in school and my future career path, and I don't see any hope in finding my way anytime soon. "

So I I'm a senior year computer science student. I have had one internship before, in finance. I interviewed with a tech startup and didn't hear from them for months, so I assumed they were not interested in me and took a campus job. 

I got an email today from the tech startup telling me they would like me to intern for them. But I've already accepted this campus position (admin assistant). The campus job starts Monday the 24th, and the internship starts the Monday after. Also, the campus job is pretty much guaranteed until next May, but the internship is only until December. 

I don't know what to do, and I'm very nervous about the possibility of turning down either. Unfortunately, I cannot fit both jobs in my schedule. Plus, the tech startup doesn't even know my school schedule, while the campus job of course generously works around it. I would be working about 20 hours a week at either of them. 

One more issue... I live close enough to the campus to walk. The internship is a 20 minute drive and I would have to coordinate with my roommate (we share a car). But I'm afraid I'll be kicking myself for not taking the internship one day when I'm struggling to find a job. This was probably a scatter-brained wall of text.

I'm set to graduate May 2016, but I may delay my graduation to December 2016. 

I already have a year long co-op under my belt, along with a summer internship and a year of part-time work at a small web development company. At this point I'm thinking... will ANOTHER internship really make that much of a difference? And as for finishing up a math major, I do plan on getting my Master's in CS (part-time!), so I'm sure the math major could help out with that. One thing to consider though is that the professors for the remaining classes I have to take are notorious for really, really sucking so there's a good chance I won't get much out of the classes anyway.

Pros for May 2016: Graduating sooner, full-time salary sooner, can get started on my M.S earlier.

Pros for December 2016: Math major, extra internship, extra preparation time for interviews and projects. No additional cost, scholarship will cover it. 

Cons for May 2016: Possibly closing doors to opportunities by giving up all the things listed under December 2016 pros.

Cons for December 2016: Good chance I'll be dreading every second of the additional 7 months I chose to stay for. It also may not make any career difference at all.

The first year I got paid hourly(while I was finishing college) and now have moved on to salary.  I haven't really recieved a raise except for when I was considered full time and he said it was for drive time/gas for driving to our customers locations.

Anyways I feel I have leared alot over the last 2 years and know all of the customers, their systems, setting up and maintaining servers and can handle everything my more experienced co-worker is able to handle.  

Also my boss has been telling me how good of a job i've been doing and proud that I have been handling 99% of the work and work tickets that's in our 2 man department(3 if you include my boss).  

Today I have been informed that my co-worker has put his 2 week notice in. My boss told me he is looking to hire someone else and has a few interview next week and if I know anyone with some networking expierence that he would hire them.  

Whoever they hire they will have to get trained in our customers systems, learn where our customers are located, their software, the list goes on and on.  

I really enjoy my job and couldn't ask for a better boss but I feel like I just don't get paid enough in the field I'm working in(it's about 9/hour after I calculate all the hours I put in).  

Also I do plan on moving out of my moms house but with the money I'm making now I don't feel that could ever be an option(unless I live in a cardboard box on the street).

My Mom, Grandma, GF and most of the people I know have gave me the advice that I should ask for a raise but I'm not sure if it's a good time to bring it up or not, especially with a 1 year of being full time around the corner.  I mean the worst thing my boss could say is no, right?

[I'm a second year aeronautical engineering student at Clarkson university, and have always been interested in what NASA and others have been able to do.  How did you all get hired? And how would someone looking to get into the field go about finding a job/internship?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3hvybf/were_members_of_solar_probe_plus_spp_nasas/cub317j?context=5)|There's a couple of paths to finding a job here.  One is through applying to the website, another is if APL is doing a campus visit. (I'm not sure if we visit Clarkson).  We also have at least four internship programs at APL that I know of.  One is our ASPIRE program for high school kids (a little late for you :), a NASA internship program, an Advanced Applications Scholars program, and a program for students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), and Minority Institutions (MIs).
 |If you get a chance to go to a big conference then this would be a great opportunity to network with companies and universities about prospective opportunities. Otherwise most universities advertise internships on their websites. Internships are one of the best ways to get experience while you are still a student and this will give you a more complete resume when applying for jobs - NJF.
[You mentioned that SPP is going to do 24 orbits around the sun.  How accurately do you know where SPP will be during the 24th orbit?  Can you estimate within 100 miles of where it will be, 1 mile, 10,000 miles?  What software do you use to calculate the spacecraft's path?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3hvybf/were_members_of_solar_probe_plus_spp_nasas/cub2ed5?context=5)|Some of our team members are mission designers. They come up with the trajectory we'll fly, including Venus flybys and trajectory correction maneuvers - right now, we're planning on something like 42 maneuvers to keep on course. Our plan is to hit our perihelion target of about 4 million miles within 500 miles.
 |Others of our team are navigators. They use data from the Deep Space Network to figure out where we are and what maneuvers we need to get us where we want to go. As part of this they have to consider effects like solar radiation pressure and forces due to torque control on the spacecraft.
 |There are several software packages we use to do this work, most standard tools in the space business. These mostly use differential equation integrators to model the flight trajectory, including gravity and relativistic effects, or are Monte Carlo calculations to make statistical corrections to our trajectory. Unfortunately, I can't remember the names of the software packages... :)

That's great to hear!  For me, a computer science degree was my path to working on a spacecraft, but building a spacecraft requires many different fields:  this includes not only the STEM fields but also business backgrounds to keep track of our budgets, program managers to keep the project moving ahead, editors to help us write coherently (very helpful, I can say!) and many others.

[ of all good luck and big respect, my question would be how much of the tasks are automated ? i work in automation :p.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3hvybf/were_members_of_solar_probe_plus_spp_nasas/cub1yk7?context=5)|In terms of how we build the spacecraft and write the software, or in terms of what the spacecraft will do during the mission? Personally, I automate as much as possible in terms of what I'm assigned to do.
 |The spacecraft itself is also extremely automated. All pointing and trajectory corrections are commanded at a high level (e.g. ""keep the thermal protection shield pointed at the sun"", ""point antenna to the earth""), and the software works out the details. We also let the probe autonomously adjust the solar panel positions, to get enough power without overheating.
 |All of this is separate from what we call the Autonomy software, which is continually monitoring the spacecraft for signs of things going wrong, and will take corrective action to keep things working as well as possible.

 |We have only 3 things that will move throughout the mission: the two solar panels can rotate on two axes each (to get more power and cool off, depending on how close the sun is), and the high gain antenna rotates back and forth to point at the earth and downlink science data. You might also count the water flowing throughout the solar array cooling system (and the pumps that move it), and then I suppose you'd also have to count the propellent in the fuel tank, and the thruster valves as they fire.

 |Slight correction: the project doesn't necessarily have to be experimental, just more amenable to the more iterative Agile methods. Many ground software tools are developed in a scrum or kanban or other process, because it is possible to release a version of the software to users every few weeks, and incorporate feedback into the next release.

First, the Sun interferes with the RF signal, so we can't communicate when the Sun and Probe are lined up relative to the Earth. Second, the instruments and the telecomm system can't be operated at the same time due to power limitations. So we take data when we're close to the Sun and downlink the data when we're further away. (except we do occasionally get a beacon tone while we're close to the Sun to let us know things are ok). This is why the spacecraft is so automated.

I am coming off of my first internship after my freshman year with a well known tech company and have some research experience with bioinformatics and autonomous robotics (specifically control systems), but I am not really happy with what I did over the past internship. 

The work was technically challenging (and looks good on a resume) but my dream has been to do OS development (or maybe some systems engineering type work) of some sort, which basically either leaves working for Apple, Microsoft, or just submitting patches to the Linux kernel for free (which I can't really afford to spend time doing, gotta pay for school somehow!).

I applied to Microsoft and Apple last year but literally just got ignored, didn't even get a cookie cutter rejection email from them!



So a quick recap of my info:



- Rising Sophomore (Class of 2018)


- GPA: 3.6 overall, Dean's List at my school for freshman year


- 1 year of on campus research experience so far, with an expected publication in a decent journal in the next few months


- Did a Software Engineering Internship after freshman year at a major tech company in my area 


- Go to a large, well regarded public school in my area




Is there anything else I can do to get into a company that does serious OS development? I feel like I have tried everything in my power to do so, the only connections that I have are to the tech company I worked at. Does anyone on reddit have any advice on how to break my way in? Or at least some alternative companies also doing some really cool OS work?"

I'm technically a junior, but I had a bit of an odd situation this semester.

First of, I am a computer science major and math minor. I am mostly in my major/minor for the career aspect. I am a really shitty programmer and mathematician to be honest. I grew up in the country with dialup. I came from a town where over half of our grade failed the state standardized tests for reading and math and over 40 kids failed to graduate out of a class of 300 or so. It was never really tough to be smart or at the top at my school, people who worked hard and studied were often bullied and made fun of by people. I took AP courses and tests, only got 3s on them and only got a 27 on my ACT. I actually got lower on my second try at the ACT and that was devastating to me, especially when my friends who were out partying the night before all got 30s. 

I went to college my first year didn't study all that much and got mostly A's the first semster. Then B's thr second semester and in my second year things got worse. About halfway through my fall 2014 semester I started skipping class a lot to spend the night playing video games and watching youtube. I made it by the skin of my teeth and got C's and my GPA right now is about 2.6 or so.

So, spring comes around and the habits stay the same and I start failing hard. This makes me depressed and I skip class more and more often and eventually it climaxs with me going crazy and going to kill myself by jumping into the Mississippi River. I don't and end up in the hospital. The semseter goes on and I have to drop all my classes. I come back home for the summer and work 40 hours a week at a fast food job while all my old friends are out of state getting huge money working as interns for some pretty high name companies (Amazon, 3M...)

I have no friends at home of in college. The two years I spent there I spent alone in my dorm room and couldn't find anyone to relate to. Even my first year when I shared a floor with people in my major they never had any intersts with me. I liked RPGs and they only played FPS games that I never liked. They'd go out drinking and smoke weed and I'd never go because I don't partake in that stuff and the only people I could find that didn't partake in that stuff either were all religious amd I'm not religious.

And here I stand. I have no motivation anymore in my life and I can't find anyway to motivate myself to go to class anymore. I don't know how to study or how to stop playing games to get to studying. I have no friends, my parents are constantly worried I'm going to kill myself. I've tanked my GPA and have no work experience and can never get an internship anywhere good. I have nothing positive to look forward to in my life, I'm completely unhealthy in terms of food and hygiene and I know I should change thise things, but can't even get motivated to do that. Plus, I'm downright miserable in my major, but I don't want to chqnge change because of the money and 90% of the majors out there have NO job outlook whatsoever. I'll never be rich or famous or popular or do anything remotely useful with my life so maybe I should just kill myself. I just wish my parents were dead so I wouln't feel so guilty about doing it.

It sucks because I had hopez of travelling abroad for a semester or going to grad school, but I really seemed to fuck it up beyond belief and threw away my future."

I am really lost and stuck in my career right now, dont have anyone to ask. Please help.

Story: 
I am a girl, jobless now, got 2-years cs diploma, 1.5 years software dev work experience. CS was the only thing I enjoyed in high school so I took 2-years cs at uni. Completed 2 soft dev internships. First one was stressfull but still enjoyable, learnt some good stuff. Second one was complete failure, hated it. Got my first ft job, didnt pass probation cuz I am not able to code well enough (+ each f task is totally new, its never ending f learning) and I didnt like sitting at computer whole day, missed social part a lot. My condition is that I have to have technical job for next two years. I dont have any interest anymore. If not the condition, I would try all my best to change careers. Only one reason why I would stay in cs is money. I do enjoy database work but its super hard to get into db as a junior.

I spent so much time on computer science, just to come to conclusion that this job is not for me :( I have to get a new technical job and do it for 2 years maximum. I am looking into help desk/qa/technical support. I am pushing myself to study, I hate job search, I hate computer science related jobs, my first fulltime experience was awful, I am afraid next job is gonna be the same. Job search is discouraging, last time I applied for over 500 jobs and got only 20-30 replies back. I applied for jnr dba positions recently but started crying right away cuz I know they wont call me. Whats point of applying if there is no result ;( I dont care about computers, dont wanna do any extra projects, dont wanna excel in it.

but I still have to do it.

ps: i got some brain, got very high grades at uni. 

Is there any way to gain interest back? I remember myself at high school and cs was really my main hobby back then. And I geniuly loved it altough it was still tough. I hate studying programming languages, its useless.  I dont have any project ideas. I consider myself junior level knowledgable in java and sql (not worse than typical comp sci grad if not better).

Please help me, I really dont know what to do now, I am totally lost, dont know what to do with my life."

I'm 21 and I can't even go out to places past 9PM. My mom only has me, so she is extremely paranoid whenever I go out thinking that something will happen to me. She have told me before that if anything ever happens to me, she might as well just die. But anyway, she wasn't this strict before I had my SO. Me and my SO have been dating for 5 months now, he is my first boyfriend, we love each other so much and we have basically planned out our future together already. It's a very mature relationship. I hid this from mom until 3 months ago, because I felt guilty (wish I never told her fml). She only lets us hang out on Sundays but I have to be back by 4 always. I babysit my sister who is 5 while she goes to work, and when I tell her to bring my sis to aunt's so I can do something, she's scared that my SO and me will be in the same room. Yesterday, she told me that ""one day while you two are alone in the house and in the same room, he will hold you down onto the bed"" and i'm just like wtf? Why would she say something like that. She wants me to babysit my sister next summer while she goes to work and I told her I'm graduating soon so I need to find a summer internship to secure a job and she says stuff and thinks I'm lying and I'm just saying that so I can go out and play with my SO. Whenever I try to reason with her, she says things like ""oh so I see that you've grown wings now, you're gonna leave me I see how it is"" and it pisses me off. The last time we argued, I told her I wish I had never told her about me dating my SO and then she replied, ""that's how you get pregnant"" and that just made me burst in tears, why would you say something like that to your daughter. Okay, so me and my SO did give our virginity to each other, but we're adults and this is normal. She doesn't know about this btw. But she keeps guilt tripping me by saying how I should preserve my virginity until marriage because that's oh-so important and if my family knows all of them will laugh at me and call me stupid. Every time she says something about my SO, I defend him (rightfully so, because she attacks his character sometimes and he's a sweetheart) and she says things like ""now that you have a bf you don't care about me anymore, you always defend him"". OMG, I have 2 years until I graduate I literally don't know how I will continue to handle shit like this. 

Crap, I didn't know how long this rant ended up becoming. Still hoping anyone who have had parents like this help me out."

I'll be starting at my local University as of January 2016 working on a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science.  Specifically the Software Systems track.  

I had a few questions/concerns regarding this decision.  I may just be paranoid due to the fact that it is 4 years out of my life dedicated to this.  

1.  How difficult is it to find a job after getting a Bachelor of Computer Science?  I see that most job listings seem to require/prefer a degree, and 2-4++ years of experience.  

2.  By the time I finish the year will be 2020.  At the rate of technological advancement, would it seem ridiculous to believe there is a chance that CS jobs may become more sparse due to more people going into this industry, along with job automation?  

3.  I have already been studying Computer Science on my own for about 6 months now, and I know enough Python, Ruby, and C# to write basic programs (100-300 lines of code) with very basic algorithmic structure, does this mean that CS will be easier for me to pass with higher grades? And if I do obtain high grades will this give me a better opportunity for internships?   

4.  Is there any other advice you could give to people like me that you wish you had received before getting your degree?"

My friends and I [21M] were camping when two park rangers snuck up on us and told us our music was too loud and we were talking too loud as well. We apologized, saying we didn't know we were bothering others and that we would completely comply. (Side note: after they left we turned our music back on to the same levels just to see, and they couldn't actually hear the music from the road, they just made it up to walk on our campsite. Doesn't change anything though. Apparently the rangers at this park target younger folks like us)  
  
What I forgot was I had less than an eighth of weed, a grinder, a bowl and swishers on the picnic table. The officer said who's is this? And my gf and I took the tickets as it was our weed. It is a DNR civil ticket, not a criminal charge. So I got that going for me I guess.   
  
The police said that if we go to court, then there is a chance the charges can be decreased to something else, whether it be a possession of paraphernalia or even just littering. I would really rather my parents not find out (of course, but still needs to be said). If I go to court is there anything I should do/say to helpfully get the charges changed or dropped? Is this common or did they just say that so I didn't get more upset on the spot? Do I need a lawyer? I can't afford one on my own, so maybe I have to ask for my parents help but I think they would be extremely disappointed and do idk what else.   
  
We never even smoked before they came and found out. I'm really concerned that this possession charge will just fuck me in every way possible for finding jobs, as I'm ending an internship now that, if offers me a full time job, will most likely do a second background check. Other companies too and I'm worried they will just reject me because of my record.  
  
I really appreciate any help and advice you guys have. I'll be checking this post regularly, so hopefully I will be quick to respond to any comments."

3hztvu,6,2015-08-22,Should I stick with my current major or switch to a different one? Or do something else? I'm completely lost.,Hopeless_Chump,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/3hztvu/should_i_stick_with_my_current_major_or_switch_to/,"I'm 23 and a senior at a local university while living with my parents.  I feel like I should already be graduated, have a job, and be living on my own, but here I am waffling around in indecision and doubt.  

My current major is Criminal Justice.  I wanted to get into an investigative field initially, but I've done literally nothing to set myself apart.  All the things I planned to do (get fit, learn another language, become more social, get a job, do multiple internships) I just haven't.  Now I'm left with an uninspiring major and an even more uninspiring individual.  On top of that, I have zero interest in becoming a police offer or anything of the sort, which is the job that everyone brings up when they hear my major.  I also don't feel like I've really learned anything and the careers I had hoped for (like on the federal level) seem out of reach.  

The major that I am considering changing to is Computer Science.  I have *some* experience with computers and coding, albeit quite sparse.  I've built several computers, maintained a website for a small business in my family, and took some advanced computer classes in high school, but nothing really beyond that.  This degree would open up a lot more job opportunities, including working in the investigative field if I so choose (something like computer forensic analyst or something).

The main problem with getting a CS degree is the time (and effort/difficulty, of course).  It'll take a few more years and I'm already 23.  But on the flipside, I don't want to finish out this last year or my current major and be unable to find a job.  Then I'd just have wasted a year and a bunch of money and I'd stil have to decide whether I want to pursue another degree or just get whatever job I can.

3hzuzy,56,2015-08-22,"I found weird job postings online for Jackson, Michigan...",CollegeKid0,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3hzuzy/i_found_weird_job_postings_online_for_jackson/,"I woke up bright and early this morning thanks to an ever so gentle breeze, and the sound of a delivery truck backing up for what seemed like an eternity. Since I was awake I took advantage of the situation, brewed up a pot of coffee, and got on my laptop ready to apply for any job available. See, I’m in college and after eating ramen and mac and cheese days on end, you get sick of it, literally. My only approach to remove myself from the restraints of the sodium filled noodles was to get a part-time job. So be it.

 I sat down with my fresh cup of energy/bowel cleanser and began to search for a job. I frequent many online job applications that are filled with posting for about anything. You can search by company, keywords, or even just the zip code you prefer. Again, being a college student, I have no room to be picky, so I just enter the zip code I’m in and boom! Pages on pages of mostly minimum wage jobs! So be it. Page after page, everything is basically the same. I am just looking at the wages and seeing what fits my previous experience. After searching for what seems like hours, I notice something a tad weird, now I’m not really a paranoid person, but some things just seem too related to possibly be coincidental. 

I begin noticing frequent job posting from the Center for Disease Control (CDC), Department of Homeland Security, some state agencies practically giving money away for new morticians, doctors, and coroners, and oh, the national guard has immediate openings in literally every single field possible, but a noticed a large amount of jobs mostly being a combatant position, and some medical positions. Now I tried to brush it off, there is some intern who probably gets a list from state and national agencies on a frequency who posts these jobs, which would explain everything. I dismissed it and continued searching for something that won’t entirely drain my soul. 

There was more, but these were brand new. See, I stepped away for about forty-five minutes to grab another cup of coffee, toss a load of laundry in, and generally just waste time. I sat back to the glaring view of endless postings with another cup of coffee and a determination to find a job. I clicked refresh to see if there was any new postings in the last hour. There was, 7 new posts, all from FEMA. I clicked on the link to view all the posts, and while the titles varied from various scientist, large population managing positions. I clicked a link that opened a webpage that gave a more descriptive overview of the job. I followed more links, which almost seemed endless until I accidentally got onto a page I’m pretty sure I shouldn’t have. I was clicking various links including employee portals, etc. Now, I think I found a loophole that allowed me to view a schedule, which seemed pretty private, why would I be able to get to it with any logins? This must not be illegal, so I clicked to view it larger. My eyes grew wide and my jaw slowly opened as I leaned in just to make sure I was truly seeing what was written. Posted 4 days ago on an employee schedule was something along the lines of saying, “ALL EMPLOYEES::MESSAGE IMPORTANCE LEVEL:BLACK: ALL EMPLOYEES: A mandatory training session has immediately been scheduled for MONDAY, AUGUST 24TH(TWENTYFORTH).2015. AUGUST 24TH(TWENTYFORTH).2015. All employees receiving this schedule update shall report to an undisclosed location in JACKSON, MICHIGAN, UNITED STATES, GNIS 0629165 08:00AM. All employees shall receive an automated email containing information pertaining to location of field briefing. All training simulations will be explained on site, and shall remain undisclosed until 08:00AM AUGUST 24, 2015. 

	I copied and pasted the above quoted text but when it was pasted in was shown with strikethroughs, sorry for that. But what the hell, Jackson, Michigan. My city? Only like 30,000 people live here, we have a somewhat high unemployment rate, yet a national agency who protects us during a major crisis is doing an undisclosed simulation here? I really have no idea what is possibly going on. How can this just be coincidental? Yeah some things can be explained to ease that weird feeling in your gut, but sometimes, your body is telling you not to be stupid, it’s right in front of your face. I think something is going on in Jackson, Michigan. I just don’t know what. Something seems off though. I paced around my house for hours before deciding I had to go out and get some fresh air, and probably something to eat. I sat up from chair, my butt hurting for sitting hours on hours, and a distinct patch of sweat building under my arms. It wasn’t hot inside? Wow, I must be paranoid. I headed to my car, turned on the radio, and drowned out my thoughts to top 100 generic songs on my way to get something to eat. Nothing seemed really weird, it was typical Jackson. 

I turned into a McDonalds and proceed to head to the drive through for some artery clogging happiness. I wasn’t exactly sure what I wanted, and a very large black suburban was behind me. Now normally I don’t care. I was here first, I’ll take my time. Although, he continued to nudge forward. He did this until he was literally a hair away from my bumper, again, I don’t really care, but dude, just relax, we’re all hungry. I paid, got my order, and proceeded, to pull away, the suburban behind me only got a drink. How did I know? Because after he grabbed it he stepped on it, screeching his tires in an attempt to get right behind me. What is with this guy? Whatever, I put on my blinker and as the mind numbing tick tock tick tock tick tock of the blinker chirp, I notice the suburban literally inches from my car again, I’m not sure if my previous paranoia added fuel to the fire, but now I was starting to sketch out. What does this dude want with me? I’m sorry I took a bit to order buddy? I finally am able to make my turn, and just behind me follows the suburban. Again, paranoid, but it’s a busy boulevard, so not unlikely. I drive down the road and get into the left turning lane onto a one way, my road. And who’s following? The suburban. Okay, now I am really worried. I basically know all my neighbors, and no one drives a suburban, all my neighbors are basically retired folk. Now, I know when you think you’re being followed you are supposed to drive to a police station or something of the like, but I just wanted to be inside my house. I pulled in my driveway and breathed a sigh of relief when he sped past me as I pulled in, hey he almost hit me as I was pulling in, but again, he’s gone. I don’t care. I sit down with my meal, watch some tv, and begin to relax.

 I must have fallen asleep, because when I woke up, the smell of old McDonald’s hit me, along with the fact that it’s dark now. I stand up to stretch, toss out the trash, and head to bed. I go to lock my door, and something caught my eye though the little glass pane on my door, the god damn black suburban was parked about 50 feet from my driveway. What.the.fuck. Am I being stocked? Is it a government agent coming to arrest me for viewing something online I shouldn’t of? I sketched the hell out, called my friend, and asked him if I could stay the night, explaining I think someone is stalking me, I chose not to inform him of my findings online, he might call me crazy and just being paranoid. I really don’t know what is going on, but I am going to get some sleep, and see if I can discover anything else tomorrow. Anyone living in Jackson, Michigan, be careful on Monday.

3hzvh3,0,2015-08-22,Should I stick with my current major or switch to a different one? Or do something else? I'm completely lost.,Hopeless_Chump,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3hzvh3/should_i_stick_with_my_current_major_or_switch_to/,"I'm 23 and a senior at a local university while living with my parents.  I feel like I should already be graduated, have a job, and be living on my own, but here I am waffling around in indecision and doubt.  

My current major is Criminal Justice.  I wanted to get into an investigative field initially, but I've done literally nothing to set myself apart.  All the things I planned to do (get fit, learn another language, become more social, get a job, do multiple internships) I just haven't.  Now I'm left with an uninspiring major and an even more uninspiring individual.  On top of that, I have zero interest in becoming a police offer or anything of the sort, which is the job that everyone brings up when they hear my major.  I also don't feel like I've really learned anything and the careers I had hoped for (like on the federal level) seem out of reach.  

The major that I am considering changing to is Computer Science.  I have *some* experience with computers and coding, albeit quite sparse.  I've built several computers, maintained a website for a small business in my family, and took some advanced computer classes in high school, but nothing really beyond that.  This degree would open up a lot more job opportunities, including working in the investigative field if I so choose (something like computer forensic analyst or something).

The main problem with getting a CS degree is the time (and effort/difficulty, of course).  It'll take a few more years and I'm already 23.  But on the flipside, I don't want to finish out this last year or my current major and be unable to find a job.  Then I'd just have wasted a year and a bunch of money and I'd stil have to decide whether I want to pursue another degree or just get whatever job I can.  

Another worry is that I don't know what's even possible.  I transferred to this university from a community college.  Would I be able to go back to that community college and take some of the required courses and transfer them over?  What happens to grants/scholarships if I take a semester off?

I've asked around and have only gotten cookie cutter answers like ""join clubs!"" and ""get involved!"" but I'm not really sure what that means. What do these internships look for? Are there any local (Gainesville) ones worth getting? I'm a computer science major (college of engineering), but the only internships I have found on the internet have been business/marketing. I'm willing to get involved in clubs that will help me reach this goal, but so far I haven't found any active computer science related clubs on campus. I feel really stuck, so any tips to set me in the right direction would be much appreciated."

3i0ysv,3,2015-08-22,"Post-bac, non-trad seeking advice for upcoming school year",-drewser-,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3i0ysv/postbac_nontrad_seeking_advice_for_upcoming/,"Hello, /r/cscareerquestions, and thank you for reading.

As the title states, I'm a post-bac seeking to change careers to software development.

I've spent most of my career in journalism, with stints in IT, sales, and marketing. My previous degree was a BA in economics.

I finished my prereqs at a community college (3.9 GPA), and subsequently gained entry into a BS program at University of Washington-Bothell (I would have preferred UW-Seattle, but they wouldn't accept me as a post-bac).

I didn't apply for internships this summer because they unanimously required that I be enrolled in a CS program, and I didn't receive my acceptance letter from UWB until about six weeks ago. Instead, I took a contract gig with a consulting firm doing marketing project management work at Microsoft's Redmond campus. Despite rave reviews for my performance (including writing lots of VBA macros for my team), my contract wasn't renewed after the team's busy season ended.

Since I'm a post-bac, I don't get any grant money, and my financial aid package barely covers tuition. My folks are providing me some zero-interest loans to help me cover rent, and I have some cash to fall back on. However, I will likely need either a part-time job or I will have to take out private loans.

I'm now debating what to do with the remainder of my summer (about a month until the school year starts) and possibly for work during the school year. Currently I'm spending most of my free time learning C++, since my prereqs were taught in Java/Python, and UWB's core classes are in C++. Would I have any chance of convincing a local software firm to take me on part-time during the school year if I'm willing to take a middling salary of $15/hr? My thought was to write a cover letter expressing these sentiments, then blasting it to every firm I can find in Seattle. Should I consider going through a recruiter (I know a few technical recruiters from previous jobs and networking)?

Any advice is welcome. Thanks again for reading."

3i12zv,1,2015-08-22,I think it's impossible to tell my skill level when applying for a job.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3i12zv/i_think_its_impossible_to_tell_my_skill_level/,"**TL;DR:** How can someone accurately tell their skill level, when their job is easy?

I thought I was entry level, but I got my first internship, it took absolutely no time for things to get easy.  I am bored out of my mind and this job has me using 3 languages a couple tools and more, yet I'm not feeling challenged.  
I am a polyglot and I overstudied (20+ books)

I get it, I picked a job that was meant for people who are new when I'm ""experienced""

Problem is I never worked a software job before this so I was ""inexperienced""  but here I am, feeling like I'm way out of this position's league and I feel like quitting cause it's boring. 
There are hard software jobs out there that require a lot of experience, but how the heck am I supposed to know my own skill level compared to the jobs skill level?

What does 3 years experience really mean?  Some people might ask for that when the job is easy enough for someone who has less than a year?  
I don't get what I'm supposed to do, if I apply for a job do I say I'm good or not?  How can I know if I'm good when I don't even know what the company will ask of me?

This whole time I could've been thinking that I wasn't good enough for some jobs.  I feel so freaking stupid for being humble.

I think if I worked this job for years, it would be **dishonest** to say I have years of experience.

I feel like I overstudied, I read about 20 books..took codeschool and many other online courses, made about 30 projects but I have no experience so I had to apply for an internship or relocate."

Thoughts?,concealing,IBM,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBM/comments/3i1lg3/im_an_intern_and_i_received_a_fulltime_offer/,"I know there's a general negative sentiment here, but I thought I'd ask anyway.     

I've been an intern here (IBM Canada) for over a year, and my manager offered me a full time position when I graduate in 2016. My manager wants me to complete the paperwork soon if I'm okay to go ahead with it.

I won't be returning to the exact same team, but to the same product area (IBM Analytics) as a software developer. Starting salary is ~$70k, which I think is high for Canada.

This is not my ""dream job"" but I wonder if I'm being naive if I turn it down. My internship was decent - got experience working with several teams, met some knowledgeable people, but the work itself was not terribly interesting. I'm lukewarm about returning; I don't see myself here full time. Plus, all the RAs and general gloom of this subreddit don't lift my spirits.   

My manager said things can change eight months from now, essentially saying that I don't have to go through with it even if I complete the paperwork. Thus, I am thinking of accepting the offer and later saying no. I was worried about the repercussions of doing so, but my manager seems understanding about things that can come up when extending an offer so early.  

Do you think I should accept the offer as a backup, and continue looking for other jobs? If I can't find work elsewhere, IBM wouldn't be a bad place to start my career. Otherwise, do you think I should refuse, since I have my mind set on other opportunities?  

**Edit: Thanks everyone for your input.** Lots of things to think about. You've made convincing arguments for accepting, and I realize this offer is probably one of the better ones a new grad could hope for."
3i24vg,1,2015-08-23,My ex took our dog against my wishes. What would you do?,morthond,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3i24vg/my_ex_took_our_dog_against_my_wishes_what_would/,"Calling her ""our dog"" is pretty charitable. Six years into our relationship of over nine years, my ex decides that she needs to go to Florida for her internship.  There's no discussion about how I feel about moving to Florida.  I do express my feelings, but they're ignored.  I didn't realized that this was the nature of our relationship until it was over.  I'm just expected to move to Florida if I want to stay with her.  In fact, I found a letter from her that says ""Please don't leave.  Please stay with me."" as though I had ever considered leaving her.  It's such a weird manipulation, acting as though the ball is in my court, when she's really calling the shots (ew, mixing two sports idioms).

Anyway, so, I give up everything I'm doing and go to Naples Florida to be with her. It's an old people city that closes down at 6PM. There's nothing to do, no youth. I don't have TV or internet. She's working 11 hours a day. During ""season"" she works even more.  At one point she worked 13 hours per day for two weeks without any days off.

I'm lonely as fuck.  I'm alone almost all the time.  All I do is practice the guitar.  So, I decide I want to get a dog.  My ex goes along with it, but she's too busy with work to really care.  She just tags along.  This is like my thing.  I pick the dog, Rowen, out at the pound.  I pick her up.  This is the first pet of my own.  I even say to my ex ""It's really important to me that this dog likes me."" and I'm really serious because growing up we had to give our first dog away after a few months and our second dog was a sheltie that bonded with my mom and didn't really care for anyone else.  I really wanted a dog of my own because I had never really gotten to experience having a bond with a dog. So, having nothing else to do, I take care of Rowen all day.  I walk for hours.  I play in the yard.  I take her to the dog park for hours and hours every day.  Everyone knows me.  They call me Rowen's dad.  I take her to training classes.  I do everything it takes to take care of a puppy.  She was a puppy, by the way.

So, after a year, we move back to Pittsburgh, and for about three months my ex is out of work.  I work from home.  She takes care of Rowen, but so do I.  I spend hours walking around at night , exploring and listening to music.  I went to this cemetery and ran round in a snowstorm with Rowan, listening to Moonsorrow, and I was like ""You gotta try this.  It's so awesome.""

So, after three months, my ex starts working again.  She's a workaholic, so she's gone like six days a week.  Meanwhile, I'm with Rowen all day, every day, constantly thinking about her happiness, making sure she goes on tons of long walks and get to play ball.  Whenever we take her out at night, I make sure she gets to play keep away, where she gets chased.  My ex doesn't give a shit and always wants to go in early.

We move again, and things continue in the same fashion.  My ex starts working more and more (this is what ruined our relationship).  I'm at home with Rowen.  You would never see me outside without her.  I still had a pretty shitty social life after moving around all the time, and we lived right next to a park, so I spent a lot of time exploring the park with her.  I would walk for three hours sometimes.  I calculated one of my usual routes was five miles.  I had my own commands for her.  I remember complaining to my ex that when it was her turn to take Rowen for a walk, it only lasted like ten minutes.  I think I said that her longest walk ever was like one of my shorter walks.  I would always take her out to relieve herself as soon as I woke up and feed her right after that.  My ex would always eat breakfast then take Rowen out, which pissed me off.  I took her to the vet most of the time.  

So, when we break up, I have to move out and I can't take Rowen immediately, but then when I start discussing who gets her, my ex just laughs at me and tells me that Rowen is her dog.  But, the breakup was so painful I was in no place to do anything about it because my first priority was trying to save the relationship. I suggested to my ex that we take a period of no-contact to see if that would let things subside and then maybe we could get back together and see what happened.  Well, I don't think she ever intended on doing that, but it soon became a tool for manipulation.  I wasn't allowed to talk to her.  So, she kept me in this state of false hope.  And, I was so desperate to for any chance to fix things that I just hung on until these periods were over.  Well, she basically used the time to plan her escape from Pittsburgh.  I met her once more, explained how much more time I had spent with Rowen than she had and again she just laughed at me.  I even told my dad that she was stealing my dog and he fucking yelled at me ""Rowen is her dog!"" like I was being selfish, just because she told him that Rowen was hers.  She also managed to give our cat away, which is equally enraging because after a year, I thought it would be best to not take her away from her new owners, even though I wanted her back.  I wavered back and forth because I didn't want to be selfish, but I wanted my cat.  Eventually, I find out whoever my ex gave the cat to gave her away.  This dude knows me.  He could have asked me if I wanted her, but, no, he gives her to some family.  Then, when I asked him where she is, just to see if she's okay because my ex doesn't even know what happened to her cat (whom she used to love like no other) he tells me, this fucker who has only know either myself or my ex for a ~2 years, tells me, who had the cat for 5 years, that the cat doesn't belong to me.

So, I was basically devastated by the breakup.  She changed her number, and I had no idea where she was, so I couldn't get my dog back.  Plus, I was traumatized by this whole thing.  The way the breakup happened, you can't imagine.  So, I was in shock and terror.  I had to take hardcore medication be in therapy.

Now, it's been 2.5 years since this happened, and I fucking want my dog.  I want her because she's my dog and I miss her, but I also want her for a sense of justice.  Why should this thief have my dog?  I even spoke to my ex two years after the breakup and explained why Rowen was mine as well, and it actually got through to her.  I thought she was being an asshole, but she legitimately didn't understand that I had a relationship with Rowen and a right to her?  I don't fucking know.  Anyway, she tells me ""But, I don't know if I can give her up.""  Then, a week later reverts to claiming Rowen is her dog and basically not giving a shit how I feel about that.

The last time I saw Rowen, I was working at a construction site, and she was all excited to see me, and I was trying to get her to come down into the foundation, and my ex just ignores me and walks away with her and I don't get to see her.

It's been to long to use the law to get her.  I basically have no legal right to her.  Should I just let it go?  You know, I keep thinking ""Be the big man and let it go."" but is that just some bullshit used to manipulate me into not doing what I should do?

What would you do?

Gone.  When you wake in the morning, gone.  Pretty Poopy (cat's name) was her name.  She was loved and we all will miss her.

**TL;DR Shared a dog with my ex.  Had her for three years.  I spent way more time with her than my ex did, picked her out, took her to training class, the vet, etc.  My ex took her to another state without giving me any say in the matter.  But, it's been 2.5 years since that happened because I needed the time to recover from the breakup.  What should I do?  Nothing?  Go steal her away?**"

3i2mbd,754,2015-08-23,You know how some buildings have a missing thirteenth floor? I found one of them.,Grace_Omega,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3i2mbd/you_know_how_some_buildings_have_a_missing/,"Hey redditors, I've got a pretty wild story to share with you. Not looking for advice, this is more like a warning.

I recently started an intern position at a big company. The office building it was located in was pretty old and kind of run down. On my first day a co-worker who had been assigned to show me the ropes pointed out that there was no floor thirteen listed on the elevator panel-- it goes straight from twelve to fourteen. I laughed about it (superstition, am I right?) and then didn't think about it again for months.

A week ago I volunteered to stay late and finish up some work in the hope that my intern job might turn into something more permanent if I showed enough initiative. By the time I finished it was eight o'clock at night and as far as I knew I was the only person in the entire building. I was pretty tired so when I got to the elevator I slouched against the wall and watched the little blinky light thing count down the floors: nineteen, seventeen, sixteen, fifteen, fourteen... and then the elevator stopped.

We've all seen movies or TV shows where an elevator gets stuck between floors and someone opens the doors to a view of a brick wall. I figured that's what had happened here-- the elevator stopped between floors fourteen and twelve. So I was surprised when I pressed the “door open” button and saw a dark corridor instead of a wall. 

The button panel was no longer working, so I decided to leave the elevator and take the stairs down, rather than press the call button and wait for someone to come rescue me. The light switch near the elevator didn’t work, which made sense—clearly, there had been some sort of power failure and the elevator had stopped at floor fourteen or twelve. I used my phone as a flashlight instead.

I had never been to any floor but the one I worked on, and I was immediately taken aback by how neglected the place looked. There was a thick layer of dust underfoot, and when I got into an office area all of the desks were bare. Some were sagging or falling apart. The entire floor looked as if it had been abandoned for years, which was strange because I had been told that the whole building was occupied.

I went to the nearest window, intending to see how far the power failure had spread, and got a fright when I saw that it was completely pitch black outside. The light from my phone just barely illuminated the face of the nearest building across a narrow alleyway, and looking further down the street there wasn’t a hint of light. No street lights, no illuminated windows, nothing. For a moment I thought there had been a major power failure like the one that hit New York in the previous decade… and then I realized that I couldn’t even see car headlights. I couldn’t hear any cars either, or any sound at all. It was as quiet as the grave, at half eight in a large city. How did that make any sense?

I was getting slightly alarmed now, so I went immediately to the staircase leading down to the ground floor, only to find it locked shut with a rusty chain. That made no sense at all. That staircase was a fire exit. Why would someone chain it shut? Why did it look as if it had been in that state for years?

I decided to hunt around for a key. As I searched the smaller offices I came across a number of very weird things. One of them was filled with what looked like ancient, desiccated mold. In another I found a suit made out of a strange, heavy material folded on a chair in such a way that it looked like a person sitting there (nearly gave me a heart attack). Some of the desk drawers had papers filled with gibberish in them. A filing cabinet was filled with dusty light bulbs.

After about twenty minutes of this I found a rusty key hanging up in a supply closet and unlocked the chain preventing my escape, feeling relieved. This place was starting to spook me, and I was looking forward to coming back in the daylight to find out what the hell its deal was.

But the door didn’t open onto a staircase. I got a glimpse of a long, bare corridor before my phone’s light caught something moving, something that had round, pale eyes.  Something very much not human.

I ran for it, back toward the elevator. The thing chased me. Its footsteps were shuffling and awkward, but fast, and I could hear its wheezing breath at my back. When I got to the hallway leading to the elevator, the doors started to close.

I’d like to tell you I escaped by doing some cool action movie stunts—maybe rolling in between the doors just as they shut—but I honestly don’t remember how I got away. All I recall is running faster than I thought possible, propelled by the most intense terror I’ve ever experienced. It wasn’t the creature chasing me I was necessarily afraid of. It was the fear of being stuck in that place. In those few seconds before I reached safety my conscious mind accepted the idea that had been growing ever since my arrival on floor thirteen: I had stumbled into a place I should not have been in, and if I didn’t escape now then I never would.

The last thing I saw before the elevator doors closed were the creature’s round eyes bobbing in the light. A few seconds later I emerged into a bright lobby, the sounds of traffic and pedestrians coming in from outside, and collapsed to my knees.

I’ve since quit that job. I no longer ride in elevators that have a missing floor. I’m not sure either of those precautions guarantee safety. I keep remembering the dark, silent city I saw outside the office window. Whatever that place is, I think it’s big, and there are probably a lot of ways to enter it. I wonder how many missing person cases are the result of an experience like mine that didn’t turn out so well.

3i3qua,0,2015-08-23,IT certs or IT/CS bachelors? (x-post from r/networking),Sicatron,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/3i3qua/it_certs_or_itcs_bachelors_xpost_from_rnetworking/,"I've been reading a lot of posts and blogs online and believe this comes down to a case-by-case basis. So here's my story.

* I acquired Associates in Liberal Arts at my local community college working full-time. Took a few networking classes.
* Transferred to local state school for Computer Science. (Was unsure at this time which path I wanted to be on: Network Engineer or Software Dev path). Still working full time, struggling quite a bit to maintain grades and keep the bills paid.
* Got a job at a networking laboratory. Taught me all the networking fundamentals I needed. I tested for conformance issues for IEEE 802.3 on switches, printers, end stations, routers, etc. I specifically worked at the MAC layer, so anything in the Clause 4 realm of 802.3 was my speciality.. I worked here part time, along with another retail job part time (full time combined) while in school (4 classes).
* Got really burnt out but learned a shit ton after my first semester. Unfortunately my grades didn't reflect the same and I got a 1 semester suspension due to my former GPA not transferring with me form community college.
Stayed working full-time at the lab. Got a part-time IT internship at an MSP in Boston. Worked full-time between the 2 for approx. 6 months.
* Went for MCSA in Windows Server 2012 R2. Failed my first test twice and determined I needed some more hands-on experience before continuing. Opted to focus on the internship and work towards my Network+ as this was more in line with my comfort zone.
* Received full-time offer from MSP. Accepted and determined it was time to leave the lab (they're geared towards college kids with full-time school; very slow paced work environment; amazing work experience but not being in school now, I determined it was time to move on).

I am preparing to move closer to my MSP and considering enrolling in school again next year.

Now this is my dilemma - Boston University and Northeastern have an IT and CS program geared towards working professionals that I'd be able to manage while full-time in school. They're mainly alternating weekend classes and night classes that go straight for 2 years. In doing so, I could acquire my bachelors and open up more opportunities to Fortune 500 type companies in the Greater Boston area.

HOWEVER, I could just as easily stay the course with cert studying and MSP work experience. In reviewing the courses offered in the aforementioned school programs, I have a gut-wrenching feeling that I won't learn much in school at this point in my networking career. I'm almost 2 years deep in experience between the lab, MSP/internship, and coursework between community college and state school. I can stay the course with certifications and save myself a ton of money.

My biggest worries are 1. ACTUALLY staying on track (it requires a lot of will power and self discipline) and 2. will certifications be enough to get the same jobs the bachelors can get me? I honestly think I'll learn more out of school on my own at this point, but on paper, I'm anxious about closing doors without the schooling.

The lead network engineer at my MSP (also the connection the got me the job) is a self-made man: incredibly smart and loaded with certifications. He thinks school won't be worth it because the opportunities gained aren't worth $30,000 in his opinion. He also has no desire to work at the corporate level, so I question if this is the right choice for ME. I'm not sure WHERE I want to work eventually.

I have about 5 months to make a final decision. 1. Apply for school. Stay at the MSP for 2 years until done and reassess my situation. 2. Don't apply for school. Stay at the MSP with no immediate plans to leave. Focus on acquiring certifications (Net+, A+, MCSA), work experience, and networking through clients in Boston.

What do you think, sysadmins and network engineers? Do you regret your IT degree? Is it worth the cost in your opinion? Do you agree with my lead network engineer? Disagree? Why?

I appreciate any and all opinions/suggestions."

I've decided that, because I won't be doing a year working as part of my degree (financially unavailable to me), I want to do a 3 month internship in Germany over the summer between my 2nd and 3rd year.

I'm a comp sci student with some level of German understanding. I can hold a conversation and articulate ideas without a struggle, but technical language is a problem so preferably (at this point at least) something English speaking would be a priority.

I'm actively working on my German (German housemate who only speaks to me in German, self teaching and a 3 week travel over to Berlin/Cologne/Stuttgart in October) but right now I can't say whether or not  it'll be at a level where I can survive without speaking English.

Does anybody have any resources or tips for searching for internships (paid or not) with German tech companies?

For additional info I want to go into web development :)

Thanks everyone.

EDIT: I'm a UK national studying here so a working visa isn't needed luckily."
3i3sd5,4,2015-08-23,[UK] 25 year old aspiring illustrator - no degree - stuck in a minimum wage job treated like poop just too afford rent and food - is there a way out of this viscous circle?,[deleted],needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/3i3sd5/uk_25_year_old_aspiring_illustrator_no_degree/,"Hi all... so I am at a really low point in my life to the extent that I need to ask my fellow redditors for advice.


A little about me:


Since I was roughly 6 years old I had always wanted to be a comic book artist. I spend every bit of spare time drawing characters on bits of scrap paper etc. I decided not to attend university as I wanted to really focus on breaking into the industry and thought I could do it just by determination and networking.
For the last 5 years I have been trying to establish a sustained career out of being a freelance comic book artist and although I have had some of my work published, I have been unable to gain a steady stream of income from it.



I am living with my partner at the moment in London and so in order to afford rent and bills, I have to work pretty much 50-60 hours a week in a minimum wage job where I spend my days being treated like a complete cretin where the slight whisper of ""job progression"" prompts a satanic laugh in response.
This is all just to have enough money for food and bills.


The issue I have now is I am just stuck in a loop I cannot get out of. Pretty much all design/illustrator/2d art based jobs require a degree of some sort...even internships require a degree! The ones that I meet the requirements for are unpaid..which I am not in the position to do as I would not be able to afford to live.

Sadly I knew it was always going to be a risk to take this path...but I have always had and still have full confidence in my ability... I have just been unable to catch that lucky break. I am now reaching the point where I really am running out of ideas on how to break out of this situation though.

So here I am reddit - please throw your odins wisdom at me.

Currently I am a rising senior in my school focusing on EE. I've taken all the required EE classes thus far and found them relatively easy and also some CE classes such as Programming in C++ and computer architecture. As of right now I'm kind of stuck deciding what I want to do with my life, I know I want to go into the Master’s Program in my school (5 years) but don't actually know what I want to focus in. I'm currently working as an intern and am doing a lot of systems engineering and a little software. There I learned a lot of HMI and SCADA and found that really interesting because we make grid like systems (one line diagrams) where the customer can monitor all there devices and power distribution through the Wonderware software. But I also worked on a software project there too and realized that it’s also pretty interesting since it’s a giant puzzle that you solve logically. So after some research and countless googling I am stuck on two field: one is going into control systems engineering and another is going into software engineering for my masters. I was hoping that if you guys fall into that line of work you can answer some questions for me:

1. What field are you in?
2. Can you describe the type of work you would do?
3. (For controls) Is it only math based or do you go from theory to model to actually implementing it to the project?
4. (For software) Do you write new software or do you maintain existing ones?
5. Do you like what you do (as in is this what you expected)?
6. If you guys don't mind, how much do you make?

Also, I know that software is really popular and high in demand, so would you say control systems is a secure field.

And any other information or life lessons you have is also valuable.

Thanks

 “Aliens?” said Ben looking up at Diana as continued to work on the environmental control system of the Ark, he’d been at it for a few hours but the damn thing still wasn’t working right.

Diana nodded, “aliens attacked Earth! They detonated a selective biological pathogen in the upper atmosphere!”

 Ben nodded and continued to work on the panel in front of him, ignoring the joke that she was making.

“Ben!” shouted Diana, startled Ben jerked up and hit his head on the panel behind him making his head ring.

“What!?” he growled turning to look at the small girl.

He paused, for the first time she looked like a child, her eyes welling up with tears that could not fall, a look of desperation prominent in them. She was normally a small adult what with her understanding of all the different ship systems and her unnatural ability to quickly pick up and understand almost anything. Ben would never admit it but she was almost as good as he was at picking out bugs in a ship system, give her a few more months and she would be.

Now though she looked like the child she was, unsure what was going on or what she should do.

Slowly Ben extricated himself from the panel, “Aliens attacked Earth?” he questioned.

Diana nodded, reaching down she pulled a tablet off of the wall and shoved it into Ben’s hands. Looking down at it Ben felt his throat constrict, a fleet wide alert for both Mars and Earth had been sounded, that was not something that would be faked for a joke.  

“Holy hell!” said Ben as he quickly paged through the reports, and then paused on the one in the middle, it was the shortest, but the most devastating.

Information Level – Critical

Information Security – None

Information – A biological weapon of unknown origin and design has been detonated on the surface of Earth. 100% fatal, complete coverage of Earth in less than 30 minutes. Do not attempt landing. Do not respond to distress calls, contamination factor is unknown, assume all vectors. Do not attempt landing on Earth.

Casualties – 10.5 billion

Putting the report down Ben wasn’t sure what he was feeling, he didn’t have any family on Earth save for an asshole of a brother who was in jail, still the idea that every single human on Earth was dead and gone was difficult to grasp. It was a surreal nightmare to even contemplate.

“Where’s Megan?” asked Ben.

“She’s up with Janus in the observation bay,” said Diana.

Ben nodded, “thanks,” he slowly started to move through the ship, still not sure what to make of everything when he felt an impact on his back, and a pair of small arms wrapping around his neck.

Ben glanced back to look at Diana.

She gave him a pleading look, and he didn’t consider trying to shake her off. Slowly the two navigated through the Ark to the exit hatch. Kicking off from the hull Ben drifted towards the observation bay.

 Drifting inside Ben found Janus and Megan along with most of the construction workers for the Ark all staring at the news as it was reported, the scrolling bulletin at the bottom reporting that all ships were retreating from Earth. The entire first fleet of Earth was gone, the second and third Earth fleets which had been conducting maneuvers near Venus and Jupiter were on route to Mars. The third and fourth Martian fleets whom had been at Venus and Neptune were doing the same. Within two days every ship in the entire solar system would be around Mars.

Still it had only been a single Alien ship, and all reports showed that the first fleet hadn’t even scratched her before being destroyed.

Sitting down next to Megan Ben took the bottle from her hand and quickly downed half of whatever it was.

“What the hell is going on?” asked Megan as he handed the bottle back.

“I have no idea.” Said Ben.

Janus seemed to wake up at that, she took a breath and pushed off from where she was sitting to drift into the center of the room, “We’re getting ready for the last stand.”

Megan wanted to argue, but it was true, everyone knew it. Every ship was falling back to Mars and away from Earth, they had already lost.

“What about the Ark?” asked Diana, her voice cutting through the somber mood of the room.

Janus slowly turned to look at her daughter, “The Ark won’t save everyone.”

Diana nodded, “No, but it will save enough.”

Janus looked down at the ship and then back at her daughter and then at the men she had employed to build the ship, “You guys want some overtime pay?” she asked.

A few of the men looked at one another, and then the largest man drifted forward, “I’m working under one condition,” he said.

“That is?” asked Janus.

“I want a bottle of that good Scotch you got, and a gun to shoot when we need to.” The muscled and rough looking man turned to the rest of the workers, “We’re sure as hell not going to be the ones flying off to save humanity, we’re all too ugly,” he said producing a few weak chuckles from the crowd.

He pointed at Diana, “We’re going to save her though, and then I’m gonna ride a nuke into the bastards who killed Earth, who’s gonna help me?” he asked.

All of men slowly moved forwards, “I’m gonna need a few more bottles of that scotch Janus,” said the man.

She shook her head chuckling, “You can have the whole case.”

Lincoln sat down at the conference table and looked across it at the politicians, despite everything that had happened they still looked presentable. Her own clothes were rumpled and her hair a mess, her brain running on a not so healthy combination of the Martian coffee and other stimulants.

 “We understand that you have been manufacturing antimatter,” said the politician sitting in the middle of the table, Senator Daniels.

“Yes,” said Lincoln.

The Senator blinked, “You don’t deny it?” he asked.

Lincoln shook her head, “No I don’t. I told you I was manufacturing it with the help of your military.”

The man to the left of Daniels, Senator Hollows nodded, “Yes, and that is a subject that will have to be investigated at a later date, at the moment we want to know how much of it that you have,” he said.

Lincoln leaned back in her chair, “I have about 7 grams of antimatter.”

Senator Hollows nodded, “In exchange for that antimatter we won’t press charges against you for violation of the treaty.”

“Senator what do you intend to do with the antimatter?” asked Lincoln.

“We intend to weaponize it, fend off the invaders who destroyed Earth,” said Senator Daniels.

Lincoln nodded, “Alright let’s say you do, then what? There have to be a hell of a lot more ships than just the one.”

“We have not received any reports indicating as such,” said Senator Hollows.

Lincoln sighed, “Their ship can do FTL same as the Longboat IV, for all we know they have reinforcements waiting a few light days away or heck across the galaxy! Attacking them without investigating the full extent of their power is a good way to make sure the rest of humanity dies!”

Senator Daniels shook his head, “I was not aware that you we’re a military strategist Dr. Lincoln, in any case this is not a discussion, you hand over the antimatter and take the deal or we will take it anyway,” he said looking smug. 

“It’s not military strategy, its common sense and in any case I am the one who called this meeting, I told you I had the antimatter, but we’re not going to waste it on a simple bomb,” said Lincoln.

“The Ark you have been constructing in conjunction with the head of the Martian crime syndicate Janus? You want to send five hundred people to another star system and leave the rest here to die?” said Hollows, “That seems like an even more stupid and cowardly idea than attacking!”

“So you would have your population throw themselves at an unknown enemy? The Terran defense fleet was destroyed in seconds, what makes you think you would fare any better?”

“Our military has more advanced ships than those of the Terran navy, we have been assured they will stand up to the weapons the aliens are utilizing.”

Lincoln stared at the two politicians for a moment, and then started to laugh. It was a strained laugh with no humor in it, bordering almost on insanity. She had thought they were only playing the politics of the situation, but they believed what they were saying.

Lincoln continued to laugh and reaching into her jacket extracted two small objects, a small tablet and a canister much like the one she had shown Captain Takuya several months ago. An intern sitting in the back of the room recording the proceedings seemed to be the only one who knew what it was and at the sight of it blanched at let out a small scream.

“Here is the antimatter, and an analysis of the alien weapons from the Yamato. They were firing plasma based weapons somewhere in the range of five terawatts output, the most we, Mars or Earth have produced for plasma based weapons is in the megawatt range! We have no defense against this type of weapon!” said Lincoln.

“Why the hell are you carrying that around!?” asked Senator Hollows as he halfway stood from his seat as if getting a few more feet away from the substance would make it safer.

Lincoln glanced down and tapped the canister knocking it onto its side, everyone else in the room winced, “Incentive, this is only about a quarter ounce of what we were able to produce. It’s as much as I’m willing to give you if you want to make a vain attempt to bomb the aliens.”

Picking up the canister Lincoln juggled it in her hands for a moment tossing it in between them before underhandedly throwing it across the table to the Senators.

Daniels’ eyes widened and he quickly reached out to grab it, the small thing slipped through his fingers and fell to the floor with an audible clink.

Scrambling from his seat Daniels retrieved the small canister and sat back up breathing hard.

“What the hell are you playing at?” he asked.

“I’m not playing Senator, and I have no intention of stopping my plans to launch the Ark. Your military command has been aware of my utilization of the old accelerator and the construction of the Ark at it’s highest levels since the inception of the plan. The Earth military was aware as well, and both militaries offered me aid.”

Lincoln stood up and offered the data pad to the Senators.

“I have no doubt they were looking for a way to weaponize the FTL technology, but they both recognized that Pandora’s box had been opened and I was fine letting them use me so long as I got to use them. They wanted a weapon or tactical advantage, I wanted to make sure humanity spread to the stars. Now those goals are the same, we both want humanity to survive and we don’t have the time to deal with you.”

Senator Willow picked up the pad, “what is this?” he asked.

“The signatures of the Martian military commanders who support me, they’re still not happy with how you retained control during the war, politicians don’t make very good strategists. I’ve also got the support of what is left of the Terran military. So you can fall in line with the plan I have outlined their or be ignored as we execute it,” said Lincoln.

Senator Willows stood up, “This is an act of war Doctor! Not only have you illegally produced antimatter, you have incited and planned a military coup on our planet! We have enough on you to have you hanged right here!” he said.

Lincoln let out another strained laugh, “You do that, and humanity will die right here. If you want to help I’ll be meeting with the Martian war council in an hour along with what is left of the Terran military,” said Lincoln.

She turned and began to walk out of the conference room.

“Arrest her!” said Senator Willow.

The two guards flanking the door glanced at one another and then at Lincoln, she glared at them for a moment, and they saw the determined insanity embedded within her gaze. The two of them remained still not moving as she swept out of the room.

&lt;First Contact +1 day 19 hours 05 minutes&gt;

Lincoln sat down at her second conference table for the day, this one looked more appropriate for the situation, people were constantly moving around the large room, multiple cups of Martian coffee were on every surface, data pads were everywhere and for some reason even a few slips of paper were on the large table.

The Generals of the Martian and what was left of the Terran military were sitting around the table or otherwise up on a display, a total of thirty Generals along with a few hundred other ranking individuals listening in to the conversation with the ability to talk when needed were around the table.

The General was sitting next to Lincoln, off to the side behind him were two military officers that looked familiar for some reason, a Martian and a Terran, Lincoln couldn’t place exactly where she had seen them before though and quickly dismissed it to look back down at her notes.

Ben was absently flipping the data pad around in his hand as he waited for the meeting to start and reaching over Megan put a hand over his stopping him before he ended up dropping it on his foot.

Captain Takuya was still on the Yamato docked to the Station far above, but he was watching the proceedings through a monitor ready to offer information when needed.

Janus, with Diana floating in front of her were both watching the meeting from the observation platform of the shipyard, where she had just received an influx of military aid.

Everyone was waiting to hear the plan that Dr. Lincoln had, all that she had released so far was that they would be able to save humanity, no details or plans, no designs or blueprints for a weapon to defeat the aliens had yet to be announced.

That alien ship was still in orbit of Earth, and the last distress calls had been from small transports and civilian ships as they attempted to run from it and make it to an accelerator rail, only a few had managed to escape though, most were still trapped in Earth orbit being hunted by the alien fighters.

“I think it’s about time,” said the General leaning over to Lincoln.

She nodded, “I know, but I’m not used to crowds.”

The General chuckled, “You’ve nothing to prove to anyone here.”

Lincoln nodded and taking small sip from the glass of water in front of her she stood.

The crowd around her immediately fell silent and turned to look at her.

Lincoln took a breath, “Earth is dead, Mars will be dead soon as well, and fighting a losing battle against an enemy like this will be impossible. We have to evacuate,” said Lincoln, with that she turned the center display on and a live image of the Ark appeared.

“I have been working with the Martian military to construct the Ark, A ship which utilizes the FTL technology I helped develop. The Terran military graciously allowed me to retrofit a frigate with a similar FTL drive and they have identified a system to which we should be able to evacuate too.”

The silence in the room intensified for a moment, a Terran general leaned forwards, “How many people could the Ark carry?”

“400 people on the Ark, but that’s not important. What is important is that the Ark has engines designed for the FTL jump,” she quickly brought up a page of mathematics, “We can take the entire fleet through an FTL jump,” said Lincoln.

“What?” asked the Terran general.

“What’s left of the Terran fleet and the Martian military fleets could jump with the Ark, her engines can hold open the rift for other ships to make an FTL jump with her, it will burn the engines out and consume all the antimatter we have, but it is possible.”

The Terran general looking nonplussed leaned back into his seat, “Uh, alright then,” he said.

She paused for a moment and looked out at the assembled crowd, “The only issue is speed. We would need to be moving quickly for every ship to make it through the rift.”

“How quickly?” asked the General from beside Lincoln.

“Roughly 100 kilometers per second,” said Lincoln, “At those speeds so long as all ships in the fleet are within 1.5 kilometers of the Ark they will pass through the subspace tear.”

“100 klicks per second!” said a Captain, “that’s insane!”  

Lincoln nodded, “We’re going to have to accelerate without the rails too, all ships need to be within 1.5 kilometers of the Ark when we perform the jump, the rails would spread us out too far.”

Ben stood up, “That’ll burn out a lot of the engines on civilian ships doing that much acceleration,” he said.

“Yes, but they only need to make it through, once were’ in the Epsilon Eridani system we’ll worry about slowing the ships down,” said Lincoln.

A captain of one of the civilian transports that had escaped Earth, a woman with graying hair leaned forwards, “How do we know that the aliens won’t follow us to this new system, that we’re not wasting time evacuating when we should be fighting?” she asked.

“We don’t, but they won’t know where we are going. Information travels only at light speed, so retreating and rebuilding on Epsilon Eridani will give us at least ten years. If we stay here on Mars we will be defeated long before then,” said Lincoln.

The woman looked like she was going to argue for a moment but then nodded.

“So we’re just going to run away and let them have Earth and Mars?” asked the Terran general.

Lincoln twisted around to look at him, “by all reports Earth is lost, Mars will fall just as easily if not from whatever biological weapon they used to the plasma weaponry. We have no defense, it cut through all Terran armor like it was paper. If you are suggesting we leave them Earth intact, I’m sure there are more than a few biological weapons of our own we could use, or a good old fashioned nuclear bombardment.”

The General blanched, “you want to destroy the Earth?” he asked.

Lincoln grimaced, “I don’t want to no, but I would rather destroy it than leave it to someone else. Humanity is not dependent on a planet, we will remember the Earth, we will remember where we began, but our children will grow up among the stars, they will hear the tales of how we retreated, burning everything in our wake so that the invaders could not have it and so that we could not turn back in fear. They will remember that bravery and it will inspire them,” Lincoln paused and took a breath, “and when we burn the home world of the aliens we will return to our own and heal it returning to her as the victors.”

Lincoln punctuated her sentence by slamming her fist into the table, cracking the glass laminate.

She glanced down at it and sighed.

The general looked at her for a moment and chuckled, “A sentiment I’m sure many share Doctor.”

“So what should we announce to the people?” asked another captain.

“We’ve been streaming this conference live, I’ll let the military types get the exact details down while the Ark is launched, and I and the other eggheads iron out the science,” said Lincoln, “the people deserve the truth just as much as everyone, and there are not going to be enough ships. So like every other time in history we prioritize, those who want to stay and fight will have opportunity to do so,” said Lincoln.

&lt;First Contact +2 days 01 hours 10 minutes&gt;

The meeting continued for several hours as the details were planned out, what equipment would be taken from Mars, who would be on what ships, what ships would be left behind and stripped for parts, along with hundreds of other details.

Engineer after engineer, from military, company, private, and civilian ships had been approaching Ben and Megan asking them questions about the FTL jump and how to calibrate their ships for the jump.

The power down sequence was about all that the two engineers could give them, and for many it was hardly enough information.

The entire operation no matter how much planning they put into it was going to be sloppy.

Getting up Ben quickly walked out of the meeting room and put his hands to his eyes, reaching into his pocket he extracted another stimulant and grimacing popped into his mouth, the sickly sweet taste barely registered as he swallowed it.

“Those are unhealthy,” said Megan, she had slipped out behind him into the hall.

“You want one?” asked Ben reaching into his pocket.

“Yes,” Said Megan as she took it and popped it into her own mouth. The two hadn’t slept since the attack, they had been working on the Ark, and then they had been told to come to the meeting being one of only 4 engineers to have actually worked with the FTL drive and the backup guys on the Yamato were busy retrofitting whatever weapons they could to the ship, stripping her now useless armor in favor of more weapon mounts.

“We’re going to have to be on the Ark,” said Megan.

Ben frowned but nodded, “I know.”

“You don’t want to be on the Yamato?” she asked.

“Hell yes I want to be on the Yamato, but jumping the entire fleet with the Ark, on her first go in space burning out the engines? We both know it has to be us in the engine room if we don’t want to kill everyone,” said Ben.

Megan nodded in agreement, “Anyone else would blow themselves up.”

“We must sound like absolute assholes, no one else can do it!” said Ben he put his hands up for air quotes.

“We could let Diana do it, she knows more about those engines then either of us!” said Megan.

Ben considered this for a moment, “She can’t reach both sides of the engineering console at once, Humanity would be doomed because the engineer couldn’t reach the right button,” he said.

Megan chuckled a strained sound that quickly devolved into a sob, slowly she made her way to the wall and sat down against it. Tears began to fall from her eyes flowing down her cheeks in the unfamiliar one third gravity.

“Everyone’s dead,” she said.

Ben leaned into the wall next to her sitting down beside her.

“My parents, my little sister, they’re dead!” said Megan, “They lived through the war but now they’re dead!” she said the tears continuing to fall.

Ben wasn’t sure exactly what to say, his parents had been dead for several years, and his brother had been in prison, after the war he had continued serving on the Yamato and the crew had been his family, Megan a large part of that.

“You think it hurt?” asked Megan.

Ben hesitated looking down at the chief engineer for the most successful battleship in the Terran fleet, he wasn’t used to seeing her like this, she was strong, and worked constantly to ensure that no one saw her like an old fashioned woman in need of a knight in shining armor, but even the strongest people had their limits, and she like everyone else had lost everything.

“It was biological,” said Ben not finishing the sentence, the implication hanging.

Megan nodded, and tried not to think about it.

“We’re running away now, abandoning everything we fought for in the war and running away,” said Megan.

“We’re retreating so we can make some really big weapons and kick their teeth in, you saw the video reports, they shredded everything! We can’t fight that right now,” said Ben.

Megan nodded and sighed, leaning over she put her head on Ben’s shoulder, “Still feels wrong, but it makes sense,” said Megan.

Ben looked down at her concerned, “You’re not thinking of staying with the second Martian fleet are you?” asked Ben. The second fleet was supposedly going to remain around Mars and defend those who stayed, there were not enough ships for everyone to make the jump with the Ark. Those staying on Mars were for the most part the elderly and the volunteers. Thankfully the Martian public had understood the need to evacuate, there was relatively little panic in the populous like there would have been on Earth.

Ben supposed it had something to do with the Martian’s almost always being in a certain amount of danger, just a breached wall away from being blown out onto the surface of the cold and desolate world they inhabited.

Megan shook her head, “The Ark needs us, as much as I want to stay and fight or ride out on the Yamato.”

Sitting straight back up Megan looked over at Ben for a moment, and let her arm lash out hitting his shoulder knocking him to the side, “You tell anyone I cried!” she threatened.

Ben just smiled and raised his hands up in surrender.

“This is their main communication channel as best as I can tell. It’s been broadcasting from a bunker on the fourth planet, its emergency instructions from what I can translate,” said [Sam].

“No tachyon transmission hubs then?” asked [Charles].

“No sir, there will be a delay of several [minutes] between the communications,” said [Sam].

“Alright, we’re going to send them the message then, transmit the translation package and let’s start the burn towards the planet. Once we get a response we’ll tell them what they need to do,” said [Charles].

“Yes sir,” said [Sam] and turning she transmitted her translation package to the fourth planet, not knowing how much damage that act would cause.

&lt;First Contact +2 days 18 hours 42 minutes&gt;

The General stood up, “We’re committing the second Terran fleet, and the first and second Martian fleets to destroying the alien ship, if they are not successful it should be sufficient diversion. If that much fire power cannot down the alien ship then we will have no choice to evacuate, and committing further resources would be a waste.”

General Collin stood up at the other side of the table, “The fleet commanders have all volunteered, I actually had to assign the other fleets to the evacuation. For the first time in history we’re not going to be limiting the power of our attacks, or pulling the punches, to say that certain members of the military are excited would be an understatement,” said General Collin.

“General Collin has been recalled to active duty, and he will be leading the assault,” said the General addressing the other people in the room, which now included the rather disgruntled Martian Senators.

General Collin nodded, “I saw what they could do on Aldrin station. We’re going to have a fight on our hands.”

“Are we sure we want to commit forces to this?” asked Lincoln, “The first Terran fleet was eliminated in an instant.”

General Collin turned to the mathematician, “We are, not everyone is going to be able to evacuate, and we owe it to them to at least try,” he said.

Lincoln looked at the man for a moment but nodded in agreement, “We’re only going to be getting at most 8,000 people out,” she said sadly.

“That’s more than the number of people that left Africa 20,000 years ago,” Said the General, “I doubt it will take us as long to recover though.”

Lincoln nodded, “Hopefully.”

Leaning back in her seat Lincoln started going over her calculations for the Ark’s jump again. It had to be right or all of this was for nothing, to be fair half of the calculations were a guess, they had never thrown other objects through FTL with a ship before, and now they were doing it with half of the reaming Terran and Martian Armadas.

“I’m getting a weird data stream,” said a tech from one of the workstations around the perimeter of the room. He and a dozen other geeks had been coordinating data and communications as well as relaying tactical data as it streamed in.

“Define weird?” asked Lincoln.

“We just got a sudden data burst through the entire Martian communication network, the TCP packet is all screwy and the data inside of it is weird, text, audio samples, and a computer program.”

The General looked at the data the tech was showing for a moment and then turned to look at Lincoln, “Any idea what it is?” he asked.

“I’m a mathematician, what do you,” Lincoln paused looking at the data for another moment, “Primes, this message is full of primes.”

She thought about it for a moment, and then gasped, “General, it’s a translation program! It got flooded through the entire network and everything about it is just a little off, the aliens want to talk to us!” said Lincoln.

The General frowned, “they want to talk now? That means they want something.”

“They want the Yamato, our FTL technology.” Said Captain Takuya through the communication line that was still open to the room.

The General glanced up at him, “What makes you say that?” he asked.

“They had us dead to rights with their fighters and their mothership right after they destroyed the fleet, when we destroyed the Longboat IV they looked like they were going to attack but backed off. I assume they detected our FTL drive,” said Takuya.

Lincoln glanced over at the General and then back at Takuya, “It’s as good a theory as anything else at the moment, but if that is what they want it means we have the upper hand in negotiations.”

“In the fashion that we’ll throw ourselves off a cliff before giving the technology to them type of way,” said the General.

He sighed and turned to the room at large, “I want those Yamato engineers looking at the alien ship, and as many free linguists and computer scientists that we have available in here getting this translation thing working! If the damn aliens want to talk I want to be able to do the same if only to tell them to fuck off!” shouted the General at the room.

For a moment everyone was frozen processing what he had said, and then the room which had already been chaotic before the data burst began to move again in a frenzy of activity.

“We’re approaching the planet, any delay in communication at this point will be negligible,” said Sam.

“Have we gotten the acknowledgement package?” asked Charles.

“We did, which means we should be able to communicate with them,” said Sam.

Charles nodded and stood up, straightening his dress uniform he looked up at the screen.

“Open the channel.”

The main screen fuzzed and for a moment there was only static, but the image quickly coalesced, the two alien computer systems syncing with one another.

Charles blinked, the image was of a messy conference room, data pads and other objects were strewn about on every surface, and more people than what looked to be comfortable were inside of the room, all of them looked worn out, not surprising that they had just had the majority of their race exterminated.

In the center of his view was an old man, his skin wrinkled and worn, pockmarked and scarred, clearly the oldest and most senior man in the room. Were it not for the hair on his head and the paleness of his skin Charles would have sworn the man was a Dorvakian General, the look in his eyes was the same.

Sitting next to him was a much younger woman in a black jumpsuit, the odd hair on her head was sticking out in every direction and the glare she was giving him made Charles pause for a moment, unsure exactly what she was communicating.

The old man stood up and as the image cleared the translation program provided him what he already knew, superimposed over the man’s head was his rank, General.

The man spoke, and it took the program several seconds to translate, the text in standard appearing on the bottom of the screen.

“What do you want?” asked the General.

Charles was stunned for a moment, he had expected a member of the Class C species to be ranting about reparations and revenge, but the man and indeed the room around him were all radiating a cold fury, it was disconcerting.

“You possess technology crucial to the Empire, you will hand it over or we will destroy you like we did your home world,” said Charles. When negotiating with a Class B species threats were usually the best way to get results, so long as you demonstrated superiority. That was apparently the incorrect tactic to use when negotiating with a Class C species however.

The General stared at him for a moment, the woman next to him seemed to find the entire interaction humorous, a small giggle escaping her lips.

“You murder billions of our kind, you take [Dirt] from us and expect us to comply with anything you demand?”  Asked the General his words appearing below him as he spoke.

Charles blinked, “You’re planet fell to only a single ship, you cannot possibly hope to fight us, if you do not give it to us we will destroy you and take it from the remnants of your civilization!” said Charles hoping that further reminders of what would happen if they did not comply would make them acquiesce.

When a class B species was brought into the Empire it rarely required force, but even when it did the application was always small and the results immediate.

It clicked in Charles’s head as he looked at the man, he could see his eyes darting back and forth reading the translation on his side, the General was responding like a man of the Empire would, he was responding in the same manner Charles would if he were in a similar situation, he would rather die than comply.

Charles felt a shiver go down his spine, this species, this species C1764 was not like the others. They would not comply, they would not surrender to hope for survival, they would not yield until their entire species was dead.

 “You seem to be laboring under the impression that threats will be effective, we have no guarantee you will leave us alone if we give you what you want, we would not give you what you seek anyway, try to take it again and we will destroy you and all knowledge of it. You attack us and we make sure we take as many of you with us as possible and that you don’t get what you came for.” Said the General.

Charles stared at him for a moment, and sighed, “Very well General, we’re attacking in one day. I can give you that much time to prepare, but I will complete my mission,” said Charles.

The men stared at one another for a moment, and the General smiled, “I’ll make sure you don’t,” he said.

Charles punched his chair, closing the channel.

“Prepare all fighters, when they are ready we’re attacking.” Said Charles turning to his officers.

“You gave them a day sir?” asked Sam.

“If we give them any more time they might find a way to win.”

I like comments!

This was supposed to be the last chapter, before the time skip and the new characters, as one user /u/pandizlle guessed this entire tale is a prologue to the more complicated and fun story to come. That is if everyone thinks I should continue.

Let me put it this way, I’m in a dead end job working to pay for things, If I clean this story up, correct the grammar and the like would you pay for it? Self-publishing is easy enough these days, and to be honest I would love to write for a modest paycheck to supplement what I’m already doing or better yet make a living off of it but that’s not very realistic, so tell me what you think. I’m open to a Patreon as well but I think those are kind of cheesy.

Chapter 11 the finale (?) will be up Friday, and after that I have no idea when the next installment will be coming, I want to get things sorted out and storylines in order. This story all started with me writing a HFY tale about humans just adding more power to go to FTL, I need to actually plan the next installment to make sure we get those juicy Humanity Fuck Yeah’s!

I do have volunteer work. I just feel silly listing all my networing and technical skills but that's ALL I have. 

I can list how well I work and stuff.

I'm currently enrolled in a[ 9-month intensive mobile application development program focused on iOS](http://www.c4q.nyc/accesscode/). I'm looking to supplement what I'm currently learning with an internship in the field. We have done a number of small projects, but nothing to big. We've recreated social network layouts such as Twitter and Instagram as proof to our comfort with using Auto-Layout. We've created small games like Hangman and Tic-Tac-Toe, but I'm currently working on my own projects such as making a Mario-like game in Swift. Most recent project has been a Reaction Timer App, in Objective-C, where the user tries to beat their score by clicking a button as soon as it turns green and a Stopwatch/Timer App, in Swift. 

This unit, we're focused on creating an application implementing table views.

I would say I'm very comfortable with the using the documentation to find out how to solve most problems &amp; using the basic concepts of programmings (loops, conditionals, classes, functions).

If you or anyone you know of has any opportunities for those who are eager and willing to learn, please feel free to share [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jovannyespinal) and send me a message. Thanks!"

3i8oe3,2,2015-08-24,Authorized User May Have Increased Credit Limit,AndjoShark,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3i8oe3/authorized_user_may_have_increased_credit_limit/,"Location: California

Recently I found out my mother charged ~$23000 over 4 credit card bills.  She was an authorized user on my credit cards that I gave her access to when I was younger

The dates which the credit cards were opened were 2006, 2012, 2012, and 2013.  

A friend brought up how high my credit limit was for someone who hasn’t had real job besides internships for work. This makes me believe my mom increased the limits.

From my research, I don’t think she is allowed to do this and I should not be liable for the anything over the initial credit limit I agreed to? 

So I have a few questions:

Questions 1: Is she allowed to do this?

Question 2: If she is not allowed to do this/ didn’t do it can I dispute this with the credit card company?

Question 3: If I have paid off some of the credit cards am I allowed to retroactively dispute the bill?

Question 4: Who should I contact if you guys think this task is too big to handle by myself? Whether it’s a lawyer or some credit card debt specialists.

There is one card in particular that I paid off (the APR was 30.00% and it had 7500 charged) but was opened in 2006 and the limit is now $11,000. My mother said she never asked for an increase on them they just did it automatically (she could be lying).

Thanks"
3i8p0r,4,2015-08-24,How do I figure out how much my skills are worth to ME.,Jumballaya,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/3i8p0r/how_do_i_figure_out_how_much_my_skills_are_worth/,"**Preface:**

I am currently 26 years old and have worked a variety of jobs for the past 10 years. In this time I have been in and out of school studying math and communications, but I have yet to be able to finish a degree due to one family crisis after another. I know not having a clear path in life reflects poorly in job interviews, but it has given me a wealth of knowledge that I use in my life everyday.

I am currently working on a saute station in a fine-dining restaurant, I really enjoy most aspects of my job, but I realize that I can't stay in the food industry for too much longer as it will become increasingly more difficult finding jobs as automation will take over. Working in kitchens has given me amazing skills in communication, time management, team work and every other skill I will need in web development minus the actual development skills. This is the only advantage I have over a fresh out-of-school prospective coder.

I have been using HTML/CSS/JS since I was in middle school as well as Python(mostly pygame), C#(only in Unity), Java(in high school and sparsely afterward) throughout the past 5-10 years. I never developed my skills to use them professionally though.

About a year ago I ran into The Odin Project website and started through it to refresh my coding knowledge with the purpose to once again have fun making websites and/or web apps. I couldn't stop coding and picked up ruby and then rails. I finally finished The ODin Project and moved on to Team Treehouse and brushed up on PHP and learned how to use python for the web.

A couple months ago I got an internship for a Front End Web Developer position and hope to move to a full time junior position when my 3 month intership is over.

Question:

I am wondering how to break down my skills and monetize them in an effort to figure out how much I am worth to both myself and to those who might hire me.

I am currently doing ---

**1. HTML/CSS/JS** &lt;- My level is advanced on all three and JS is my strong suit here.
What is this worth? What about someone with strong HTML/CSS skills but only knows JQuery? What are each of these worth on their own if you had to break it down?

**2. Email newsletters** &lt;- This is not fun work but using gulp/mailchimp/litmus I have taught myself a decent workflow here. What are the varying levels of knowledge/mastery and how does that translate pay wise?

**3. Sass** &lt;-- I don't use any crazy Sass logic but I will modularize as best as I can where I can. What do the different mastery levels of Sass look like and how much are they worth?

**4. Git and SSH** &lt;-- I use git all the time so it wasn't anything crazy for me to learn the workflow. Again, what levels of mastery and what are they worth?

**5. Drupal / PHP** &lt;-- I have an intermediate grasp of PHP and I am learning more and more drupal everyday. What are the various levels of mastery for these two and how much are these skills worth?

**6. Design PS/Illustrator** &lt;-- I use Adobe software daily. I wouldn't call myself a designer by any means though.



What else do other Interns/Juniors Front End Devs do on a day-to-day basis and what is worth.

I ask this because I am used to working at near the pay-cap for what I do in my town at $13.50/hr and based on how much work/pain/labor/stress I go through I am unable to start to put a value on myself as a web developer making almost the same as an intern.


**TL;DR --&gt; I don't want to hear a one-size-fits-all salary number, instead I want to learn how to value myself.**"

3iae6n,9,2015-08-24,Finding a niche--if I even need one?,lost_at_cs,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3iae6n/finding_a_nicheif_i_even_need_one/,"I'm a rising senior at a higher ranked state school (a public ivy, top 10 ranking in CS), and I've just finished my first internship. That said, I've been programming since...middle school? but I'm still not sure where I best fit.

I mostly know what I *don't* like--pure frontend work and pure algorithms. I like knowing how things work from top to bottom. I took a class in computer graphics on the theoretical side and I loved it--but I'm not a gamer; outside of games, where can I realistically apply this? I find things like React.js super cool--but I don't want to get stuck in web development, because as a single thing it's generally unfulfilling for me. There's all the stuff below it that I find interesting too. Interview questions focus heavily on algorithms and data structures, but I find the way everything comes together the most interesting part. Is this the ""architecture"" of managerial speak? I like getting ""down and dirty"" in the code, though, and someone with an ""architect"" title generally has an upper level position.

At my internship, I started out working on a ""native web"" application (single page app, all in JS--I never know how to explain this), but it wasn't really enough work. On my own, I learned about the whole supporting software stack (as it did rely on a lot of stuff specific to the company for the backend) and as a result I (a) helped other interns (and a full-time employee or two) when they ran into problems and (b) put myself on a backend project to get more work.

Roughly speaking, I guess I just feel lost. There are so many people who *know* they want to go do theoretical CS research, or go found a startup and make some hip mobile app--but I never see someone driven to do the stuff I like. Is this just a side effect of me hearing the loudest people, or do I need to really drill down more and find a more specific area of interest? I have a hard time explaining my interests to recruiters and such because they're quite varied.

Hoping maybe you guys can help :) Thanks!!"
3iahfn,4,2015-08-24,Help to be more social with other interns,account50999,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/3iahfn/help_to_be_more_social_with_other_interns/,"I am a college student and have an internship this summer (mid June-mid Sept.). Since I started this internship I have had trouble connecting with the other interns. There are two other interns that I started on the same day with who I initially tried to spend time with (i.e. have lunch together), but this kind of fizzled out. I think part of the problem is that we work in different departments, the office is kind of spread out, and people take lunch at different times and in different places, so I won't necessarily see them unless I seek them out. The thing is, they seem to spend a lot more time with each other than they do with me. Not that they're unfriendly toward me, I just don't really seem to be part of their group.

The thing that made me want to write this post was that today I saw them in the parking lot walking out and talking with each other and all I did was just wave as I walked to my car. I even saw one of them talking to another intern who started the week after the three of us. This sort of thing always seems to happen to me - social groups just seem to form without me. I want to be more social, but not socializing or socializing very little is all I know.

So my question is: how do I join this social group that is already formed that I feel like I should have been more a part of from the beginning?

TL;DR: 2/3 of the way through an internship, want to be more social with other interns, how do I do this?"

[The world reacts to Anne Hathaway in a similar manner to how they react to Jim Harbaugh. What are your thoughts on the two? Will Harbaugh succeed at Michigan? Is Anne actually pretty cool?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3i8elo/this_parts_all_caps_i_am_actorwriter_zack/cue6c12?context=5)|First off, Anne Hathway is one of the sweetest people I've ever met. No bullshit, she took the three ""interns"" out to dinner when we started shooting with her Husband and we got to know her. We are also in a Fantasy Football League together and she won last year. In regards to Harbaugh and Anne and the way people react to them, I think in any profession, if you are outwardly passionate, you will show it. Both of them are nerds in the respect that they eat, live, breath the thing they do. So if you question them on it, they will have opinions. And even if you don't question them, they will share their opinion. I feel it's unearned when it comes to Anne, people are mean to her for very little reason. With Jim, no comment :) Jim will save Michigan football and angels will come down at the end of this season and give everyone wings and then we will never lose because our team has wings. That shit is like cheating.
[How/why did you get into acting? Also I've been calling my friend Aaron ""A.A.Ron"" since the day I've seen that skit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3i8elo/this_parts_all_caps_i_am_actorwriter_zack/cue61y8?context=5)|Well, I was 19 years old. I had pretty much zero prospects in terms of work outside of Ann Arbor. I was working at a sub shop that was owned by an Ex-Convict who payed every employee under the table. I was teaching improv at the Y once a month. I was kinda floating along while all my friends were in college making something of themselves. I was pretty depressed at the time so I was also gaining weight. Then I saw ""Superbad"" at midnight on August 16th 2007. That movie changed my life. I saw it and said ""I can do that!"" Then 6 months later I got my first audition for a movie (which became ""The Virginity Hit"") and eventually got the roll (this was 2008). We shot the movie the next year and I had finally found something I loved. LOVEDDD.

How are you two alike/different?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3i8elo/this_parts_all_caps_i_am_actorwriter_zack/cue65ev?context=5)|My favorite part is the amount of improv I'm able to do now that I've been doing him for 4 years. I feel like I can jump right into him at any moment and really know what and how he's going to react. I would say we are both stubborn, him to a fault, me... to a fault. But we ultimately know when we are wrong. We are different in the way that I pursue things with love and he pursues them with trying to be the best. I don't care about being the best, i just care if I love doing that thing.

Hassan Johnson is a real fucking actor and to work with him on that was such a fun experience.  Method Man is my homie. We chat from time to time. Every time I talk to him I remember being 8 year olds when I stole a few CD's from my brothers room and one of them was ""Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)"". I told Meth about this one time at recess all the kids were trying to make each other laugh and I recited the opening to ""Method Man"" (the torture skit) and made a kid cry.

There was something that didn't click from when we shot it to when it went on TV. I think it's the fact that everyone in the studio was in on the joke but when presented, people were already told it was ""Seinfeld"" which it was never trying to be. For a minute, I was a part of maybe the funniest thing I had ever seen. Ever. I stand by that.

I'm writing a few things with friends and by myself. Whatever is next I will know that I want to do it 100%. That's how I've decided everything I've done so far. I've been very picky and it's suited me. You can be picky too, you just have to know what you want.
[What do you like most about Ann Arbor and Michigan?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3i8elo/this_parts_all_caps_i_am_actorwriter_zack/cuea0i6?context=5)|The place itself. Michigan is beautiful and a lot of people assume it's shitty because of Detroit (which is also beautiful in it's own way). Sleeping Bear Dunes, Lake Michigan, the entire coast (east or west michigan) football saturdays in Ann Arbor, watching the sunset in the UP. All my favorite.

Ever been to Cadillac?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3i8elo/this_parts_all_caps_i_am_actorwriter_zack/cuea9uq?context=5)|I am a fan until someone tells me they are from Columbus. I just say ""oh, i don't watch sports"" so I don't have to have to stupidest conversation about ""who is better"" in a thing I have zero control over.

3ib98a,8,2015-08-25,How do you make friends in college as a 3rd year with no friends,Heraclitus94,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/3ib98a/how_do_you_make_friends_in_college_as_a_3rd_year/,"I'm technically a junior, but I had a bit of an odd situation this semester and I wanted an opinion on something. I start school in about 3 weeks.

First of, I am a computer science major and math minor. I am mostly in my major/minor for the career aspect. I am a really shitty programmer and mathematician to be honest. I grew up in the country with dialup. I came from a town where over half of our grade failed the state standardized tests for reading and math and over 40 kids failed to graduate out of a class of 300 or so. It was never really tough to be smart or at the top at my school, people who worked hard and studied were often bullied and made fun of by people. I took AP courses and tests, only got 3s on them and only got a 27 on my ACT. I actually got lower on my second try at the ACT and that was devastating to me, especially when my friends who were out partying the night before all got 30s. 

I went to college my first year didn't study all that much and got mostly A's the first semster. Then B's thr second semester and in my second year things got worse. About halfway through my fall 2014 semester I started skipping class a lot to spend the night playing video games and watching youtube. I made it by the skin of my teeth and got C's and my GPA right now is about 2.6 or so.

So, spring comes around and the habits stay the same and I start failing hard. This makes me depressed and I skip class more and more often and eventually it climaxs with me going crazy and going to kill myself by jumping into the Mississippi River. I don't and end up in the hospital. The semseter goes on and I have to drop all my classes. I come back home for the summer and work 40 hours a week at a fast food job while all my old friends are out of state getting huge money working as interns for some pretty high name companies (Amazon, 3M...)

I have no friends at home of in college. The two years I spent there I spent alone in my dorm room and couldn't find anyone to relate to. Even my first year when I shared a floor with people in my major they never had any intersts with me. I liked RPGs and they only played FPS games that I never liked. They'd go out drinking and smoke weed and I'd never go because I don't partake in that stuff and the only people I could find that didn't partake in that stuff either were all religious amd I'm not religious.

And here I stand. I have no motivation anymore in my life and I can't find anyway to motivate myself to go to class anymore. I don't know how to study or how to stop playing games to get to studying. I have no friends, my parents are constantly worried I'm going to kill myself. I've tanked my GPA and have no work experience and can never get an internship anywhere good. I have nothing positive to look forward to in my life, I'm completely unhealthy in terms of food and hygiene and I know I should change thise things, but can't even get motivated to do that. Plus, I'm downright miserable in my major, but I don't want to change because of the money and 90% of the majors out there have NO job outlook whatsoever. I'll never be rich or famous or popular or do anything remotely useful with my life so maybe I should just kill myself. I just wish my parents were dead so I wouln't feel so guilty about doing it."
3ibl2j,12,2015-08-25,Interning at the same place for a few years during your college career vs. trying different companies each summer - what do you guys think?,Mechalien,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/3ibl2j/interning_at_the_same_place_for_a_few_years/,"I just finished a summer internship as software/systems engineer in a smaller company. It was a lot of fun, I made great money ($24/hour), flexible hours, and they invited me to intern again next summer. If I were to end up working there full time, I'd be making great money to start ($72k+). 

I'm going into my junior year, so I have one more summer before I have to consider full time work. However, I don't know if I want to settle so quickly in my college career. I have a pretty solid GPA, I'm president of the largest and most active engineering organization on campus, and I have a second major in Computer Science - I know there will be many other opportunities made available to me throughout this year, and I don't know if I want to lock myself in for next summer. The company I worked for typically gives their internship offers in October, and asks for a response by mid-November. Most other companies don't look for interns until mid-winter/early spring, so I would be making a decision without much chance to venture and see what else is out there.

I know this sounds kind of silly, but I figure that others must have been in the same position at some point, and I want more perspective.

I was wondering what kind of things they would want to hear from an aspiring system administrator. For example, if I tell them about my experience creating and deploying images, or being a java programmer intern for a year, how do I sell that experience to an employer looking for a sys admin.

Also, I've never worked very much with VMware desktop applications. I have looked but there aren't too many options for someone who wants to try and create a setup at home to study off of. For example, how do people even go about creating vdi images, how do drivers get pushed on them through whatever management software vmware is using, and how are they deployed? I've always been curious about these types of things in regards to vmware and xenapp and whatever else is being used.

Anyways, here's the job description. Any help would be appreciated. I'm stoked to try and not live in poverty anymore.

3idh7j,1,2015-08-25,"College senior undergoing treatment for depression and anxiety, needing to learn independence and self-care",Ave-Ianell,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3idh7j/college_senior_undergoing_treatment_for/,"I'm a 22 year old female, two semesters away from graduating college. I was officially diagnosed with depression and anxiety at age 19, although I've been experiencing symptoms since I was a child. It took an emergency room visit for my parents to finally take me seriously and give me the support I needed, which I'm pretty grateful for.

However, when I am away for college, all that progress I made is thrown out the window. My health and hygiene routines become very sporadic, I gradually become withdrawn, and I can no longer keep up in my classes. When I lived alone for the first time, there were days where I didn't bother showing up for class. I never felt motivated to do chores unless I felt that I was about to gag from all the trash and dirtied dishes.

Ultimately, my parents packed up my apartment and brought me back home at the end of last school year--not without complaining about the state of my apartment the entire time.

Later on, I went on a class trip to New Mexico toward the end of May, never taking my meds for the whole week-and-half. I had a ""relapse"" the moment I drove back home and I was whisked to yet another hospital.

After I was discharged, I spent the entire summer living the hermit life at my parents' house, never communicating with my friends or classmates. My only social interactions (face-to-face) are with my parents, my doctors and therapist, my much older coworkers, and any cashiers I encounter when I do go out.


This semester, I've transferred to a university that's only a 40 - minute drive from home. Every morning at 6 a.m. my mom wakes me up to administer my meds and gives me a list of chores/errands to do throughout the day. Then it's off to school or my internship. Just a normal day, every day, under the care of Mom.

The trouble is that I'm about to graduate into the ""real world"" soon, and I just don't think I am prepared to be responsible for myself. I fear that I've become so accustomed to being baby-fied under my parents' roof that I'll become a leech to my parents and the government (I'm on food stamps and Social Security Income, which my mom signed me up for without telling me). Much like typical Millennials, I've had so many things handed over to me, that I don't know what goes on behind the scenes of full-time adulthood (e.g. finances, insurance, ownership).

What makes me a special snowflake in this case, though, is that I also don't know how to manage my whole being, I can't push myself to stick to a routine.  I'm so accustomed to following orders that I don't I don't think I can survive living independently.  What if I make it a habit of skipping my meds again? Then it's another relapse and recovery process where someone has to hold my hand at all times. This vicious cycle has to stop. 

Can the kind folk of /r/Advice direct me to some resources? I'm also seeing a doctor and therapist, but their appointments are getting more and more spaced out.

Tl;dr: depressed Millennial about to graduate college wants to be a contributing member of society without mooching off the mother and government funds. Also has bad habits of not following habits, which could be detrimental to mental health."
3idlzt,6,2015-08-25,Focus on interview prep or side projects?,ubicate,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3idlzt/focus_on_interview_prep_or_side_projects/,"Hi everybody,

So I'm a rising sophomore trying to prep as much as I can for next summer recruiting. I have two side project ideas that I want to go through with (one will take far more time than the other). At the same time, I'm working through the problems on InterviewBit and, since I'm taking an Algorithms &amp; Data Structures class this fall, I'm trying to put in some independent studying on sorting, binary search, hash tables, etc.

How should I be balancing my time between side projects and interview preparation? This is sort of my thought process, please correct me if I'm wrong.

&gt; I have minimal experience but have some connections I've made with people in different companies. I can hopefully get them to connect me with recruiters / push a resume inside the companies themselves. With their help, I can hopefully get an interview. At this point, my resume is not really very relevant anymore. [is this true?] From that point onwards, I need to be really good at interview questions, and if I can do well on the interviews, I have a good chance at getting the internship.

So with that thought process, my hunch is to put more time in interview preparation than in side projects. Is this a good way to think?

Also note that the only projects I have right now are all academic, i.e. I did them in the courses I took this last year.

Thanks in advance to everybody!"

If you don't have an account, now's a perfect time to sign up and explore.
 |Stuff was going really well until I added in the soy milk, which doesn't seem to pair will with the other ingredients. It seems like a [chicken curry](https://www.ibmchefwatson.com/recipe/3121d317-99b4-41a7-ba35-35f7eaf4b28c) would be a fairly safe bet. Although you'll need some additional stuff to make it truly tasty.

[Hi, I have an interview for a job at Shop Direct in the morning, who recently had a video on your channel talking about a partnership together. Is there anything I could bring up about this partnership that would make me seem knowledgeable and a better candidate in the interview? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3id842/we_are_the_ibm_chef_watson_team_along_with_our/cufissj?context=5)|I guess a lot of it depends on what sort of position you're interviewing for. I'm a technical person, so I'd naturally try to figure out what the partnership means for backend technical systems. For example, [IBM is working with Shop Direct](http://www-03.ibm.com/press/uk/en/pressrelease/46047.wss) to create a hybrid cloud solution. Understanding why the company looked for a hybrid cloud is important if you're looking at being a systems architect. Knowing the advantages (seemless scaling with some locality, etc) vs the disadvantages (heterogeneous environment, etc) might be helpful.
 |Good luck with your interview. Afterwards unwind with a Chef Watson designed cocktail (yes, it generates cocktail recipes too).
 |Also, insert the usual disclaimers here. I'm an American and know very little about Shop Direct and aside from a few mentions in the press or internal communications I haven't been involved and have no real knowledge of any of the collaborations between IBM and Shop Direct.
[How homogeneous are AI and big data, insofar as ""the future"" in technology is concerned? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3id842/we_are_the_ibm_chef_watson_team_along_with_our/cufkla0?context=5)|That's a very broad question and you'll get lots of varied answers from luminaries in the field. The main thing is that advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms need data - lots of it. Incredible amounts of data. The amount of data that you and I process on a daily basis makes even the largest system seem tiny.
 |Where we have challenges is making sense of that data. When the data is structured, as is often the case with ""big data"", it's easier to apply standard ML techniques to generate something like a decision tree. When it's unstructured, such as images, audio, video, or even natural language, it's a lot more work. There's a gap that remains in getting this huge volume of unstructured information into a form that is usable for ML systems. That's where we're going to see a lot of innovation in the near future.

Really it's designed to work with people to create interesting recipes rather than work in a vacuum.
 |Despite these caveats, I get chuckles when Chef Watson generates something really crazy - like telling me to mix lobster and chocolate (not even going to try that). A good recipe which I thought was actually really good but apparently some people really disliked was the Austrian Chocolate Burrito. FastCompany proclaimed ""[IBM's Watson Designed The Worst Burrito I've Ever Had](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3045147/ibms-watson-designed-the-worst-burrito-ive-ever-had)"".

Then placed on a barbecue.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3id842/we_are_the_ibm_chef_watson_team_along_with_our/cufg3fc?context=5)|Behind the scenes when you see something like ""Shelled green peas cut into 3/4"" pieces"" it's probably trying to substitute green peas in for a similar ingredient. Likely the original ingredient needed to be unwrapped and then sliced. So the natural parallel was to suggest to shell the green peas.
[While I'm sure I could use my human brain to figure out how to make the recipe, can you give any insight as to what is happening with the technology that causes these errors?  What's missing to make it ""smarter""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3id842/we_are_the_ibm_chef_watson_team_along_with_our/cufg3fc?context=5)|Creating new recipes from natural language recipes is difficult work. Not only do we need to understand what goes into the recipe, but what the purpose of each ingredient is and how they pair with each other. Sometimes we get things wrong, most of the time we get things right.  As for what's missing to make it smarter - high quality data. Lots of it.

Can the chef answer jeopardy questions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3id842/we_are_the_ibm_chef_watson_team_along_with_our/cufdkr6?context=5)|Watson is a collection of technologies - many of which were used to win Jeopardy! in 2011. One of major features that we utilize on Chef Watson is the system to parse unstructured English language content. The recipes that are used to help train the system are the simply the HTML of the recipes available from [bonappetit.com](http://www.bonappetit.com/?mbid=IBM), which we parse and convert into structured text.
 |Contrary to our initial assumptions, this isn't an easy process. Recipes have their own peculiar way of being written which is far different than anything we'd encountered before.
[Is IBM Watson dedicated to a single functionality at a time or can Watson work on Chef, healthcare, business, etc simultaneously?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3id842/we_are_the_ibm_chef_watson_team_along_with_our/cufekry?context=5)|Watson is a collection of technologies related to cognitive computing. There is no one central Watson instance that contains everything that Watson knows (i.e. Watson is not a generalized AI). Rather, we have many places and technologies that utilize Watson technologies in a manner that is customized to the business case at hand. If you're a developer you can use many of these technologies yourself on the [Watson Developer Cloud](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/) - which I can talk about *much* more if folks are interested.
[What recipes, suggested by Chef Watson, have you guys tried? How did they turn out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3id842/we_are_the_ibm_chef_watson_team_along_with_our/cufefpq?context=5)|Somehow, even though I am American, I am a huge fan of poutine. IBM did a poutine recipe challenge earlier this summer and came up with some terrific ways to reinvent poutine. You can find a selection of these great recipes at our [cognitive cooking site](http://www-03.ibm.com/innovation/ca/en/cognitivecooking/vote-now.html#toronto). I actually made the [Japanese-middle eastern onion ring poutine](http://www-03.ibm.com/innovation/ca/en/cognitivecooking/recipe-jpn-egy.html). It was awesome.

Maybe it's julienned, diced, or shredded instead.
 |[Chef Watson isn't a genetic algorithm that can self-propagate](https://xkcd.com/720/). - so we can't create thousands of systems and have a bakeoff to see which works the best, but we do constantly improve the system and evaluate builds against each other.

[This is an amazing project. I saw a recipe food Web info graphic a while back and always thought it'd be possible to make and app that helps people cook and find flavours. And you guys have done it which is awesome! How did you guys end up on the Watson team? And what would you recommend that someone should do who wants to get into data science?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3id842/we_are_the_ibm_chef_watson_team_along_with_our/cufhlvo?context=5)|Many of the people on the Chef Watson started out in research where we explored the boundaries of computer science. In my case I looked at how people came together build complex software systems. Other folks on the team looked at the intersection of design and software development, nano technologies, business process management, and in the case of /u/fpinel, he went to the Institute for Culinary Education while he was working at IBM.
 |The one thing that unifies all of us? Relentless curiosity and a desire to build systems to explore those questions.

""We're going to feed you an experimental dish in a crazy giant magnetic tube and record what's going on in your brain.""
 |Beyond that, some of the flavor information in Chef Watson is based on the science of hedonic psychophysics.
[What do you guys think about Soylent?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3id842/we_are_the_ibm_chef_watson_team_along_with_our/cuffc96?context=5)|I'll freely admit that I tried soylent on the advice of one of my past summer interns. It was interesting. But it turns out that I really like food and eating with other people. So it never stuck with me. I understand why people might like it, but for me it just didn't work.
[, I would like to say that I've been using Chef Watson almost since it launched, and I'm a huge fan of the service!  It has definitely made my cooking more efficient and reduced the amount of ingredients I have to throw out.  That said, I really wish there was a way to filter the recipes by complexity.  Some of the things that Watson comes up with are really involved to cook.  How feasible do you think it would be to add a feature to sort by time of cooking and number of ingredients?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3id842/we_are_the_ibm_chef_watson_team_along_with_our/cufkiwv?context=5)|Thanks for the suggestion. I've also noticed that sometimes Chef Watson generates interesting recipes but they're overly complicated and would require me to have six burners on my stove. My favorite incident of an overly complicated recipe was one that called for 561 acai berries. Something strange happened and the dish was ruined. In a post-mortem of my cooking attempt (I'm a software guy, don't judge) it was discovered that I used 562 acai berries. There was much shame in my household that evening.

I'm a CS student, going into year 2 of 3 (no work placement/industrial year due to financing issues) which means I'll be looking at getting an internship over the summer next year to gain some real world experience. 

I know what I want to go into, which is web development, but I don't have something that sets me aside from the crowd right now.

I feel as though if I walk into a firm and proudly display a portfolio of HTML personal sites with 4 pages and no real skill shown, I'll be laughed out of the door (please correct me if I'm wrong there, just assuming!). So, my question to you is:

- Do I spend the next month of my summer, between 12-14 hours a day (I enjoy it), and the majority of the year next academic year in my spare time building a big project, or a series of smaller ones?

I was sat with a friend a few days ago and we were talking about building a few things over the next few years before working, and I thought it would be incredible to basically **build reddit from the ground up**.

If I took a fully functional and (relatively) secure fresh build of reddit into a web development firm looking for an internship, would they be more likely to give me a job over a few different websites such as custom WP themes, HTML 5 templates and the like?

*Also, sorry if this seems a bit all over the place, currently running on 4 hours of sleep.*

Thanks in advance guys :)"
3idye2,93,2015-08-25,The Bastard provides.,LP970,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/3idye2/the_bastard_provides/,"Greetings TFTS, I do L1 and L2 support for business clients. As the lowly intern (finishing my ACT degree) at the company I get the jobs that require lots of repetitive tasks and anything that deals with hardware. I'm more than happy to do so and have gotten pretty good at attaching/detaching those really small ribbons inside of laptops and such. I don't get to do much in the way of software other than installing OS's and such. On to the story.  
I'm comfortably sitting at my workstation surrounded by my three screens, two customer laptops i'm cleaning and a tablet when my boss swings by and hands me a little notebook/laptop with one of those swiveling touch-screens.  

**Boss:** ""Here you go rookie, pull the HDD and run a diskcheck. I need to know if it just has some bad sectors or if it's a gonner.""  

**Me:** ""Will do! Ugh, why is it so...dirty?""  

**Boss** ""(Laughs) No idea, looks like they were eating french fries or something, get some gloves if you want.""  

He walks away and I proceed to get out my set of screwdrivers and pull the hard-drive, ran disk checking utility on a testing rig and sure enough the thing is toast. I tell Boss and he orders a new one.  
A few days pass and the new drive shows up. I install it and then go to load an OS only to realize that there is no disk drive.  

*No worries, I'll just grab the portable drive and just plug in via USB.*  

The portable DVD drive was no where to be found.  

*I know, I'll make a bootable USB drive and install it that way.*  

I pop the DVD into my workstation and toss it's contents onto my flash drive and then boot up the little laptop with my drive plugged in. 

    No hard disk is detected.  

*F$ck! Now what do I do?*  

I realized that the contents of the disc were an extraced .iso and that they would only be recognized once the machine was booted into an OS. It was then that I remembered the magic that is /u/Tuxedo_Jack 's TuxPE.  

*I wonder....if this works I'm having some Balvenie 14 tonight! (you have to celebrate the little things)*  

So I booted up TuxPE and then popped in my flash drive, ran the installer for the OS, told it which drive to install on and then waited. Successful install was achieved but would it boot on it's own?  Eject my TuxPE drive and my other drive and then restarted the laptop. Sweet honeybee of infinity! It booted. I've only been at this game for a few months and was very proud of myself for figuring this one out sans Google.  

**TLDR** Portable operating systems are a real lifesaver. "
3iegsb,1,2015-08-25,Is a full time internship worth it?,KidReynolds,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/3iegsb/is_a_full_time_internship_worth_it/,"Hi /r/EngineeringStudents, sorry if this has been asked before, but I recently have been offered a full time internship at a local company. It seems like a really great experience but two things are making me rethink it.    

1. It is full time and for two semesters, effectively delaying my graduation for about a year.

2. It may be unpaid.

Do you guys think it is worth it? I still have about three semesters before I graduate (Fall, Spring, and Summer), which is a good amount of time to search for more internships, hopefully part time, and paid. Or would I be missing out on a great opportunity by not taking this chance?"

3iep3h,28,2015-08-25,House sitting,voicelessdeer,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3iep3h/house_sitting/,"Over the summer while I was on break from college, I worked at The IT office at my school. It was a pretty damn cool job and the people I worked with were really awesome! About a month and a half into the job, my co-worker, David, asked me to house sit and take care of their animals for him and his family while they went away on vacation. They had a chicken, a few cats, and a beautiful German Sheppard they adopted from a farm that bread police K-9's. Now let me tell you, I'm suuuuper allergic to cats, and by that I mean all I can do is blow my nose and sneeze for 3 days after coming in contact with them and bc  ecause of this, I was really tempted to say no, but he was doing me a huge favor by letting me be his intern the upcoming semester doing database work and other programming stuff and the house sitting pay was great, so I figured why the hell not. He was planning on being gone for a week which wasn't all that bad anyway and he suggested I get my girlfriend to stay over so I wouldn't be all alone at his house which I thought was pretty rad. 


About a week later, we were leaving work to go check out his house. We got out of work around 5 and headed over there after stopping to get some food. He has a really cool Log house set pretty far back into the woods with a looooong gravel and stone driveway that seperated the house from the road. It was about a quarter mile stretch of drive way which wouldn't normally be that bad, but unfortunately for me, my car was bottoming out like crazy from the bumpy driveway, so I figured I should leave my car where it was and catch a ride up with him. So I started beeping my horn like a mad man to get him to stop, which worked, and hopped in his jeep.  He apologized a bunch of times on the rest of the drive up and said he hadn’t realized his driveway was that bad as him and his wife both have jeeps and never have a problem with it. He offered to leave the keys to the other jeep so I could use it while they were gone, but I turned down his offer as my girlfriend has a Cr-V and would be staying with me the whole week. So the next hour or so was spent meeting his family, his amazing dog Jada, and strolling through his woods chatting. Time came to leave, as I had made plans that night, and he handed me the key to the house and the money he was going to pay me too. I bid him and his family goodbye and told them to have fun on their vacation and left for a night of fun bar hopping with some of my old friends from high school.


The next 4 days went off mostly without a hitch. His dog, Jada, really had severe anxiety because she HATED being alone in the house which I could easily see when I arrived to his house every day after work. She would tear open food bags, open drawers, remove all of the cushions from the couch, and even left some pretty bad scratch marks on the front door. I called David to tell him upon arrival on the fourth day and told him about the door, he was a little pissed off, but he said not to worry about the door and apologized for the extra cleaning I’d had to do. I said no worries and we were saying our goodbyes as my girlfriend’s phone started ringing. It was her boss, turns out her coworker went into labor and he needed someone desperately to cover her overnight shift. She reluctantly said yes and it seemed as if It’d be just me and Jada watching Netflix that night. She left pretty soon after receiving the call, which sucked because it was raining and I had to drive down the driveway with her to move my car and walk back up, which turned into more of a run, in the rain.

As soon as we got in her car, Jada started howling and going nuts inside like she does every morning when we leave, and I was a little aggravated as I would probably get back soaked and have to clean up some mess she made again. Fast forward 15 minutes and I’m just reaching the front steps. I noticed I didn’t hear Jada barking which was odd as she was usually going nuts when we would pull up after work. I figured it may be a good thing as she may have just laid down and not made too much of a mess in my absence…Boooy of boy was I wrong. The house was literally TRASHED. Now I’ve seen some pretty damn messed up house being a college kid and going to frat parties and what not, but this took the cake. In the three seconds it took for me to walk in, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing..Dvd’s were thrown off of the wall shelves, cushions tore off the couch, blinds knocked down, dog and cat food bowls flipped over, somehow the fridge was open, the TV was knocked over,  and there was Jada.. sitting in the middle of the mess shivering. She seemed to know she was in trouble by the look on her face and I almost felt bad for her. She seemed to not notice my presence for the first few seconds I was in the house until all of a sudden she flew up and jumped in front of me and started growling a low and deep growl the likes I’d never heard before. My heart literally froze and I tensed up, not because I was afraid of her, I was more afraid that she did this as turned her back to me as she stared with her tail tucked and ears high towards the door in the kitchen leading to the basement.  I stood there almost frozen for a few moments as the situation played out until I finally regained some sort of brain function and reached in my pocket to grab my knife. I flipped it open and told Jada to guard in German. She was very well trained and David was sure to show me this while showing me the house, lucky for me, she was trained in German which made it easy for me to give her commands as I have taken quite a few German language classes in college. She backed up a little and rested almost between my legs as she let out another deep growl. I walked backwards slowly while glancing over my shoulder towards the front door until we reached it. I peered outside towards the ever darkening landscape of his house and saw the coast was clear, so I stepped out. Once off of the porch, I told Jada to follow and ran as fast as I possibly could to my car. Once at the bottom of the hill, we both jumped in my car and I dialed 911. 

In the panic, I forgot the house address and had to do a very awkward 3 way call to David as I explained what was happening and that I was house sitting for a friend. David picked up and immediately fell silent as I told him what was happening, he seemed to whisper the address to the dispatcher and told me to call me back as soon as the police were there. It took nearly 15 minutes, but finally a squad car roared up and started asking me questions. I told him I was house sitting and how I had gone down the driveway to let my girlfriend out, and came back to the house trashed, and how Jada went absolutely berserk. He told me several other officers were almost there and he was going to wait until they showed up so I wouldn’t be left alone and so he didn’t go up alone. A few more minutes passed and several others showed up. I mentioned that their cars would not make it up and suggested they take the police SUV one of them arrived in, but they brushed my suggestion off and three cars drove up the driveway moments later.  It seemed like nearly an eternity had passed by since the officers took off up the driveway, and the whole time, I was being asked over and over again what had happened. I got the feeling the cops thought I was high or something due to my eyes being extremely red from my allergies and they kept asking me if I had drank or ingested any drugs that evening. I thought it was pretty rude to be asking me these questions given the circumstances, but you know cops, so I told him about my allergies and he made a face in disbelief and told me to take a seat. After what felt like an eternity more, I figured I should call David back and tell him what was going on. He didn’t pick up so I left him a voicemail telling him what was going on and asking him to please call me back. Almost as soon as I hung up, I heard the cars come scraping down the driveway and saw their bright headlights peer out from around the first corner of the driveway. Two of them hopped out of their cars with stern looks on their faces and asked me what the hell was really going on and to stop wasting their time. I was almost in shock and asked them what they meant. The officer told me that he didn’t think it was funny that I call and make up stories, that they had searched the entire house and property, and didn’t find anything.  I told him I wasn’t making it up and I was very mad he would say that. He told me there was no mess at all, no sign of break in, and above all else, no evidence other than my delusions to support anything I stated. At this point, I was pissed the fuck off and started getting very loud with the cops. I told them to all go fuck themselves and they were good for nothing but hassling people and giving out fines to line the states pockets. This must have hit a nerve, because the cop in front of me slammed me on my car and twisted my arm pretty good. He got so close to my face I could almost taste the fish he must have eaten for dinner and told me I was lucky he didn’t beat my ass for wasting their time and let me go. They told me they were giving me a ticket for prank calling them and after that, they left. 


I was absolutely stunned at how they handled the situation and didn’t know what to do. Should I go back up to the house? They said it was clear…but they also said there was no mess. Had I really imagined everything up to that point? Jada seemed to have read my mind and started barking and rubbing against me. I asked her if she wanted to go back up and she sat and stared at me almost as if she was in a trance.

My only qualm was that there wasn't a lot of coding projects, more of just technical work, setting up environments and VMs etc. I would've preferred to get more experience creating software for projects etc. The company liked having me this summer and has given me a return offer with a $1 pay raise for 2016 summer. However, they have only given me 2 weeks to decide. 

What are your thoughts on returning to the same internship? Would it be better to look for a new internship? Spread skillset etc?

&amp;nbsp;

As the Board of Directors shuffled into the conference room, their chitinous exoskeletons creaking, the being already present in the room placed a small device on the center of the table. Taking their seats in the chairs that rose out of the floor, curved to fit their physique, the group slowly came to order. The being sitting at the head of the table, dressed more sharply than the rest in richly colored robes, coughed slightly before speaking.

&amp;nbsp;

“Intern Krevik, for what purpose do you presume to call us here?” His voice was calm, but certain. Like stormclouds on the horizon. far enough to have no effect currently, but that could change very swiftly.

&amp;nbsp;

The intern coughed, a meek, slightly terrified sound. “As you may know, I was brought into this company to study other species that might partake in our services, as caffeine is a valuable commodity. I also know that you enjoy spending as little money as possible in the upkeep of your very profitable business, thus putting more money in all of our pockets.”

&amp;nbsp;

The Board nodded collectively, always eager to entertain an idea that would bring them more wealth.

&amp;nbsp;

“Well,” Krevik continued, “my idea may be quite drastic, but I suggest we start hiring outside of our own species to run our establishments.” He quickly held up one of his four arms to quell the outrage he knew would be coming. “I’m not referring to completely replacing our workforce with others. Merely placing another species on the more… intense shifts, to increase productivity. One race in particular, actually.”

&amp;nbsp;

The well-dressed being at the head of the table sat up straighter in his chair. “I’m assuming you have a race in mind, intern?”

&amp;nbsp;

“Krevik, sir. And yes. Please observe.” With one three-fingered hand, Krevik reached out and tapped the center of the device placed on the table. Instantly, a still image appeared in the air above it, depicting the inside of a caffeine shop, with what appeared to be two fleshy, nigh-hairless creatures manning the registers. “Humans. Remarkably adaptable, as you well know. This recording was taken during what seems to be a ‘morning rush’ at this particular establishment. Please continue observing.”

Several minutes passed, with the two humans going about various tasks. Cleaning this, restocking that, serving the occasional customer. The Board was quickly becoming, well, bored. Two more humans, both of them female, with what would be considered attractive faces, entered the establishment and walked behind the counter throwing on ‘aprons’, as they were called, and beginning to work. Soon enough, the entire lobby of the establishment was flooded with patrons from a large number of species, all seeking that delicious, energy-giving caffeine. 

The human making the most popular medium for the substance, drinks, was churning out beverages at a pace that would make the most dextrous species blush - including those that physically did not have the ability to. The Board watched in rapt attention as the human dumped scalding hot water all over his arm. Surely this human would scream in agony and have to be taken away from his position in order to recover. Much to their surprise, and mild horror, the man simply bared his teeth, wiped off most of the water, and continued making drinks, his arm still steaming from the heat.

The human taking orders was moving with an almost mechanical efficiency, pausing only briefly to ensure her coworker was okay before smoothly greeting the next customer, suggesting a telepathic link of some type between the coworkers. She smiled a wide, genuine smile as a Avec woman, a species known for their shrill, blood-curdlingly loud voices screamed at her for not attending to her needs sooner. The human female continued smiling, gave the Avec a discount, and swiftly moved to the next customer. The Board was in awe.

“As you can see,” Krevik began, breaking through their glassy stares, “humans can withstand a wide variety of punishment, while still maintaining their effectiveness while under extreme duress. I will now show you one of our own species, after a similar shift.” Krevik tapped a smaller button on the side of the device, and the image of the two humans working dispersed, quickly replaced by another.

&amp;nbsp;

A Krek, one of their own kind, was huddled in the back room of a popular caffeine joint, their uniform soaked with various fluids. The poor creature was curled up, rocking back and forth, attempting to calm itself.

&amp;nbsp;

Another press of the button, and the traumatized Krek was gone, replaced with the smooth efficiency of the humans once more.

&amp;nbsp;

The Board looked to each other and nodded. “Find us some of these humans. Employ them immediately. Thank you for your contribution to this company, Intern.”

&amp;nbsp;

“Its Krevik…” the intern stated meekly as the Board filed out, either not hearing or not caring about his words. As the door slid shut behind them, the video switched to the back room of the human’s caffeine establishment. The human who had dumped water on his arm was pacing back and forth, rubbing his face. On the faint audio that the recording carried, Krevik thought he could hear speech. Eager to hear the pep talk the human was obviously giving himself, he adjusted the volume higher.

&amp;nbsp;

“Fucking xenos…” the human said. “They’re never nice to us. I hope you like your goddamn decaf. Alyssa! Did that bitch really yell at you like that? What the fuck? I thought the windows were going to shatter. Next time, tell her ‘I hope your day is as lovely as you are!’ They always think it’s a compliment!” Soon enough, another human, which he assumed was this ‘Alyssa’, joined him in the back room. The male looked at her and gave a smile. “If it wasn’t for all the free drinks we get, and all the booze I have at home, I’d probably go on a killing spree. It would start here.” Much to his horror, the female nodded in agreement.

&amp;nbsp;

“Oh dear,” stated Krevik."

This past summer, I did a software engineering internship at Comcast. It really opened my eyes to the fact that in two years I'll actually have to get out into the work force, so I need to figure out what I want to do with my life. And as I looked at the day to day happenings in the office I worked in, I was confronted with the question of if this is really what I want to do with my life.

My friends who are EE's feel the same way, and it has nothing to do with a lack of skill or anything. 

I've just become totally apathetic towards engineering and the subjects I'm learning about. And the worst part is I really don't even have a plan B. I still plan on getting my bachelors in engineering, mainly because my parents can't afford to pay for another year of college. But after that, I have no idea.

Is this just a phase people go through?"
3ifnl0,2,2015-08-26,Career Advice: High GPA but no Experience,CountingIsDifficult,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/3ifnl0/career_advice_high_gpa_but_no_experience/,"Hi guys. I am a second year EE major with a Math minor who will probably finish my degree next year and I am in need of some advice. Sorry if I sound a bit incoherent– right now I am a bit depressed.  

I was pretty good with math and physics in high school. So people kept telling me that I should become an engineer. Furthermore, my dad has been pushing me to become an EE. So I went to study EE in a top 25 university, all the while not knowing what an EE does and feeling no passion for it. But my dad said I would get more passionate about it as I learn more, so I didn't pay much attention to it.  

Now here comes another source of the problem– my dad expects me to graduate in three years and go to work right after that. I just finished my second year, so this means I have one more year before I am done with school. Even given the time constraints, academically I am still doing fine. I have been taken 5 to 6 STEM classes pretty much every quarter since I got into college (my school is on a quarter system, so 15~18 classes a year). Even then I still have straight A/A+s in all of my STEM classes with an overall GPA of 3.97. I even managed to squished a Math minor into my three year plan. I also plan to take a couple graduate classes next year.  

Now here is where everything went wrong. I have a mild case of social anxiety, so I am very sensitive to criticisms. And when I first got into college, I expected myself to get into a PhD program after graduation, so I did not pay much attention to extracurriculars and internships. Since I thought they are not relevant to grad school, and I didn't want people to find out that I don't know how to do the technical stuff, and I wasn't really interested in them, I naturally stayed away from that. So the only EC I have is micromouse with IEEE, and I have no internship experience because I was too scared to apply.  

All these would have been fine if I successfully got into a good grad school. But my search for research experience didn't work as well as I had hoped. I only got a research position with a professor this summer, and there is very little chance that I'll get published. Furthermore, I don't know who to ask for letters of recommendation because I barely attended the classes. So there is very little chance of getting into a top PhD program.  

I have thought about getting a Master's instead at my current univerisity as I am guaranteed a spot with my GPA. But I worry about the funding because my dad has made it clear that he wants me to go to work and will not pay for my college tuition.  

Any advice on what I can do?  

TL;DR  

Will soon graduate in next year with high GPA. Can't get into top grad school because no publication/good letter of rec. Considered Master's but worry about funding. Can't get a job because no internship/project experience. Need advice."

3ihg6r,1,2015-08-26,"Dad flew me halfway across the country to meet his mistress AND her three children, who I didn't know of until minutes before meeting them.",IsAThrowawayTho,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3ihg6r/dad_flew_me_halfway_across_the_country_to_meet/,"I am a female in my mid-twenties (originally from California) wrapping up a summer internship on the east coast having the time of my life. I planned on having one last adventure in the city during my last weekend before returning home this Saturday, until my dad decided to fly me out halfway across the country to visit him where he works.

**Backstory:** *My parents, who’ve been married for just over 30 years, are hardworking individuals and have raised us well. Much of the credit towards achieving the American Dream goes to my mom for flying halfway across the world away from their native country to land a job in the U.S., where my dad and two older siblings (who were toddlers at the time) eventually joined. After years of working up the corporate ladder, we’ve been living a comfortable upper-middle class lifestyle in California. Everything looks fine on the outside.*

*I'm the youngest of three and am extremely close to my dad, primarily because my mom (although very loving) has the tendency to nag and micromanage like crazy - a side of her my dad says caused them to grow apart over the years. Because of this, he was quick to accept a job offer out of state six years ago. A couple years before this, my mom suspected him of infidelity when she saw him frantically closing out tabs on the computer when entering their bedroom to the point of locking the door and demanding he fessed up to which he adamantly denied. Since then, they've continued as normal.*

*There was an incident in 2010 when my sister was in Vegas and dad was ""in Phoenix on business""... until she saw him strolling along at Cesar's Palace with a younger and older woman (presumably the mother). When she confronted him about it a week later, he vehemently denied anything was going on and that the woman was “just a friend/coworker.*”

Since moving out of state for work, his weekend visits became so sparse to the point where he barely comes every month – usually on Saturdays and leaves early Sunday mornings. Mom is under the impression this is all temporary and he'll be back permanently in due time, despite recently accepting another job offer in a different state (much further away) in the middle of the country. He admitted to me that he is much happier with his freedom (never having to report to her what time he's coming home, what he's up to, etc) and that he no longer loves my mom. She waits on him hand and foot when he actually is around while he treats her as a roommate. My siblings and I suspected him of dating other women/having second families with them because he was never short on excuses of why we couldn’t just fly up and visit him, why he couldn’t make it to my older sister’s wedding, etc.

Meanwhile, my gut feeling all these years have pointed to him having affairs but hoping he had stopped while I maintained distance from involvement. I tend to give him the benefit of the doubt because of how close we are, but this weekend took the cake. I assumed I would fly out to where he resides for work, anticipating a weekend of bonding time and sightseeing. When we met at the airport he said, “We’re going to meet some friends of mine, but don’t judge.” My stomach dropped. *Don’t judge*? I joked with my fiancée days ago about this but assumed he wouldn’t pull such a heavy stunt. But there we were, driving to the other woman’s house. “I met someone, and we’ll be staying with her. She has three kids (two of which are teenagers).” *What the shit.* I couldn’t stomach this clusterfuck, and to top it off, I knew I was going to be forced into being social with a family of strangers I don’t even approve of. I flew into bum fuck Egypt for *this.*

After the awkward introduction, we all went out to lunch in the city, where there was continued awkwardness on the way there with forced dialogue (“IsAThrowAwayTho, why are you so quiet?”). It made me sick hearing this other woman say shit like, “Baby do you need cash for parking?”/”Are you okay honey?” While walking to the restaurant, my dad had the nerve to tell me to hold the 10-year-old girl’s hand while we crossed the street. I pretended not to hear him but he kept insisting. Fuck that, because who are these damn people. I was even more annoyed when we were alone at one point, and he told me to “talk more so that they get used to it.” No thanks, I refuse to play the big sister role to a bunch of strangers whose existence I just discovered an hour prior and act as if I condone your behavior. We walked to a nearby historical monument, where I was forced to take pictures with this family. “Smile, IsAThrowAway!” I found it weird the way he interacted with the kids, like he was trying too hard to tolerate them as a way of getting close to their mother. The little girl was trying to point something out at the monument but my dad kept brushing her off with, “Oh okay-okay, nice.” just to shut her up.

When my dad got up to use the restroom I asked how they met. “Online! He was just so funny and we Facetime’d before meeting…” It felt so fucked up hearing this lady gushing over my dad, who by the way, was no longer wearing his wedding ring.

We went back to the house with the intent to rest before dinner and I was told I’d be staying in the little girl’s room. Thinking I’d finally have a private moment to myself, I walked in only to see that the girl wasn’t going to leave. She sat in a chair in the corner playing games on a phone… while I was expected to nap/rest in her presence. I stepped outside to have a panicked phone call with my fiancée about all the awkwardness before mustering up the courage to talk to my dad. When I came back inside, I heard my dad call my name and followed his voice down the hallway, only to enter the bedroom of the other woman, where I saw them lying beside one another. “Is everything okay? Take a nap before we go out to dinner!” Yeahhh-NO. “Dad, can I have a word with you real quick?” I took him outside and told him how shocked I was being brought out here to encounter something I so strongly disapprove of, and his only reactions were to nod, tell me her understands, and say, “Okay. We’ll leave early tomorrow morning then [before the flight home].” He went back to the room to nap, and I felt like I was brushed off.

I needed an exit plan quick and neither Lyft nor Uber operate in this city. *Fuck.* I managed to find a cheap hotel deal for one night close to the airport and a taxi app, hoping the cab came quickly enough for me to sneak out. Just as it pulled up to the house, I grabbed my stuff, tip-toed to the front door thinking I was clear, and heard the lady from the kitchen say, “Is everything okay?” “Yeah, this was great. But I gotta go.” I sit in the back of the cab and just as I was about to pull up the address to the hotel, the cab driver told me to look up and I see my dad – eyes bloodshot, stifling tears. “Where are you going?! Why are you leaving?!” When I told him the situation made me uncomfortable to the point of getting a hotel room, he apologized to the cab driver and paid him cash, insisting he would take me instead. When we had a moment in the driveway, I echoed my previous sentiments of not wanting to be culpable in this mess. “Yeah, we should’ve gotten you a hotel room in the first place.” Uh, no… you should’ve never brought me out here, ever. “I knew you’d be shocked, but I was hoping you’d understand…” Wtf.

He was extremely apologetic on the drive to the hotel, saying he ruined my weekend. After he walked me to my room, we had a serious talk and I told him he needs to fix this before shit really hits the fan. I insisted they continue with their dinner reservation without me and he told me that it was for me, and that they would no longer be going. He ended the conversation with, “It would make me really happy to see you and have dinner with you tonight, it’s up to you. Text me, regardless of what you choose.” Come 7PM, I was torn between even seeing him again or going across the street to TGI Friday’s for buffalo wings, but I wanted to give him another chance. I told him, “I would like to have dinner with you, if and only if it is only you and me.” Assuming he’d pick me up for a father/daughter dinner date, he said, “I will bring you noodle stir fry, honey.” I chilled in my hotel room, waiting… and waiting… and telling my two older siblings about this ordeal, who were concerned with my safety and well-being. After about two hours, I told him not to come by anymore and that I’d take care of myself. “But I have food for you, do you want me to bring it? Cancel your order.” “Okay, fine.” Feeling guilty of rejecting him, I waited another hour. 10:15PM and he finally came by with what looked to be leftovers or takeout. I was angry at myself for being so forgiving when I was merely an afterthought while he was out treating his other family. The following morning when he dropped me off to the airport, he said, “I’m sorry this trip did not meet your expectations.” Well, no shit, you dropped a huge bomb on me.

Here’s the problem: My mom has no idea any of this is going on. I fly back home in California this Saturday; my dad plans on flying in, too. I was under the impression this would be the weekend he’d fess up, but he volunteered to help my older brother and his wife and baby move into their new apartment – my guess is he plans on coming clean to the family later in the weekend (if at all). My older siblings want to break the news to my mom either Friday or Saturday, likely before I arrive since my flight lands later afternoon. I’m grappling between even telling her because I’m trying to keep my distance from their marriage, but I feel it became my business from having involuntarily witnessed [evidence of] the affair firsthand. The fact that my mom can be a highly volatile person and my potential absence to help handle this as a family makes me uneasy and almost not looking forward to coming home. On top of all this, I begin school next Monday. So, the worst it still yet to come, because my mom’s reaction will be scary. Our rationale is that it would be better to brief mom on this to not only save ourselves from potential backlash (“If you knew, why didn’t you tell me?!?!”), but so that she doesn’t feel completely alone in all this (“if they knew and didn’t tell me, who else could I trust?”). My siblings have villainized the other woman, but I can't help but feel horrible for her - she thinks she is dating an honest man who is divorced and good to her children, and seemed excited to ""finally"" meet me because my dad often boasts about me. I can't rid myself of the guilt + feeling like I betrayed my dad's trust, despite him betraying the trust of the entire family.

I’m really sorry this was long but I’m panicking and I need insight. What is the best way to approach this while minimizing damage?

**TL;DR:** Dad has been working out of state for five years and has had a couple affairs while mom has been at home, working, and totally oblivious. He flew me out halfway across the country to hang out with him before I finish my summer internship on the east coast and I was under the impression it’d just be the two of us chillin’, until he introduced me to his mistress and her three children and didn't tell me about until minutes before meeting them. Mom has no idea and neither does the mistress, who probably thinks he is divorced."
3ihmvg,1,2015-08-26,I'm about to launch the first products for my online furniture company and am looking for marketing tips that I may not have thought of.,jcadem,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3ihmvg/im_about_to_launch_the_first_products_for_my/,"Hey all,
 
First off, this is a great subreddit and I've enjoyed perusing it lately.  I'll outline a little context and my question first, then get into some details.
 
&amp;nbsp;

**Context**

I've started my own furniture line called [Novello + Steele](http://www.novellosteele.com), it's flat-package furniture so it can be shipped and assembled easily but unlike IKEA it's all made of high quality, local, and sustainable materials, hand made and finished by me.  I'm confident in my cost analysis, profit margins, and competition research but am less sure of my marketing.

&amp;nbsp;

**My Question**

Do you fellow entrepreneurs have any tips or suggestions for online marketing, increasing visibility, and in general, generating interest?  

&amp;nbsp;

**More details**

I'll start by saying that my prospective customers are young professionals, out of college and looking to furnish a home with quality but affordable furniture.  The idea of furniture that can be disassembled and reassembled without falling apart appeals to them because we move more than ever before and nobody likes to pay high shipping costs.

&amp;nbsp;

My marketing theory is to gain a little traction by word of mouth in Oklahoma City, selling pieces in boutique stores etc, as well as approaching architecture firms and realtors to see if they will use my pieces to stages houses (each piece can be disassembled and reassembled without breaking like particle board) while I grow the internet marketing with more and more photos of the pieces being used.  I also have friends and friends-of-friends who run boutiques and interior design studios in LA, Chicago, and NYC which will help out after I can afford to produce a large inventory.

&amp;nbsp;

I noted that I have an instagram account, I'm not the greatest at hashtags, [case and point.](https://instagram.com/explore/tags/pleasesomeonebuymepizza/)

&amp;nbsp;
 
I followed [this tutorial](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/205814568-Increasing-your-site-s-visibility-to-search-engines) for my website which is hosted by squarespace.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I have one fairly popular LA based online store (curates and sells textile goods from South America, we share a similar prospective customer base) that is going to blog about my stuff, probably even selling it on their site, and an OKC blog lined up to do a post / professional video on myself and Novello + Steele.  I suppose my plan after all this is to approach like minded blogs to gauge interest and try to get featured around the net.

&amp;nbsp;
 
The other thing I've started is, I applied and was accepted to sell on [Amazon Handmade](http://services.amazon.com/handmade/handmade.htm) and figured out at which point in sales it would be feasible / profitable to also take advantage of amazon fulfillment (pretty soon, actually.) This will open up a huge customer base, I think.

&amp;nbsp;
 
Anyway, that's about it.  I'm starting production of the pieces this week / next week and should have the final packaging designs done and ordered.  In three weeks I should have a full inventory and gobs of photos of the furniture, boxed and unboxed.  I'd like to avoid a facebook page just because I don't want to get stretched too thin on the social media stuff, is there a way to mirror instagram posts automatically on facebook?  Unpaid intern?

&amp;nbsp;
 
Here's [just a couple screenshots of my backend spreadsheets,](http://imgur.com/a/7HKCz) by inputting my stock and number of orders per piece, it tells me exactly how much of each material i need to buy to fulfill all my orders and replenish ideal stock.  I also can track all my costs per piece and per order cycle.  Excel!

&amp;nbsp;
 
 
Uh, that's about it.  Thanks for reading and any input you might have and above all, thanks for being a group of innovators and thinkers."

My question is, what skills are employers looking for when deciding what level somebody is at?

At my previous internship, there were a mix of SEs and Senior SEs. The senior SEs had more responsibility, but I did not think of them as more capable. The regular SEs I believe probably could have learned do do what the senior SEs do in a month or two of working in that job role. 

What skills in particular make an engineer valuable? Is it just being able to maintainable / fast / good code in a short amount of time? Will you know you are better when you are able to solve the same problems faster?

When thinking of the architect that I knew, he had experience at the company, but so did other people who were nowhere near his rank. How much do employers care about years of experience when deciding what level you should be? Do they want many past projects you can point to with success, or just a few combined with the ability to demonstrate that you are competent enough for that level?

The main idea I am trying to pull out here, is what steps should I take to make myself valuable? And how will I know whether or not I am successful at that? I am in my junior year in college, and want to make myself as attractive as I can before I leave."

That is, this summer, my health went downhill, and my docs told me that I need a lung transplant if I'm to live past a year or two. I won't go into the details of why, because my story is rather elaborate, but I'm feeling awfully low about my prospects, even though I've been dealing with a chronic illness for most of my life. I know that the new lungs would offer me the chance to live again, but I'm just not able to put my life ""on hold"" while I'm waiting. Yes, my mobility is somewhat limited presently, and my current lungs are functioning at 20% of where they should be at, but I'm definitely not bedridden or on oxygen 24/7. I drive, and when walking at my own pace, can get around pretty well. 

I planned to move to Seattle this Fall, as I was admitted to UW's Ph.D. program in CS. As an undergrad, I did research, in human computer interaction, mostly, completed two summer research internships, and graduated with a 3.8 from a big state school in the South. I deferred admission to UW because I need to stay where I am, as this is where my transplant docs are and if I get sick across the country, I don't think I could manage without a social support system. So now I'm in this weird place where my entire undergrad career was built around research, but now I need a software engineering gig until I'm able to get new lungs, and move to Seattle.

I did work a couple semesters early in my college career as a part time mobile developer for a state funded R&amp;D center on campus, and the research projects I've worked on the last several years have involved a fair amount of coding (I'm an excellent Java coder, decent Android dev experience, feel pretty confident with front-end web dev in JavaScript, too - honestly feel that I could pick up any language 'on the job' given a few weeks). But my development experience definitely isn't on par with my research experience, even though I feel pretty good about my coding ability. Actually I was able to land an on site interview at Google in Mountain View last year when a friend slipped my resume to a recruiter. My whiteboard coding wasn't stellar enough to warrant an offer, but still I felt that I had ""my shit together"" for lack of a better phrase.

This summer I had to decide that if my breathing were to go downhill, if I'd go to hospice or pursue the transplant. I won't Iie, for some time, I was determined that I wasn't going to get the transplant. It would be my second one, and getting through the first was painful as hell. But I don't want to throw my life away because I worked my ass off in college, so I must keep my body strong and active for the surgery. I therefore need work, and paid work, because I also need to, like, make a living. 

And since I'm not going to land a research role without a graduate degree, I'd like to be a developer for an indefinite amount of time, which I wouldn't mind, if I'm coding things that excite me. I flatly don't have the energy to work on things that I'm not passionate about. I'm just coming out of a spell where I've been laying in bed mostly, because I was (1) physically sick and (2) very depressed and in shock. So I'm just beginning to code things again, my GitHub has been inactive for months, and my resume is a hot mess, with a gap since I graduated in May. I'm looking for jobs in Alabama, near Birmingham, maybe Huntsville, and it has to be here. But hunting down entry level positions months out of college and restructuring my goals after this summer has been very tough. I'm confident I could hit the ground running were I to land a job, but the couple places I applied to didn't even get back to me. All the positions I see request a couple years of dev. experience to start, and my resume is just... research. I also don't know how to ""pitch myself"" because at any point, I may have to run in order to get the transplant, or because of an infection, or whatever health flare-up comes up. How I've been dealing with it currently is just not mentioning it at all. 

I'm tired of being a degenerate in bed watching Netflix all day, and want to take control of my career. I guess I'm just looking for any advice on how to get a software developer job in light of my situation. Luckily I've got no student debt because I studied on a full scholarship, but my savings are quickly dwindling. Help!"

3iiz0f,0,2015-08-26,[NJ] Drove while DL was suspended stemming from a DUI/DWI. Judge's punishment didn't match up with guidelines,hypesdead,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3iiz0f/nj_drove_while_dl_was_suspended_stemming_from_a/,"Some backstory. Not sure if it is relevant so I'll try to be brief. I can explain anything in detail of needed:

Late August 2014- I was pulled over for tints and a broken headlight coming back from a company party (last day of my internship). Eventually blew a .08 in a school zone.

Mid November 2014- I eventually was convicted of a DUI after taking a plea deal that dropped the school zone, tints, and headlight tickets

January 20 2015- I was pulled over for using my cell phone while driving, did not have a valid license. Told officer why my license was suspended and was told to pull the car over and tickets were mailed to me.

August 19th- plea bargain dropped the cell phone. The judge sentenced me to 10 days in jail and said 30 days suspension of license on top of additional fines and such

I know driving drunk is inexcusable and I was equally bone-headed by driving while suspended with about a month to go on my original suspension. I had enough guilt building up for about 6 months leading up to my sentencing and jail was rough but I deserved it.

I'm 22 (21 when I was pulled over), have a clean driving record otherwise, and did not drive or attempt to reinstate my license since January.

My question is why was I suspended for only 30 days? I thought it was an additional year or two of suspension according to this:

http://www.state.nj.us/mvc/Violations/dui.htm

Of course I'd rather have 30 days but what can I expect from the MVC? I didn't have a chance to talk to my lawyer after sentencing as I was focused on the impending jail time. Without a question I heard 30 days but could I have gotten the DUI provision pleaded out and the judge just sentenced me off his own discretion? Should I just shut up and accept that I'm lucky....or not?

As in ""Yeah I may not be amazing but I can hold my own."" I graduated with a 3.2 in CS at a STEM heavy school. I have 2 internships. I thought I was at least competent but after a combination of:

1.) Choking under pressure

2.) Failing to solve straightforward, standard problems that made me think, ""that shouldve been trivial for you to solve and you couldnt solve it""

3.) Being asked questions about language specifics, OOP, design patterns, etc. that end up demonstrating just how little I know about software development. ""Gee I guess I dont know as much about that as I thought I did.""

I start to realize that my sense of self as far as programming skills go is way overinflated. I realize now my problem solving and thought processes are pretty remedial. You cant just solve everything with brute force and for loops but I honestly find myself reverting to that all the time. Anybody else feel like this?

3ikb8k,5,2015-08-27,GIS Jobs - Australia,savethevultures,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/3ikb8k/gis_jobs_australia/,"Hi all,

I am looking for a GIS job (currently living in Sydney) and I wanted some advice.I have done quite a bit of research on getting a GIS job, but actually landing one is another story (without any professional experience).

I have a Bachelor of Science (Geosciences) that included completing two GIS subjects (graduated 2012). I had trouble getting a job at the time so I enrolled into a Master of Environmental Management (part-time). I started to enjoy GIS more and have currently completed 2 more GIS subjects (and a remote sensing subject). I will complete another GIS subject before I graduate. I also plan to complete a guided research project (as a university subject) in GIS. 

In addition to studying GIS at university, I am also learning SQL and Python to help with the data analysis/data query.

I have looked up and been applying for GIS roles. I have subscribed and been reading the only GIS magazine in Australia. I have tried emailing companies to see if I can volunteer (for free), in exchange for experience. I have researched GIS internships (which seem to be more prevalent in the USA than here in Aus). I have gone to a GIS networking event, but nothing has come of it. I am (very) persistent with following things up. I have heard of GIS Corps Volunteering, but I feel I need the experience first before applying.

I have been talking to my GIS professor and she is trying to help set up work experience for me, but everyone seems to be firing people, not hiring people.

So, Q1. Any tips on how to further improve my skills? 

Q2. Would developing a 'map portfolio' like a graphic designer portfolio be beneficial? Or is this over the top?

Q3. How did the GIS analysts get your first GIS role? Most of the people I have talked to have gotten a job through knowing someone.

Thanks!

3ikdtx,1,2015-08-27,Deciding between internship and full time offer,joysofpi,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3ikdtx/deciding_between_internship_and_full_time_offer/,"I'm in the Bay Area going into my last semester of a Masters program in CS. I accepted an offer for an internship at a small but growing tech startup for the Fall. I've been really excited about this internship since it'll give me the chance to get some real world production experience. I signed an offer letter with them and am on track to start there soon. 

However, on Monday I was contacted by a university lab that I had interviewed with last month letting me know that they would like to offer me a full time position as a bioinformatics programmer in their group (which I think is where my long term interests are). This is an amazing opportunity that would let me work with really smart people at a top tier research institution. 

I'm leaning towards accepting this position and it was originally my first choice but the last week or two I have been psyching myself up for this internship, and I have a few reservations:

1. On principal I feel bad turning down an internship I have already accepted, especially so close to the start date
2. The internship pays about twice as much, which at least in the short term would make a significant financial difference
3. I think I'm more interested in research but was looking forward to having some hands on industry experience to compare to
4. I'm afraid going into research/academia will hurt my marketability later on if I do decide I want to try getting into industry.

Is it reasonable to turn down an interesting internship opportunity to pursue a (much lower paying) permanent position that *I think* is more in line with my career goals? Should I stick with the internship I've already committed to but risk having to start my job search again in January, albeit with some hopefully valuable experience added to my resumé?"

- 2.22 Cumulative GPA

- 2.83 Major GPA

- 3.08 Psych minor GPA

- Took me 7 years to complete my 4-year degree

- No internships, or relevant [to economics] job experience

- Have been working restaurant jobs for the past 5 years; mostly serving, but also started bartending a year ago

- Currently making about $20,000/year

- Was convicted of DWI earlier this year; license is suspended but due to be restored in about a month

- 25 years old, still living with parents


My short-term goal is to start making $30,000/year; by either picking up a 9-to-5 type job during the week (in the ballpark of $20,000 yearly) and bartending/serving on the weekends; or completely through the job change. Ideally the job would be economics related. Something in finance/consulting/analytics, etc... or something that would lead to such a career.

Under my circumstances listed above, what real options do I have? The sheer amount of time it took for me to finish will look terrible to potential employers. I will need to find a way to explain my DWI conviction. My GPA is awful, I have zero internship experience, and no real network I can exploit for job opportunities.

I think I'm in a hole of sorts, and I don't believe that things will be terrible forever, but I need to move rapidly out of this situation. What do you think, Reddit? What should my next steps be?"

[1-Why don't they make cartoons as good as they were in the 90s?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ii48l/iama_professional_animator_at_nickelodeon_ama/cugqdet?context=5)|That's been a question for a while. I'm not one to say...but I think there was a higher tolerance for weirder/crazier visual stuff back in the 90s, no one cared as much about putting offbeat ideas on TV. Now everyone plays it very safe. I, myself miss it. Ren and Stimpy, Rocko's Modern Life, etc... those cartoons went above and beyond weird at times and it was rad. 
[2-is there a place still for cartoons on TV or did YouTube/online take over?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ii48l/iama_professional_animator_at_nickelodeon_ama/cugqdet?context=5)|There is a place for it, but there is also a huge audience shifting to multiplatform stuff, like iPads, iPhones, etc. We're the binge-watching generation, so Netflix is obviously our go-to these days. I think there's room for MORE stuff, you just need to be willing to deliver it by the season, not the episode. I personally never watch cable anymore, it's just not as convenient to my schedule. As a kid, I'd always watch ""after school"" cartoons, so there really wasn't a place other than the TV that I could go to for that. No YouTube or Netflix... Now there's just so much more out there. More options. But cartoons aren't going anywhere. 
[Hey thanks for answering. I just wanted to know if they still drew cartoons by hand. Everything looks computer-ized today. Cartoons from the 80s and earlier had a very different look and feel to them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ii48l/iama_professional_animator_at_nickelodeon_ama/cuh1sfh?context=5)|There are new techniques to make stuff have that hand-drawn look. ToonBoom Harmony is being used by a lot of companies, and that allows for a lot of super advanced character rigging/puppet creation. Also, all of the storyboards are done completely by hand using cintiqs. 
[How'd ya get the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ii48l/iama_professional_animator_at_nickelodeon_ama/cuixgoo?context=5)|A friend who previously worked here called me up one day and asked if she could recommend me since Nick was looking for new hires. I said sure, not thinking I'd get an opportunity like that. I was going to intern for Disney in LA, and then Nickelodeon stole me.
[How long did it take to hone your skills?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ii48l/iama_professional_animator_at_nickelodeon_ama/cuixgoo?context=5)|It took an entire lifetime to learn how to draw. But technically speaking (software), it took a few years to learn all those skills too. I learned a lot of the software in school... also, I did a lot of studying/research on my own. At the end of the day, it's up to you how you spend your free time.
[Whats the work environment like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ii48l/iama_professional_animator_at_nickelodeon_ama/cuixgoo?context=5)|Work environment is super awesome. I have a cubicle, nice computer, double-monitor setup, wacom tablet... I also made a coffee cup art tower on my desk, plus all my amiibos are on my desk... lots of creativity going on here. I also work with really cool people. Literally the best people in the world. I'm very lucky to be here. :D *cries*
[What tech do you use professionally to animate, and what do you use on your own time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ii48l/iama_professional_animator_at_nickelodeon_ama/cuiy8kf?context=5)|Wacom Cintiq Companion (1st Gen)
[Are there any exercises you would recommend for an aspiring animator?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ii48l/iama_professional_animator_at_nickelodeon_ama/cuiy8kf?context=5)|Exercises = learn the principles of animation, draw a lot, use Maya, learn After Effects.
[What are some good things to put into a portfolio/ improve a portfolio?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ii48l/iama_professional_animator_at_nickelodeon_ama/cuiy8kf?context=5)|Good drawings, good keyframe poses, motion graphics show a lot of skills, show that you can do a little bit of everything.

Keep on being a boss ass bitch, you sly motherfucker!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ii48l/iama_professional_animator_at_nickelodeon_ama/cuiyqog?context=5)|YO, THAT IS THE BEST COMPLIMENT I THINK I HAVE EVER RECEIVED. I DIG THAT.

[YUUUP! Also, any resources or books n' shit to learn animation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ii48l/iama_professional_animator_at_nickelodeon_ama/cuizt32?context=5)|The Animator's Survival Kit, and Preston Blair books. 
[Im looking to become a animator and because im young im really worried about the future and if i could do it. Its my dream though can you give me any words of wisdom? I need all the advice i can get.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ii48l/iama_professional_animator_at_nickelodeon_ama/cui1wb7?context=5)|How old are you?
 |The above question doesn't really matter.
 |Don't worry about how long it takes to achieve a goal. The time will pass anyway.
 |Follow your dream, take small steps towards a big goal. Nothing happens overnight. Make it your life's mission. Literally nobody else could stop you once you have the mentality that you WILL do it.
 |Draw a lot of pictures and create a body of work. Start showing your work on instagram and tumblr - A lot of industry people have tumblr accounts where they showcase all their work. Follow your favorite artists, etc... Find ways to connect with people who are in the industry and do what you want to do. You'll be taken seriously if you have a portfolio as opposed to not having one. You could talk the talk, but you gotta walk the walk.

[Is it easier for you to create your own style of drawing or do you prefer to mimic the style of other animators? I myself find it extremely difficult to create original characters. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ii48l/iama_professional_animator_at_nickelodeon_ama/cuhb2l4?context=5)|As I was learning how to draw as a kid, I would naturally try to mimic the styles of the other artists, simply to LEARN and ADOPT techniques of the masters. I would learn things and see visually from their perspective. It helped me adopt the thinking process of a designer and cartoonist. As I got older, I found my own personal style that was a result of all the practice I got as a kid, combined with life drawing, combined with a crazy active imagination. Seriously, I always have a pen in my hand. In class, I would draw and get in trouble way too often. But it didn't matter, because it's my profession now :) TLDR - it's okay to study the styles of another artist for the purpose of learning, but don't straight-up copy theirs... use it to learn, and craft your own style over time.
[How does one get into animation in a company like Nickelodeon or cartoon network? I heard its all about what school you go to. I am 24 and its been my dream to be a story-border/ animator/ or concept designer. But i still have no clue how to dive into it. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ii48l/iama_professional_animator_at_nickelodeon_ama/cuhiyc7?context=5)|It's not about the school you go to, it's about the following things: -how dedicated you are to the craft... you need to stand out from those who aren't 100% dedicated. give it your all. -your skill level in software, hardware, etc... your drawing skill and/or 3D skill  -your personality, you gotta be able to get along with people.
 |Going to a good animation school helps, but it's up to you. You could go to the best school in the world and still never do the work... It matters HOW you handle the work and if you give it your all. If you're gonna dive, go head first. You can't half-ass this career path... Gotta go all the way! It became my life the minute I decided to go into it. I dream in keyframes.
 |Just be awesome!
[Haha awesome. Do you think age matters? I feel like i waited to long to jump into it. But it is my dream, and i do want to give it my all. Though sadly i was so traditional for so long, i feel like diving into digital media will take me a bit to get use to, maybe to long. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ii48l/iama_professional_animator_at_nickelodeon_ama/cuhj8sf?context=5)|You're 24? LOL.
 |You've got a shot. Get into it now, don't waste anymore time doing what you don't want to do. Age is just a number, bruh. And 24 is YOUNG. Don't worry about the amount of time it will take to accomplish something big. The time will pass anyway. Make the most of it. 
[Any advice on what to start with first ? As in what is 100% necessary to learn hardware wise and software wise? ( i know a lot of questions, but you got me feeling motivated again\)  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ii48l/iama_professional_animator_at_nickelodeon_ama/cuhjfau?context=5)|""Find what you love and let it kill you"" - What do you love most about the craft? Make that a part of who you are and you'll find motivation instantly.  Where to start? Learn After Effects. and learn to draw on a tablet - I recommend a Cintiq but that could get expensive. Intuos is a good starting point. Draw from life, too. 
[Thanks man :D I can break these desk jokey cuffs. Thanks for getting me pumped up and motivated to follow my dreams again.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ii48l/iama_professional_animator_at_nickelodeon_ama/cuhkniw?context=5)|If you're not following your goal, you won't be fully content... Gotta chase that dream. 
[Do you think flash animation is less valued/should be less valued than hand animation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ii48l/iama_professional_animator_at_nickelodeon_ama/cuh0kdh?context=5)|Flash is just a different craft. I know some good flash animators and some bad ones. It all depends on the skill level of the animator. Also, some people do hand-drawn animation IN flash... so they cross over often. I do think I know what you mean, though.. you're talking about motion-tween-based work versus hand-drawn... It all really just depends. A lot of people/clients don't understand animation or its challenges to begin with. Overall, I don't think we're valued as much as we should be in a professional sense. I'm lucky to work somewhere I do feel valued and appreciated for what I do.  
[What shows inspired you? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ii48l/iama_professional_animator_at_nickelodeon_ama/cugmsze?context=5)|I love Butch Hartman's shows. Great dude, I got a chance to meet him several times, but he never remembers my name xD.
 |So, Fairly OddParents and Danny Phantom really inspired me, both in style and writing. I love the character designs and easy-to-read staging. Additionally, I feel we could all find a way to relate to the main characters.
 |Also, huge Rocket Power fan and of course, Spongebob.  Outside Nickelodeon, I love BoJack Horseman, Adventure Time, and Regular Show. Everyone tells me to watch Rick and Morty too... I've gotta get on that!
[You should also check out gravity falls if you haven't already. it is absolutely amazing in every way. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ii48l/iama_professional_animator_at_nickelodeon_ama/cuj0my9?context=5)|Ha! I have seen. It's rather brilliant.

3il8mc,1,2015-08-27,"Coming into the PC, cluelesness at max level",ravnicrasol,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/3il8mc/coming_into_the_pc_cluelesness_at_max_level/,"Hello and good day/evening/night.

I've been somewhat interested in making my own PC for years now, my first game was the square-boob Lara Croft and loved it back in the day I played it on a laptop thicker than my thigh. 

Unfortunately I never got the opportunity to get a proper tower, and an unfortunate series of events had me VERY out of touch with the techie world for years afterwards. Now that I've got a decent paying job I wanted to properly enter this realm and switch out of my 6 year old laptop (not the original one where I played T-Raider in).

This is also a first for me using reddit, so... here goes:

Firstly, I'm looking for a gaming platform, though it has to be Windows since I also have to use some software from where I work that isn't compatible with any other OS (they're some custom tools that were created by an intern from our IT department and by the time management realized it was somehow restricted the guy didn't work with the company anymore and the bosses chose hiring a pro to fix it wasn't worth it).

In terms of image quality, I'd like to scream out ""Best image performance EVER!"", but I haven't got a clue on that point. Seriously, I'm worse than a trained monkey when it comes to this sort of thing, I've tried reading up on the subject and it turns out it was a wise decision not to go into computer engineering or my future would've been very bleak.

What I DO know is that I'd like the total price-tag not to be above the 3K € mark (this price would be for everything, including screens/mouse/tower/etc... except the table it'll be on).

I'm working from Spain (English is my second language), and I'd like to point out that (though I'll do my best to avoid it) there could be 30ºC+ temperatures (86ºF) with a top humidity of around 25% where I currently live in (sometimes the AC stops working and no one knows why). So maybe it should have good cooling? (again, I'm clueless here).

Before I go into the last bit of the required fields (and more into detail), I'd like to comment that I don't have any rush in building this. Right now I've got multiple things going on and I may even be moving within the next couple months (not sure yet, but it'll still be in Madrid/Spain, a bit closer to the city... maybe with a better AC). So in all likeliness I'm posting this WAY too soon but I just wanted to at least get a general idea of what I should start looking for and the sort of suppliers I should favor.

The details... here goes:

Firstly, being Spain, what I have available is a type C/E/F socket with 230V and 50Hz (Again, this information could be redundant, but I'm posting it just in case).

In theory I have 100Mb/s internet connection, but for practical purposes it might as well be 20Mb (we have our own version of Verizon/Comcast/Satan over here).

I've seen the http://pcpartpicker.com/guide/6Qyp99/enthusiast-gaming-build build and it looks to be on a good spot in my price-range, though I'm certain it'd be somewhat wasted on me. What sort of usage should I have? My gaming habits would be a little over an hour or two a day during the week and maybe 12-20 hours during the weekend, so...

I'm looking for a dual screen set-up, something along the lines of http://www.amazon.com/LG-Electronics-24GM77-24-Inch-LED-Lit/dp/B00P0EOX1S%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAICE7LOAJMK3SSLPA%26tag%3Dpcm_buyitnow-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00P0EOX1S each. Or would it be better to stick to a single screen that's overall better?

Lastly, I haven't stopped hearing that mechanical keyboards are the way to go, but with prices at the 100€+ I've been hesitant. Is it worth it on the long run? I may not have the time to be a fully fledged gamer, but I do have to write a LOT both at work and from home.

Well, that's about it, as I mentioned before, I'm as lost as an Eskimo in the desert, so I haven't got even a piece of a clue about this HUGE world of possibilities and any help would be highly appreciated to at least have a better sense as to what to look for.

Thanks in advance."
3ilspi,1,2015-08-27,Lack of projects is hurting my job search and motivation. Find a solution or give up? [Kinda long],startingtolive,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3ilspi/lack_of_projects_is_hurting_my_job_search_and/,"First off, apologies if this is not the right place. I'll remove if necessary.

The tl;dr version: CS student with no projects. Tried a couple, always end up getting overwhelmed. Recruiters are now visiting college, and personal projects are main topic in the interviews. Thus my chances are over before they even begin. Recruitment season stops by November. What do I do?

The long version: 

Right now, I feel like my interest in CompSci is fake, superficial. Most of my knowledge is high level stuff - I don't spend hours reading up articles, tinkering on my machine, or anything that I know other passionate people do. I do like coding, but any time I try to start a project, I get overwhelmed by the details and give up. 

I don't want a dead end job. I'm in India, and the Big Bad Consulting Companies are always ready to recruit disposable coders. I want a job which is stimulating and challenging. But at this point, it just seems like a wrong fantasy. If I can't even drum up the motivation to work on my own, any interview I do attend will be a waste anyway. There are 10x better people waiting in line, and it's a rejection process after all.

What should I do at this point? Should I just take a break from the recruitment process, get some projects done ( which is a wrong mindset to begin with) and then look for internships around the end of the year ? Or should I just give up and look for alternatives?"

I on the other hand have not. I went to community college for one year and dropped due to the uninteresting nature of my classes I slacked. 

That was about 5 years ago now. I worked my way through about 4 IT related positions and now I am working as a Programmer for a large Financial Core Software company building network monitoring applications, basically full stack type of work, and have for the past two years. I'd say I'm slightly more advanced then what most would be at this point in their career. As this is also my hobby, and pretty much my only one. When I get off work I'm working on a pet project or learning something new. (nothing to do in the midwest with my interests in technology)

I'm 25, looking to move out of the Midwest sometime in the next 1-2 years for a Dev type of position in either Denver or Bay Area. At this point I fell like my lack of formal education has not hindered me thus far in my career at all. 

I'm trying to build my GitHub to show my abilities to prove my worth to potential recruiters and job prospects, but really don't know where someone would stack up of having years of experience in the field and no schooling versus someone who's went to school and had maybe a internship?

Anyone ran into this or have thoughts?"
3in6ml,92,2015-08-27,I don't enjoy programming. Anyone else been in my shoes?,Pistolcrab,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3in6ml/i_dont_enjoy_programming_anyone_else_been_in_my/,"Hi all, thanks for reading. 

I'm 25 years old, finished my CS degree a year ago and got immediately rehired by the company I interned with as a student. It's a mid-sized office working on a mid-sized project of a large corporation. In total with my internship, I've worked here for almost 3 years. 

In that time I've slowly realized I don't enjoy coding. I have a lot of respect and envy for those of you who do, it takes a great mind to be able to be passionate about it. It's just not my thing. I overhear my coworkers talking about the latest development tools and products with excitement, and I usually just quietly listen, unable to find the same level of appreciation. Everyone I work with is very friendly, but I just don't connect to the same developer culture that they all share. 

I can code decently enough, not as well as most of my colleagues but enough that my managers are satisfied with my performance. But I'm starting to dread going to work because I find coding to be boring, difficult, and unsatisfying. Even if I try side projects that are not work related during my personal time for fun and to improve my skills, I find that I just get bored and the projects are abandoned at 25% completion.

I know I won't be happy with a programming career for the rest of my life.  I think we can all agree that this is a career you can't half-ass your way through. Due to personal reasons, I'll be relocating to a different city early next year and I think that will be a great time to switch jobs and try to find a better fit. 

So my question is: is there anyone here who also doesn't like programming but enjoys computers and found a great career with minimal programming and a CS degree? I do like computers and I do like working with people, programming just isn't for me. 

Thanks in advance for any advice!"

3iofme,1,2015-08-27,Should I leave or wait for a promotion?,FilipinoTGrigio,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3iofme/should_i_leave_or_wait_for_a_promotion/,"Throwaway because I don't want to out myself to my employer. 

Reddit, I need some advice. I'm four years out of college. The first three years were miserable, spent vacillating between unemployment and working badly paying temporary jobs with poor working conditions. 

I got lucky last year and found a GREAT job. It really is great. The money is great, the people (while a bit gossipy) are great, the work is interesting and the company is one of the best in the country. This job was literally the thing that saved me. I had nearly given up hope on everything when it came around. I credit this job for giving me a boost in self-confidence and saving my life BUT:

The position I accepted is not the level at which I am educated. It is a step below (it's a big step, the step between having no education and being degreed) but I convinced myself that this didn't bother me when I started because I was so desperate to have a job and this job, while low level, pays commensurate with my education and experience. Many of my friends from college who have positions working at our degreed level are making the same or less. My job is specialized and hard to find. Many more of my college friends had to leave the field after not being able to find work. 

The problem is that it *does* bother me to work at a lower level. It bothers me that other people in my office with my same education put their names on my work and get/take credit for it. It bothers me that I am as capable (or more capable in some aspects) as the people taking credit for my work. It bothers me because I try to imagine myself as someone who doesn't have an ego that needs petting, but apparently my ego is a desperate, attention-seeking, needy beast.  I feel bad because I know the market is shit and I'm lucky to have anything at all. 

Fast forward to three months ago: one of the people I work under (let's call him Mr. Pants) said he heard through he grapevine (see the gossip thing?) that I am going to be promoted. This promotion would mean finally working at the level I'm educated and experienced at. When I pressed him for details he said that it was ""in the works"" and should take place pretty soon. He didn't have many more details about the promotion, but seemed to know about other things in the company that did come to pass shortly after this conversation. A month later, my division director and I went to a conference and she said that ""our division and company will be undergoing some big changes soon"" and smiled. My heart leapt. I'm sure it's possible I'm reading those two separate interactions together and reading too much into it, but I can't help but to hope. This job would be perfect if I were working at my level. 

When I came back from the conference, Mr. Pants shared new information: he discovered that my promotion would not be effective until our company's interns graduate, so we can all begin at the same time. The interns were offered permanent positions shortly after my first conversation with Mr. Pants. Don't get me wrong: I love the interns (the ones I've met, this is a large company) and I'm happy they have found jobs. I was where they are not long ago and I know it is scary AF right now in the job market, but I'm terribly hurt. I'm hurt because I've been in this position for almost two years (longer than any of the interns) and I'm through with school and all of the requirements to work in our field. 

Now, it's been two months since anyone has mentioned anything at all. Several other changes are happening in our division and no one has said anything. I'm very disheartened and starting to feel like it won't happen (even if it does happen like Mr. Pants said, it would be a year or more away, as several of the interns are sophomores) and I'm thinking about leaving. I know it's crazy to think of leave a good paying job in this market, especially without having something else lined up, but I'm more heartbroken about not being approached and being delayed than I can adequately convey in words right now. The recognition means more than  the money. I know I'm a good worker and I get praised (and my colleagues get accolades when they use my work) but it doesn't seem like the promotion will ever come. Should I leave? I feel awful for even thinking about it knowing how bad people have it right now. I know I must sound ungrateful. I know so many people would give their eye teeth for a decent paying job right now, but I feel very unappreciated and overlooked. It's so frustrating to be so close and work so hard for something that seems to be a mirage, always moving farther off into the horizon. I thought I'd be working at my level by now. I've been here a long time.

Here are some additional factors: 

-I can't mention the promotion to my division director. Mr. Pants shared the information, which he gleaned from our HR director, in confidence.

-Even if the information was not confidential, my division director will be out of the country for the next several months (which is probably why I'm so sad, my dear Reddit friends - I'd hoped she might mention it before she left).

-Mr. Pants often stabs me in the back. He claims my work as his own A LOT (even once removing my name from a spreadsheet I'd worked on for months and turning it in after replacing his own and denied that I had worked on it, even when asked directly) and often divulges sensitive information about others. Mr. Pants also  makes sleazy comments to me sometimes, but he's a dork and I can handle him.

Please help. I feel like I'm too close to the situation to know what to do. 

**TL;DR: told I might be getting a promotion, but I will have to wait to begin until virtually everyone else at the company has been promoted first. **"

The money I had saved from my last major gig is running out and I can't seem to find anything. 
I'm starting to wonder if I should just go back to school or do I just tough it out for longer and keep looking?

My main reason for even leaving film school was to save myself from getting into such a large hole of debt and quite a plentiful of individuals have gotten film/video jobs without ever needing a degree of any sort and just using their sole experience as their selling point in getting hired.

3ipkf4,1,2015-08-28,TIFU by thinking an internship with a big company would be better than an internship with my University,Semajian,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3ipkf4/tifu_by_thinking_an_internship_with_a_big_company/,"So I've never posted a FU here, and over the last 9 weeks (in which I've been doing an internship) I've been lurking here almost constantly, trying to pass time.
So this actually happened when I agreed to do the internship, today is my last day.   
Last year my University gave me an internship, I could work from home, do the hours I wanted, and it was really quite chilled work. (Programming) It also paid very well.
This year I decided an internship with a large company would be better, get a name on my CV and a really great experience working in the real world.  
I was wrong.  
The company really wasn't prepared and although they have some ridiculous figures for how much they make, and a huge client, there's been absolutely nothing for me to do for the past 9 weeks. It's paid about the same as the University internship (Which I could've done another of this year) however it's 38 miles away, so I spend £50~ a week on petrol just to get here. I feel like the last 9 weeks of my summer have been completely wasted, I've managed to fund a holiday with the proceeds, but I wanted to be working, I wanted to be busy, and most of all I wanted an experiene to tell future potential employers about during interviews.  
I'm actually incredibly shocked by the lack of work I've been able to do, a lot of which stemming from security issues (again, big client).  
Today is my last day, and I'm mostly excited, the only thing slightly negative about leaving here, is how little i'll be able to browse this and several other subreddits from now.  

TL;DR Internship with a big company, wish I'd acted reluctantly."

I haven't been able to take any web programming courses yet because my degree has a lot of prereqs in mostly Java before you can open up all of the 300 level classes where the stuff I want to do is located. 

This particular internship I applied to seemed really bare bones: some experience with JS, CSS, HTML, and WordPress is a plus. I figured I'd apply to a few lower companies since I haven't really done much with web dev yet, and I got a response immediately (like, 9PM last night I applied and I got a response 8:30AM). 

All I've really done is mess with creating my own websites, recreate a few classic games on JS with a basic site to hold it, and helped a friend of mine who graduated a little on a quick drawing canvas application he's been working on. I'm afraid I might not know everything they'd like even though it seemed like I probably would.

So, in short, what do I expect from a company that wants an intern that just knows some JS, CSS, HTML, and WordPress? Do I have a reason to even be worried?

So I work as an college intern for a small-medium local government in the IT department. There are several building that are close together but there are also departments that you can only really reach by car. This is a rare story of users being awesome and thanking the fearless techs that fix their stuff.

Anyways, one morning $Boss comes over and tells us(Myself and $Other_Intern) that $User is having problems with their projector, and that they have an important presentation later that day and that they need it fixed. Upon inquiring who $User is and where they are located, I am informed that they head up a small department out in the boondocks. No problem, we could use a change of scenery. We gather up some tools and a spare projector and take the IT car out for a joyride. 

Upon arrival we are greeted by $User and led to a small conference room with their older projector. It turns out that we didn't have the proper cables to turn HDMI into VGA, so we give them the spare projector and advise them that there are many portable projectors(they do environmental stuff and need to be semi-mobile) that have digital inputs, and that its time to upgrade. They thank us for our time and after a small tour on the way to the door we head back to our office, satisfied with a job well done.

Well unbeknownst to us, shortly after we left, there was some sort of subliminal memo sent around the office that read something like,
&gt;""Hey did you know we have an IT department?!?!?!?!""

To which the answer was obviously  
&gt;""No""

Cue a flood of biblical proportions of support tickets hitting our servers with the all the power Neptune himself could muster(ok it was like six but that's a lot for one department around here). Over the span of a week and a half we made five trips out to their office. Each time we went over there they would always have some impromptu ""while you're here"" request to take a look at something to see if it was still good.

After the ticket storm subsides, $Other_Intern and I are sitting around doing intern stuff(organizing, updating inventory, strenuous manual labor, etc.) and $Boss comes in with a tin and a card.
&gt;$Boss:""This came for you guys from $User's department for fixing all their stuff.""

At this point $Other_Intern and I feel like Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield, having just found the briefcase. This particular briefcase was the kind that either contains sewing supplies or baked goods so it was really a tossup. $Other_Intern grabs the tin and, as he opens it, a golden light beams from within.
&gt;Me:""Are we happy?""  
&gt;$Other_Intern:""...""  
&gt;Me:""$Other_Intern! Are we happy?""  
&gt;$Other_Intern:""Yeah, we're happy.""

That day we feasted on *homemade* chocolate chip cookies as thanks for our efforts in battling the wrath of Neptune. That department has become our favorite department even if they do have quite a bit of work for us.

**TL;DR** Interns exist as the most efficient means of turning cookies into technical support.

This past summer I was in an internship position that required the use of my personal computer.  We traveled to a different city every day.  
My laptop stopped working and I found a computer repair place nearby. I was quoted $50-150 and about 3 weeks, since he had to order parts.  My employer paid him $50, as she felt bad that my laptop crapped out because I was using it so much to work for her. He gave me a loaner to use while he was fixing mine. 
This city is 2.5 hours away from where I live.  The agreement was that on my way home from our final destination, I would pass through this city and pick up my fixed laptop.  I had to leave my internship early, and handed the loaner laptop off to the girl who was taking my place.  She returned it to the repair guy.  
At that point, I emailed him and he told me it would take a few more weeks, and I was fine with that.  But, every time I contact him since then he says ""Sorry, been out of the office, I'll be working on it this week."" This continued on, and on.  He said he would mail it to me since it's been taking so long. Now it's been 3 months, and my emails and calls from last week, and the week before, have not been returned.  
I do not have time to spend a day driving to this city to show up at his office, if he'd even be there.  He non-response is unsettling.

Can I report my laptop as being stolen?  At most it's worth $150, but I hate giving up and basically just giving this guy $50 and my laptop, which has sentimental pictures on it that I don't have stored anywhere else."

I'm a fourth year computer science major at a UC. I've never had a part time job or an internship before and I've just recently been applying to part time jobs on campus (programming, it, tech support, retail) but so far, I've been rejected to all of them after having interviews . 

I'm currently working on a side project (android app) that I've started over the summer. I know C++ and Java but nowhere near the experience wanted in job descriptions. 

Basically, I'm really worried about finding a programming job post graduation. Seems if I can't even land part time jobs, how will I be able to land software development jobs? 

Can you guys please share your experience on this and if I should keep trying to find part time jobs for experience or just focus on school and side projects? What's the best course of action for me to take to increase my chances of landing a job, or even an interview, after graduation? 

Thanks."

On the outside it looks like I am an excellent candidate, however the truth is that I did badly at all of these jobs. I paid one of those professional reference checking firms to call all 4 managers at my previous jobs, and not a single one of them had anything positive to say about me. All of their feedback was terrible. I think this is because of the halo effect (I am an African American).

I'm curious if new grad jobs out of college will ask for references. If they do I'm probably screwed. I mean sure I could give professor references but it would be pretty suspicious to use a professor reference considering I have four internships and won't give any references from my bosses, wouldn't it?"

3itrrt,1,2015-08-29,I constantly self-sabotage. I'm aware of it but I don't know how to change my mindset.,3arfbound,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3itrrt/i_constantly_selfsabotage_im_aware_of_it_but_i/,"I self-sabotage in so many aspects of my life, to the point that I feel like it's really inhibiting my happiness. I've read a few articles about how to help, but all the advice seems very abstract to me... I don't know how I'm able to be self-aware of it and still be unable to do anything to get rid of my self-sabotaging behavior! It's a mix of procrastination, anxiety, and just pure carelessness.

Some of the strange behavior I do:

* If I have a crush, I'll try my best to appear ""normal"", even cold and indifferent to my crush to hide my attraction, so most guys probably don't even think I'm interested. I'll still try to spend time with this person, but I'll act super nonchalant about it and make it hard for them to get the hint, just because I don't want to feel vulnerable if they reject me if I *do* show interest.

* If I have an exam or something coming up, I'll procrastinate to the point where my grades suffer. This has actually caused me to fail a class, meaning I have to stay an extra quarter at school in order to graduate. I have absolutely no motivation, and I often choose to go out with friends or just watch videos on YouTube to escape responsibilities.

* I'm so overly concerned with what everyone else is doing that I don't want to miss any social event or hangout for fear of missing out. This has made it really hard for me to focus on important things, like my career and schoolwork. I prioritize my social life over everything even though it's proven to be detrimental to most other aspects of my life. I'm so behind career-wise because I haven't focused on applying to internships or learning skills relevant to my future career, at all. 

I don't know what it is, but I've had a pretty lonely and shitty life before a year ago: I had barely any friends, didn't have any productive hobbies, stayed at home and played video games a lot, didn't really care about school. Now that I've changed socially and actually made friends, I'm feeling like I have to catch up to everything I've missed. 

I hate that I know what's wrong with my behavior but I don't know how to change my mindset to get rid of this stupid problem! At heart, I think I'm insecure, but my life has been better than ever and I feel finally mostly comfortable with who am I, so I feel like that should have gone away once I made improvements to my social life.

One more note: I've worked before, and when I had a full-time position during summers (just as an office assistant, not an internship), I was able to get my shit together and do a really good job, but when it's left to myself and I have no guidance, I just don't care enough to make changes until I'm literally forced too (no self-discipline, basically).

Does anyone have any advice on how they personally changed for the better? What are some things I can do to get rid of my terrible habits? I feel like a failure lately, and it's literally all my fault. 

Thank you to anyone who's read my lengthy post, it really means a lot to me."

3ixjk5,1,2015-08-30,How to go about negotiating?,exogreek,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3ixjk5/how_to_go_about_negotiating/,"I interned for the company in question for about 4 months and it was a great success. I worked hard, impressed the right people, and naturally towards the end of the internship, they expressed interested in hiring me on as a field technician (IT). They hired me on at $17 an hour with a max of 30 hours a week. (It turns out that they confused my school schedule and thats why they didn't offer my a salaried position right away, ill get into that) I originally wanted more, because I had a year of applicable experience before I started my internship and based on the market research I did, my starting earnings should be somewhere between 40-43k per year. I felt kind of pressured to accept the job right away, and I ended up accepting the 17$ offer. But, as mentioned before, I worked out the miscommunication about my school schedule and they made me a salaried offer of 35k/yr starting with decent benefits and with reviews about my compensation every 6 months/etc. I am looking for at least 38500, but would love 40k, as the job I am going to be doing and have been doing can be pretty stressful and taxing (IT Consulting) as well as the median pay for 1 years experience being about 42k (they apparently pay low, but its getting better). I am only 21 and this is all so new to me. I am going to have a quick meet with the VP of technical services to discuss this on Monday before my official full time orientation on Tuesday, Are there any things they are going to expect from me when I negotiate wage? Why I deserve it? Proof of other projections?/etc. I have not graduated yet, but I will be graduating soon, and I would be a great asset to their team. All opinions are appreciated.

3iy2ec,7,2015-08-30,How do I choose between these two internships?,BryceKKelly,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/3iy2ec/how_do_i_choose_between_these_two_internships/,"So, context: I'm an Australian computer/software engineering student, 3rd year (of 4) and I've received two offers, both from banks, one regular and the other is an investment bank. I keep going back and forth, so I guess I just want to hear what you guys think is truly important in selecting an internship.

* One appeared to be a decent amount more selective than the other. I know they hire less interns, they had a more rigorous online and interview process, and people who I know made it to final round/got accepted into the other firm did not even make it past online assessment for this one. Is this an indicator of anything? I feel like there's no smoke without fire, but maybe they just have less work available and can afford to be that picky?

* One pays more. Money isn't really my primary goal, but I've read that what you're worth to employers is measured more by your salary than what you actually know. Considering it's not unlikely I move to a grad position with whoever I choose, am I starting myself on a lower rung by choosing a lower salary? (The difference is fairly big, like 35% more at the higher paying company)

* One is bigger globally, but the other is larger within my own country. I don't particularly know where geographically I want to be in the future, but the freedom is worth something I guess.

* One seems to have a much better environment to work in. The training I can tell is more thorough, the teams are closer, and they appear to just be generally more technologically advanced. Not by a huge margin, but it's there. 

* One seems to have a really heavy focus on keeping you around indefinitely if possible. Steady advancement and good money make it tempting, but I feel like I'm too young and ambitious for that. Then again, I'm a clueless student still so what do I know about where I want to be in the future?

So, those are just random elements that bear considering. I'm fully aware that I'm probably making too big a deal out of things, but it just feels super important to me since this will be my only internship during university, and likely what I'll be doing directly after university as well. I don't have much of a goal for what I want to do as a software engineer, all I know is I want to keep learning and becoming more valuable and never stop until I retire, regardless of where. That probably means I can't be in banking forever (maybe I can?), so I guess I'm looking for which internship is going to make me the most appealing candidate possible, both in terms of prestige and also tangible skills that I'll have.

I guess the big conflict here is money/selectiveness vs a more advanced type of business. Maybe the lower paying job is that way because it knows the true value isn't meant to be the money I earn there? Would other companies know that, or would they just see relatively low pay and assume I'm not that valuable?

I know this is a personal decision I have to make myself, and I'm not asking you guys to pick for me, but I'd definitely appreciate opinions on how much each of those factors matters, to you guys."
3iyelf,10,2015-08-30,"Bootstrapping myself, foot in the door. Pushing for turning a volunteership/internship to a paid position",chunkythrowsit,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3iyelf/bootstrapping_myself_foot_in_the_door_pushing_for/,"Hey y'all, I've seen this sub offer some tremendous advice in the past. I'm hoping someone with similar experiences can lend some insight. 

I am a former Ph.D. student in the social sciences that decided to leave with an MA after years of field work, teaching, and pursuing the dismal prospect of post-graduate employment. My training is versatile and valuable in the market though generally not recognized as such (don't be an anthropologist kids). I am bilingual and qualified for a number of positions that for one reason or another are less than forthcoming. 

While I have been fortunate enough to be employed since leaving this program in 2012, the work itself is less than fulfilling and does not utilize the kinds of skills that I have developed over all of those years of schooling. It is a seasonal occupation where I get a lot of free time during the winter months, but am on unemployment due to lack of work. This happens every year and makes saving really difficult as more often than not, it simply doesn't pay to get a job during the off-season. Where I live unemployment does not cover the entirety of living expenses, and so I draw down any money that I may have saved during the 9 productive months of my year. 

Last October, I decided to change directions and went to a local historic preservation organization with a copy of a CV and a stiff upper lip. I ultimately persuaded them to offer an unpaid internship for a very, very substantial project. This was acceptable as, at the time, I had no direct experience in the work, save for having demonstrated that I am a competent researcher in the social sciences and history. 

Despite a lack of experience in preservation, I have learned enough to satisfy the needs of the project and am presently working toward its conclusion. From last October through March, I put in about 40-50 hours a week working on this project and getting myself up to speed technically to become competent with little guidance. The organization is aware of my time investment and I have received across the board approval from my direct superior and the executive director of the organization.  Once March/April rolled around again, I had to put the project on hiatus as I needed to return to my ""real"" job, or rather, the one that actually pays me. 

There is quite a bit of work left to do, and autumn is approaching. By my estimate, I require an additional 4-5 months to get the job done. Simply put, I am not in a position to put in another full-time plus set of months for work that I am evidently qualified to do, but not receive pay. Moreover, I would like for this to turn into a permanent position that I might use to get a better job in this field in the coming years. 

My ultimate goal is to move from where I live and get a job working as a researcher, grant writer, or applications manager for national historic register applications elsewhere in the US. I am not an engineer or architect, though do have a tremendous amount of experience in construction management from my tenure at my ""real"" job. 

I write because I intend to call the organization and ask for a meeting with the exec. director and/or preservation director and present my case for employment as my schedule will soon afford me the time to get back to the original project. However, I am at a distinct disadvantage because I don't want to beg for a job and undercut my leverage. At the same time, because the project is very substantial and as yet unfinished, I don't want to appear as though I am trying to strong arm the organization into giving me a job or sacrifice the project. 

The final caveat is that I would like to at least use this as a reference for getting a job in this field, while also being able to say that I completed the task at hand. 

The organization itself is pretty well endowed and I don't want to be unreasonable with my demands. By the same token, I'd really like to garner a living wage+ as I think I've demonstrated that I am more than capable in the position. 

Has anyone been in a similar position and has successfully been able to turn internship to employment without having been first offered a job? 


**TL;DR: Former Ph.d candidate in a related field volunteering his way to employment finally needs to shit or get off the pot. If a paid position isn't forthcoming doesn't want to sacrifice a lot work on the project or burn bridges. Need advice on how to tactfully lobby for employment with out coming off as simply trying to leverage an incomplete project.** 

I can answer any questions you all may have if I've been vague about anything. Thanks for taking the time.

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**

Yes

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

I'm primarily building this to use for machine learning applications, specifically training neural networks. I'm an undergraduate and I'm looking to push hard to get into graduate school and eventually a career doing research. I have an internship now where I am getting to do this kind of work and I'm absolutely in love with it. I want something that is going to be able to do relevant work now while I don't really have access to computing resources outside of what I own. I want to have a computer I can experiment and learn with and that can be upgraded gracefully into the future. I'm hoping the base of this computer will last for the next 5-6 years. I'm going to be running linux and would like to be able to run several virtual machines at once, as well as being able to have the VMs access the GPU. Being able to play games with the rig is a nice bonus, I'm excited to be able to play at ultra settings when I get time to :)

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

My initial budget was around ~$2500 before monitors and I'm really pushing the edges now of what I'm willing to spend. There were a few things I didn't want to compromise on like the Titan X GPU and X99 chipset that are really driving the price much higher. I have a hard limit of $3200 without the monitor for the build, but would like to spend less than that. I still want the performance from the build, be well set up for future extension and have the investments in cooling to keep everything in good condition.

**What performance are you looking to get?***

I do want to be able to train rather large neural nets with the GPU, so the 12 GB of memory on the Titan as opposed to the 6 on the 980ti is a huge plus. I also want to be able to do a lot of data scraping, cleaning, processing, and piping around through all the hardware, which is why I am wanting to use the X99 motherboard with the 5820k i7. I feel like I can really take advantage of all the extra processing power from the hex core and the extra RAM. I'll be pretty happy with whatever performance on games I get out of the rig, so I'm not worried there.

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

USA

I want to extend this set up in ~1.5 years by doubling the RAM, adding another SSD for data sets, and adding another Titan. I'm also planning on overclocking the CPU and might consider overclocking the cards themselves after the upgrade. I'm not sure if I should consider a beefier power supply in that case. I would also ideally like to be able to water cool the Titan(s) because I will be putting a lot of continual stress on the cards and want to keep it in good condition for a long time to come. I was considering the hybrid card but it is currently $400 more. I haven't looked at a do it yourself water cooling system for cpu/gpu but that might be the way to go with what I want to eventually extend to. I also haven't priced that out and know next to nothing about it. This is my first build on my own and that seems pretty intimidating and dangerous. I'm thinking that I might air cool the card for now, but am looking at what I should do later.

3j0jha,2,2015-08-30,poor phrasing of interview questions? Has anyone else encountered this?,Thounumber1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3j0jha/poor_phrasing_of_interview_questions_has_anyone/,"I was reading this thread on the ycombinator forums here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3634078

The second poster says he was asked the following question: ""Given a binary tree, tell me if it is a binary tree"". This question seems poorly phrased because essentially you are asking ""Given A, tell me if it is A"". As written in the post, the interviewee said this confused him, to which the interviewer replied ""do you even know what a binary tree is?"" and after the interviewee said ""yes"", the interviewer re-phrased the question as ""given a binary tree, tell me if it is a binary search tree"".

Why didnt the interviewer phrase it like that in the first place? To expect that the interviewee extract this from his poorly phrased question seems unfair, and then asking him if ""he even knows what a binary search tree is"" is just going to make him very nervous and make him feel as if he did something wrong, when in reality the interviewer poorly phrased the question. The second phrasing changes the question quite a bit IMO. Has anyone ever encountered this in an interview? 

I am writing this because I have my google intern interview in a few weeks and I don't want some interviewer who phrases the question in a crappy way and then penalizes me as if it is my fault I didn't understand it (which is what appears to have happened to the poster in that forum), because I actually do know how to solve that question. Granted, this poster wasn't able to solve the question, but the way that interview was conducted still worries me. Anyone else encounter this?"

3j1voq,8,2015-08-31,"(California) Apartment Complex Moved Possessions Out of Apartment Without Notifying me, Possessions get Stolen",pomplemus,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3j1voq/california_apartment_complex_moved_possessions/,"I’m in the process of moving from one apartment complex to another without being there. I’m currently doing an internship in a distant location, so to simplify things for me my new housemates (I know them all well, trustworthy guys) offered to move my leftover stuff between apartments for me on their own. Not too much stuff, but moderately valuable, including a desktop computer, Yamaha keyboard, my bed, and a hobby class RC truck. The complication was that my move in date to the new place was a few days after my move out date from the old place, leaving my stuff in limbo for a time. I petitioned the old complex, and they moved my move out date back a few days to make it easier for me. The new dates:

Move in date to new apartment: August 30th at 8pm
Move out date from old apartment: August 31st at 8am

So everything looks good right? When my housemates went to the old place this evening (August 30th, 8pm) they noticed that the front door lock was already changed. They went around back, and the lock was still old. My stuff was nowhere in the apartment, and all the carpets were changed out. They found all my stuff in the parking lot, out in the open and unguarded for who knows how long. I asked them to make a quick check for some of my stuff, and I’ve already confirmed that at least my desktop computer and ~$1000 hobby class RC truck are missing, with probably more gone. They are taking pictures and sending them to me, so I can confirm just how much has disappeared. 
I only had an oral agreement over the phone about my new move out date, but I know who it is and hopefully he doesn’t change his story when I call them tomorrow morning. The biggest fact is that they moved out my stuff without permission and WITHOUT contacting me. In addition it occurred before the agreed move out date. I want for them to AT LEAST reimburse me for what I’ve lost, do I have a case here? We have strong renter’s laws in California, I found this information:

http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/legal_guides/lt-4.shtml

http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=civ&amp;group=01001-02000&amp;file=1980-1991

Section 1983 b.

One potential complication is that the new complex I’m moving into is managed by the same company as the old one, and I’ve already signed a year long lease with nowhere else to live.

TL;DR: Apartment management moved my possessions out of my apartment into a parking lot before the orally agreed upon move out date, without permission and without contacting me. My possessions get stolen.

Do I have a case here, and how do I proceed? Ideally, I would like a settlement to at least cover what I confirm missing. I’ll update with their response when I call them tomorrow.



UPDATE: I called the management today, and they cheerfully admitted that they moved out my stuff on their own, but they stored the items that they deemed of value. So my HTPC, keyboard, and speakers are fine. The problem is the stuff they DIDN'T think were of value that actually are, which they left out in the open and were taken. At the very least, my $1000+ RC truck was taken, along with some other stuff that I'm sure I will confirm soon. I called the owner of the complex, and she brought up renters insurance, which is irrelevant since they broke CA law. The owner claims my lease was extended only to the 30th, not the 31st, but I'm 100% sure the guy on the phone told me the 31st. I repeated it back to him 3 times in the presence of another person who agrees it was the 31st. So either the owner messed up, or the guy who told me messed up. Either way it doesn't matter, since they still threw out my stuff without permission or even any attempt at contact me, thus breaking the law. The owner seemed sympathetic, and said If I can prove the value and ownership (receipts) of the items lost she'll see what she can do. My RC truck is the only thing I have partial receipts of, and even just those add up to over $1000. My fear is that if they do reimburse me, they will only give me small percentage of the value since they assume the value went down. This isn't the case with RC stuff, they retain around 90% of their value for a long time. Hopefully I'll know more when she contacts me again and my housemates confirm everything that was stolen.

However, the hiring manager says that I would need to teach myself C# and take a written test before formally interviewing (I haven't coded in 3 years and only have experience in Matlab and Java).

1) What should I do? Is it worth teaching myself C# and dedicating most of my time to this for a possible internship in the IT world? 

2) Will learning C# help me in the future in the MIS world or is it just relevant to the IT world?

3) My uncle said C# is mostly for big companies and not startups. Is C# a good language to learn first?

I’m discovering that I am not cut out for the 8-5 office drone life. I haven’t been doing it for very long, but it’s already killing me. I don’t want to spend my life waiting for the weekend – I want to actually enjoy my work. Please help me!

I’m 23, graduated last year with a B.S. in Psychology, and changed my mind about grad school. Looking at 7 more years of intensive schooling, possibly having to move, and facing a saturated market with little stability is what influenced this decision. 

My background is non-profits: Two years of volunteer work with sexual assault victims, and my current job is working with HUD and low-income senior living. I was also a teaching intern, research assistant, desk assistant (at the dorms), and server in college. I have no desire to make a career out of non-profit work, but it took a year of job searching to get this position. 

I want a job that offers some autonomy, is flexible, and doesn’t have me chained to a desk all day. Maybe with an option to telecommute sometimes. I work well with people and have great writing skills. Here are the options I’ve been considering, all of which require school:

Real Estate: My hobby is looking at house listings in my area, looking at the market value, the features, and location. For whatever reason, it relaxes me. From what I understand, being a real estate agent is a lot of driving, which I don’t mind, working with clients to get what they want, and some paperwork. This comes with a more flexible schedule (I’m hoping) and offers incentive for me to work hard (i.e. commission, genuine interest in the field, etc.)

Teaching: Running my own classroom, making lesson plans, and having summers off is very tempting. The trade-off is that I live in Texas, which is currently devaluing education and placing standardized testing on a pedestal. So, there are less jobs (though I could probably do inner-city) and a de-emphasis on actual learning for more emphasis on studying to a test. 

Finally, I could go back to school for a Counseling Psychology PhD, but if there was a career option that would make me just as happy without several years of schooling, that’s what I’d prefer.

Are there any options that I might not have considered? Any opinions/feedback is greatly appreciated.

3j4ae9,198,2015-08-31,How I Landed My Dream Job in San Francisco as a Canadian New Grad,Sonx,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3j4ae9/how_i_landed_my_dream_job_in_san_francisco_as_a/,"I am a new graduate from the east coast of Canada working my first (and dream job) in San Francisco, California. Two years ago, I made it my absolute goal to follow my dream to move, live, and work in San Francisco as a Software Engineer. It feels amazing to say after a ton of hard work, I was able to do it. I thought I would share my story and hopefully inspire those who are trying to out their dreams.

#Quick Background
I graduated May 2015 with a Bachelor’s of Computer Science and a 3.3 GPA. I worked three co-op jobs (internships) in pursuit of my degree; two as a Systems Administrator and one as a Web Developer at a Canadian IT Company – all in my home town.

#Developing My Dream
When I found out that I was going to be working as a Web Developer for my third co-op work term, I was so excited. I worked my first two work terms as a Systems Administrator which didn’t include any coding so I wanted to work my final work term as a developer with a company I could work for when I graduated.
As time passed, my excitement faded. By the end of my third work term as a Web Developer – I was miserable. I loved coding and was so excited to start the job but by the end of the work term, the daily grind got to me. I developed and performed the same mindless routine every single day for 4 months. I lived, went to school, and worked in my hometown my whole life which made everything feel even more repetitive. I thought to myself that this would be my life for the next 30 years until I retired. Any excitement I had about life faded and I couldn’t see anything in my future I was excited for; I felt dead inside. I returned to school for my final year with the mindset that when I graduate, I was going to work a mindless job and go through the motions of life until I died.

A few months into fourth year, my mindset changed. I met a guy who created an app with over 50,000 users in one of my classes. He mentioned to me how he was going to do a work term in San Francisco. We started chatting about the tech industry, opportunities, culture, weather, and everything else that makes the bay area such a desirable place to live - I was legitimately excited for him. He sparked an idea in my head that I never thought was possible, could I possibly find a job in California and move there graduated? I always thought of myself as an average computer science student and never thought of doing something as big as moving across the continent to another country. Just the idea of relocating all the way from from the east coast of Canada to California was the first time I felt excitement in a very long time.

**I remember hearing a quote at the time which stuck with me:**

&gt; “You only live once and you have all eternity to be dead. Why not live doing something that you like, even if you never make it, at least trying to achieve something that you like, versus doing something you don’t like and just going through the comfort zone of society.”

From that point on I set out to make that thought a reality. It became my dream and I made it my absolute goal to move to San Francisco when I graduated to experience life, and something new, in a city far from home.

#The Process
The process started well before I started to apply to jobs. I decided to teach myself new programming languages and technologies to put on my resume and make myself more marketable as a new graduate. My interest lied in developing web applications so I shifted my learning and focus towards that. In my spare time, I taught myself JavaScript and dedicated my whole summer to making an app which now has over 1000 users. I returned to school in September for my final semester and I continued to fill my GitHub with side projects including languages/technologies that I never learned in school or used before such as Scala, Ruby, JavaScript, JQuery, AngularJS, Bootstrap, Sass, LESS, Ruby on Rails, etc.


By January, I officially completed my degree requirements and was set to graduate in May. During this time I shifted my focus from side projects to studying algorithms, practicing interview questions, and applying to jobs. Applying to jobs became a full time job. I spent 6-8 hours a day applying to job postings, writing cover letters, replying to emails, and studying for interviews. I decided to keep a spreadsheet (which I linked at the bottom of this post) of every job I applied to. I used the spreadsheet to keep track of all the places I applied to and used it as motivation and record book.


The first interview I had was with Google. The week leading up to the interview I didn’t leave my house. I studied Cracking the Coding Interview for over a week straight doing practicing problems and algorithms all in preparation for that single interview. When it came time for the interview, I cracked under the pressure. It was a coding phone interview and I didn’t code a sufficient algorithm in time (looking back now, after all my studying, I feel I could pass).


I continued to apply to jobs through company websites, LinkedIn, Stack OverFlow, Indeed, and everything else in between. I even made a Hired.com profile, passed their coding test, but they wouldn’t accept my profile because I didn’t have sufficient work experience. I eventually started using Hacker News for job postings which lead to great responses. Through Hacker News I was usually able to email an engineer or hiring manager directly which got me a lot personalized responses. In total, from January – June (6 months), I applied to 305 positions and interviewed at 21 companies, all in California.


A lot of companies (especially startups) have their own unique interview process and if I were to go into detail about all of them, this post would be a thousand times longer than it already is. By the end of everything, I received two offers from two different companies, both in San Francisco. Both my offers came in around the same time and were from funded startups. My first offer was bad. I was so excited to finally receive an offer but I knew I was going to have to reject it which gave me a ton of anxiety. I had what I was working so hard for right in front of me but I knew I couldn’t accept it and I wasn’t sure if I was going to get another (or better) opportunity. 10 days later I received another offer. My second offer was much better and was everything I was hoping for in an offer. I negotiated a bit, thought about it for a day, and then accepted it. At that moment, a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders. I set out to do something I wasn’t even sure was possible and I did it. All the doubts in my head were erased in that instance and I felt a sense of accomplishment that I have never felt before; it was pure bliss and I couldn’t be happier.


That is my story. I truly believe that you can accomplish anything in life as long as you have drive and a strong work ethic. It feels very surreal to accomplish something you originally never thought was possible. My advice to anyone trying to follow their dreams or move from their current situation: dream big, work hard, be ambitious, and no matter the circumstances, never quit.

I took the time to look around for any posts similar to my situation, but the closest I found was no degree vs a Bachelor's.

So basically, I'm going to a local technical college for an Associates in Science right now, in Software Development. My question is, will I have trouble finding work in development after I graduate? I have to do an internship to graduate, and hopefully I can find more than that. Salary isn't my number one priority.

I know it all comes down to the area you're finding jobs in, but I suppose I'd be willing to leave state for a great job offer. Right now I'm in Wisconsin, in Milwaukee county.

The majority of the credits of the A.S. won't transfer to the local 4 year school, despite being mainly the same courses (like Data Structures, etc.). Only the general education courses will, which is a handful of classes.

They would however fully transfer for a Bachelor's in Information Science and Technology, however I don't think companies who want a B.S. in Computer Science for example, would really care about it.

Under my current circumstances, I can't go to school full time, so if I went for a B.S. it would take at least 5 years, if not more. It will take me at least 3 years to get an A.S.

Or should I drop out right now and transfer to the local four year school and get a B.S. in Computer Science? I hear how some companies require a B.S., and will auto drop your resume if you don't have one. Is this a very common thing?

I'm just worried that most, if not all companies in the future may require a B.S. to work for them.

Finally, do I need to learn Calculus? Or is it just recommended? 

Thanks for any help!

For those interested, here are the two degree programs I am looking at:

3j5f61,2,2015-08-31,I think I'm about to get kicked out of Uni,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/3j5f61/i_think_im_about_to_get_kicked_out_of_uni/,"I think I’m about to get kicked out of University. I failed first year as I didn’t submit work, had to do retakes over the summer last year and failed to submit the work then. I was made an external student and had retakes to do again, didn’t submit them then and was given one final chance this summer to complete them. I have been sitting in front of my laptop for 3 weeks trying everything I can to complete these essays. I have lost all motivation. The deadline is tomorrow, I have already been given an extension.


I failed doing my a levels twice, tried to start a photography course and dropped out before I finally took an access course to go to university and passed by the skin of my teeth.


I cannot do this anymore. I don’t want to be a failure anymore. 


All my closest friends from home have graduated and are extremely successful, I don’t think I can deal with moving back home and watching them all succeed whilst I fail again.


I have kept myself going for so long, the only reason I passed my access course was because I felt like there was nothing out there for me, I considered suicide if I didn’t pass. I have lost so much confidence in myself.


I am currently in counselling, but all it seems to be doing is making me hate myself and my actions more. 


I tried everything before I did the access course to go to uni, applying for apprenticeships and internships as an alternative. I would get interviews and get told I didn’t have enough experience. I felt hopeless without a degree. So I decided to push myself and go to university. Now there is a chance I could get kicked out I feel like I’m back to square one, and the job market is even worse.


I don’t want to have to say goodbye to all my friends at uni. I don’t want to have to go up there and have to take all my stuff out my uni house and bring it home. 


I have been a failure so many times, I can’t deal with doing this again.
