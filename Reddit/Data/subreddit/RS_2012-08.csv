xj839,2,2012-08-01,CS/Game Dev Questions for those in the industry,SouthernArrowwood,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/xj839/csgame_dev_questions_for_those_in_the_industry/,"Guten Tag! Ich heisse Herr Eller. Ich weiss Deutsch nicht gute. Aber, ich womme mehr wiess Deutsch sehr viel!.
(Sorry if I butchered that horribly! Tried to do it from memory.)

Don't worry, this isn't a misplaced post trying to practice German! I wanted to ask a few questions to those currently working in a CS field in Germany, especially those working in the video game industry. Before asking, I'll give some of my background. I went to DigiPen Institute of Technology for 3 years, but couldn't afford to finish. Before DigiPen I worked as an IT/IT Intern for 3 years. I'm currently working as a game tester and doing indie work on the side to work my way up to a development position. I have a love for, and am really considering specializing in graphics and/or AI programming.

* How likely/difficult is it for an American immigrant without a degree but work experience to get into the industry in Germany?
* Would I be able to find a position where I won't need to be fluent in German, but can work on becoming fluent at the same time?
* I'm certainly not looking to make bank, and am far more concerned with doing what I love. Will the pay for such a position in Germany allow me to have my basic needs and a little extra spending money
* Would it be better/easier to become a student in Germany and then pursue the industry?

I'm looking at a few different countries as possibilities to immigrate to (Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark), but Germany is definitely at the top of my list due to my heritage.

Danke schone!"
xiw8c,0,2012-08-01,Is anyone else experiencing hostility in the workplace today due to it being Chik Fil A support day?  I'd love to hear some stories so I don't feel quite as dejected.,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xiw8c/is_anyone_else_experiencing_hostility_in_the/,"First off, I'm typing this from my phone as I'm still at work, so please excuse any spelling errors that are almost certain to be in this post.

Alright, so I was fortunate enough to get my foot in the door of a company this summer as an intern, despite only having finished my first year of univeristy.  This happened because my dad works here in a higher level position and was able to request that I be given an interview.  Luckily, I did well in the interview and here I am working my first real people job.  Anyways, I'm a gay (for the most part, we will get to that in a minute) female who is out to essentially everyone but my family.  I didn't find it necessary for people I work with to know this because of both my dads position here and the fact that I've been recently seeing a boy for the first time in my life.  Literally, out of the considerable people I've been with, he is the only one with a penis. So I know I will have to come out some time, but im not ready yet.  

A man who works near me today decided to talk about the Chik Fil A situation and how much he supports their idea of defending tradition marriage.  Now he obviously has no idea of my sexual leanings and was being incredibly offensive.  He was giving the 'why can't I marry my dog then?' argument and just being generally incredibly ignorant.  My coworker ended up stepping in and shutting him down and while offended, the situation was dropped and I was grateful. I ended up telling that coworker about my homoness, thanking him for stepping in the way he did.

Anyways, cue about fifteen minutes ago and a few people are back in our area of the office discussing their support for Chik Fil A, how long the line was and how great it was that people were supporting them and their right to be bigots.

It may not seem like a big deal but I just want to be able to scream the fact that I like women and get them to all stop talking, but I can't.  I'm afraid they'll treat me differently and shun me more than my parents finding out at this point .   Despite the fact that I live in Texas, everyone I've ever been out to, and that is most people that I've ever met, have been incredibly respectful even if they have differing viewpoints.   I've now seen first hand how people think that granting gay people rights is taking away from theirs, and its sickening me.  Im now questioning whether or not people who were nice to me actually liked me or thought I was a piece of trash that deserved no rights.

/rant.  There is more to say but I hate typing up so much on my phone.

Anyways, Reddit, I want to hear your stories.  Have you seen any intense or heated discussion over this recent controversy where you work?  Have people you know been really vocal about their support of Chik Fil A in unwarranted/inappropriate settings?  Honestly I tried not to pay any attention to it, but people who it has NO effect on can't stop talking about it!

**TL;DR:  I like scissoring. No one at work knows.  People suck a lot and hate the gays.  Anything similar happen to you at work?**"
xilc3,3,2012-08-01,Should CS Student take an IT Position?,Malluce,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xilc3/should_cs_student_take_an_it_position/,"I am a graduating CS student that goes to a top 20 Engineering school in the U.S. This summer I got an internship at Boeing IT and they are willing to give me a full-time offer after I graduate. My question is: Should I take the offer or should I look for something better? I am seeking a product manager position that can be on both technical and management side. I know I can also apply for a software developer position but since this is my future career I'd really want to go with something I like to do. My current position is a project manager (i.e., only doing management with minimum technical stuff involved) and I don't quite enjoy it. I mean, it's an interesting experience with good salary....but I miss coding (or designing software)! Also, I've heard stories saying that once you got into a non-software company, the chance of switching to a software company in the future is a lot harder. I am not too sure if this is true but I can see why it's hard to go from an IT company to a REAL software company (e.g., the ones in Silicon Valley).

I know I still have time to decide but I really need some suggestions at this point. Any suggestion is appreciated. Thanks! :)"
xhybo,1,2012-08-01,They say to do the things that you love and that you want to do. But what if you don't even know what those things are?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xhybo/they_say_to_do_the_things_that_you_love_and_that/,"I'll keep this brief. I'm an incoming university freshman and have a fairly good idea of what I want to study now, but I'm not convinced that I will be interested in every aspect of my intended major. Actually, one of the factors in my choosing of this major was the fact that I didn't like any of the other majors at my school. But I am well aware that much of a person's education actually takes place outside the classroom, and that the vast, vast majority of people who have ever discovered, invented, or created something cool did so outside of the boundaries of schoolwork.

But the problem remains that I don't know what *I* should do. I enjoy learning foreign languages, but don't know how anything huge would come out of that. I play two very generic musical instruments and am not one of those people who dedicate ten hours a day to practicing, nor would I even come close to being a professional musician at all. I like to write, but I suffer from writer's block the vast majority of the time because I am a perfectionist about my writing. Scientific/engineering research sounds fascinating to me, and my intended major is actually Physics, but my high school did not have any programs that promoted this sort of activity. I was temporarily in Math Club in high school but quit because it wasn't interesting enough to me (contest math didn't seem to be very practical, but I can definitely see why some people would love it).

As school's about to begin, I've landed an internship at a hospital doing biomedical research as a lab volunteer, which will begin next week. I'm really hoping for a positive experience because science is definitely an area in which I'm interested, but I'm also scared because I didn't have very good science teachers in high school (my chemistry teacher repeatedly called me and my class stupid and my physics teacher, while brilliant, was not great at conveying concepts to students), and I'm not sure that a career in research or academia is for me. This is not an unfounded opinion as several members of my family are academics themselves. 

Basically, I'm still not sure what I'm really passionate about. The closest thing to lighting that 'spark' of passion is science (especially the applied part of physics), and I don't want to become a professor or full-time researcher, so I don't know what I should do. I envy people like Tim Berners-Lee (the guy who invented the World Wide Web) who got to work on things they were passionate about. Berners-Lee actually read for a degree in Physics, but it was his lifetime passion for computing that earned him his fame. I've read lots of similar stories as well, and I want to be like one of those people, but how should I proceed?

Thanks for making it this far into this really jumbled post!"
xhmp8,2,2012-08-01,"[US] Deciding on a college laptop; questions of heat, bulk, battery and features",ghetto_fapulous,SuggestALaptop,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/xhmp8/us_deciding_on_a_college_laptop_questions_of_heat/,"I am an entering freshman looking into purchasing a laptop that will last me through (hopefully only) four years of college. I would like to keep the price under $1100-1200, though I am willing to go above that soft ceiling if that money would actually be well spent. 

I am pretty sure that I will be able to move in with my desktop, so in all likelihood, the laptop will only have to run what I have to do outside of my room. During college, most computing I anticipate will be: 

* Word processing/internet/music/video e.g. stuff my grandmother could do
* gaming
* CAD
* physics simulations (based on my choice of study, I anticipate more particles and E&amp;M than classical mechanics or fluid dynamics, if that makes a difference)
* coding &amp; compiling (at this point, I don't know what language, compiler, or even size/type of coding)
* Analysis software like matlab and stata (just guessing here. I don't know anything about the usage/hardware requirements of these)
* While I can't anticipate everything right now, I expect that most computing I do will be for physics or comp sci classes, design projects (independent or otherwise), or research internships in physics (hopefully experimental rather than theoretical) or related fields

I anticipate being able to do much of the more intense stuff on my desktop, but I can foresee situations in which I would want some of this higher functionality on a mobile device, such as in LAN parties/SCII team games, during travel, studying/doing work away from my dorm, or collaborating with other students. That said, if any of you readers have been through any amount of time in college and can validate or repudiate these concerns, I would appreciate your input. 

Now that I have covered some background about my use of the computer, here are the models I am considering:

**Sager** **NP9130** - XoticPC - $1119

* 15.6"" 1920x1080 matte screen (default)
* i7-3610QM (+$70)
* GTX 670M 1.5GB (default)
* 8GB DDR3 1333MHz (-$50)
* 750GB 7.2k RPM primary HDD (+$0; special)
* no mSATA selected (I am hoping that the installation is accessible so that I can purchase a reasonably priced one)
* No OS (I believe I have read that I can get Windows 7 free through my school and installing the OS myself simplifies upgrading to an mSATA SSD if  I do so right away)

* 6.83 lbs
* 1.69"" thick at thickest
* 76.96 Wh battery


**MSI** **GE60** - XoticPC - $1214


As above except with the following changes:

* GTX 660M 2GB (default)
* 8GB DDR3 1600MHz (default)
* Win 7 Home Premium 64-bit (default) 
* Clean Windows install (+15)
* Steelseries laptop keyboard (default)

* 5.28 lbs
* 1.46"" thick at thickest
* battery capacity not listed


**Sager** **NP6165** - XoticPC - $1018


As above, except with the following changes:

* GTX 650M 1GB GDDR5 (Default)
* Copper Cooling Upgrade (+$79)
* 8GB DDR3 1600MHz (Default)
* No mSATA option; instead secondary HDD bay (left empty - Default)
* No OS (Default)

* 6.17 lbs
* 1.63"" at thickest
* 62.16 Wh battery


**Lenovo** **IdeaPad** **Y580** - Lenovo - $1049

* 15.6"" 1920x1080 ""glare wedge""
* i7-3610QM
* GTX 660M 2GB 
* 8GB DDR3 1600MHz
* 1TB 5.4k RPM primary HDD
* Win 7 Home 64

* 6.15 lbs
* 1.4"" thick
* 5-hour claimed battery life


So at this point I need to decide between the offerings I have considered. I have never owned a laptop, so I have little reference as to ""good"" battery life or how much (or little) the size of the thing will matter to me. The NP9130 has the best graphics, while the GE60 comes at the highest price but in a slightly smaller package and with a steelseries keyboard. I have no experience with the laptop keyboards of either company, so I don't know whether this is worth the apparent price difference. The NP6165 is the cheapest, and I have configured it with copper cooling. I would like to hear your thoughts on whether this feature (available on all the XoticPC computers I have listed) is necessary/useful/noticeable. None of the laptops here are particularly thin or light, but from what I have read, I am not confident that the lower end (integrated or GDDR3 cards) can perform. Main gaming with this thing will probably be SCII at full screen with lowered settings. 

**I** **would** **like** **your** **input** **as** **to** **what** **features** **should** **be** **of** **concern** **to** **me.**  

* Size: I realize that anything over an inch thick begins to look rather enormous, especially in our college campuses so saturated with MacBooks, but how much will I notice or regret having a laptop that is over five pounds and over 1.4 inches thick?
* Battery: What life should I expect/demand?
* Heat: what can I expect from the books up here, and is it worth it to spend extra money on cooling upgrades (offered by XoticPC)?
* CPU: I come from a background of overclocked desktop processors. Given my frame of reference, 2.3 Ghz in a mobile die doesn't seem like much. Will the i7-3610QM cut it?
* Keyboard: Is an upgrade worth it?
* Bulk: I'm a little concerned about it, but I would like to know if this goes more often in the direction of the overlooked faults or the hated pet peeves.

EDIT: format, processor model

EDIT EDIT:

Also considering the **Gigabyte** **U2442N** if I go for a small laptop. 

* i5-3210 (2.5 Ghz, 3.1 turbo, dual core w/ hyperthreading)
* GTX 640M 2GB GDDR3
* 2 or 4 GB DDR3 ????Mhz RAM
* looks like an mSATA option side-by-side with an HDD inside.

That obviously doesn't have the power of the others, but I'd like to hear if you think it would stand up to the demands I'd place on it."

I am near the top of most of my classes, so my work in the classroom is fine. The problem is, I feel that regardless of the GPA, I am quite far behind my peers in terms of actual knowledge. Before college I had zero programming experience, so I suppose this is at least a bit expected when going into a major that's heavily populated by lifelong enthusiasts.

Everything that I do in and out of the classroom is really helping me to understand programming concepts and be able to solve the problems I see on a test or a lab, but I am having significant trouble taking the next step and putting my skills to practical use. I've got quite a bit of anxiety about putting together a resume and getting the right internships because I know that it's important but *I don't know how*.

It's difficult for me to put into words but I suppose the title really says it. I want to *make something* with my skills because I really love this science. It's just new for me and I guess I've hit a bit of a mental block. Can anyone relate or offer some advice?"
xl6or,2,2012-08-02,I chipped a tooth today at my employer's cafeteria while on my lunch break. They say they won't pay for it under Workman's Comp. What is my best recourse?,Bloedbibel,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/xl6or/i_chipped_a_tooth_today_at_my_employers_cafeteria/,"I work for a large company in NYS. I purchased and ate chili at my employer's cafeteria. I was almost finished (maybe 2 spoonfuls left), when I bit down and felt that hard feeling of gristle on one of my rear-left molars. Having eaten gristle before like any meat lover, I swallowed it.

I then inspected my tooth with my tongue, and I felt a chunk/chip missing. It feels rough/sharp, and a piece is definitely gone.

I immediately went to the First Aid/Nurse's station to find out what I could do. The Nurse, call her ""Mulva"", didn't know, but they filed an incident report, and Mulva said she would talk to the insurance provider for the company who handles workman's comp claims. I said OK, I'm not in any pain, please get back to me. Mulva said she should know in about an hour what to do.

She emails me back at 4:30, presumably right before she left, saying that even though it was on company property and I was consuming food purchased there, Workman's Comp doesn't cover it, because it was during my break and I ""was not forced to eat there.""

Frankly, this sounds like BS to me. I am a full-time student doing an internship with this company for the summer, so it's not like I can afford a huge dental bill to repair my tooth or at least mitigate further damage.

/r/legaladvice, what is my best course of action here? Are they truly not liable? Maybe not under WC, but definitely personal injury liability applies here right?

Thanks in advance for taking time to read/respond.

**TL;DR I chipped my tooth eating food at work during my lunch break, the I was told I would not be compensated for my injury.**

xka37,5,2012-08-02,"In a few hours, I’m flying across the country to meet my girlfriend of 5 years (long-distance relationship) for the first time. Reddit, what crazy things have you done that you never thought you would?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xka37/in_a_few_hours_im_flying_across_the_country_to/,"Long story short, my girlfriend and I met on an online roleplaying website when hit my teens. We live on opposite sides of the country. We drifted in and out of contact for a while, and I even deleted her as a contact on AIM when she hadn't signed on after several months. I randomly added her again maybe a year or so later, and one day I saw her sign on again. We caught up a bit and started to role play again, but then we stopped because she wanted to chat rather than role play. I was pretty depressed and contemplating suicide at the time, and didn’t have any friends. I couldn’t understand why she was trying to befriend me, and for a while I seriously felt like I hated her because I believed that I didn’t deserve any friends (because I didn’t even like myself, and I had just gone through a pretty bad betrayal from people I considered friends)After a while, I felt comfortable enough around her that I opened up and told her about myself, and soon after we became really good friends. Over the course of a few years, I fell in love her with and decided to tell her after Christmas. She said she wasn’t sure if she could love me back (for some personal reasons that I don’t feel like getting into right now) and we talked about whether we should pursue a long distance relationship for a while.

We decided that we were going to try and be in a relationship. It was pretty difficult and extremely frustrating, as many long distance relationships are. Her parents didn’t know (they’re pretty controlling) but mine did, and my parents supported me but wanted to make sure I was careful (because of online predators and such). When we moved into talking on the phone, it got pretty risky and eventually her parents found out. We lied and said that I was her friend until two years ago, when her mother complained about how most normal friends don’t spend hours on the phone together. She had to spill the beans to get her mom to stop pestering. Her mom had suspicions about us being together but was pretty skeptical about the relationship lasting(as most people are).

We couldn’t meet for multiple reasons. Her parents didn’t know for the longest time, we both go to school full time, we didn’t have the money, she had internships during the summers. A big reason we haven't met yet is that her parents want to meet me first, and there's a pretty big issue with that which I don't feel like getting into. There were a few moments when we thought we'd reached our breaking point, but we always ended up working things out. As I said before, it's been pretty hard but our struggles have strengthened out relationship. We have an extremely open and trusting relationship. We have both grown so much together and she has helped me find who I am. I am so much happier with myself now because of the love she's shown me.

I never thought I would be in a long distance relationship, nor did I think it would last this long and still be successful. I had really hoped to meet her sooner, but all the same, I'm extremely excited to meet her. 

So Reddit, what things have you done (or are currently doing) that you never thought you would? It doesn't have to be related to relationships, just anything in general."

xjz9s,6,2012-08-02,I'm inexperienced (and very much a novice); how do I work on OSS or contribute meaningfully to projects while in school?,SRyJohn,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/xjz9s/im_inexperienced_and_very_much_a_novice_how_do_i/,"I start this fall at a community college. I'm on the A.S. track for CS. However, my goal is to transfer and get a bachelor's degree in CS with a minor in math. I'm obvious aiming to do well in my courses, but past that I'm already trying to be mindful of distinguishing myself and growing into an alluring candidate for a job offer in four years. 

So far I've chosen a work-study job that is at least a little bit tech related (refurbishing donated computers for a nonprofit with the aim of providing them to low income people in the community). It's enjoyable work and I like the feel-good aspect of it. However, I of course hope to transition to a coding internship at some point. I will try to be proactive about this, since one of the two big summers for internships (from what I understand, soph-junior and junior-senior summers) will be spent without the advantage of a major school's career dept. But I'll see what I can wrangle up!

In the meantime, I'm looking for actual, achievable ways that I can produce meaningful work- especially as it applies to contributing to existing projects. I've made a github account, but I am not experienced. I can build a few simple programs- I've done a couple dozen Project Euler solutions (in Python, C++, and Java). However, I feel like I've hit the point where most of my struggles with the harder problems are math-related and not about programmatic thinking. I've made a few of the simple projects in the more popular Learn Programming ebooks and free online courses. But I don't feel that I know enough just yet to help rewrite some open source library or whatever. I can write simple code on a small scale using popular libraries in major languages. I can't look at any sort of production code and parse what I'm looking at. 

I'm not looking for a magic bullet, I guess. I know the best way to learn is to jump in- but surely there's such a thing as working smart? Is there a certain method by which I should be seeking projects? Do open source communities provide someone to walk you through the vernacular, the existing code flow, etc.? I sometimes bring up repositories that I'm linked or that I see on the web and I don't feel like I could write a productive line of code in the whole thing. Commenting, maybe- I guess I could start there?

I know I have a few years but I'm already a 24 year old going back to school. I want to be doing everything I can today to be good at my career- not just get hired, but legitimately know what I'm doing (especially in a communal coding setup). Any help with this particular goal this early in the learning experience?"

I'm about to reach the end of my summer internship, and I anticipate receiving an offer for a full-time position post-graduation. It's been mentioned informally a few times by my supervisor, along with the fact that 90% of interns get asked back.

The problem is I don't know if I want to work there after graduation. It's a great company doing some really important work, but the location (San Diego), isn't ideal. I know that might be a strange city to complain about, but I grew up there and would rather work up north in the bay area (I'm CS, lots of companies up there). That said, I'd take the offer if it was nice enough.

So here's the question. **How do I ask the person who is likely to offer me a job if I can list them as a reference while applying to other companies?** Is that going to burn bridges? Are they not going to give me a good reference? Is that going to hurt my chance at an offer with the original company?"
xjsnv,182,2012-08-02,"I know there are many similar threads but please help me, Reddit. My underage sister is being sexually preyed upon by a doctor.",confusedtotheextreme,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xjsnv/i_know_there_are_many_similar_threads_but_please/,"First please excuse the re-re-repost because I know there are many similar threads involving underage girls and adult guys and there is some great advice in them. However, there are some elements to my circumstance which are slightly different and I would like some help.


Let’s get to it. My younger sister is currently 16. This summer she started interning at a local hospital where she was attached to a resident doctor who was basically meant to be her mentor, teacher and guide. She did this internship for three weeks.


Now last night I sit down with my laptop and I see that her facebook account is open. I would have logged right out (she usually leaves it signed in) but her messages were open. In particular, her message thread with this doctor she was interning with, let’s call him Doctor “P”. Turns out their conversation started innocent enough but Dr. P soon took the conversation to a sexual side. Now this thread was insanely long so I could not read all of it but what I did read was parts where he was telling her what to do to herself sexually, asking for naked photos of her, telling her what he would do to her and what he would want her to do to him. I can’t go into more details (unless required) because I am about to be sick all over myself.


This Dr. P is in his 30’s. He is very much an adult and is very much aware of my sister’s age as well. When I was reading their conversation I kept remembering NBC dateline and how the predators gain the trust of the victims in their chats. He kept saying how he loved her and cared for her and he was doing this because he cared for her. He has said things like: I’m a caring person and I care about you so I will always make sure you’re satisfied. I’m very worried because I couldn’t get any evidence of whether he has actually touched her.


I’m going to try and keep it short I know this is getting long. Some more relevant things which I said were kind of novel to my situation. I am currently in a muslim country and I am not sure how to approach this. I haven’t let my sister know that I’ve found out. Now I have a few options on how to handle this.


My best bet is going to the hospital and the medical council and getting him fired and his lisence cancelled. However (this is where my country/religion plays a part) being a third world country with an atrocious record of treatment of women, I have a feeling the doctors will try to twist this into making it my sisters fault. Yes my sister has flirted back and played along but she is a child. There is no concept of paedophilia in my country so that aspect of this disgusting crime will be lost on most people. *Editing to add*: I guess now that she's 16 it doesn't matter. I was thinking more from the aspect that when she joined she was 15. 


I do not want to go to the police because in this country when you have a problem you stay away from the police unless you want to be paying through the nose in bribes to get your case registered. Even then all the police does is harass you and in this particular instant I’m sure they will not be helpful.


I don’t want to go to my parents just yet. They will be crushed and it will keep them up at nights.


So what do I do reddit? I am hoping that my sister will keep her FB logged in again and I will take screen shots of the conversation for record and proof. I will confront her after I have this proof so she doesn’t delete anything. 


What should I do, Reddit? Should I go to the hospital? Should I confront Dr. P? When should I talk to my sister and HOW should I talk to her? She will, no doubt, get pissed and tell me to stay out of her life. She is in those years where she thinks she is all knowing and no one has a right in her business.


TL;DR: Saw my 16 year old sisters sex chat with ~~paedo~~ doctor. 

EDIT: for formatting.

EDIT 2: I was avoiding this but I guess it's important. I'm from Pakistan. The police is usually bought in such cases, as are trial judges. There is such a taboo surrounding such things that if I do go to the police and approach a lawyer, my family will be dragged through the dirt and it will be us who end up suffering. Here the stigma always surrounds the girls, never the guy. He may be troubled but my sister will be the one that suffers. I know it sounds extreme but this is how it is here. I'm also worried about what the laws will be for my sister. What if she gets punished?

EDIT3: This is more difficult than I thought. I guess it requires clarification that she turned 16 while she was interning there. I don't know if that changes anything.

xje2s,1,2012-08-01,Stressful job worth it?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xje2s/stressful_job_worth_it/,"I am currently struggling with whether or not I should start looking for another job.  It’s a long read, and honestly, probably not all necessary to describe the situation, but I would appreciate any advice on my situation.  Apologies in advance for the book.

 
Necessary background:  I have been at my current company for over 4 years now.  I started as an intern prior to my senior year in college, stayed on part time, then accepted a full time job when I graduated.  Without going into too much detail, it’s a consulting company that focuses on development for products in a government regulated field.  At this company, I have worked on projects that someone with my level of experience wouldn’t normally be exposed to, much less in a decision making role, until they had another 10-15 years of experience.  I have been promoted a total of 3 times over those 4 years, and each time received a significant raise.  It’s a small company, but over the past two years, it has about doubled in size.

 
Current Situation: 

Historically and currently there is/was a very high turnover rate at this company.  At this time, I have been here longer than 75% of the personnel that have worked here, and of the remaining 25%, most of them have only worked here 1 or 2 years longer than I.  In addition, I have seen a number equal to about 50% of the company start and then quit in this time, including several personnel in senior positions.

 
The problem is that the CEO is, to be nice, insane.  Moody, temperamental, likely to change their mind at the drop of the hat, to forget things, to claim that, “Well, this is just the way that we do business…”  Or, “that’s the way it’s always been done.”  As far as I can tell, she has randomly re-focused tunnel vision that is subject to change at the drop of a hat, and while they are focused on the one random project, other projects are left to languish.  Which wouldn’t be a problem, except that everything needs approval from the CEO, even though the company has grown to a size in terms of number of projects that this is not feasible.

 
Due to how long I’ve been at the company, there are many things that I am responsible for, either because I took them on or because I am the only person that was left that knew what was going on.  This includes client related work and internal work on systems (training, documentation, templates, etc).  I am not really allowed to do anything without approval, but I constantly get pressured for not getting things done.  Often, this will be related to assignments that I have worked on, couldn’t get any approval on, so eventually let them go.  I have raised the issue with my managers, and they are all very sympathetic, but the fact of the matter is that is just how the CEO operates, and no one can change that.

 
Additionally, I have recently had a lot more responsibility dumped in my lap that I am, in my opinion, not particularly qualified to take on.  I can do it, and I am struggling to learn, but the added stress on top of everything else is making me miserable. 

 
I have a company cell phone that, as a manger, I am required to have with me at all times.  If I am going to be away from it for more than 2 hours, I need to notify my manager.  If, heaven forbid, the CEO calls, it’s to my detriment if I don’t answer.  It honestly feels like lugging a brick around with me everywhere.

 
From an HR perspective, working here is a nightmare.  If you are the favorite of the CEO, you get all sorts of perks, up to and including time off.  If you happen to be on the bad side of the CEO for any reason, it’s a living nightmare – you can expect to get ripped to shreds for things you did, things you didn’t do, and things you didn’t even know about.  In addition, they constantly promise promotions or raises, and then take several months to actually follow through (if they ever do)

 
On the other hand, the pay is good, they give great bonuses at the end of the year, there is vacation and sick time, the benefits (health and dental) are fantastic, and the CEO can be the nicest person there is if something goes wrong in your personnel life.  For example, when I’ve had to put an animal to sleep, it’s not a question of me leaving the office for a day or two.  In addition, I love my line managers to death – I have been in their offices crying more times than I can count, and they support me through it all and do their best to mitigate the problems.

 
I also feel like it would be very difficult for me to find a new job based on my qualification – I am not an expert in any field but have been exposed to many (due to consulting), and my experiences/specialties that I have developed here are not really what you would expect or want from someone my age.

 
In addition, as this job constitutes my entire work experience, I would have no idea even what to expect from another job.
 

Finally, I feel horribly guilty at the thought of leaving – I have been promoted very quickly, and I would hate to leave everyone with the fall-out from me leaving (primarily that whenever someone in my position quits, CEO freaks out and start overanalyzing vacation time, etc. because she is paranoid that people are leaving.  In addition, the approval issue gets even worse, because she will be stressed that she didn’t know all of what I was working on, so it will make life that much worse for everyone)

 
Now, to most people, I would suggest that they look for a job in the background and if they find one or get an offer, to go for it.  However, my CEO is remarkable well connected and this is a very specialized field, and I know for a fact that if they found out I was looking, I would likely be fired on the spot.  Not that they absolutely would find out but it’s a possibility that I can’t completely ignore.  In addition, I will not be able to give notice – when I do, I will be fired that day, she will probably close the entire office for the time it takes to clean out my stuff, and that will be that.  So looking for a job opens up a lot of risk – I would only really do it if I convinced that I am willing to lose this one.

 
Am I insane to think about leaving a job when I am in the position that I am?  If I were to stay another year, I would probably receive another raise, potentially another promotion, and I would amass additional experience that constitutes things I would never get to do otherwise.   But I have no hope that anything will change with regards to the environment that I work in, and I don’t have anything left that I can think of to try to fix it.  I hate coming to work every day, and I don’t see that changing anytime soon.  


In addition, are the stressors that I am facing common?  If I go to another job, will I be likely to face this same situation, just in a worse position from a seniority point of view?


TLDR: have a job, take home a pay check, but I am miserable largely due to crazy CEO and don’t know if I should try to find a new job or if I'm likely to face the same situation anywhere that I go.  Additionally, may get fired if its discovered that I am looking, and not sure if the negative is enough to warrant risking that."

I use best practices including source control with git and svn, test driven development, writing specs of projects and using bug/issue tracking, and am quick on learning new skills when I can.

xlgwp,1,2012-08-02,[For Hire] Looking for a job that doesn't suck ass -- Southeastern NC,[deleted],forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/xlgwp/for_hire_looking_for_a_job_that_doesnt_suck_ass/,"Hello Potential Hiring Managers (or bored souls reading all of the many laments and cries for help in this section),

I am a recent college graduate, and like many of my peers, I'm looking for a job.  I've now lived in the Wilmington area for just over a month, and it has become perfectly clear that the job market is just as shitty here as it is everywhere.  People say the job market is poor because the economy is bad.  Am I the only one with eyes?  Every time I go out, people are shopping, eating at restaurants, driving new cars, talking on cell phones.  Heck, I waited in line at the food market for 10 minutes the other day because the line was so long.  I mean, my fucking ice cream was practically melted by the time I got home.  And they say the ""economy is bad"".  The ""consensus"" that the economy is in the tanks is B.S. -- an no, not the one I have sitting in some mandatory $50 binder I had to buy that is now in my sock drawer.  Consumers are spending money left and right, so don't let anybody pawn that off as the reason the job market is balls.  

I'm going to be real with you all.  My generation (the fabled Gen-Y) has a bad rap.  That is why nobody wants to hire us.  u adults think we all r stupid n jus txt all day n r lay-z n lack soshul skillz n a basic grammer* usage mekaniks.  (*I misspelled ""grammar"" purposefully.)  I can assure you I have a firm grasp of the English language and a strong rhetoric to boot.  I'm not lazy, either.  I scour CL's poor excuse for a job board daily, along with Indeed, Monster, CareerBuilder, etc., etc.  I would wager that my work ethic exceeds that of your average Joe Schmoe and far exceeds my average newly-graduated peer.  I want to work.  I need to work.  I need a chance.  I've had some interviews, and they've led to offers.  Just insulting ones.  And the jobs I'm really interested in?  I don't get callbacks.

Holy cow, I am so sorry -- this is supposed to be a posting about me and my resume.  Would you like me to quit my bitching and showcase my qualifications?  Well tough, I'm going to do this my way because the traditional ""email us your resume and we'll be in touch with you soon"" bit is a damned facade.  As I stated before, I've got a B.S. in Small Business Management and Entrepreneurship, with a minor in Marketing.  If you haven't already figured it out, I enjoy writing as well.  I have experience as a customer service and sales intern for an industry leading website manufacturing company.  I have years of retail sales experience.  I am well-versed in MS Office, social media outreach, basic web design and just about anything else a computer does.  I am not a website building maven, an accountant, or a boring monotone nitwit.  I am friendly, well-spoken, and passionate about my work.  You can see the rest on my resume if you email me.  Put ""Purple People Eater"" in the subject line so I know you didn't just give this a quick once over.  (See, I can be crafty too.)  If you're a legit business with a solid background and promising growth potential, I would love to start for you Monday morning -- and at the ass crack of dawn if that's your game.  I'll bring a medium coffee for you as well.

I don't want to come across as desperate here.  If you are a Taco Bell manager (while I do enjoy your Beefy 5-Layer Burrito) keep on browsing -- I'm not your guy.  I'm no slouch -- I had an offer right out of college...which I turned down.  Management Trainee position with a car rental place...perhaps you're familiar.  It all sounded great until I found out I would make the equivalent of sub-$10/hour.  I had another offer in Wilmington about a week and a half ago.  Another $10/hour gig for a manufacturing company doing some sales/marketing work.  Pardon my Francais, but fuck off.  As a summer intern last year (without a degree in my hand) I made $15/hour and was worth every penny of it.  I'm not trying to sound cocky here...just honest.  I work hard.  The only reason I'm not working there right now is because my whole family moved and I was stupid enough to want to be near them.  $15/hour sounds like a King's wage compared to the shit here.  I'm sick of real companies ignoring qualified students, shitty ones offering me dick for pay, and every commission-based position in the world calling me every fucking day.  If you are with Innovative Marketing Firm, any leading insurance provider, a ""business faced with rapid growth in my area"", some asshat promising I can make $75k/year from my home computer, or any other 100% commission-based opportunity:  Please stop wasting my time and everyone else's time.  There may be enough morons on Earth to fully staff your ""ventures"", but I will certainly not be one of them.  

If you are a real business offering a FAIR hourly wage (or, dear sweet God, a SALARY), full-time work, and employee benefits:  Please email me.  (If you haven't been scared away by my naughty language and perceived pessimism.)  I'll send you my resume, both my phone numbers, and you'll have my complete attention.  I can't guarantee that meeting me in person will lead to you extending forth a job offer...I can just be really, really sure that I will impress you.  Look:  I want to make your company money.  I will sell, I will serve, I will write, process, create, send, call, travel, market, relocate, exceed expectations, work my fat-ass off...cook you grilled cheese...anything short of murder.  My ideal job?  Something where I work with people daily, work in a team-environment, and have a great product behind me.  I love cars, electronics, watches...man stuff.  Give me a chance and I will add value to your business.

If you couldn't decode by now, I have a great sense of humor and I really am an optimistic individual.  I've been told I emit a positive energy strong enough to turn Scrooge into Gandhi**.  (**I told myself that just now.)

I look forward to hearing from you soon."

xoucu,2,2012-08-04,Seeking advice on how to deal with this situation.,rubbertissue,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/xoucu/seeking_advice_on_how_to_deal_with_this_situation/,"Back in March I was hired by this kind of small software company, my first job, since I finished college in February. I was waiting for a contract of approximately 860 USD/month, as an intern. Meanwhile (while I waited for the contract), one of the bosses said that they would be giving me some help in my expenses. A value was never agreed upon, or discussed, but they paid me ~247 USD/month.

I started working in this conditions, ~8h per day and, not rarely, I worked extra hours at home, even during weekends. The first project I had to work on was practically adding a few extra features to a website, based on opencart (which I didn't knew). Another project came along: an android application (the reason which I got hired, I guessed).  I was the only person in this company with any experience developing for android, but you can't really say I was very experienced or something similar. Naturally, I became the only person responsible for this project (which shouldn't be possible on the terms of the internship contract that never existed), without anyone helping me and the design team ""dropping"" it having only made a few (~6) layouts of the many more that were needed.

Meanwhile another project came along, another android app. This one was a priority, so I tried to work in both projects and a few days/weeks later had to stop working on the first android app to work full-time on this new app, since it was a priority. The guy that kinda filled the shoes of the team/project manager left, and a new guy came in his replacement, a month later. This new guy had no clue about the current projects nor did he try to learn much about them. I don't know why, but I guess that this new guy didn't like me much, since he always spoke to me in an offensive manner; calling me unprofessional, a bad programmer and he even went on to say that everyone that comes out of my college thinks that they are the best but they really aren't bla bla bla (talk about frustration). There were, a few times, empty threats about firing me (and other colleagues). I even had to go to work sick 'cuz of this guy.

Their deadlines weren't really being met (i.e. they were being met but the client had always something he wanted to do differently or just adding new features), so this (second) app would be ""sent back"" to us.

This went on for a few weeks, until recently. I was supposed to be on vacation, but had to work 4 out of the 5 days of vacation and they were refusing to pay me the miserable 247 USD of the last month. I always tried to solve things out calmly and asked frequently when would I be offered the supposed internship contract. During the last week they asked me for the source code of the first app, which I sent them (note: I had to work with my personal computer and smartphone, which wasn't supposed to be happening and they didn't even have a version control system or anything similar for that matter). I tried to talk with one of the bosses to get them to pay me, but again, got turned down and I was said to show up in the next week, which, again, was a week of vacation. I refused. The guy started to talk rubbish and called in the pseudo-team leader, who started screaming. I kept my cool and went back to my desk. I had to leave early that day and had informed the team leader about that. He asked me for the source code of this second app. I told him that I would send it later.

As I was leaving I said goodbye. The boss followed me and grabbed my backpack, asking me to send them the source code. He blocked the  door and didn't want me to leave. This went on for a few minutes. He finally got out of the way, and I was able to leave. I didn't send them the source code (as they later ""demanded"" through an e-mail).

This is my situation at the moment. They phoned me today asking for the application (not the source) so they can show it to the client, that is getting mad and bla bla bla. What should I do? I don't want them to get the source since they didn't pay me. I want to be paid fairly for my work now. About the source of the first app, that I did send them, what can I do to ensure that it is of my authorship and if they use it, they have to give me credit (not money).

TL;DR: got in a bad employment situation. the bosses don't pay, I don't want to provide the source code as I'm leaving. what should I do?

I was having a great day at my job that is getting me through my IT degree. This consisted of 10 hours sleep, 2 cups of coffee and only lovely chatty customers. One of the customers was a guy who followed on where the conversation left off about uni between me and another student. He seemed quite interested in changes in the IT industry and was very amused by my attempts to get better at programming (taking on calculus and linear algebra as well as writing silly software for practice).

It turns out he’s a CPA partner in one of the accounting firms around here with some sort of history in systems analysis and design in the english financial system (doing one of their big banks software). He gave me his name and the name of his firm then said I should call him for coffee to talk about other things I can do to improve my job prospects. (He wasn’t hitting on me btw.)

what were your internships like? Did you get job offers immediately after graduating, or did it require some job searching.

Do you feel like you make enough to support a family living comfortably.

If you had to go back and do it over again, what would you do differently?

thank you so much for your help!

xqijk,3,2012-08-05,I need extreme help in writing a resume for an internship.,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xqijk/i_need_extreme_help_in_writing_a_resume_for_an/,"There is something about me that prevents me from being able to write about myself and it has always been a problem. Writing a resume is quite possibly the most difficult thing in the world for me to do. I get shaky, frustrated and basically have a nervous breakdown even thinking about it. I can normally fill out job applications just fine when they ask specific questions but when writing a resume i freak out and don't even know where to start. I am changing careers from graphic design to computer programming so changing an old resume is not really adequate. i have tried numerous sites that say they help but none of them really help all they really do is format it for you and give suggestions. None of this really helps me because it still means i have to talk about myself, i still have to say how good i am at something which i can not do i can't judge myself on my skills and don't even know how to list them. If anyone knows of a great website for helping write computer science-ish resumes that will walk me through it. or some way to list the language/skills that i know any help would be greatly appreciated.

again this is for an internship which i hear you are supposed to make different that a normal resume which seems even weirder to me.

sorry for the oddness of the post, i am still shaky and nervous.

just as an example of how bad i am at this, i have been working on it for about 3 hours and only have my name on it."
xqf45,15,2012-08-05,"My College Decision: RIT's Game Dev Program, or Digipen's RTIS Program? Employers or Students Perspectives Would be Much Appreciated.",MDSVentus,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/xqf45/my_college_decision_rits_game_dev_program_or/,"So I'll be a senior this upcoming year, and this summer I've spent my time looking at colleges. In the end I've whittled it down to two colleges for specific programs: Digipen Institute of Technology for their RTIS program, and RIT for their Game Design and Development program. I've done almost all the research I can see yielding good results, and frankly, they both stand side by side now.

What I could really use is the perspective of students of either programs or colleges, as well as the perspective of employers in the industry who may have seen applications from graduates of these programs and seen how they stack up. Anyone else with knowledge about either of these colleges and programs would be greatly appreciated.

Here's a general outline of where I'm coming from and what I'm looking for: I want no cut corners, I'm not one of the students who thinks ""Oh cool, I can make video games, why not?"" I understand all the time, energy, and problems that will come with game development, and studying under a true program at a college to prepare you for it, and my high-school curriculum is setup so that I'm hopefully ready for a harsh workload that comes with it. I want to be incredibly well-prepared when I get out of college for the industry, this goes beyond just programming skills, design skills, and project experience, and also into internship opportunities, and co-op. And I'm also looking at what kind of time I'll have outside of classes, how's the student body, what's the area, stuff like that. I really want to try and see if I can put one before the other.

So, for all those with knowledge about either of these schools, their respective programs, or students who have participated in them, I would love an outline on positives, negatives, bonuses, ect in the following categories if you could.

1) Core Skill Set- Programming, Design, Projects

2) Area - Campus/Town, Dorms/Apartments

3) Internships/Co-op - Possible internship opportunities, ease of getting internships.

4) Community - Clubs, Student interaction

5) Difficulty


I know I'm asking a lot here, but I'm hoping that maybe there will be some people from one program or the other, and I can begin to get a look from first-hand experience from varying perspectives besides my own on what these colleges can offer. I know this isn't helping anyone but myself, but you have my huge thanks for even just reading through this, it's the rest of my life here, and I'm trying to find the right way to go."

[Ex-NASA contractor here (GSFC\).  I had nothing but positive experiences while at NASA.  What were your negative experiences?  Also... what do you give the chance of success for the landing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o548x?context=5)|I received resistance, rather than encouragement, when I found odd or even flawed behavior during testing, despite that being my job. The apparent reason was that the project was already over budget and behind schedule and so any such result was not wanted. The most memorable required me to risk damaging the prototype I was testing to prove the bad output was from the hardware and not a fault of the testing equipment. It turned out I was right and the flaw had not been caught for years because the software/simulation tests (these were FPGAs) were manully modified to pass with the bad data (e.g. if actualResult == expectetResult + '555A' then pass), and apparently anyone doing hardware tests had not been thorough enough to find or investigate the problem.  I found flaws in my predecessors tests, but I was not believed, my claims were not investigated, and I was told not to spend time rewriting them or even re-testing the functionality, again because of schedule. One such function was found to be flawed in the course of other testing, whereupon I successfully argued for time to investigate the cause, explicitly being told not to spend time looking over other tests. It turned out my predecessor had been incorrectly using a bit-wise AND to perform comparison. (This would be like a computer program concluding ""nitrogen"" and ""ailments"" were the same word because the letter ""i"" was the same in each. Not good when working on technology where every bit matters.) I performed an automated search of the rest of the code and found he was using this method everywhere, meaning the fastest solution would be to re-write all of them. When I reported my findings, rather than receiving praise or an apology, I had to defend how I managed to find all these other misuses if I did not spend time reading all of the code. I was told not to go back and re-test the hardware, since it was concluded the other testing was done ""through use."" Soon after, my predecessor, who had previously left JPL, was hired back to do the same job by my supervisor, apparently with a higher salary than before.  There were lots of limitations due to apparent budget and scheduling constraints, to the extent I was asked to work 56-hour weeks (the maximum allowed without very special reasons) because there was no money to hire other engineers, and I was young, cheap labor. Then the end of the fiscal year came and I was told, ""we need to spend as much money as fast as possible"" and ""as long as it costs less than $600,000, I don't really care, just buy it."" The strategy here was apparently to spend all resources available since otherwise our budget would be lowered the next year.  During a meeting in front of another section, I was asked by my supervisor to agree that we were ready to sign that testing had been completed, even though we both knew it was not anywhere near done. Soon after, another engineer was hired, I was asked to train him, and then I was moved to another project. I could not help but think it was so that my signature would no longer be required, and so I began making arrangements to leave. From this meeting to my departure was a period of months, by which time testing was still not complete, to give you some idea of just how absurd his assertion was.  I was told by another engineer that the reason the Genesis spacecraft crash-landed in Utah was because when they tested the accelerometer, they just dropped it and checked that the numbers changed. According to him, they did nothing to ensure the numbers were positive, negative, or accurate to any degree. He did not seem to feel responsible beyond a slight shrug, citing that the test procedure didn't specify exactly how to test it.
[**tl:dr The federal funding process put a counterproductive focus on budget and schedule, resulting in flawed products and general apathy.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o5lch?context=5)|There is a natural schedule built in with Mars and other planetary exploration, since launch is only plausible within certain windows of time. However, I find your theory consistent with what I observed.
[Wow, thanks for sharing. For the sake of future astronauts, I hope that these incidents are isolated and not commonplace at NASA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o5koo?context=5)|This was equipment used for autonomous space craft, so it is unlikely that any astronauts would be put at risk. However, I love space exploration and it baffled me why anyone at JPL would take it so lightly. I was not prepared for this attitude.
[Given this, do you think MSL is ready for its mission or do you think there are serious software or hardware flaws that will hinder it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o5mmq?context=5)|The mission was delayed, as I understand it, to do more testing. I think there are good engineers as well as bad ones, but I am optimistic the good ones were given enough time to be thorough.
[When you are on a project that has extra money, you don't think ""oh, I'm going to save NASA some money](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5oa2de?context=5)|I do not consider that a defense of this behavior at all.
[I've always wondered this: Why are the hardware specs way lower on satellites and rovers than what you can get on a consumer level?  I can get a 16 MegaPixel camera for $200, and 8GB of RAM for $50.  Why does a 2.5 billion dollar rover have a 1MP camera and 256MB of RAM?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o5xsq?context=5)|For one, there is much more fault tolerance in space flight hardware than consumer hardware. It's radiation hardened, it has a lot of error detection and correction, it's built to failover to another copy of itself, it has heat and space requirements, and it's all custom-built.
 |Also, such hardware is often built from scratch. That is, they often create new custom hardware rather than standardizing components and re-using them. One of the goals of the project I was on was to standardize some of these components, such as the network card. I was surprised it had not been done much sooner, but I am also not sure if it will turn out to be successful, due to all the customization that seems needed for each mission.
[What is the most exciting thing that happend at the office?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o54nw?context=5)|The atmosphere after the success of Deep Impact. There was plenty of media coverage and they brought in the surviving members of The Comets to sing ""Rock Around The Clock Tonight.""
[What kind of engineer are you? What was the scope of your job? Tell us what you mean by gritty/dark experience.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o5600?context=5)|I graduated in computer science, but my job at JPL had a lot to do with electrical engineering, so I had to learn about a lot of low-level stuff like communication protocols and other bit/byte-level stuff.
 |I was essentially responsible for understanding and testing several custom-built cards (think oversized PCI cards). This involved working with the designers and other test engineers to understand all behavior and then writing scripts to automate testing so that regression tests could be performed as new functionality was added.
 |I have covered some of the gritty stuff in other questions.
[Did you find it odd that they would put someone to work in a area that wasn't specifically trained for it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o5u6c?context=5)|I found it challenging, but not odd. I figured they preferred people who were able to function in multiple disciplines. I believe I did so. However, someone with a dual EECS degree would have been better-equipped at the start.
[Do you believe Curiosity will safely land?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o5r75?context=5)|No, I just really hope it does.
 |Edit: I botched this answer, as I was focused on the word ""believe."" I am somewhat science-minded, so I do not simply believe things one way or another. I do not think I am anywhere near a good place to make a valuable prediction, so I prefer to just cross my fingers and wish us all luck.
[You're not happy you JERK.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5oukgh?context=5)|Care to share why you're so upset with me?
[Is the Curiosity as it was planned however many years ago? Or has it completely evolved from former plans/drawings?  What is an experiment/design that had completely unexpected results?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o5f1l?context=5)|I can only comment on the avionics and only for the time I was there, but it seemed like the evolution was minimal to the overall design. There were several small enhancements, but the biggest change in the design I remember was that the circuit board had to be redesigned because the height requirement changed. I seem to recall that this was to make space for attaching a cable to another component. Nothing too unexpected.
[How likely do you think it is that Curiosity will land without a hitch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o5lzk?context=5)|I don't think it was built with a hitch, so 100%. *rimshot*
[I'm a software consultant and lately I've been thinking a lot about an old dream of mine to work for an organization like NASA in order to contribute to the scientific community.  Unfortunately I'm not really sure what I'd be doing, or how to get there.  Are you, or did you work with, software engineer types at all?  And if so, what were your or their responsibilities?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o5frj?context=5)|I did work with software engineers and I know there are a variety. There are those that do ""hard"" computer science, like designing EDAC (error detection and correction) algorithms, image compression algorithms, etc. There work in computer vision, evolutionary algorithms, and other advanced technology. And there is also space flight software, test automation, and I'm sure many others.
[What are you currently doing for work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o59no?context=5)|I work writing healthcare software and have some side projects in educational software in the hopes of becoming more independent.
[How hard is it to land a job with NASA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o5ira?context=5)|I had a high GPA as an undergraduate, somehow landed an internship, and then accomplished enough in 10 weeks that they remembered me a year later as I was graduating.
 |Other than that, I have no idea how hiring is done, and I suspect JPL is different than other NASA centers since it's operated by Caltech rather than directly by the federal government.
[I've learned that the two newly designed jets, the F-22 and the F-35, the F-35 designed to use the same technology designed for the F-22 use two different programming languages.  The F-22 uses LISP, and someone in the DOD decided that a new feature of the F-35 should be using C++, because C++ is more modular.  Representatives of the DOD did apparently say that the chinese probably couldn't hack anything written LISP...  Anyway, so at the cost of tens of billions of dollars all the software for the F-22 was rewritten for the F-35...  So now you'll read about the F-35 getting billion dollar software upgrades for things like ""software update block to support enabling the use of the RADAR"", or another billion for the software update to give it the software to shoot missiles, and another billion for an update to drop bombs...  What do you think about that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o65db?context=5)|The entire MSL project apparently cost $2.5 billion, so a billion dollars for a software upgrade doesn't sound realistic to me. If that's true, that would sound very wasteful to me.
[JPL doesn't use version control?  I thought my company was bad...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o86pm?context=5)|A few EEs at JPL use backups and file renaming instead of version control. I've seen worse.
[What do you think about the Government Accountability Project (GAP - Link to www.whistleblower.org \)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o5mut?context=5)|As others have pointed out, you can reason that the root cause of problems here are due to the focus on budget and schedule. This is set by Congress and I am not sure that telling everyone that Congress is performing poorly will really surprise anyone, judging by their current approval ratings.
 |That said, I tend to think openness and transparency are great, especially in science and technology, so any channel to expose information is better than none.
[This is rather disheartening... working at JPL was always one of my biggest dreams... :( now what do I strive for? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o5w07?context=5)|Working at JPL. Just be more prepared than I was.
[Hi FormerJPLEngineer, I am an electrical engineer and it has always been a dream job of mine to work at a place like JPL. After reading about what your experiences were it sounds like I should change my mind. Should I stay away from JPL(and similiar places\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o5zud?context=5)|Part of me believes if I had been more mentally prepared for what I would encounter, I could have found the willpower to stay and change things for the better. Part of the reason I think it's good to talk about my bad experiences is so that people like yourself will be able to do what I gave up on.
[I know this most likely isn't your area, but why do all the images of mars look like they've been scotch taped? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o5rqm?context=5)|It's not really my area, but I think what you're talking about is due to images being sent back in chunks and then stitched together.
[I've always wondered if the signals to/from the various space probes are encrypted in any way.  Would it be possible for hackers to spoof a signal and hijack, say, the Mars rover, given access to a powerful enough antenna?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o6j1y?context=5)|You would not only need transmit the data all the way to Mars, which is no easy task, but you would also need pinpoint accuracy to the precise location of the spacecraft, which is tightly-held information. Even if you managed to pull that off, there is defense against a spacecraft being hijacked, but I obviously shouldn't go into detail.
[*but you would also need pinpoint accuracy to the precise location of the spacecraft, which is tightly-held information.*  Hmm, that doesn't make much sense.  At X-band, the beamwidth of any conceivable antenna on Earth is large compared to the angle subtended by Mars as a whole, isn't it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o8oud?context=5)|You also need to be able to listen to the signal back, which is very weak by comparison and so you need to listen in exactly the right direction.
[For a young, space enthusiast, chemical engineer, graduating in May, with internships in biochemistry (university research\), nanotechnology (ARC-NASA\) and piezoelectrics (GRC-NASA\), I'm having trouble deciding on how to go about applying for jobs/opportunities in the space exploration and related technologies industry.  So far, I'm planning on applying to grad schools, as well as to SpaceX, Blue Origin, and whatever other space companies I can find, and see what happens from there.  Any advice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o5sc4?context=5)|Just that the people you work with directly make a big difference in your ability to stay motivated and productive. Even if they are not bad people, if you're surrounded by those who are most concerned about paying off their mortgage or getting a promotion, it will be more difficult to accomplish great things.
[Despite all of the shit you had to deal with, do you have any positive/ interesting experiences?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o640i?context=5)|Yes, there were many fun, interesting, experienced, and intelligent people there. It was in fact my dream job and so for a long while I walked around like a child, being giddy about how I was in the same room where they developed Cassini or in the same lunch line as the chief engineer of MER.
[How hard was it to learn all the PCI stuff and test it. IT sounds very very daunting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o5w4d?context=5)|Difficult, but doable with time. The cards used the cPCI specification (which is essentially the same as PCI, but with a different form factor) and there other cPCI cards we had to do test automation. Unfortunately, the other engineers had played dumb and assumed these tests were complete, which was nowhere near the case. I ended up reading through the entire specification and checking all of it, finding more than one error in our implementation, as I recall.
 |Thanks for this question... glad at least one is technical. :-)
[How come there are no instruments to record sounds from Mars?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o7d8e?context=5)|They have tried: [Link to mars.jpl.nasa.gov](http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msp98/lidar/microphone/mic_found.html)
 |I guess the problem was RealPlayer.
[What were the surprises that made it go from ""dream job"" to quitting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o5ffz?context=5)|I mentioned a number of problems I encountered. Those were the worst and easiest to explain, but there were other issues too, such as observing certain co-workers not working except to take credit for other people's work, including my own. Other trust issues led me to be generally unhappy and so I eventually just quit, not even having another job lined up.
[Do you think the people you worked with were really the cream of the crop?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o5ffz?context=5)|I think I was exposed to some really great people and I believe there are many more great people around the laboratory. Obviously, from earlier answers, my experiences were such that I could not make the same conclusion about every single person there.
[I saw what you said about the negatives during your time at JPL in a previous comment, and I was curious as to what you think could be done to fix that environment? Was it limited to your team/group/project, or do you think it's an institutional problem?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o6e9y?context=5)|To me it seems like a change in culture (shared attitudes and beliefs) would be the best improvement. I do not really have any solid suggestions on how to accomplish that at an organizational level.
[Also, could you break down how one goes from undergraduate studies all the way to working at JPL?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o6e9y?context=5)|I received an internship after my junior year and I apparently performed well enough that they remembered me the next year as I was about to graduate.
[Its more of a hardware question, but did the cards you worked on get built to a certain vaccum and temp specification? Are they exposed to vacuum during the trip over to the planet? What extreme conditions are associated with space travel + surface travel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o6kj9?context=5)|I worked with prototypes that did not go through environmental testing, but yes, that is the norm for flight hardware. Radiation, heat, pressure, and durability are the major environmental tests I'm aware of for internal components.
[What are your thoughts on the future of the private sector in space exploration (e.g. the partnership between Spacex and NASA\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o8y33?context=5)|I think having diversity in the industry is great. Once something as large as NASA develops a pattern of doing things, it's difficult for such an organization to make the leap to doing things differently. Hopefully SpaceX will be more adaptable.
 |I'm especially interested in the success of Planetary Resources.
[Have you ever tried involvement with a Labor Union? My father, a GSFC employee, has been very active in his Labor Union, I remember him helping people keep their jobs and such.  Actually, after researching it, I don't see anything similar for JPL, which might be a problem.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o8mvh?context=5)|There is active resistance by leadership at JPL to unionization. Apparently people have even been fired for mentioning it.
[Aliens! Do you have any stories about NASA &amp; aliens?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o8s0f?context=5)|They are delicious.
[Hello, I'm starting college this fall and I'm planning on majoring in physics/astrophysics. Does NASA have demand for such graduates, or is it mainly engineering? I'm not really familiar with the specialties sought by space programs. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o6u8m?context=5)|I don't know the demand, but there are positions for scientists there, including physicists and astrophysicists. I suspect such positions require a PhD.
[Definitely... BTW, are you familiar with Roger Boisjoly? Any comments on his actions/experiences?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5o9ppc?context=5)|I wasn't, no. Seems like he did the right thing.
[Did it seem like everyone was stressed out all the time, as though that was the culture of the organization?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xoeei/i_was_a_jpl_engineer_who_worked_on_the_mars/c5oa68v?context=5)|It seems as though that was the atmosphere management intended to create, but not everyone bought it.

xpyl4,3,2012-08-05,"[COLLEGE] I'm going to college, what should I know to help me succeed? A giant thread of tips from a senior to a freshman.",RossPeterson,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xpyl4/college_im_going_to_college_what_should_i_know_to/,"Earlier, I saw a post on habits that you wish college freshman will stop, but I felt that while that thread was helpful, I felt there could be more educational value. As a senior in college who has aced and failed numerous times, I have learned from my successes and failures, and would like to take this opportunity to pass down some things I have learned over the years. 

**FEEL FREE TO ADD YOUR OWN TIPS. THIS IS AN OPEN DISCUSSION.**

[Strong language ahoy]

Let me just hand down a bunch of college tips from a senior to an incoming freshman.

**The most important thing is to just go to fucking class.** It is comically easy to just not go to class and do whatever the hell you want. That is both the glory and downfall of college. 75% of the time you will have classes that don't take attendance, but DO NOT let this fool you, as 100% of the time, you will royally fuck yourself over. I'm not saying that there won't be days where you can skip and you won't miss out on a bunch, but I'm saying that if you have to ask yourself if you should or shouldn't go to class that day, GO. Attendance can make a whole letter grade of difference, and constant missing classes will not just make you look like an idiot, but an easy A will turn into a well-deserved F.

**Do every assignment after you get out of that class** and you're not in another one. Procrastination is masturbation, it's fun and games until you realize you fucked yourself. The assignment and the guidelines to go about it will be fresh in your head and fresh in your notes. It will be super easy to do when you get down to it right away, and then you can go fuck around. If it's a big assignment, divide it into sections and take some breaks. BONUS TIP: Go to your professor with your assignment a day or two ahead of time and go over it with them. Professors will LOVE you for this, and will ace the assignment even if it isn't that great. A for effort.

**Join as many activities** that you are interested in as possible. College is a social experience as much as it is an academic one. I made the mistake of sticking around a select amount of people, and three years later, people graduated, left, had a falling out, or overall I never saw them again for whatever reason. Activities are places where you make friends, and you will be surprised how many besties or bros that will either fuck you in the ass or simply leave after a year or two. Make as many friends as possible because...

**You need to network.** I say college is a social experience because the people around you are going to be much more than just your friends. These are also your study partners, your mentors, and your way into the job market. Professors, activity partners, co-workers, TA's, and students, all of these people are more important than you will ever know. I've received many jobs, free-rides, easy passes, and overall amazing benefits simply by being friendly with people and keeping in touch with them. Everyone is there to be your friend, and many of them will help you in so many different ways. Also, make two friends in EVERY class, these people are now your best friends and your study partners/people to get notes from when you're away.

Activities is mentioned twice here because **people never realize how truly fucking fantastic activities really are.** There are some lame ones, but most of them are incredible. I was on the student newspaper, radio station, English honor society, etc. All of these activities helped me make more friends, get new jobs, expanded my horizons, all sorts of benefits I thought weren't possible to come from just by a group of people meeting together with free food.

**Take advantage of every social gathering on campus.** Free food is everywhere, and chances are, your dining hall sucks, or WILL suck. Clubs and activities are begging for members, and they will lure you with all sorts of goodies and swag. Take them all.

**Accept that everyone in High School is practically dead.** If your high school was like mine, you will come to terms that everyone in high school that you were around were either fake douchebags or are simply just not your friends. Of course, some besties or bros you know in high school will still be your friends, but for the most part, cut ties. The people you will meet in college will be 10x what your ""friends"" were back in HS.
I'd like to repeat the importance of breaking up with your long-distance relationship partner. That shit never works, and if it is working, it won't last long. If I had a nickel for every time I witnessed a conversation about a girl breaking up with her boyfriend from home or some guy realizing the women at college are hotter than in nowhereville, I wouldn't be going to college.

**Some generals.** Take your phone battery out of your phone if you can, or completely turn your phone off in class. DISABLE your speakers or mute them on your laptop. Sit in the back if you're going to dick around. Don't ask too many questions, they have office hours for a reason. Don't talk about your life in high school, no one cares. If you have to use the bathroom, just go. If you're sick, just email, if attendance isn't taken and you're sick, get better and don't give a fuck, but maybe you should get notes from someone who was in class. Plan out your entire four years or however many years you plan on going to school for, plan out every course you will take, and make a couple back up plans. Thinking of going to grad school? It is NEVER too early to start planning for that. Internships? Jobs? TAKE THEM. You know why the economy is in the shitter and no one can get a job? Because NO ONE PLANS ANYMORE. You plan this shit out and you get everything handed to you. People respect those who know what they are doing. Professors will take note and will give you the grades and resources needed for the higher level classes and internships and jobs and grad schools.

**Don't be a prick.** It is really easy to get a big head in college because you can do so much hot shit. People start giving a fuck about you but that shouldn't be a reason to start walking around like the big man on campus. The people in college that you want to be around are people who are humble and worldly, not the student senate douche who is there only to tell people they are wrong. Remember your roots of college, that you are there to LEARN, to WORK, and to HAVE FUN, not to be an ass to everyone you meet.

I've never seen anyone do all three, but **college is the art of balancing good grades, a social life, and getting a good amount of sleep.** The rule of thumb is to **pick two,** and **grades should be one of them.** Don't fuck this up. College is the best time of your life, and it will quickly turn into the worst if your grades are shit. You have no idea how important this is until it is too late, because all of your life you've had mommy and daddy walk you through everything, and in College, you're on your own for the first time, and you're going to make a bunch of big fucking life-altering mistakes that you won't even comprehend until years later you're going to regret it. Don't waste it.

xpubg,22,2012-08-05,"College Graduate Redditors: Looking back, if you were to do it over, what would you have done differently?  Also, what are you really glad you did in college?  I'll start.  ",celinesci,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xpubg/college_graduate_redditors_looking_back_if_you/,"Inspired from the advice thread for incoming freshmen, it got me thinking about my own college experience.  

What I'd do over:

I'd take the effort to get to know some of my professors.  I was an average student in lectures of 300-400 students, and figured only exemplary students or struggling students were worth the prof's time.  I definitely missed out on getting letters of recommendation and networking opportunities because I didn't really interact too much with any professors.  Also, it wasn't till after I graduated that I found out one thought I had fantastic lab technique.  

I would have also dumped my controlling college boyfriend a lot sooner.  


What I'm glad for:

My parents were struggling financially when I was in college and I had to take up a work-study job as part of my financial aid package.  I worked the whole time I was in school.  I also picked up an internship because it paid well.  Those two positions helped me get my full-time job that I have now.

Because of the availability of courses and poor planning on my part, I wasn't able to graduate on time, I had to take summer school and an extra quarter.  Because of that extra time, I got to take more ""fun"" classes that I didn't get to take when I was focused on knocking off my gen ed requirements my first two years.  I took psychology and ornithology, and loved it.

xp5fb,34,2012-08-04,"A blog post I wrote a while back that contains all the advice I can think to give beginning artists who are seeking jobs at game studios, having been in the industry about a year myself. ",bacon_lettuce,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/xp5fb/a_blog_post_i_wrote_a_while_back_that_contains/,"This is an article I wrote on my art blog back in February. I thought I'd make an updated edit of it for the Reddit game dev community since I've been seeing more posts from junior artists here. It's essentially advice on breaking into the art side of a game development studio, and surviving there. 

Before I start, I should say that I am not an expert and have made a LOT of mistakes along the way. Heck, I'm only a year out of school (graduating in 2011) so I really don’t have a lot of experience on this. The things I say are going to be based purely on personal experience and from what I've observed from other people’s experiences.


**Getting a job – starting your career**


You – meaning your portfolio and experience - will get you the job. Networking will only get you an interview.


You think this one would be obvious, but I have had folks ask me if I could put in a word for them at my company, assume I got hired at a company because I knew someone there, and so forth. Really being hired is a matter of three things:


* The right opportunity within the company/project arises.

* You demonstrate through your experience (resume) and artistic portfolio (or art test) you are a good fit for the job.

* You interview well, your references check out and it's clear you work well on a team.



Networking and referrals can and will help you get an interview after the opportunity arises. New projects are scattered as to when they'll start up and where, so it's really great if you have a broad network of people at various companies to let you know when an opportunity arises.


Ultimately however YOU get you hired. You can't and shouldn't rely on anyone or anything else to do that for you.


**You will get rejected. A lot.**


While in school, I started applying for internships and jobs early on. I got rejected a lot. My senior year I got more interviews and more rejections. Eventually, I sent my resume off to an indie studio after seeing a junior artist posting there and landed an interview. I continued on with that team through two contracts after graduation through their sister outsourcing art company. After my second contract ended unexpectedly I was unemployed for about a month and a half, which is pretty good for only having 8 months of experience.


During the first week of unemployment I sent off more than 40 letters/applications/postings to companies. These included temp jobs, companies on gamedevmap that I was interested in, friends at companies asking if they were hiring, jobs postings on websites, postings on cragslist, monster and more. I interviewed with a few temp agencies/recruiters to get myself in their system.


I got very few responses. Of the responses, many were automated rejections.


I also got a lot of rejections after interviewing. I think I interviewed at least 4 times before landing a job offer. The reasons for being rejected included:


* We don't have the money to hire you;
* You don't have enough lead experience;
* Your art isn't a good match for our project.


When you get rejected, it doesn't at all mean you are a bad artist. You just aren't the right fit right now. If you landed an interview it's clear that your art is not 'bad' or 'sub-par', it's just not a good match for them right now. Keep trying.


**Be flexible. Be willing to take a job you are less interested in if the company is willing to give you an art test and train you. More experience can only make you a better artist.**


I was VERY lucky that the sister art outsourcing company was willing to give me a world building art test for a 6-month contract porting a big name AAA title to the Wii after I graduated. In school I had focused on character animation, but I was willing to give world building a try. I did an art test for them and they hired me.


Doing the contract was a great experience for me. It got me a AAA game on my resume, showed me how AAA games are made, and helped me build a relationship with people at the studio company we worked for and the art outsourcing company. The art outsourcing company gave me an unreal test for another contract after this one ended, and from there I got a second contract doing FX work. I again learned a new skill and found that I REALLY enjoy doing FX animation. Though I didn't do any character animation I made a lot of great friends, gained mentors, and grew exponentially as an artist. Nothing but a positive experience.


After that contract got cut and I was unemployed, I went to go work at a big name game studio as a ‘student hire’/contractor. They paid me $18 an hour and I worked on a casual kids browser MMO, doing 3D character animation. 


I left that gig to go work as a FTE on a AAA game doing VFX, which I found out I love to do. I got benefits and I got to do VFX on a game I am really excited about.


Many art graduates see themselves as craftsman that specialize at one thing. While I think both craftsmanship and specialization are really important, it’s a bad idea to pigeonhole yourself into one role. Some may disagree with me on this, but being open to new artistic paths has worked great for me so far. In 10 years I might not even be an ‘animator’ – I might be an ‘FX animator’ or even a ‘technical artist’ or 'art generalist'. I’m not sure. But I do know that taking non-character animation specific jobs has really been a great experience for me.


**Look at contract jobs right away and jobs that aren't your dream job.**


I see a lot of people say things like they'll only take contract if they spend a good chunk of time searching for a FTE job and can't get one, or that they will only accept jobs they are really interested in - like being an animator at, say, blizzard.


Most full time jobs in the area aren't for junior level people, especially at big companies. It's also foolish to think that someone is going just hand you a FTE job without at least doing contract-to-hire. The artists I know who are working FTE from my year at least started out as an intern and later got an FTE offer. If you have zero experience as an artist, the chances of you getting an FTE offer are pretty slim even if you are really skilled.


**What companies and recruiters want**


**How you brand your portfolio is really important.**


If you spend a lot of time animating/drawing more simplistic, 'cartoony', stuff and that fills up a good chunk of your portfolio, it's a good idea to apply to Disney and not to apply to say, Arenanet. Likewise, if your portfolio is full of realistically rendered fantasy paintings/3D models/Animations, apply to Arenanet but do not apply to popcap. If you want to make games like Halo, work on stuff that matches their art style.


If possible, talk to the recruiters from your dream companies and figure out what they want in a portfolio. Every company/recruiter is different. A recruiter friend of mine specifically says he does not prefer the ‘demo reel’ format for animators but rather prefers a bunch of individual videos. That way he can click through and look at each animation in detail. Some companies however only accept one video edited together. Ask and do your research… That is big!


**How you brand yourself – and how you talk to recruiters - is really important.**

What should you **DO** when you talk to a recruiter?

**DO** ask questions – recruiters are often loyal and passionate about their companies, the positions they’re hiring for, and are more than willing to talk with you about the important stuff.


**DO** treat recruiters with the professional respect they deserve.

**DO** make your website/resume clear and to the point. The faster a recruiter understands what you do and who you are, the better.


**DO** your research. Ask the recruiter what they want, especially if you see a booth for your dream company at GDC or PAX. Have a 15 minute conversation with them. If that’s not possible, try and find a contact email online.


**DO** ‘reach out’ to recruiters. Let them know you’re interested in their company. Even if they’re not hiring for someone like you right now, they might in the future so make that contact early on.


There’s a long list of DON’Ts when it comes to personal branding and dealing with recruiters.


**DON’T** try to manipulate recruiters. I once overheard an HR recruiter ranting about a particularly manipulative candidate trying to use a contact at another company as ‘leverage’. By this I mean the candidate was implying that if the recruiter’s company didn’t hire the candidate, the candidate would jump to the competing company. It was clear that the recruiter felt that if a candidate didn’t want to work for her company she would just 'show them where the door was.' Ouch!


**DON’T** try to use ANYTHING as leverage. You’re junior. You’re new to the workforce and don’t really have much to leverage. Especially don’t try to use things like your gender as leverage. It won’t work. If you put ‘woman game artist’ on your resume you will get laughed at. Likewise, using contacts at other companies or really anything as leverage will get you thrown out. Recruiters care about your team skills and portfolio and not much else.


**DON’T** waste a recruiter’s time. They don’t have a lot of it.


**Most companies in game development hubs hire artists on contract, and/or do contract-to-hire. There is a good reason for this.**

There are exceptions, but most companies in the area hire a good chunk of their employees as contractors and hire potential FTE's on contract at first to test the waters with them.

Contract-to-hire makes sense for companies and for the potential hire. It gives everyone a few months to 'test the waters'. The new hire can see if they like working at the company or if they hate it there and would be happier elsewhere. It also gives the company time to see if the person is productive, easy to work with, and able to do quality work. It's win-win all around.

Though, it is naïve to assume that all contractors are contract-to-hire. Big companies staff using contracting services to get their head counts up. They bloat with contractors during the big production phase of game-making and then let go most of their staff. This, in many ways, isless cruel than hiring a bunch of folks on as full-time and then just firing them at the end of the production cycle like some smaller or mid-sized companies do. I've meet industry vets who have experienced this exact thing and it sucks way more to go full time to laid off in a day than to expect your job ending in 6 months. At least then you have time to prepare.


**Companies do not hire degrees, or the schools you got them from.**


While having a degree is important and a prerequisite for getting a job at some companies, the most important thing recruiters look for is skills. It's important to remember that having any other school ‘name’ on your resume will not get you hired. You will get you hired. If your skills are lacking anywhere, you need to supplement your skills and push yourself to be a better artist.


I hear alumni from my college blame the college for their lack of employment. All colleges have their flaws, but if you don’t have a job, keep working and bettering yourself until you get one.


**Get yourself into the talent agencies databases, befriend recruiters, and maintain an open dialogue with them - get SEEN!**


When you get laid off it's good to know recruiters. They will help set you up with opportunity (but as I said before, YOU get YOU the job.) Add the recruiters on LinkedIn. Add them on Facebook, too. Pester them. Remember they get PAID when they match up talent like you with the right job, so it's in their interest to talk to you and hire you.

Also, it's worthwhile to regularly check job posts on these sites and to post your resumes on them, though there is no recruiter working with you;


* http://www.gamasutra.com/jobs/
* http://creativeheads.net/
* craigslist (yes craigslist, I have found some great jobs through there)


Mostly, get yourself VISIBLE any way possible.


**Working as a 'free intern' is illegal and a scam but is an option for the desperate.**


I couldn't afford to work as an unpaid intern. It's scammy, it's bad, it's gross, but some companies will do this instead of doing 'contract-to-hire' to test out new employees. I know of at least 3 folks from my year that got hired this way. Take a job like this at your own risk.


**Do not worry about 'offending' or 'annoying' a company.**


Apply everywhere, at once. Interview at multiple places. If you get a job offer and are interviewing at other companies, stall on signing it. It's perfectly OK to sign one job offer and then tell a company you're interviewing with that you took another offer. They have other candidates lined up.


I've met more than one person who interviews at a company and who wait to hear back from that company before applying elsewhere. Companies can take several weeks to get back to you. Keep applying.


Also, if you don't hear back from a company for 1-2 weeks, there's no harm in emailing them. You won't 'annoy' them. An email once a week/every two weeks shows you are interested and that you want to work there. Also, if they find an email every two weeks 'annoying' then is that really the kind of place you want to work?


**Your Network'**


**‘Networking’ does not mean collecting a stack of business cards.**


People are under the impression that they can go to GDC, collect some business cards and that is 'networking.' That is NOT networking. Networking is meeting some folks at GDC, talking with them, partying with them, Facebook friending them and building and maintaining a friendship. A ‘network’ is an ongoing relationship with people you meet during your professional career.


You have been networking the entire time you've been in school. Your network is your graduating class, the upperclassmen you knew before they graduated, the underclassmen that will graduate in a year or two, and any coworkers or colleges you have after graduation.


You have been networking the entire time you have been in school. You could think of college as an $80,000 four year networking event. People WILL remember how you performed in a class. Whatever you do, don't do a bad job on a team or piss off a TA or turn in work that's less than you are capable of because you WILL leave a bad impression. Your graduating class will remember you for how you performed and they will not want to recommend someone at their companies if they remember you as a bad student.


**The two most important kinds of people you meet are other game artists/designers/producers/developers and recruiters.**


Meet people who make games, and people who hire people who make games. Make friends with them. Ask them questions. See if you can glean some of their experience. Talk to them about their projects; these people are PASSIONATE about what they do! They are often cool and approachable. Don’t be shy.


When you lose your job (which will happen) your network will help you get employment again. Be sure to branch out. Don’t just make friends with people who specialize in your field; befriend professionals of all stripes. If you’ve been hold up in your ‘art lab’ your whole career in school and there are programmers/designers/producers to meet at your college, you’ve been doing it wrong. Go make friends.


**You have a job. Now what?**


As a contractor or a full time employee, I CAN say to ASK QUESTIONS. Always ALWAYS ask questions. Questions like:


*	Am I meeting your expectations?

*	What am I doing right?

*	What do I need to improve on?

*	What is the duration of the project and my contract? Likewise; will there be need for my services longer than the duration of my contract? (The best time to ask this is after you get an offer or early on. Make sure you ask the right person this; ideally someone in an administrative role. Your ‘art lead’ might not be sure. Establishing this early is ideal.)

*	My project is wrapping up soon. Are there other projects at your company you think I’d be qualified for? (Again, ask this to someone in an administrative role. If you’re working through an agency, ask them too.)


When performing your job:


*	How do I do ______? (you are junior, better to ask how perforce works before you break something…!)

*	What reference should I use? (If the client isn’t sure, look up your own concepts/reference and send them to him or draw your own.)

*	When do you want this done by? (Get a deadline, or offer an estimate.)

*	I’m halfway through animating this. How does it look? (Don’t be afraid to show unfinished work.)
*	I’m close to finishing. How does this look? (Always always always get feedback!!!)

*	I made the requested revisions. How does it look now? (Revise, get feedback, revise again!)

**Make the best work you can, then revise it and make it better.**


Self-explanatory. Revision -&gt; feedback -&gt;; revision will only help you. Ideally, get feedback from lots of people. Different artists might show you cool new workflows. A non-artist might pick up on something they don’t like, and point out something the others missed. Anyone can be an art critic, so value all input.


**Be your ideal teammate.**


Think about the best teammate you could possibly have. Now be that person. Show up on time, be friendly. Ask questions. Work hard. When you screw up, apologize and work hard to fix that mistake. Ask more questions. Get feedback. Make a finished piece you’re proud of, then get feedback on it and revise it. Put in your hours.


One of my favorite old teachers gave me a great piece of advice that I try to take to heart: “Every day of your life, be the very best version of yourself you can be.” When at work or school, put in 110% into everything even if you don't enjoy doing it. Never, EVER do a sub-par job on anything – or do anything sub-par to another person. Never be a person you would be ashamed of, or produce you work you wouldn’t be proud of. You will be remembered for how you performed.


“You're only as good as your last project.” My friend who is a recruiter told me this. It's completely true. Hiring managers will look very critically at your work and if you have anything 'weak' in there it will be called out. If you are a game company and you produce a game that doesn’t get a super high average score from reviewers, it could mean the end of your company. It’s really brutal out there so try to be on the top of your game.


NEVER tell someone you don't like them, even if you think they're a completely dysfunctional human being because they might get hired at a company you want to work for one day. I've made this mistake before (telling someone I thought they were a dysfunctional human being) and although it hasn't bit me in the ass yet, it still might one day during my professional career. These days when I think someone is a totally dysfunctional human being I try to keep it to myself.


**Prepare for when you get laid off.**


This just happens. The game industry is chaotic at best. One day you will walk into work and you will no longer have a job. EVERY senior person I meet has some kind of ‘yeah I got laid off’ story from some point in their career.


*Horde money.*


Also, when you do get laid off, it isn't likely because of something you did. Money dries up. Goals shift. Projects get cut. Some higherup thinks their assets should be utilized in a different way. Commonly, a game ships and there's just not enough work to go around anymore. It's not your fault.


**Don’t be afraid to leave a crappy job if a better opportunity arises.** 


After leaving the small outsourcing house I went to go work at a huge company as a student-hire, doing character animation for a kids browser MMO. I took the student-hire offer because I was desperate for a gig being unemployed and all, and they said they usually hired their student hires on full time. Everyone called me an intern while I was there and asked me questions like how school was going, the producers micromanaged us, and the art director wanted to keep me on at $18 an hour as a contractor for the next year after my student hire position was up. Also, the tech artist and art director seemed to think I was mentally challenged going by how he talked to me; I felt like I was talked down to constantly. Pretty much all of my concerns were dismissed rather than treated as valid concerns. Needless to say, when a headhunter called me and asked me if I wanted to interview for a FTE gig doing FX on a AAA game in another state I leapt at the chance. Now, I have a real FTE gig doing benefits and I really love my coworkers/job. Everyone here is very friendly and not in the least bit condescending and the game is AWESOME, much more exciting than the social kids MMO I was working on. 


**Managing life after school**


Manage your money carefully. Ideally, build yourself a safety net.


My total net worth, counting all student loans, credit cards, checking + savings and my IRA is around -64,000. Cool, right? My minimum student loan payments are around $700/month.


I would like to save enough so I can live comfortable for at least 6 months and pay my student loans without worry. In order to do that however I'd have to put away around $900 a month over the next year or so which I simply can't do while paying so much towards my loans. I can probably do about half that much. I am currently at DIMG for the next six months, but being that the game industry is turbulent at best I can't realistically count on being hired at the end of that six months.


I utilize mint.com to manage my finances and it's been a lifesaver. I know how much I owe and how much I have, and I can build budgets on it. It's great. I really recommend the service.


My back-up plan if I am unemployed for longer than 6 months? Ask Grandma if I can move in with her and go into deferments or forbearance on my loans as necessary.


**Take care of yourself.**


I've been bad about this one. I've gained about 15 pounds in the last year. I don't work out anymore. If possible, eat healthy and exercise. It will affect your energy levels and mood in the workplace.


Recently I’ve started taking vitamin D supplements + multivitamins and that has definitely helped me feel better overall. I think the lack of sunlight has had an effect on my health.


**Take care of your personal relationships.**


Call mom, call grandma, call dad. Better yet, visit them. Go out with friends. It's good for your mental health to get away from the computer for a while. If you have a significant other, try and spend time with them – even when you are crunching. Having a dinner with them when they haven’t gotten to see you all week will be worth more than all the email messages and texts you can send.


**The professional world is way better than art school.**


Your own measure of personal success is the most important ruler to hold yourself against. Satisfy your own goals and don’t worry about satisfying anyone else’s view of who you *should* be.


Art school is mentally torturous. This is a fact. By now you have almost all of your ego beaten out of you, and along with it a lot of your self-worth. When the dean of the art department comes in and says your artwork falls short of the 1 yard line, don’t take it personally. Your own personal measure of success is way more important than anyone else’s. And anyone who expects junior artists to make mass effect 3 in 4 months – who expects SEINOR artists to make mass effect 3 in 4 months – does not have a good grasp of modern game production processes. Unlike major game companies, students don’t have a huge overhead or months of time for pre-production.


In the professional world, nobody (so far) has told me I’m a total failure that will never get employed. Every professional I have met has been encouraging and helpful. The real world is nothing like art school, it is hundreds of times better.


You will stumble. You will trip. But it’s not nearly as scary as people make it out to be.


**Remember that you are not your career.**


In school there is a big push for you to get a job. If you don’t get one right away… Don’t beat yourself up over it. It’s OK. Relax. You have your WHOLE CAREER ahead of you.

It's easy to get depressed and to take it personally when you get rejected or are unemployed for a length of time. Your professional self is not the same as your 'real' self. Once you learn to separate your professional self from you as a human being it's easier to take rejections in stride and handle the mental stress of unemployment. YOU have not ‘failed’ if you are unemployed.


**Keep growing. Never stop.**


Paint, animate, draw, model. Grow. Go to the art museum. Draw people in the park. Go to life drawing. Whatever you do, don't stop growing weather you are employed artistically or not. You are poisoning yourself, your artistic abilities, and your professional life.

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[What are the most interesting combinations of customers and objects have you sold?  What would you say is the most difficult aspect of your job is?  Most hated toy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xrb7c/im_a_female_who_has_worked_at_two_erotic/c5oxmel?context=5)|Most Interesting combo was an older lady came in and bought a hefty amount of BDSM gear, you go girl!  Most hated you is hands down the squeel wheel, it's so poorly made and expensive it's an Insult to toys. 
[Have you ever caught your boss doing anything perverted relative to being in a sex shop?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xrb7c/im_a_female_who_has_worked_at_two_erotic/c5oxmel?context=5)|Honestly the hardest part of my job is working with shy people, I can't help you rock your house if you don't give me the knowledge I need to help you!  Promotions to key-holder, management, not a career job for sure. Unless you count the chance to go into porn? 
[Have you ever caught anyone going at it in the fitting room?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xrb7c/im_a_female_who_has_worked_at_two_erotic/c5oxmel?context=5)|Strictly enforced 1 person per fitting room, so no. 
 |I've never witnessedy boss or any other employees doing anything dirty, besides trying on some corsets while we were dead.
[Hey the guy who stars in the Pirates of the Caribbean porno went to my high school! He's our most famous graduate, sadly...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xrb7c/im_a_female_who_has_worked_at_two_erotic/c5pjpj7?context=5)|Dude that's awesome!
[*trying on some corsets while we were dead.*  Whaa?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xrb7c/im_a_female_who_has_worked_at_two_erotic/c5oxynq?context=5)|Lol that was phrased awkwardly, what I meant to say was: when buisness was slow we'd try on corsets.
[How do you approach shy people that do go shopping in your store? What are some strategies you employ to letting them open to you about what they are looking for sexually?  What would you say is the average age of your customers?  Do you get more women or more men? And what would you say each sex buys most often?  Thoughts on Fifty Shades? Has there been any video spoofs yet? Do customers come in asking for it?  What do you think are misconceptions that people have about what you do, and how a sex shop runs?  Working in a sex shop id imagine you are fairly knowledgeable in how to make sex more fulfilling and meaningful. Would you say that you can clearly see the advantages in your personal life? Would you say your sex life has improved since starting to work there? Have your partners ever commented something along the lines?  Your industry seems like it's constantly trying to create new things, from sensations to aesthetics. How do you guys keep up with the constant influx of new products?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xrb7c/im_a_female_who_has_worked_at_two_erotic/c5oxvqu?context=5)|I was/still am pretty shocked by how little people know about sex and their own bodies!  I think many people think you have to be part hooker or crazy sex fiend to work in a sex shop. To be good at your job (IMO) you need to be knowledgable inthe human body, sex and the human mind and be able to relate and bond with customers. Because of my ability to do this I had many regulars that would only come to me for advice. 
[What has surprised you the most about your job? That is, what views did you have on the sex shop industry before working there compared to after?  What are some pet peeves that you have about your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xrb7c/im_a_female_who_has_worked_at_two_erotic/c5oxvqu?context=5)|I think it's for sure opened up doors in my sex life, it for sure hadn't hurt it by any means, my boyfriend while I was working there was a little vanilla so we didn't get into much products but the other tips and tricks I picked up he for sure appreciated.
[How do your parents feel about what you do? What about your friends? Significant others?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xrb7c/im_a_female_who_has_worked_at_two_erotic/c5oxvqu?context=5)|Pet peeves are people who offer me money for sex, and like most retail stores: asking for discounts!! No you're not that cute, I know it's expensive, I'm not risking my job.
 |My mom doesn't really care sometimes when she sees and ad for something she'll ask me questions. Friends think its hilarious and don't understand how I do it. Significant others didn't really care if anything kind of a perk. 
 |It's like Christmas day getting new stock I love receiving new items learning about them and such but creating the display for all of it is a complete bitch! 
[Why is the platinum bullet the best?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xrb7c/im_a_female_who_has_worked_at_two_erotic/c5p81cm?context=5)|IMO, it's the best out of the bullets because instead of just 3 click speeds you get varied speed which coincidentally gets you more power for your buck. I also found they broke down A LOT less often then the regular bullets which are VERY cheaply made if we got a shipment of 100 bullets at the very least 30 wouldn't work. plus it's got a glowing light in the top.....it glows....that's awesome!  
[As a girl with zero vibrator experience, could you elaborate on the platinum bullet? Also, any recommendations on a good ""beginners"" vibe? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xrb7c/im_a_female_who_has_worked_at_two_erotic/c5p668e?context=5)|[This but the longer one](http://www.amazon.com/PowerBullet-Platinum-Variable-Speed-Wireless-Waterproof/dp/B002Z7FOBG) It vibes but isn't clunky for a beginner Some women find it awkward using a toy for the first time so I recommend starting small working your way up, plus this toy is versatile you can pretty much do whatever you want with it!  The butterfly kiss platinum I linked somewhere is also great concentrates in G-spot and clitoral!
[Guy here, when I come in with my gal on a quiet night they have a tendency to try the corsets on me instead.  Forcefully. Ish.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xrb7c/im_a_female_who_has_worked_at_two_erotic/c5p0hel?context=5)|You also deserve a cookie! nothing like a man willing to go outside his comfort(ish) zone.
[Can you please link to this product? I'm finding different ones with the same name.  Yeah, they seem to be built-to-break. They do this so you keep having to buy them. Three have broken on us and we aren't violent with them, heh.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xrb7c/im_a_female_who_has_worked_at_two_erotic/c5pamm3?context=5)|Not sure what e-commerce is to be honest. I promise to link later!! 
[I'll eat the cookie once I can breathe again. Ayyeeee!  Turned out I have an hourglass torso naturally, every time they see me in there I get dragged into being a model for something or other. It's fun, can't complain!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xrb7c/im_a_female_who_has_worked_at_two_erotic/c5p0mcm?context=5)|Work it then!! I always wondered how guys felt in corsets..
[What was the ballsiest customer you ever serviced? like he or she just walked in and was like ""i want to have a huge fucking object rammed inside my dick hole"" or something really off the wall that was requested?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xrb7c/im_a_female_who_has_worked_at_two_erotic/c5oxgaq?context=5)|Probably the ones that outright asked me to have sex with them, or this one guy who came in and said ""I need something to fuck my wife! My dick ain't doin it! I'm not sure if I should get something that makes me dick look awesome or get something so fucking big it destroys her"" again hard to keep my jaw attached after that deceleration. My reaction was pretty much ""well sir I have just the wall for you!""
[You recommended he fuck her with a wall?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xrb7c/im_a_female_who_has_worked_at_two_erotic/c5oxvas?context=5)|The wall of vibes!! 
[He fucked his wife with a wall?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xrb7c/im_a_female_who_has_worked_at_two_erotic/c5oxvez?context=5)|Wall of vibes!!
[I like how you abbreviated vibrators like the sex shop community has inside lingo ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xrb7c/im_a_female_who_has_worked_at_two_erotic/c5p0l9r?context=5)|But we do, we are special!!
[So did he get something to make his dick look awesome or something so huge it mangled his wife's pussy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xrb7c/im_a_female_who_has_worked_at_two_erotic/c5p4271?context=5)|He got something on the bigger side, and it was black, he was pretty amused by this.
[Did you ever catch people having sex/masturbating in the store? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xrb7c/im_a_female_who_has_worked_at_two_erotic/c5oxc44?context=5)|Pretty small stores so we keep a keen eye out and a strict 1 person in change room policy. We get couples who are quite entangled in each other while browsing but we mostly find it cute.  Did have a regular come in a buy a pocket pussy once, came back 2 minutes later asking to purchase a condom because he wanted to try it out while driving home without the clean up. He then stopped looked me over and said ""you changed your hair, it looks really nice."" then made his way out, I'm not sure what happened after :s.
[He probably thought about you, at least a little, in the next few minutes...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xrb7c/im_a_female_who_has_worked_at_two_erotic/c5oxo5x?context=5)|Yeah, I'm strangly good at ignoring these thoughts.
[*came back 2 minutes later asking to purchase a condom because he wanted to try it out while driving home without the clean up.*  Why would he need to explain it with so many details? ""One condom please"" sounds quite enough for me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xrb7c/im_a_female_who_has_worked_at_two_erotic/c5oxwag?context=5)|I asked myself the same question, I guess we'll never know.
[You have a changing room??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xrb7c/im_a_female_who_has_worked_at_two_erotic/c5oxnpg?context=5)|We do for lingerie!
[I want a pocket pussy too.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xrb7c/im_a_female_who_has_worked_at_two_erotic/c5p6txf?context=5)|Go for it!
[Probably a mild form of exhibitionism?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xrb7c/im_a_female_who_has_worked_at_two_erotic/c5p0ql8?context=5)|Very possible!
[He was trying to get you interested. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xrb7c/im_a_female_who_has_worked_at_two_erotic/c5p4olc?context=5)|I think you just wanted you name to show up here, didn't you? Didn't you!
[I still find it weird that people try on lingerie.

 |Strangest  May sound boring but this guy would call me every shift I had for like two weeks straight. He would ask about what Dom equipment we had, and that he's getting his gf (a powerful executive) to get dragged to a Dom/sub party in a leash accompanied by her two interns. He'd explain the story everytime he called and say he was coming the next day or so because he's currently out of the province. He would never come in, the whole thing was just odd.
 |Funny This guy came in a couple times asking about lingerie then finally told me it was for him and he was recently exploring his want to lead a female life. Being interested I would ask about why he wanted to do this and what hardships came from it. I guess he'd gotten pretty comfortable with me and one day opened his phone and asked my opinion on his outfit. It was him in a nurses dress with his finger in his mouth. I found it pretty damn funny at the time. 
[Oh, wow. I don't know if I would've been able to not giggle at that photo!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xrb7c/im_a_female_who_has_worked_at_two_erotic/c5owj1n?context=5)|I got pretty good at hiding my reacttions, out loud I was telling him he looked great on the inside I was like ""dude...dude is wearing a nurse outfit and posing...LOL!"" 
[That leads me to ask this - what was the first crazy thing (that you remember\) to happen to you on the job?

It's pretty hard to choose from all the stories so many crazy stories for different reasons.  Here's one: about a week into my first time working in a sex shop  a male/female couple came in looking for a strap-on for her to use on him. At the time I was pretty noob to things like this and didn't realize girls used strap ons with their male SO. Boy did I learn quick lol but for sure was an interesting event for me.
[Hahaha, oh man! I bet you could literally talk about these stories for hours.

 |Strangest movie I ever sold: hmm our delivery guy used to pick some weird ones out for us, but I'd have to say ""chicken and bitches"" the cover was literally black males eating a KFC look a like bucket of chicken all greasy with women bent over. I laughed pretty hard but it was pretty damn racist.
 |Discount:I got 25% at my first store and 50% at my second.
 |Most embarrassing moment: I am pretty hard to Embaress, my most ""caught off guard moment"" was a woman came in buying some toys and lingerie for her massage job, friendly enough girl told me how she'd gotten breast implants. I asked her how the surgery went and the general ins and outs (haha) she kept saying how real they felt and told me to touch them....me being curious I gave a poke and agreed they were squishy. She announced I hadn't even felt it properly pulled down her shirt and put my whole hand on her boob. Took a lot to not act really shocked by it.

I have good questions but i suck at responding to their question even though i'm totally prepared for what they're going to ask.

I feel as though i have no reason to tense up and get as nervous as i do. I speak 3 foreign languages, have great references, good GPA, was really involved in college, and i'm totally qualified--maybe even over qualified--for most of these unpaid internship to ""get my foot in the door."" 

Reddit, toss me tips, advice, and something to get my confidence up. I just feel really shitty and hopeless. 


(Edit)
Also, i'm tempted to email one of the interviewers i had last week and ask for advice. What do you think of me doing that? How should i phrase it? I was thinking along the lines of:

Hi XYZ,

I'm assuming since I have not heard from you that I didn't get the internship. 

I was hoping that you would be able to give me some feedback as to how to improve my interviewing skills. I would greatly appreciate it if you were tell me what I did right and what I did wrong during the phone interview so that for future interviews I may find success. 

Again, I want to thank you for your feedback and having had the opportunity to interview with XYZ.

Thank you,

xumwz,2,2012-08-07,Preferred EDA?,spm5276,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/xumwz/preferred_eda/,"Calling all EE's/CE's.


At my internship this summer I've been using the PADS suite from Mentor Graphics to do schematic and PCB layout work. It gets the job done. That is it did until I learned how much we were paying for 1 license (the company I work at is small). That 1 license is hardware locked to a USB dongle. 2 to be precise.


Now I HATE this software. I think I spend more of my day fiddling with making the software work the way it was designed to than I actually do designing. Here's a few of my gripes.

* Cumbersome menu 

Often I have to search through multiple toolbars (which are all hidden by default) to find the most essential functions. The more I use the less of a problem this becomes. Also try adding a sheet in schematic without going to help docs, go on I dare you.

* Component movement

Moving a component automatically snaps the 'origin' point of the component to the mouse pointer. So if you're trying to align the tops of components nicely on a sheet, and you right click -&gt; move, bam you've got the bottom of the symbol. Now your symbol is out of place and your net wires look like hell, usually requiring you to zoom out and return the part to where it was. This is particularly a problem with long (or wide) component symbols.

* Part creation


PCB model creation is minimalist. You get lines, circles, and rectangles. Thats it. Creating a curved line is broken at best. If you're not using a standard package this is a pretty frustrating part of the process. You also can't move an entire shape, only sections of it.


* Library Management


My absolute biggest god damn complaint with this software. I have wasted HOURS trying to manage my parts in the library and getting them to update properly in the schematic and the layout. After updating a part, running the 'Update From Library' command literally does nothing 50% of the time, even though the part has been changed and saved..multiple times. ECO's from schematic to PCB practically never work, and I have to drop a new part in the PCB layout then rewire the schematic and delete the old part. The properties of the part do not show the library its contained in, so trying to search for a specific part to edit is guess and check.



There are other minor nuances that exist within any software so I can deal with. But these are functional issues which are just...awful. I'm convinced the software I'm using is in beta and we got gipped. One thing I here over and over again is that PADS has advanced auto-routing algorithms that we require, but we don't do super advanced electronics work. The auto-routing does work very well, but not any better than Altium from my experience. There is not a single thing about this software that makes me go ""Yeah..I like that."" The interface is outdated and many of the built in tools simply don't work. All of this comes a huge pricetag.


I am a fledgling circuit designer, but I am thinking of getting into analog circuit design although I know its a dying profession. I have used Altium and the NI Multisim/Ultiboard package in the past but I have used PADS the most. I don't really have enough experience in Multisim/Ultiboard to comment on its usefulness although I know that the general perception is its bad and should feel bad. Altium is tough to learn but I like the look and feel of the program more, I'll be designing more advanced circuits with it this upcoming semester. 


So in closing, what's everyone's favorite EDA and why? Also, am I being pedantic or are my complaints legimate? Does anyone else use PADS that would like to provide their own tips and tricks on how to use it more efficiently?"

I think I've made myself pretty useful in my first month(I've developed a tool to help the other programmers, I've done some research on some new technologies to be used in further developing of our projects) since my boss decided that my internship will end sooner and I'll start with a full contract like the others. 
However, I discovered that he's offering me about 25% less pay than others, even though I will be doing the same work, the same hours. The thing is, the amount of money they are given should be confidential but they told me because we've been friends long before being colleagues.
How do I ask for the same salary, without letting him know that I know how much the others are being paid?
**TLDR**: Boss is offering me 25% less than the other employees and I don't know how to ask for more without letting him know that they've breached the confidentiality of salaries....

xu1gb,0,2012-08-07,"Regarding Parenting, Where Is The Line Drawn Between ""Controlling"", And ""Abusive""? ",HelicopterParents,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xu1gb/regarding_parenting_where_is_the_line_drawn/,"In light of popular recent posts and some of my recent experiences, I'd like to walk you through the scenario that is my life, in hopes of helping many other people in my situation. 

This is a story 21-years in the making, but I'll try to keep it simple and avoid a wall of text as mush as possible. 

Some personal info that will help you understand the scenario better:

* 21 year-old male
* Entering my 4th of 5 years in undergrad 
* Oldest of 5 kids
* Highly educated parents/high income 
* My home is only about 20 minutes from my university

Let's turn the clock back a few years... I'm off to my first year of college, extremely excited to move out of my house and experience some independence, just like any college-bound kid my age. It was understood that despite my family being of high income, I would be responsible for covering part of my college cost (so that I would ""take ownership"" in my education, which I respect of them). We agreed that my parents would cover my academic related expenses (tuition+books), and I would cover my room/board expenses. Sounds like a good deal to me. Now me, being a 17-year-old, had no way of paying for my room/board out of pocket, so my parents and financial aide officers helped me take out the necessary loans, and it was understood that I would pay for all of my room/board expenses via subsidized loan, which would leave me with about $50,000 debt upon graduation (which I was fine with, because that amount is certainly manageable). 

Fast forward to my sophomore year. I'm living in the dorms again after being home for the summer. November rolls around, and I acquire what is called an ""MIP"", which stands for Minor In Possession Of Alcohol (a misdemeanor), and follow-through with all of the necessary court proceedings, then move on with my life, nbd. While I understand the severity of it, I am also aware that these things are handed out like candy on college campuses, I moved on. Shortly after, I was paid a surprise visit by my parents who informed me that they would no longer be paying for any of my college expenses as a result of my misdemeanor charge, which they had blown way out of proportion. So, now I'm responsible for paying 100% of my way through college. I put my tough guy face on, and was determined to do it, as people before me have come from much worse situations and managed to get through. I was determined not to be an entitled brat or a pussy. 

End of sophomore year, I move home for the summer. June rolls around, time to take out my loans for the upcoming academic year. Now instead of a $10,000 loan to cover room/board, I need to pay for ALL expenses, so I try to take out the necessary $25,000 loan. Time for my parents to cosign the loan. I approach them with the correct information, and was informed that they would not be cosigning a loan any larger that what was required for tuition+books, meaning that I had to move home and commute to school. 

Junior year begins, I'm living at home and commuting. I'm thinking ""Home isn't that bad. I have a nice bed, good food, etc..."". Then, things started to get weird. Now as I mentioned above, I'm 1 of 5 kids, meaning there are 7 people living in my house. As you can imagine, this makes my homework environment extremely unproductive. As a result, I begin staying in the university library every night until about 2:00 AM to study (thus avoiding the lack of productivity that is home). My parents don't believe me, they think that I'm out partying and such while I'm studying. I begin to receive an excessive amount of call/text (every night) asking for confirmation of where I was. Sometimes they even wanted a current picture of me in the library as proof. Sometimes when I come home, I see that my mail has been opened. Sometimes when I come home I see that my room has been searched. Keep in mind that I'm 21. 

So, basically I'm a university senior who lives at home due to shrewd dealings on the part of my parents. My belongings are sorted through. They need to know where I am, who I'm with, etc... whenever I leave. They utilize the ""my house, my rules"" phrase whenever I try to argue the above. I'm forced to sit through church ever sunday and pray at dinner (I'm a man of science). Control is being used and abused. My parents and I are constantly bickering about stupid/unimportant shit. When they have nothing to bicker with me about, they'll bring up something I did YEARS ago and initiate an argument about that. Or, we'll resolve/conclude an argument, yet they'll bring it up again a few days later. It seems to me that they feed off of arguing with me and each other. My dad is a great dad, but he's basically just my mothers puppet. If my mom were out of the equation, my father and I would have an awesome relationship. I think my dad secretly knows that what I'm going through is wrong, but he can't stand up to my mother. My mother is like some sort of evil, controlling mastermind. 

You're probably wondering why I don't just ""get up and leave""... Well, despite no longer paying for my academic expenses, the parents still pay for my dad to day expenses such as gas and clothes. 

Why don't I have a job? 

* I have a very prestigious internship, but unfortunalty it's unpaid. Still, you'd be a fool to turn this internship down. I need this for my future. 
* Even with a summer job, I wouldn't be able to afford to move out

Do my parents act like this with my younger siblings? No

So reddit, are my parents just controlling and strict, or am I being abused? I know there are tons of people in similar situations who are wondering the same thing. 

What can we do? Do we just have to wait it out until we graduate and can financially support ourselves? Trust me, as soon as I'm self-sufficient, my parents will be getting a big ""fuck you"" followed by me ceasing all connections with them for a very long time.

What experiences does Reddit have with this difference in outlook?",ImFlamtastic,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xtwv5/idealist_vs_realist_what_experiences_does_reddit/,"This is more of a series of questions that cover a broad topic.
Today while I was at work I was emailing a coworker. Now we're both temporary interns that get paid decent money until the end of the summer when we both get back to work. We had an intense argument about whether working our asses off at this job was worth it or not. 
His viewpoint was that by working hard you're helping those around you, and even though you may not get a raise or a promotion or even a permanent job at work you're still getting results whether you see them or not.
My argument was that I didn't want to work in this establishment regardless, I could get my work done without giving 100%, and my work would just get done eventually if I didn't finish. 

I figured the rigidness in our argument and the staunch, immovable stances we each took was due to the fact that he was raised an idealist, and I was raised more as a realist throughout childhood through our environment during that period. 

My questions are these:
Which outlook do you most identify with? What advantages and disadvantages do you see with either one? Is one outlook particularly better than the other? Was there ever a circumstance  you encountered that focused on this conflict we see every day (often without realzing)."

I have also been applying to internships to no avail and would even do some voluntary work to get me started in the industry. Since then I have been working part-time to keep me going but this work will dry up in the coming months so I really need to get my act together.

I had no real trouble with the CCNA itself and really enjoyed practicing labs and setting up different configs, I was not too keen on some of the theory though and would definitely consider myself a practical person when it comes to learning.

I would like to hear peoples thoughts and opinions on furthering my Cisco/IT certifications and what would be most likely to benefit me in getting started in a career.

A lot of people seem to suggest CCNA Voice as a good follow on to CCNA and this seems to be because of the popularity of VoIP and UC these days. I have read about the exam and topics but would like to hear from people who have attempted or passed it. How long did you spend studying for it? Maybe compare it to the CCNA itself in terms of time; theory vs practical content; any equipment required. (I used GNS3 for ALL of my CCNA study, I was given a switch by someone but alone it wasn't much use)

I would also be interested in CCDA or CCNAS if anyone had any similar info on this and what direction it took you in.

CCNP seems like the general way forward so would I be better to do this rather than specialise? I have all the material for CCNP and it looks like it is a big undertaking for something I may not really use in the future, depending on the position I end up in.

TL;DR - Have CCNA, can't find job. Opinions on CCNA Voice, CCDA, CCNAS and CCNP as the way forward.

I am doing all the ""right"" college things- I participate in extracurriculars associated with my degree, I'm minoring in Mathematics, I have a 4.0 in my major and very close to that overall. I enjoy the math and programming, read supplemental material, and try to do whatever extra coding I can (Project Euler, for instance).

That being said, I'll be 30 when I get my degree, with no practical experience in the field. I've managed a convenience store while I've been in college; it's helped my pay my bills, but doesn't look so great on a resume. 

My school is a large public university. I go to a regional campus. We are under one large accreditation, so my degree will be from the main school, but I lack a lot of its resources. The professors here don't have the facilities to do much research, so assistants/aides are in low demand. Also, I've had trouble finding ANY internships, much less ones in my field. 

For one last kink, my fianceé is about to pursue her Ph.D. We will be moving out of state shortly after I finish my degree, and I am taking a heavy class load to keep on that schedule.

With all that, I just need some advice on getting started. I'll be a good bit older than a lot of my competition, with no real-world experience under my belt. I've read a lot of posts here and gotten some great ideas, but I feel like I'm stuck in a bad situation. Is not getting an internship a serious blow to my career? Are there certifications or projects that would make getting a job easier? At this point, I'm just looking for anything remotely related to the field so I at least have something to put on my resume.

As the title suggests, I've got a few questions/concerns about my current situation. I'm not sure what kind of answers I'm looking for, but I guess I would just like to hear what other people think.

But first, some background (I apologize in advance for the wall of text):

So I'm 22 years old and I graduated high school in 2007 and went to a large private university in NYC as an engineering major. I didn't really take it seriously and would skip class, so my GPA wasn't that great. Some (in retrospect, trivial) stuff happened with a girl during the beginning of my sophomore  year which bummed me out a lot and my already poor grades slipped even further and added to my unhappiness at the school.

I transferred to a trade school and took 2 semesters of Automotive Repair classes, which were fun and interesting, but ultimately not what I wanted to do with my life. The good thing about those classes was that they boosted my cumulative GPA up enough that I was able to transfer to a college in the CUNY system.

I've been in this school for 2 years and I switched majors several times because I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. In addition to that I continued to not take my classes seriously because I'm wasn't interested in most of the material, and the professors are mostly part-time and don't seem to be of very high quality, AND most of the students don't seem to want to be there either.

Last year I finally decided that I wanted to seriously get into programming. I've always loved computers. My parent's didn't work with computers but my dad had one since I can remember and we always had computers in the house growing up. I tried several times throughout my youth to pick up programming, first in VB 5 and later in C++, but I could never stick with it I would always give up and decide to just play games instead. 

Summer of 2011 I made the decision that I was going to study programming and it seems to have stuck this time. I thoroughly enjoy programming. I took an Intro to Computers and Programming course last Fall where we looked basic C++ and an Object Oriented Computing class this past spring, also in C++.

**Now here is my main problem:** My school specializes mainly in Criminal Justice. It doesn't offer a Computer Science major. Instead, they offer a BS in Computer Information Systems in Criminal Justice and Public Administration. Required courses include Advanced Data Structures, Programming Languages, Operating Systems and Computer Algorithms. They don't offer many related electives, and then you pick a specialization either in Public Administration or Criminal Justice. They don't require more than Calc I.

Now I'm not really sure what field of CS I want to go into or what sort of career track I want. But will I have a hard time finding general software development jobs with such a specialized degree?
Another concern of mine is the quality of my education. Last semester, my OOP course was supposed to cover Classes, Operator Overloading, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. We covered Classes and barely covered Operator Overloading, didn't even mention the last two. We've also had no assigned projects over the past year. A few (I can count them on one hand) ""Write me a function that does this"" or ""Write me a class that does that"" small assignments, but that's it.

I haven't had any internships and I've worked odd dead-end jobs, completely unrelated to computers, throughout my time in college. If I stay at this school I will graduate in 1.5 years. 

However, I am thinking about transferring to another school within the  CUNY system that actually has a Computer Science major with classes that seem interesting. If I do transfer, I may be adding more time to my graduation date, depending on which classes transfer over, however I would reset my GPA which would be good because it's not very good right now. I don't currently have any loans and these schools are relatively inexpensive.

**TL;DR:
So I'm not sure what to do. Am I overanalyzing things? Should I just stick out my remaining time at my current school and use the internet/my free time to supplement my knowledge gaps? Or would it be beneficial to obtain a proper CS degree, which would allow me to graduate with a higher GPA anyway, even if it takes me longer.**

Yes, I know that it is my decision and no one can make it for me. That doesn't mean I can't ask other people's views/opinions/advice, and I would greatly appreciate anyone who takes the time to say anything at all."

Graduated last year, in December. Due to some issues with family and other stuff I didn't really start looking for a job until around march or so. 

Now, problem is - I graduated from what's pretty much a no-name university. They taught me the basics, and I enjoyed it for the most part, and did well for the most part. But I know I'm years if not more behind other graduates, as no one stressed how important stuff like internships was to me until after I graduated. 

Since March I must've applied for dozens of jobs, anything low-level and relating to programming. Internships, QA/testing, etc. Anything that was offered towards people with little to no experience, and I haven't gotten so much as a ""thank you, but we're not interested"" email or call. 

So now: I'm throwing myself at your mercy. Here's my resume:  https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B2AdmMvnmQEUSkJYeVZ4VTJYMGM

I know it seems pretty empty, but there's not much more I could put on there. I've been applying for IT jobs lately, which is why I added the ""Computer Maintenance"" section. Ignore formatting as that's something that was lost in the transition to the web. 

Finally, I'd like any suggestions as to what kinds of things I should be doing while I try to find a CS-related job. Anything. I'm at a loss as to what kinds of things I should be teaching myself. 

TL;DR: I'd love some critique on my resume and some advice on what kinds of things I should be studying for a CS-related job. "

xsqn9,2,2012-08-06,What am I doing wrong? (Graphic Designer) Please Help!,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xsqn9/what_am_i_doing_wrong_graphic_designer_please_help/,"Hello everyone. First post here, and I'd love some constructive advice as to what I'm doing wrong and why I can't find a steady job after 2 years of looking slightly and 3 months of serious looking. I've had a couple interviews in which I feel like I do well in, however I have yet to get a job offer. 

I graduated with a bachelors degree in Graphic Design in 2011 and I've been doing freelance work for multiple companies ever since. My resume was hard to design and work on because of this issue and I feel like that may be the only reason I'm not able to find a consistent job. The only reason I've been job jumping is because the jobs that I've held didn't offer me enough pay/hours to support myself so I was forced to find another. 

I feel like I have a pretty diverse portfolio and skillset including web design, so I'm not exactly sure what I'm doing wrong and why I'm having such a terrible time finding a full time position that offers more than $10/hr. I've applied to plenty of positions and usually apply to around 3-8 a day and I have kept up this for the last three months. 

I've come across some crazy design positions. One position I got an interview for was 30-35k a year, no overtime pay with hours M-Thurs 7am-5pm and Friday 7am-8pm (or later). I would have taken that one if I had gotten it just due to the fact that I need some job, but I've even seen worse. There are plenty of jobs for unpaid internships (30+ hrs a week) that REQUIRE a bachelors degree in design. I would really love to know how the hell they expect someone to pay student loans on working 30+hrs a week for free. Doesn't make sense to me.

ANYWAY. Here is my website with my portfolio and resume which you can browse around on and tell me what the hell I'm doing wrong. 
http://www.nwestbrooksmith.com

Also, I always write thank you letters for interviews and change my cover letter and resume for every job I apply for. I got picked up by a recruiter, had one meeting with her, then never heard from her ever again regardless of how many times I try to reach her. I wear professional clothing to interviews (usually black pants and a nice shirt with a black blazer) and I bring my portfolio which includes 6 of my best pieces of work that are diverse and yet impressive (imo anyway). 

Thank you for everyone that can help me figure out what I need to improve on. I really really really appreciate it and NEED to find a full time job. "
xsmlf,6,2012-08-06,"A lot of parents will do anything for their kids, except let them be themselves.",sofaralone,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/xsmlf/a_lot_of_parents_will_do_anything_for_their_kids/,"I have felt suicidal on and off for several years, but I've put it off by telling myself that things will get better eventually. I don't think they will anymore. Sadly, I wasted my life away feeling depressed and alone. Especially the past 6 years. It should have been so much better. I'm 24 years old now with no direction in life, and no motivation to improve. I think about suicide every day. This is long, so sorry about that. If you're interested, here is my story.

My relationship with my parents growing up was not good. My father had a very bad temper and his verbal and at times physical abuse at an early age was traumatic to me. My mom was luckily there to intervene a lot of times, but she also has a lot of the same views as him which didn't gel with who I was as a teenager.

They are both doctors, from India. There was a lot of pressure to perform well academically, get into a good college, and major in either medicine or engineering, something professional that would lead to a good paying, prestigious career. My father was obsessed about me doing well on the SAT exams, and didn't give me any choice in the matter of what to study in college or where I would go. He based this decision purely on what his sister-in-law (a HS guidance counselor) recommended.

The main thing I was really interested in growing up was music. I loved the energy and excitement I got when listening to music, and started playing guitar when I was 12. I spent a lot of time teaching myself to play when I was growing up, and I got good at it, and felt that I could grow up to be really good at it. I knew that it was what I wanted to pursue, but when time came to talk about what I would do in college, he said ""absolutely not music"". He doesn't give any value to music and would belittle me about this thing that I cared so much about. ""How much money have you made playing guitar? You think you're so great?"" He really beat me down about it and made me feel worthless. Fine. I would go to college to study what he wanted me to study, engineering.  At least I would be away from him, right?

My first year of college sucked. I was in a small, heavily monitored freshman dorm, surrounded by assholes who bullied me (who would do stuff like take a hat I was wearing, run off with it and light it on fire), and studying engineering, which really didn't appeal to me. I only had 1 friend who would regularly hang out with me. On my 19th birthday, in February, I was so depressed from all the bullshit these assholes were putting me through that I smoked pot in my room rather than going outside, and got in trouble for that. I knew there was a good chance I'd get in trouble, but I didn't care.

I saw a therapist for a few times after that because I told the school I was depressed. And that was helpful. I ended up doing a lot better for the rest of the school year. Made good friends towards the end who also were into skateboarding, art, and music and generally seemed like the cool hippie kids I wanted to know the whole time. Things were looking up, I was going to live with a friend who was awesome, and finally be happy, right?

Then during summer vacation, I had gotten accepted into another school closer to home, which I had applied to transfer into around the time that I got caught smoking weed. I gave it some thought (not enough though) and decided to transfer. Why? Too many bad memories. Thought I'd benefit from a fresh start. This is a major regret in retrospect. I lost a lot of really special friends that I never had a chance to have real solid friendships with. I think part of me wanted to leave because I thought they'd be happier without my awkward presence… which is sad to think about because I now know it would have been fine. They really did like and care about me.

I started sophomore year at a new school. I changed my major from engineering to economics. I never enjoyed economics, but I thought I could get through it and it would be enough of a 'practical major' for my father. I don't even think I brought up studying music because I knew how he'd react, as he was already butthurt that I quit engineering. So it was a compromise for the sake of my father, again. I should have made a better switch than to fucking economics though, since I never wanted a cubicle job and I never cared about stocks or anything like that. I never met people in my classes that I got along with. I made friends through my initial living situation who remained my friends throughout college, but I always felt like an outsider. I was always the one calling someone else to hang out, never the other way around. Going to parties wasn't great because when asked ""what's your major?"" and then saying that it's economics and I don't like it doesn't make you a fun person to talk to. The interaction often ended there. Super lame. So I never fit in. I never had a good, fun, living situation in college, spent the last year alone. Never got laid at all the whole time in high school, college, or since then either. Never felt the warm embrace of a girl. Never loved by anyone.

After college, I eventually got a shitty internship that lasted almost a year, mostly just entering data on a computer for $9/hr. Living in a condo with my brother, paid for by my parents, in a part of the city that I never wanted to be in, away from my friends and surrounded by people that I can't relate to. I was in a band though, so that was good. I hung out with them a lot and for the first time I was putting the time and work into music that I wanted to, rather than just noodling alone in my room. It was fun.

This past winter though, I decided I needed a change, the job was boring as ever and the band was slowing down… So I moved across the country to live/work in the mountains. I had a great time there overall, snowboarding every chance I could. Had good friends and roommates. Didn't make much money though due to a slow winter/lack of work and instead of keeping the adventure going, I came home in May.

Things were initially good when I came back. One thing that was nice was that I finally looked like I wanted to, more or less. I've always been really thin, but I put on a little weight, and the face was looking good. Also, I finally had the nice long hair I always wanted to have growing up, instead of a 'bullshit phase' messy afro type thing I'd usually have… since my dad would always make me cut it off. 

About 2 weeks after I came back, I went to a party after some friends of mine played a concert and things seemed to be going well that night. There was even a cute girl who I think was interested in me. Unfortunately, I drank a lot that night. I don't remember exactly what caused it, it could have been a few different things, maybe overall sadness upon reflecting on my own college experience and/or the need to go to sleep. Anyway, I got really upset and decided to leave the party. It was really childish. I got my longboard and tried to skate all the way home… several miles away in the middle of the night. Yes, I should have stayed/taken a cab. Instead, I fell hard and hurt my face. It looked bad initially, deep cut below my eye and scrapes on my forehead, but It could have been much worse. I was a couple millimeters away from probably losing my eye. Now I have a small dark scar under my eyelash which I've come to hate, especially given how I got it. That event catapulted me into a really deep depression. I was planning on starting to work a restaurant job the next day, had to call that off. I stayed at home with my parents for 2 weeks while my face recovered.

I came back to living with my brother and was getting more and more depressed. Thinking about suicide constantly while pacing around the room, barely eating, looking at the mirror. To the point where I couldn't concentrate on anything else. I wrote a letter to my parents basically telling them I'm close to ending my life and why I felt this way. My dad called the next night while I was at a friends house to yell at me… told me you're coming home tomorrow, and you're gonna cut your hair (of course). So the next day, I came home, my mom gave me a shitty haircut, my dad yelled at me some more, and my mom tried to comfort me. At this point I felt inconsolable. There is nothing that I felt would be worth it to live for. I got admitted into an inpatient psych ward for 5 days in June, then an outpatient program for a few weeks. I thought I was feeling better. I had a plan to go back to college to pursue music therapy and told the people at the program that, which they thought sounds good, but I don't really know if that's what I want to do....

To be honest, I still feel like ending my life just as much as I did in the beginning of the summer. I've thought for years that I'd kill myself around this age.. I'm not doing anything productive these days. Can't find a job. Still barely eating. I'm addicted to masturbating, too. I sometimes waste hours a day doing that.  Seeing other people being happy makes me more depressed. My friends in college who are living exactly how I wanted to live. I could have thrived if I had that opportunity. I feel like every time I hang out with someone I say/do something really dumb that I beat myself up over, especially since if I do kill myself, they'll inevitably be thinking/talking about me and the stupid things I've said/done. So many people have embarrassing stories about me. I feel embarrassed about how I've lived these last 6 years… this was supposed to have been the prime time of my life, what have I accomplished? My mother cares about me a great deal but after all that we've been through, I still feel the same- hopeless. I feel bad to keep putting her through this torture. My dad doesn't even speak to me directly anymore, he says ""he's your problem"" to my mom. He's a big reason in why I've ended up like this. If there's anyone that I'd be happy to hurt emotionally by killing myself, it's him.

xwd16,337,2012-08-08,Had a technical phone interview today for an Entry Level Software Engineering position and nailed it.  Here are the questions they asked:,Slims,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/xwd16/had_a_technical_phone_interview_today_for_an/,"I thought you guys would find this useful.  

The position is in a really great medium sized software company that uses Java as their primary development language.  This was my second interview (first was with HR, this one was with an engineer).  

1. What kind of data structure would you use to hold an arbitrary amount of objects in which retrieval is not an issue?  

2. Follow up: what are the advantages and disadvantages of using a linked list over a dynamic array structure? [good time to talk about Big-O performance]

3. Describe the main properties of a binary search tree.

4.  What would happen if you inserted a sorted list into a binary search tree?

5.  Follow up: how can you avoid this problem?

6. Say you want to retrieve from a data set a person's name based on an alphanumeric ID number.  What kind of data structure would you use?

7.  Compare a hash table and a map type structure and their big-O performance on various common functionality (search, insert, etc.).

8.  What is the worst case retrieval time for a hash table and how can this happen?

9.  Briefly describe object oriented programming and it's main principles (MAKE SURE TO SAY: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, (and abstraction if you want)).

10.  He specifically asked me to elaborate more on encapsulation and polymorphism.

11.  Why is polymorphism useful?

He then asked me if I had done any multithreading, which I have not, and if I've worked in SQL, which I have done a little. For SQL questions he asked:

12. What is a join and an outer join? 

Despite not knowing 12 and not doing any multithreading, he told me I did great and they immediately gave me a time for the final on-site technical interview.  

I think my situation is unique and many budding programmers will find my profile interesting/helpful in context:

I have a BA in philosophy from the University of Michigan, with about 20 computer science credit hours (no minor).  C++ is my main language.  They very much like C++ people.

On my resume I put the projects I've worked on, what concepts they taught me and put it all on github and put the github link in my resume.   I've also done an IT management (no development) internship at a very large corporation.  I have a 3.1 GPA. 

I've spent a LOT of time outside of class programming on my own and hammering in concepts that I may have missed by not completing a full CS degree.  

That is all.  Hope you guys find this useful.  Wish me luck on the final interview!"

Advanced C++ didn't feel *Advanced*. To give you what we went over in the *Advanced* course:
  
 * Bits, Characters, C Strings, and structs
 * Standard Template Library
 * Custom Templatized Data Structures

Now, I delve from time to time into /r/programming, and in my journeys though that subreddit, I often come across things (jargon, concepts, and sometimes syntax) that I have never seen or heard of. And I wonder to myself, ""Where do people learn this stuff?"" and ""What am I missing out on?"".
  
  
  So my question is: where do people go to learn past college, before employment in the field? Books? Friends? Hobby work?
  
  3 years into learning languages, and not once have I had an instructor tell us how to build and publish an application as a standalone .exe.
  
  And I'm currently studying to get my Bach. of Science in Software Engineering. Given my location (midwest), it's hard to find an internship position."
xw2cq,0,2012-08-08,Underage Drinking Citation...,ricefarmer912,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xw2cq/underage_drinking_citation/,"Hi Reddit,

*Sorry to do a repost of the same exact question but I figure I'd want to get a different group of answers at this time of the day to see what I should do.*

19 year old living in Pennsylvania and I have been recently caught walking around a neighborhood under the influence with a few beers in us with a friend while trying to run away from the cops that busted a party we were at.  We claimed ""we're out for a walk"".  The cops breathylzed us and sent us back to the party house stating ""You cannot drive back home tonight, here are your citations.""

The citation explains that I have consumed alcohol along with my friend.  We were written up for underage drinking which includes possession, transportation, or in my case, consumption.  However, this was NOT ""public intoxication"" or ""disorderly conduct"".  

The citations that we were given were identical to the ones issued to the others that stayed behind at the party.  **Does this mean we're in ""deeper"" trouble relatively than the others?**  The fine asks us each to pay $23.50.  We have 10 days to respond to plead guilty or not guilty.  All of us have agreed to plead guilty to avoid any court fees or anything of the sort as we are soon heading off to college. **Is this the right thing to do for all of us to avoid the worst of it?**

I'm 19 so I'm certain my parents won't get notified or anything in the mail.... **right?**  This is the first time I've had to deal with anything like this and I would just like to know what the proper thing to do is.

I don't feel like getting lawyers and other court situations involved.  Also, I ran across [this website](http://fairlielaw.net/practice-areas/underage-drinking/) while researching and wanted to know if any redditors can confirm if what this site says is true.  There are TONS of sites for different states and different scenarios on what should be done.  Is it true I can get this expunged or erased like the website says when I turn 21?

**Also, I plan on trying to get interviews and internships in for my sophomore year in college, how will this all be affected?**

**TLDR: Got caught with underage drinking citation.  What are the correct steps in terms of this citation to avoid the worst of everything?**"
xvz0c,3,2012-08-08,"reddit, I really need some growing up advice if you would be so kind.",kingbarnabyjones,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xvz0c/reddit_i_really_need_some_growing_up_advice_if/,"Hello, so im kind of stuck in this predicament and have no idea what to do. I am a recent college graduate majoring in Health Administration. Two days after graduation, my girlfriend of a year and half broke up with me. After all the drama, me and her decided we were going to take things slow and try to fix things. Well pretty much nothing has changed and we are the same minus the title and the every now and then awkwardness. Anyways its coming to the end of the summer and I have a choice to be made. They are as follows:
1. Stay in the city where my parents live and try to find a real job. The kicker is I was recently convicted of a drug offense felony and do believe noone in the Healthcare industry will hire me, I am lucky that I got the internship where I currently work as it is. Also, as I am not from this city I have almost no friends here and think I will be miserable if I stay.
2. Move back to the town where my college is. This is also an issue as rent is expensive as well as other things. The good things are I do have a decently paying job there, so until I find something better this would be a decent source of income. Also, I still have alot of friends there as well as this will be where my ""girlfriend"" will be.
3. This is an either or: I could possibly move back to where I am from in Chicago where I still have alot of highschool friends who live out there. Problem is, it is quite expensive, and a job and place to stay are not garanteed like the previous two. This is also something I would have to plan and can't just pack up and do. OR: I have the possibility of moving to Hawaii where my mom lives. I cant even imagine how awesome it would be, but again no job garanteed as well as pricey. I also lived with my mom my entire life until after I graduated from highschool. It was pretty miserable living with her, but then again I havent seen her in almost 4 years and alot has changed. Another issue with these two topics is my probation. I would have to go through the lengthy process of getting it transferred and thats not easy or guaranteed either.

I cannot lie. Most of this boils down to the whole ""girlfriend"" issue. I was legitametely going to propose to her not long after I graduated from college. Now things are kind of awkward and different but we still hangout alot and act like we are dating for the most part. My issue is I feel like the main reason I would move back to my college town is because of her. Thats a pretty big sacrifice, as my dad would have to help me out with this, and us getting back together isn't even guaranteed. But I know I would be miserable living with my dad in a different city not too far out, and would go crazy thinking about what is going on, especially with no friends. The way I see it is it comes down to me living with my dad being miserable or being in the college town and witnessing our demise first hand. At least I would have friends for support though. 

I have no idea what to do? Please help? Let me know if you have any other questions as well.. Thanks"

xvwj0,9,2012-08-08,How to ask for a paid position?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xvwj0/how_to_ask_for_a_paid_position/,"In April of this year I started an unpaid, part-time internship with a very small non-profit organization (only about ~25 employees in total but we recently have been getting a lot of exposure and are consistently growing) that is supposed to end at the end of August. About halfway through the summer, my immediate supervisor quit and since then I've gained lots more responsibilities and they still have not hired someone to take over her position. Most of the job requirements (updating social media, sending donation thank you letters, updating the CRM system, etc.) are things that I'm pretty sure many of the other employees don't know how/don't want to do so at this point I feel like I have some leverage. I have no problem with the workload, but the commute is a bit much for me, especially when I'm going to be starting classes at the end of the month so I was hoping I could somehow weasel my way into a paid part-time position (preferably paying better than minimum wage), otherwise I don't really see the point in sticking around.

So basically my questions are:

* Is this unreasonable to ask of a small non-profit company? 
* What would be a reasonable hourly wage to ask for? I was hoping for about $10/hr but I honestly don't know what should be expected. I'm in Philadelphia, if that helps.
* How do I go about this discussion? I feel like it's kind of rude to be like ""Yo pay me or I'm leaving"" but that's pretty much how I feel about it. Is there a basic guideline to do this or something?
* When should I ask them? August is over in a few weeks, should I ask them right before my internship is over or do it ASAP?

Thanks so much!"

:--|:--
[Is Disneyland still infested with feral cats?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5pq8h6?context=5)|Yes, there are still feral cats (hundreds actually). Disney actually finds homes for kittens and when one is found, they are spayed or neutered. 
[See anyone get fired for an easy mistake? I guy I knew was down there and took a dollar tip and got fired. I think he worked at one of the food courts.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5pqkwj?context=5)|This is a pretty good one: Whenever a celeb was in the Magic Kingdom, if they wanted to ride Splash Mountain (which I worked near), they would close off the lines and then allow them to entire from a back entrance. We saw SO many celebrities do this and got really excited whenever we could tell that one was in the park. Some of the celebrities I watched go down Splash were Peyton Manning, the Obama girls, most of the Star Wars cast, Mariah Carey, Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, Michael Phelps, and pretty much any athlete or entertainment star.  One time, they went through the routine...and in Disney fashion, we got all excited about watching a fave celeb plummet down Splash.  Yeah, you can't take tips there.
[Oh god. JB is such a douche. As someone who works at Disneyland and had to deal with him a week ago, he's pretty entitled. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5pxcug?context=5)|Yeah my manager dealt with him last year at the Christmas taping. Gawd...
[What was your worst on the job experience?  Funniest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5prxsx?context=5)|Worst job experiences were helping guests to propose to their girlfriends and then being turned down. WDW is the most popular place in the USA for proposals! Funniest for me (but probably not you guys) is that there are SO many people from different countries that visit who are truly perplexed by the English language....but you should see the look on their face when they go from talking to my co-worker and his STRONG Bronx accent to myself and my strong southern accent. It's like clockwork. Not funny to anyone else but me, I'm sure.
[P.s. I have a tremendous amount of respect for the cast members.  I get a raging headache from all of the screaming children when my family goes to disney, and I can only imagine the stress that you are under.  So, I think I speak for everyone who has ever been to a disney park here, thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5prxsx?context=5)|Thank you for the respectful compliment :) It's a difficult job and not paradise as many like to think. One of the biggest compliments Disney receives is how polite and gracious cast members treat guests.  I wish I knew more about Imagineers. My boyfriend's brother is in digital media and asks me a lot about the animation stuff too, which I also wish I had taken the time to learn more about at Disney U. One thing I can tell you is that I have heard that one of the additional things you can choose to do when visiting WDW is having ""Lunch with an Imagineer"" and guests only told me WONDERFUL things about it after they did it.
[Im going to disney this month any rides i should go on??  Ive been to disney a lot since i live in miami but haveny gone in like 3 years.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5qho7n?context=5)|Disney World or Disneyland? I'm guessing you mean Disney World...if so, which parks are you going to?
[What is your favorite/least favorite part of working in the parks? Is there a particular time of year that's less stressful (ala, in the fall when the crowds die down from the summer rush\)? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5pq7wg?context=5)|January- The first week is nuts...the next few weeks are really great. Excellent weather, even cold at times. And the parks close relatively early so it was always fun.
 |February- a lot of the cheerleading/dance groups come...another one of my favorite times of year even though those groups could get complicated at times. The parks aren't very crowded and it was one of the best months to do personal touring.
 |March- Big sports fan here so I LOVED atlanta braves spring training and ESPN weekend....crowds start to pick up around the middle of the month.
 |April, May, June- Easter weekend was always hellacious. Believe it or not, May and June really aren't that bad. I would even argue that the first few weeks of May were some of the best crowd wise. As a Star Wars Fan, I LOVED SWweekends!
 |July and first few weeks of August- SO hot, so tiring, guests get extremely frustrated during this time. My bday is 4th of July so that was special (especially at EPCOT)...there was a huge difference between the second week of August and the third week of August: it marked the end of a long, hot summer and the crowds began letting up...
 |September, October- Very comfortable and crowds were very light until the Halloween festivities became more intense. Halloween was fun there but didn't compare to Christmas. Worst thing about September, maybe even the only negative, were the horny little love bugs that mate EVERYWHERE!
 |November- FAVORITE MONTH. light crowds...When I vacation at WDW in the future, I'll probably always go around the 8th of November. Perfect.
 |Christmas- My second choice of time to visit when I return as a guest will be the first of December. Big difference between the 16th of December and 17th of December in the parks. Christmas is truly magical there. Sounds cliche, but I didn't believe it until I did it. I saw Neil Patrick H at EPCOT, there were few crowds the first week of December and the Osborne family lights at Hollywood Studios...wow, I could have spent hours there (and did!) Christmas week to New Years were probably the worst that I spent at Disney, to be honest. Crowds were awful, guests could be very rude and impatient, and it was difficult to move, even in your own place of business! 
[How are the two parks different in your opinion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5prfvh?context=5)|Great question. I probably prefer WDW because I am partial to EPCOT. WDW is also more of a ""resort"" place where although the biggest competition is ten miles away at Universal and Sea World, you can actually get lost in the town of Celebration. Disney's Magical Express can pick you up at the airport, put you on a NICE bus, take you to a Disney resort, and you don't leave until they take you back to the airport. It's business genius.
 |Disneyland is more magical for me. Walt saw DL come to life and a lot of his personal touch is there. I love how WDW's EPCOT and Hollywood Studios pay homage to Walt and his passions but it saddens me that he never saw any of it except for the land :(
 |Cool fact: Disneyland will fit into Disney World's Magic Kingdom's parking lot!
[Have you even been to the ""secret"" Club 33 at Disneyland?  What cool ""special people only"" venues are there?  Is there an analog to Club 33 at Disney World in Orlando?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5pubcm?context=5)|I can't talk about it.
[Understandable but they have too many TV specials with 'behind the scenes' footage now days that goes into depth about Club 33 it's hardly off limits discussions.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5q6zfa?context=5)|A lot of the stuff that goes ""behind the scenes"" is very informative...but I expect that if someone is asking about this in the AMA, they are also able to find this info...anything more than that (which there is a lot more than that) I am unable to speak...and thanks :)
[How do you get to stay in that room up in the castle at Disney World? Iv always just wanted to see it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5prsq4?context=5)|No one stays there anymore. There was a little over a year where they did  ""a year of a million dreams"" and a cast member chose a random family or person that was in the right place at the right time and let them go in the castle when the park closed and go to their bedroom. I have heard stories, seen pics, video, etc. and the coolest part was that you got to be up there during Wishes fireworks and watch the night shift go to work cleaning the hell out of the that park which is amazing to watch....in the mornings they got complimentary breakfast with Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore, and Tigger at Crystal Palace :) But now its just available for private tours.
[Why did they stop?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5pv56g?context=5)|They have higherups at Disney stay there sometimes now as well as celebrities. Rumors change often about it...last I heard, knowing the right people and having 20-30k will buy a night there.
[What are your favorite easter eggs in the park?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5prota?context=5)|Haunted Mansion plates and belt in Carousel of Progress!
[Donald Duck vs Goofy. Both armed with a 15 cm blade, separated by 10 meters. A 9mm gun lies at the 5 meter mark with a single bullet in the chamber. Who wins? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5pqckf?context=5)|DONALD!
[I've heard that employees at Disney come from all over the world and live in their own little spaces about the park.  Does everyone get together well?  Is it a huge hook-up fest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5pqpo8?context=5)|No one lives ""in the park."" The college program students live in a few different apartment complexes off site. The college program is actually extremely strict. There are separate male and female complexes and strict rules about visitors. There are high security measures everyWHERE! Everyone does get along well, but there are cliques just like anywhere else. Many people told me it was a big hook-up fest but most ""cliques"" occur based on where people work. I have been told that many of the ""characters"" party but the majority of male face characters are not really into the female face characters....if you feel me.
[Do you have a good, public, mental-breakdown story you'd be willing to share with us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5prmrz?context=5)|Hmmm...the first job I had there, my job was basically to gather all of the trash in the place and take it to the crazy trash disposal system in the Magic Kingdom. Without telling too much, I seriously thought I had entered the twilight zone and wanted to go home so badly. I was so homesick. Not a good story, but honest. 
[Oh, I was thinking more along the lines of guests, but wow. It never occurred to me how taken-for-granted theme park workers are.

It was Peco's Bill and there was a big taco salad bar and a lot of people would bring in paper plates and just make salads off of the bar and there was nothing CMs could do about it. After this 90 year old man saw a few non-Americans doing this and he just spent 25 dolllars, he walked up to my sister and dropped a gazillion F-bombs and went off on her...and being the Disney employee she is, she could only smile and apologize. Parents around us were horrified.
[Who was the most exciting/interesting person you ever met? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5pqsgu?context=5)|The vice prez of Pixar!

What would you say is the best job you could have there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5pr5ou?context=5)|I can't really say the kind of jobs I have.   Best job you can have would probably be, in my opinion, a server in one of the restaurants like Tony's or the steakhouse in Canada. I also think it would be nice to do guest relations in Grand Floridian or Polynesian.
[How do you feel about other amusement parks after working at the world's greatest?  Can cast members ride after hours?  Edit: Favorite ride in each park?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5pr5ou?context=5)|There are several days that are ""blacked out"" from going to any of the parks but no one would want to anyway because it's like Christmas Day  and you can't move in there!
 |I love all amusement parks. Going to Dollywood tomorrow.  They actually don't regularly keep the park open after hours for us. A big misconception is that people get off work and then go ride rides. You are so exhausted after the heat and the crowds, plus you have to completely get out of uniform, then find your way to an entrance to go on stage that it's not worth it and not many people do it.Newac1234 is right...most cast members go on their days off. However, after awhile, no one really does that either as transportation sucks sometimes and you really just want away from PEOPLE most of the time, especially tourists.
[Thoughts on Brazilian tour groups? I swear to go they're are at least 10 at the same time with groups of fifty people.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5pv2wh?context=5)|I just laughed out loud .
[Any secret things in the parks not many know about but should?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5pthe3?context=5)|There are tons. Next time you go, take one of the ""Keys to the World"" tour. I think a lot of people should know about the Utilidors but they don't...I've talked to a lot of people who are like ""You know what? You never see any cast members in a Tomorrrowland uniform in Fantasyland!"" and guests can only name a couple places where they see cast members actually leave ""stage"" to go ""backstage""...I guess a lot of people don't know that there's a Subway and food court underneath the Magic Kingdom....or notice that we never come around to get trash out of trashcans...because it's taken away magically :)
[Disneyland or Disney World (which do you prefer\) and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5pt2pq?context=5)|Hmm...that's difficult. Disneyland is more ""magical"" for me as it's what I pictured Aurora's kingdom was like when I was a little girl. But because I visited Disney World 18 times before I worked there, it is embed with a lot of family tradition for me.
 |As an occupation or college program, Disney World for sure. Tens of thousands more employees and its more like its own private little town.

As a former CP I know what goes on.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5prs5i?context=5)|I had a roommate that was completely obsessed with harry potter and she was very anti-alcohol and I would come home from B-Dubs (wednesday nights, remember!?!?) and she would be on the couch glaring at me while watching the Deathly Hallows and trying to find a ride to Universal the next day.
[That's it?  Wow, that was my average day on the CP.  I guess it is possible for some people to have a somewhat normal program maybe?  I woudl literally write a novel with stories you wouldn't believe from the sounds of it.  How about a roommate of mine who was an ex-con(yes he had a jail ID\) knock up his girlfriend on the CP, and on their day off they went and had an abortion.  When they walked back in he said, ""Hey, we're back.""  My sarcasm over ruled my good judgement and I said, ""Aren't you missing someone?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5pv7ws?context=5)|That's not it...but I have CP friends and ex-roommates that I'm friends with on Reddit so I'm going to hold back :)
 |Keep in mind too that I didn't start my programs until after I had gone to 3.5 years as a total sorority girl at a MAJOR southern university...so everything also seemed pretty tame in comparison hook up and party wise.
[Have any tips for not going crazy hearing the same songs from the rides all day? Totally waited in line way too long for the ""It's a Small World"" ride and the song will forever repeat at least 3 times in my head when someone starts singing it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5ptpkk?context=5)|I've had a few jobs at Disney and one of the worst for me was in Frontierland where I saw the same parade two times a day and another parade two times per night. I memorized the music and it was terrible. Funny enough, when I went home I bought the CD on amazon because I missed it.
 |I have had friends that have worked Small World. Imagine that!
[Have you ever been to Disneyland Paris?

[Was there a lot of hookups between the cast members?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5pr6rg?context=5)|There are hookups everywhere, in any job IMO :)

Most common CP roles are transportation, costuming (entertainment), character attendants and sometimes characters (after audition), retail, janitorial, and quick service food (Not even food servers). You may be able to find a non CP internship if you know the right people though! :)
[Any dirty gossip on any of the characters getting in on behind the Pirates of the Carribrean ride or anything like that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5pr053?context=5)|I've heard stories. Keep in mind that many of the characters are opposite genders than their characters. I have only heard of one or two guys ever being Mickey Mouse. If you want to hear about some ""antics"" look up Cast Member Confidential or Dark Side of Disney on Amazon.
[Why are the actors opposite genders of their character?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5pz4ku?context=5)|Abgleich is right. The mice, chipmunks, etc are usually females because females are smaller in stature.
[I just got back from a trip to Disneyland!  There are thousands of people who visit the park. I was thinking that people must get sick, pass out, or even die.  How does Disney handle this? I've been to the park many times, but have never seen any paramedics or anything. Do they keep it under cover?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5pvhbg?context=5)|It's its own operation. A common myth is that no one dies on Disney property. That's not true, but they are very professional. There are often stories in the local papers of things that happen at Disney, however. I do have a few stories that either I experienced or a roommate/friend/family member did that would blow your mind about things that have happened in the parks.
[I visited Disney world, it was incredibly hot out, I watched some of the workers in Donald and Goofy outfits, the first thing i thought was how hot it must have been in there. so what was the worst part about working at a place like that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5pt2sd?context=5)|Those costumes are terrible I hear. The worst part for me is cultural differences. For example if you ever return, notice how no cast member ""points""...we all use more than one finger to ""point"" to  a general direction as Disney is big on cultural considerations and not offending different traditions....
 |I am from the South so it was a big culture shock for me when I realized that people can just be plain mean.

If you go the ""Disney Honeymoon"" route and let them do all the amazingly cute things for you, it may get up to 2 or 3,000. Last time my boyfriend and I went for fun when he came to visit me, if you add in the park tickets that we didn't pay for, we probably did it for 700-800. If you want to go on a budget, look into the Art of Animation Resort. It is brand new and still opening sections every few months. What month are you going?
[How do you feel about the pin trading? I am really into it and wonder how a CM actually feels about it. I swear I am staring at your lanyard and not your boobs!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5q05wu?context=5)|I personally pin trade. I worked at a Pin Trading station for several months and we were obligated to trade. We actually HAD to trade if someone asked (with certain regulations, of course). I got some really cool ones....I love it.
[It's clear you don't actually want to say anything interesting because you're for real. It's this annoying catch 22 where you can't be completely candid with us for fear of professional reprimand, and we can't expect anything interesting from you unless you have that threat. So with that in mind, please tell us the most insanely controversial shit you've experienced. Things that were blatantly unethical/illegal that disney encourages or allows, things that are terrifying or disturbing about the culture or the people, etc. etc. I noticed that your only response to the brazillain question was that it made you laugh out loud. This tells me you've got some opinions you don't want to make public about them. How do different ethnicities act on average(Obviously poor white people are gonna act worse than rich black people, but there's some things you learn to notice\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5pwxlp?context=5)|Okay. So, one time there was a Cinderella who was doing a meet and greet. The family finally got up to her and the man started going into cardiac arrest or something (don't know specifics). She had been a lifeguard a few years earlier and began performing CPR. A few hours later, she was fired because ""Cinderella wouldn't know CPR""....I had a huge ethical problem with this and really questioned the company at this point. How's that?
 |And I really don't want to say anything about certain countries or groups...that's a personal line I don't want to cross just because of how many friends I have that I work with from so many different cultures.

[Did you do both college programs for WDW and disneyland? if so which did you prefer? was kind of thinking about joining one of them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5pvvyl?context=5)|Yes, I did both CPs.....they were both wonderful and very different. Disneyland CP is very exclusive. For spring, they only took in state. For fall, most of us had already been CPs at Paris or Orlando...some from Tokyo. I would do WDW first!
[Is the walt disney company really that evil?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5pv478?context=5)|Nah. Depends on who you ask, but they have as loyal of employees as any. The pay isn't great but the benefits are a big sell to many employees as well as the company itself. My sister makes 80,000 a year now as a Target marketer and she tells me at least once a week that she'd do anything to go back to near-minimum wage at Disney.
[What did you get payed at disneyland?  I have asked, they cannot tell me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xuo5p/i_worked_at_disney_world_and_disneyland_and/c5pvkwm?context=5)|I really can't talk about it for the sheer fact that a few people have my reddit name that I don't want knowing.

[I love Disney (I'm a huge dork, going to WDW in the fall with my boyfriend\).  Although, I was wondering, how do you react to people who have the 'Disney is the root of all evil' perspective?

19 year old living in Pennsylvania and I have been recently caught walking around a neighborhood under the influence with a few beers in us with a friend while trying to run away from the cops that busted a party we were at.  We claimed ""we're out for a walk"".  The cops breathylzed us and sent us back to the party house stating ""You cannot drive back home tonight, here are your citations.""

The citation explains that I have consumed alcohol along with my friend.

The citations that we were given were identical to the ones issued to the others that stayed behind at the party.  **Does this mean we're in ""deeper"" trouble relatively than the others?**  The fine asks us each to pay $23.50.  We have 10 days to respond to plead guilty or not guilty.  All of us have agreed to plead guilty to avoid any court fees or anything of the sort as we are soon heading off to college. **Is this the right thing to do for all of us to avoid the worst of it?**

I'm 19 so I'm certain my parents won't get notified or anything in the mail.... **right?**  This is the first time I've had to deal with anything like this and I would just like to know what the proper thing to do is.

I don't feel like getting lawyers and other court situations involved.  Also, I ran across [this website](http://fairlielaw.net/practice-areas/underage-drinking/) while researching and wanted to know if any redditors can confirm if what this site says is true.  There are TONS of sites for different states and different scenarios on what should be done.  Is it true I can get this expunged or erased like the website says when I turn 21?

**Also, I plan on trying to get interviews and internships in for my sophomore year in college, how will this all be affected?**

**TLDR: Got caught with underage drinking citation.  What are the correct steps in terms of this citation to avoid the worst of everything?**"
xv49u,4,2012-08-08,The Backroom,amblerina,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xv49u/the_backroom/,"This summer I decided that I would spend my time doing something other than sitting at home alone; as I always felt uneasy with the corridors and empty rooms around me. Therefore at the beginning of the summer, I applied for an internship at a bakery. However, there were plenty other girls(and older women) trying to work there, so I didn't feel that I had a very good chance at being hired.
It was somewhat out of view, in the downtown, older part of the city. Across from it's left was the old post office and in front of it across the street was a bank. It was quite a small building and didn't appear frightening at all at first glance.

A week after applying, she called me in for an interview. I came and answered her questions, as well as askeing her a few that I had in mind.
The next week she called me, telling me that she had chosen me. I was so excited, I had never had a job before, so it was almost euphoric that she had chosen me, of all people, to work with her.
She showed me how to use the register and the backrooms on my first day. The kitchen door was in the upper right corner of the main room.

There's a small hallway behind the main room containing a bathroom and another room, I assumed for storage.  It was never really well lit and had a dark curtain behind it, so I never really messed with it.
Things went really well working there the first few weeks. I baked cupcakes and made fondant to put on top of cakes people ordered, made cookies, the work that comes into working in a bakery. My boss seemed to like me extremely well, she would joke around with me when I was on shift and she'd give me free cupcakes if I forgot my lunch; even so far as to taking me out to lunch a few times. When her kids,  7 and 3, would show up, they were kind to me and tried to get me to play with them. Her daughter even drew me a picture one afternoon.
 I was washing dishes in the kitchen one peculiar afternoon, then drying them with a dish towel. To the right is a metal-wired shelf where I'd place the pans. That's when I noticed something that I hadn't picked up on before, I was curious about how I'd never seen it until then.

Behind the shelf was a doorframe, the door missing its' knob. It was odd that it was blocked by the metal shelf, but it didn't really bug me. I made a mental note to ask my boss about it later.
Another week goes by and I'm washing pans again. I'm focused at the task at hand when I hear a slight rubbing sound to my right, like something was rubbing against rugged surface... then a thud, like something had fallen.
It was especially strange since the only thing to my right was the shelf, with no equipment or utensils were on it. I felt a slight chill run up my back and I stared at the door, not paying attention to my soapy hands dripping water on the floor from the dishwater. I step closer to hear better, to try to decipher what was making that noise...

'Amber,' my boss says behind me,  'what're you doing?'
I jump at hearing her voice so suddenly,  then sigh. I figure now's the best time to bring up the mysterious door.
I respond, 'I noticed that there's a door here,' I point to the object of interest, and continue, 'what's behind there anyway?'

She calmly replies,' that's a room that used to be used as a drive-thru,  but no one ever uses it. We use it for storage now.' She shot a 'don't-ask-anything-else' look to me before turning on her heels, and returning to making icing.

She never talked about it again. 
I was still as intrigued as ever- each time I'd pass that door I couldn't help but wonder what was hidden inside it.. and what had made that noise. I would ask her questions concerning the building in hopes of getting more background knowledge.
I gathered altogether that the small building had once been owned by a small group of 5 elderly women running a thrift store. According to my boss, however, it was horribly unkept and dirty. The opaque-white walls were a dull yellow, aluminum foil encrusted the windows 'to keep the heat out', my boss said.  However, they all had died within 5 years of eachother. I thought that was a bit strange but I didn't question fate, when it's your time, it's your time.
She never came out and told me how she had turned out to be the owner of the building, though. I didn't think much of it. 

I came into work especially early one morning, my boss calling me the night before asking if I could man the shop by myself for a few hours, her daughter had a scheduled biopsy for a small tumor on her back. I happily complied, feeling as though I had just been promoted. My boss trusted me enough to man the shop by myself? Heck yeah, that made me feel great.
I got there especially early the next morning, around 6 AM(she had given me a key about a month into the job).
I felt slightly uneasy at being there by myself, especially when the lights flickered slightly. They returned to normal; I went to the kitchen to start baking cupcakes for the display.
I eyed the blocked door for a moment before disregarding it, and going on with my morning. 
As I was cracking eggs, I heard a slight scratching sound behind me. I froze; the yolk falling in the batter(I was only supposed to use the whites.) 
I remember thinking to myself, 'am I really hearing this?', trying to make myself believe that it was probably just a rat in the wall.

I turned around slowly to the far metal shelf, the scratching sound becoming more distinct. I looked over my shoulder- nothing was out of the ordinary.
A slight sweat on my forehead, I continue with the eggs; fishing out the bastardly yolk I had dropped in a moment ago.With the mixer on, the sound seemed unexistent. With the batter mixed, I greased the pans and poured the batter in them. I turned on the radio and found it to be on a weird station; a mixture of static and whispering. I couldn't make out the words, but it was really eery to listen to. I tried to change the channel but found that the dial was stuck in place. It was quite strange. I turned off the radio and waited for the cupcakes to finish baking.  The clock read '6:17', not even thirty minutes had gone by and I was already spooked. 'The bakery isn't even haunted, get a hold of yourself,' I would repeat in my head.
A large bang echoes behind me as I turn around to see the shelf shaking, a few pans hit the floor from the sudden motion. There's a loud sound behind the door, as if something were trying to break it down.
I stand in fear, my hand to my mouth to keep me from screaming. I can't move, my legs are stuck in place as the pounding continues. No screaming, no words, no low moaning.. No signs of human life other than my own.
All at once the shaking and banging stops.  I hold my breath and listen, and there are no more sounds. Nothing at all.

My heart is pounding and I'm about to run out of the building, but my conscious is telling me to check to see what that was.
After a minute of catching my breath, I decide to move the metal shelf out of the way. It isn't as heavy as I thought it would be, especially with none of the pots or pans on it.
With that out of the way, I take a look at the door freely, no more barriers to keep it shut.
Without a doorknob, I try to think of a way to open it. I push it gently,  however it won't open. I look under the sink and find various soaps, a mop, a flashlight, a window scraper, and a glass cup with dirt inside. I put the small flashlight in my pocket and take the window scraper to the door to try to pry it open. After various attempts, the door budges slightly.. I push it open and I'm greeted by cold, musty air. I take out my flashlight and find that this door leads down a small flight of stairs..  I slowly walk down them, shining my flashlight into the small space. The walls are a beige, though it's hard to tell from the darkness. I lose my footing in the steps and lose my balance for a second, scaring me half to death.  That alone made me want to run upstairs, but I kept walking. 

When I reached the bottom, I turned to my left and shined the flashlight.
The floor had a large pentagram drawn in the middle with a limp bird in the middle. If I had taken another step I would've been inside of it.
 I dared to look up.
On that wall I saw something I pray to God I never see again.
On that wall was a drawing of a horned creature, ash pale with a gash in his stomach exposing his organs.  It had no hair and wore no clothes.His arms were cradling something; and it had the physique of a malnourished man. It had  hollowed in cheeks, dark circles under its' eyes. It looked so real, like I could touch him..
Until it opened its eyes- 
It's gaze found me at once. This thing's eyes were pitch black against it's pale skin. It cocked its' head curiously at me before realizing that I shouldn't have been there.. It's face then distorted in such a way a man shouldn't be able to, its mouth growing to a size that should've split its jaw-
  I couldn't take my eyes off of it.
It then released a horrible low screech-

 At this point I made a break towards the staircase. It was right behind me, it's rancid breath was on the back of my neck. I trampled up to the top and shut the door frantically, the horrible creatures' screeching as it tried to claw through the door.
I ran through the corridor to the main room when I see something that makes me stop dead in my tracks.
In the last door before the main room is my boss, standing at the doorway.
I'm at first relieved and try to tell her what happened to me back there, to make her believe me.. when I notice that she is still eerily calm, like this wasn't anything new.
My talking comes to a stop when she says, 'You shouldn't have been back there. That wasn't any of your fucking business and you had to go find it.'

She grabs my throat tightly and says, 'You found him.. now you have to keep him company.' she chokes me as she drags me back into the kitchen, leading me back to the terrifying monster's home. 
I'm screaming but nothing's coming out, my throat is trying to shut when I remember the ice scraper beside the door. As she goes to shove the door open, I grab the ice scraper and lodge it into her neck.
Her hand drops from my throat immediately. The door is slightly ajar but I don't stay to shut it. I bolt out of the kitchen and into the main room. I hear a frantic thumping sound right behind me but I don't look to see what it is. I get to the front door and burst through, then lock the door. I see a black figure pounding on the glass and I can't tell what it is.. All I know is that I don't want to find out.
I run and run far away from the bakery as fast as I can until I end up outside of a corner store. I collapse onto the pavement bawling my eyes out. I call 911 and I tell them what happened.
The bakery burnt down later that year. 

It's been a few years now, and I'm still afraid of what happened that night.
It turned out that my boss and her family had been in a satanic cult using that backroom and had summoned that.. thing. The elderly ladies had never actually sold the place to her, she became friends with them all and they either went missing or died of food poisoning.. one after the other.
I thought that I had finally gotten over the fear of that night until a few days ago... when I saw my old boss at the grocery store."

I graduated in May with a degree in Business Administration, and had been working in an internship from January until the end of July. This month, I started a job and can finally say that I am gainfully employed! 


The issue is, I'm not quite sure I'm sold on my new job yet, and I may have an offer from my previous internship for a job that would start next month. The job at my previous internship has not even been posted yet, but my former boss indicated that it was opening before I left for my new position (but after I had already signed my offer letter). 

My new job is at a young, high-energy software company with decent pay, great benefits, and lots of really awesome people. The downsides are that it is all cold calling, and the commute is about an hour each way in terrible traffic. 


The job that may be opening with my previous internship is about the same pay (possibly more), a 15 minute drive, and they will also pay for half of the costs associated with me getting my master's degree. The job is also an ""inside sales position"" but is much less cold calling and more ""warm"" calling. The downsides to this job are a much smaller, and quieter office with a bit of a slower pace and a much broader age range. 



So I come to you Reddit, I'm hoping some of you may have experience with a situation like this and will be able to offer some insight and advice for me. Also, before anyone asks, the room for growth is about the same at both companies. Thanks in advance to anyone who can help me out with this.

Though it was called the 'web' intern, it was actually really flexible, and I even ended up developing an android game for NCSA (by my own choosing; you're not expected to know android). The boss is super nice and energetic and will definitely give you a nice recommendation if you show some sort of enthusiasm for what you do. You get to work in the awesome new NCSA building with awesome bathrooms (dunno why i included that, but it's so much better than my other work restrooms) and even a weight room! You get a super nice chair, a cubicle in a nice room with a handy fridge and a microwave, and best of all, a super awesome giant iMac to work on. Hours are really flexible, and she doesn't mind if you have plans or take off days, as long as you're still doing your job. I've had 6 undergrad jobs since getting to UIUC, and this has been the best one yet. She basically wants me to refer someone to take my spot, so send me links to resumes/portfolios and I'll look through them, maybe try to work out an informal meeting with you, and go from there. 

Edit: More deets about the work:
So you basically handle a lot of different web functions. I did front end work, work integrating a designed site into a content management system (CMS) like liferay or expressionengine, and also back end server stuff. A lot of it will be project specific, so it's learning as you go. You'll be expected to work around 10-15 hours a week, but it's flexible. "
xxxt9,23,2012-08-09,Just found out the CEO of an organization I volunteered at is on the Board of Directors for an organization where I recently applied for a position. How do I use this to my advantage?,MPLS_MN,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xxxt9/just_found_out_the_ceo_of_an_organization_i/,"Some background: 

I graduated in December with a degree in Applied Economics, but was unable to find relevant work so I cold emailed a local non-profit that does economic development work and offered to do and office work they had on a volunteer basis. I volunteered for 6-8 hours a week for about 2 months before being offered a full-time position from a former employer. I'm connected on LinkedIn to my old supervisor and one other employer at the non-profit and I'm confident they'd be great references although I haven't contacted them in a few months.

About 6 weeks ago I applied for a job (Research Assistant) at another local economic development non-profit and got an interview, but upon realizing it was an internship without benefits and no guarantee of hours after December 31st I cancelled the interview. About a week ago I applied to another position (Administrative Assistant) at the non-profit and am waiting to hear back. While reading this non-profits annual report, I recognized one of the board members as the CEO of the non-profit I volunteered for. I only met her once or twice and it was very brief. 

Since I'm only sort of qualified for the administrative assistant position (I don't have the 5 years experience they were asking for, but I fit the other required criteria and have some experience with their database system from using it at the other non-profit, which was a preferred/desired skill) I think a reference might really help me get an interview. 

EDIT: I'm going to contact my old supervisor first and see if he can help me out. Does anyone have any suggestions on how I should start my email?

I'm thinking of emailing the two contacts I still have at the non-profit, but I'm struggling with wording. Also, should I email them separately or CC them both on the same email?"

I'll have two degrees, one in CS and one in math. My CS GPA is 3.3, Math is 3.6, and overall is 3.4. I've done some looking around and I seem to be pretty far below the curve for those accepted to grad schools. 

I'm two days from the end of my first internship (at Interactive Intelligence, if you've ever heard of it).

My coursework has involved a fair amount of theory and a decent amount of lower-level work. The OS class we take here is now identical to what the graduate OS course was two years ago. 

Having a math degree means I have experience in differential equations, combinatorics and other discrete math, linear algebra, topology, analysis, computational and complexity theory, and numerical methods.

I'd like to go into theoretical CS research; I really care very little for the minutia of hardware and embedded devices.

So, my question is, how would you rate my chances at getting in to a decent grad school with these numbers and experiences?"
xxgps,1,2012-08-09,"Engineers of reddit, I have an ethics question.",[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/xxgps/engineers_of_reddit_i_have_an_ethics_question/,"So here's the story. By the way, I am a civil undergrad working for a fairly large company, and I know undergrads have the habit of trying to be the hero that the company deserves but not the one it needs (i.e. being the *hothead* who's a know-it-all), but hear me out.

There is a manager where I work is perpetually grumpy (I'll refer to him as **the Drama Queen**), and when he is, it spells bad news for myself and the team (I work under a team of senior estimators) but mostly me, since I am the jack-of-all-trades intern who's eager to learn and will do anything I'm told.

Drama Queen is grumpy because his job involves hours (even days) of mind-numbing manual arithmetic tasks in spreadsheets, because he isn't very well-versed in Excel and his task often requires 3-6 repeats per project which really pisses him off (e.g. a new design, an additional scope, etc). Now that is bad for us because he'd use his power to pass his job onto us and make it seem like it's our fault for not working fast enough. I have also noticed that he would insert questionable numbers in well-hidden cells *just to make things look right* and because he got sick of trying to troubleshoot it. I knew of a way to speed up the process with precise accuracy, and gave him the template which reduces the entire task to about 2hours tops (because it still needs user input and decisions) for one specific project because we were running out of time and it worked, however clumsy my coding was.

So the guy was delighted to know that it works and it saves him a lot of headaches, which was also to my delight in hopes of keeping him off our backs, but not for long. He noticed that I know a lot of ways to speed up tasks (being the young kid who's fast with the computer, like every other undergrad) so he started giving me tasks that are outside of my job description (specifically, **his** tasks). He has been reinventing the wheel and making tasks more difficult for everyone else to make his tasks more convenient, remaking tried-and-tested methods into different formats (nothing really improved, but the fanciful colours of the cells) and I made a mistake of criticising it as ""inefficient"" which sent him into butthurt mode. By inefficient, I meant unworkable because I will need to make decisions that could fuck shit up in a small-to-medium scale but cumulatively, because he doesn't know what decision to make. I wouldn't mind making these decisions, if I had the relevant experience (note that what he was trying to get me to do was mostly commercial stuff).

When I asked him to provide more information, he told me that the information he provided is as complete as it gets and I should just stop complaining and get to it (not exact words, but that was the point). When I compiled a list of the incorrect/missing information and sent it to him which also attracted the attention of my boss (senior estimator), he spoke to me in person asking me what my problem is, to which I made yet another mistake of implying that what he was trying to do was counter-productive, although politely. Then the Drama Queen stormed off to see the project manager (also the guy I need to impress because I want to keep my job and join his team) and told him:

&gt; Young noodleproof isn't feeling his usual happy self today and doesn't wanna do work.

Now Drama Queen may not be the most effective guy to do what he does, but man, can he talk shit formally. He made it look like I was just too lazy to do it and I kept complaining. The PM probably realised what was going on, but nicely asked me to do it anyway just to get it done and over with. So I did, asking everyone questions so I have some idea in what I'm doing. This went on for a while, and then asked me to *fix up that macro* that I made a while back, so he can once again make his work more convenient.

**TL;DR: Manager is a complete dick, and now asks me for help to make his life easier.**

My ethics question is: **Should I?**

I can always pretend to be the clueless intern. Hell, I am supposed to be clueless."

I am working full-time in a clerical position, and my future job prospects are bleak. I also have a family to support, and as a result, I am desperately looking for a way to increase my earning potential. 

I have almost no programming experience, but I am in the process of learning using textbooks/ Udacity at the moment and am enjoying the work. I feel that I have an aptitude for CS, and am looking for a career path that is financially rewarding and also tailored towards introverted personality types. 

I could be making a grave mistake, but over the past few weeks, I have begun to consider returning to my state-school to earn a BS in Computer Science. I would probably take out loans to be able to survive and pay for school, and I would be able to graduate in about 2 years if I go full-time. I would likely accrue about $80,000 in debt as a result of this move, but I would be working part-time to help alleviate this. To put things into perspective, law school would be about $150,000 in debt over 3 years with worse job prospects (that was the other thing I was considering). 

If I put my heart and soul into something like software development over these two years and graduate with a good GPA, research experience, and an internship ""under my belt"" (I hate that phrase), might everything work out in the end for me and my fledgling family?

UPDATE: I would like to thank everyone for the advice. I realize that my next endeavor should be to map out the expected financial consequences of each possible education choice available to me. To recapitulate, here are my options:


1) Learn CS in my spare time. (Unclear timeframe, low opportunity cost)
2) Take part-time courses and work towards a certification. (2-3 years, low opportunity cost)
3) Take part-time prerequisite courses and apply to a master's program. (5-6 years, high opportunity cost)
4) Go full-time to earn a second bachelor's. (2 years, high opportunity cost)
5) Read self-help books and join Amway Global. (Unclear timeframe, high opportunity cost)"
y0ege,0,2012-08-10,How do I get to a good school?,[deleted],compsci,https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/y0ege/how_do_i_get_to_a_good_school/,"Story: I went to school for computer science and management and earned a dual-degree. Unfortunately, the school I attended is terrible and has a terrible reputation. What I want to do, which is along the lines of software engineering, is impossible with this degree. I can't get a job, internship, or even a call back.

The thing about me is that I don't represent the average student from my school, in terms of math skills or programming skill specifically. The average student from my school can't even code a linked-list or comprehend what a logarithm is. I'm ashamed of my school, the administrations lax standards, and the kludge these kids pass off as programs. 

I'm not like these kids. I'm very well-versed in set theory, calculus, linear algebra, and probability. I use UNIX and Linux at home. I'm quite familiar with database relation. I've taught myself data structures, and not just the easy ones. In fact, I can probably give you 98% of CLRS from memory, including implementations in Java, C#, and C++. I've seen every accredited online lecture video in CS, EE, and mathematics from MIT, Standford, and UC Berkely. Every. Single. One. And retained a great deal of it. It's really made me realize the difference in my school and those schools. The information presented in these videos is supposed to go right over the heads of low-tier school dummies like me....but it doesn't. 

I'm not an experience software engineer but I'm not a moron either. I took this degree because I thought it would lead to a job and a life out of the minimum-wage gutter. If I'd had know that it wouldn't, I wouldn't have wasted the money and five years of my life.....but in doing so I realized something: not everyone from MIT, UC Berkeley, UT, Standford, CMU, Cornell, etc. is an uber genius or even close, or even smarter than me at all. I've met kids from Cornell who didn't know economics as well as I do despite it being their major. I've met kids from MIT and Harvard who didn't know data structures as well as I do. 

Everything I was ever told about people from these schools is a myth. Growing up, poor, in a drug-infested failing falling apart public school system, I was always told these people had something I'll never have, in terms of mental ability. Intuitively, I didn't really believe it then and I sure as hell don't believe it now. 

My question is this:

Need support. ,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/xznps/i_am_at_breaking_point_in_my_life_and_i_dont_know/,"I'm male, 25 years old and for two years I have dealings with anxiety. I'm an agoraphobic and I feel unable to drive long distances. (From one city to another). There is little to no support from my family. I live 500 miles apart from most of them. When I was a child I always felt like I was unwanted and tried very hard to get attention from anyone in order to subsitute the hole my parents left in me. Their work was always more important than anything I could do, for example school concerts or sport matches. I always felt empty inside and that I am on my own, alone, all the time. Unfortunately I didn't develop a strong and self confident personality. Sure, I went away from my family and it felt good for the first couple of years, but there still is this feeling of being insignificant, an inability to love myself and love others as well. I have a girlfriend, but I'm not a good boyfriend to her. I often become aggressive and throw things at the wall. I never hurt or touch her, that's out of the question. But she feels so sorry and there is nothing she can do to help me. It's my inability to accept myself as a person. How can I open up to her? I don't know. And then, there's this anxiety, this fatal seed, that destroys everything I try to start. Whenever there opens up an opportunity in my life, the heavy thumb of fear presses me down into the ashes and the dust of nowhere and nothing. I feel isolated and cold, in some way not human. All life I had is sucked up by fear and all I do, or still able to do is dictated by fear. 

Next week I'm going to start an internship and I need to start it in order to finally finish my studies (it's obligatory). I have no idea how to deal with it. I can't sleep and I'm nervous all the time. I read (on reddit) that suicide seems like a constant solution to a temporarily problem, but what do you do when the problem is constantly bringing you to the knees? "
xzcvt,4,2012-08-10,Question about resume... having a low GPA,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xzcvt/question_about_resume_having_a_low_gpa/,"So I am a Computer Science student and my GPA right now is 2.6 due to the fact I did extremely bad in one class (actually most of the class failed). I transferred into the university so my GPA is really easily influenced. If not for the class my GPA would be 3.1 ish. As the school year starts the job fairs start as well as most companies recruiting for internships. I am retaking the class, but by the time I do, all the internships will be taken. I currently go to a top university as well as one of the hardest universities (been recognized as top 10 hardest)

So Reddit, how should I approach this problem and what should I put on my resume? If I currently put a 2.6 I will be instantly over looked even though I have work experience."

However, during that time, I found a friend who always came to me before the IT guys, mainly because their office was at the bottom of the cliff, and they always gave problems in our office the lowest priority, at least it seemed that way.

One day I was waiting for a test run of my software to finish, when the guy, whose cubical I was using (I was an intern and they had run out of cubes, so I was using his, since he was working in a lab most of the time), asked me to come look at a problem he was having.

We were often writing software for products that needed to be able to swapped out in the field (this was embedded computing, so WindowsCE) so all the software was loaded onto CompactFlash cards.  One drawback was that when you formatted via Windows it would make it so that WindowsCE couldn't read the cards.  So, to solve the problem, they would low level format the cards, then load the software on the cards with a special transfer utility.  He had not done it before as he was new to software testing, so he wanted some help performing the operation the first time.  I walked him through it and made sure he knew to select only the E: drive, as the C: was his hard drive, and D: was the optical drive.

Cut to 3 hours later, he comes running up to the desk again, saying he has a problem.  I run downstairs after him and he said that he was no longer able to open Internet Explorer or Firefox.  On the screen is Outlook with the corporate email.  While looking at the screen, I watched messages disappear from the Inbox, then Outlook Disappear, then our IM software, then the icons in the sys tray disappear, then the desktop picture, the icons on the desktop, the Task Bar, and finally all that was left was a flashing cursor.

I turned to him and said ""It looks like you pressed C instead of E.""

He looked at me and asked, ""Can you fix it?"".

I told him, ""No, we should call IT to get your system rebuilt.""

I called IT, told them what happened, then about 30 minutes later arrived with their portable Image system, and a second machine.  The latter was set only for low-level formatting, and was set so you couldn't change the drive letter.

y35nm,5,2012-08-12,Absolutely terrified of my house right now.....,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/y35nm/absolutely_terrified_of_my_house_right_now/,"Ok to start this off, I'm on this sub too often. It has caused me to be paranoid and lose sleep at night. I lay in my bed at night scared something is in my house even though my front door is locked as well as my bedroom door. 

Speaking of that front door, there's two locks on it. One is on the knob and when locked, it can be opened from the inside and it stays locked. The only way of unlocking is to either unlock it from the inside or use a key on the door. There's no opening it from the outside without unlocking it. The other lock is a bolt that prevents it from being opened from either side without unlocking it.

Things have been shaky with one of my housemates. We've had much personal drama and it's hard for me to like the guy anymore. Because of this, I had no idea that he decided to go home Friday. One of the other guys just left his job so he went home until school starts. The last roommate is finishing his internship in his home town. This leaves me alone.

I just started a new job and I had to work this morning so I decided that I wouldn't go out on a Friday for the first time in awhile as I was tired and wanted to catch up on sleep. Boy did that not happen. Of course I browse reddit while browsing through the TV. I see MTV was having two horror films (Sorority Row and Friday the 13th remake) and while I knew it would be bad I had never seen the first and watched it. This made me want some horror so I went to nosleep while Jason slashed up some kids.

Boy was that a bad idea. You know that feeling of uneasiness where you feel there's something somewhere and you just don't know where? That's all I had the rest of the night and struggled for an hour in bed before I went on /r/funny in order to maybe feel more at ease.

This led to my dream. Now I'm someone who has had nightmares many times and it isn't new but it was the timing of this dream. I'm sitting in our front room on the couch watching TV. Behind me to the left is the front door and behind me to the right is the kitchen. There is a chair to the left of the couch where I can see the kitchen that I'm currently sitting in as chills run down my spine. In my dream as I sat on the couch, a woman with messy hair came walking slowly out of my kitchen smiling and just staring at me. She walked up behind me and just stood there staring. This is when my alarm went off.

I was scared shitless but I had to get ready for work. Did all the essentials and still had 10 minutes to spare so I watched some TV. That's when I heard the door. It sounded like someone turning the knob. Now last night when I went to sleep I locked both locks. This morning I undid the bolt but left the lock on the knob. I was curious who was here so I moved the curtain and looked outside to see no one. I decided to walk over to the door to see it wide open still locked. The only way for it to do that was to be opened from the inside.

I left a couple random lights on and a quarter on the knob tails up when I left tonight. Everything was the same when I got back not too long ago but I'm absolutely terrified and regretting not staying at someone else's house tonight. I can't wait for the housemate I hate to get back tomorrow."

So I'd like to know

- if anyone here has interned at Qualcomm, in any of those positions

- did you have everything on their list of skills, coursework, and experience?

- how I can best prepare myself. 

I can program pretty well (Matlab, C/C++, java), but I don't have a lot of courses in CS. So data structures, OOP analysis, algorithms, while I have just a fleeting familiarity, most of it is lost on me. I don't have an scripting language experience, and I don't know a lot about mobile development. 

I know some more of the stuff mentioned in the hardware intern specifications, but I don't really want to pursue hardware, since it looks like it's mostly RF engineering.

I got good results on my courses and was top of my class in some of them. I did not do any internships during my degree and I don't have any industry work or interviewing experience.

I'm about to start looking for a software development job and was interested in the job market for a foreign recent graduate in Europe. I was in Germany as an exchange student last year, really loved it there, and would like to go back to Europe to live and work there for a few years. It doesn't have to be Germany. I'm open to anywhere in Europe. My life really needs a change of scenery, and my semester in Germany makes me think Europe would be a great option.

I've heard from friends in industry that there's a shortage of good software developers in Europe at the moment, but I don't know how true that is, and I've also heard that there are laws about trying to hire EU citizens instead of foreigners (I'm non-EU). The only European language I speak is a bit of German (not fluent), which I guess is also a problem.

I'm guessing that only large companies (like Google and other big multinationals) are going to have the resources to invest in foreign graduates with no experience, so I shouldn't bother applying to smaller companies?

A friend suggested that I should work here for job experience to improve my resume, and try for Europe in a few years. Thoughts?

I fully get that finding a job in Europe with my limited resume, lack of citizenship and limited language ability is going to be very very difficult to do, but I was hoping for advice and information from you guys that might help me. I can answer any questions you have if it helps. Thanks in advance for your advice!

TLDR: Non-European fresh graduate without industry experience wants to break into European software development job market. Possible, or not?"

**Derpina:** It's not turning back on! (No idea how you can mess up a reboot...)

**Le me:** What cables did you use to connect the monitors? (My first thoughts were that she used the graphics card and the internal graphics on the Dell box)

**Derpina:** The white one and the blue one (DVI and VGA just as I suspected)

**Le me:** Okay is there anyway you can use the splitter with two white cables and just ditch the blue cable?

**Derpina:** There's only a white and blue place to plug the monitors in!

**Le me:** No ma'am the computer has a splitter to connect both monitors with white cables.

**Derpina:** Oh I figured it out! I rebooted it and found the splitter right next to the box, all set! Thanks for your help!

**Le me:** Uhhh... you're welcome ma'am, call us back if you have any other problems.

y56hf,1,2012-08-13,"Caught my boyfriend's son smoking weed at his dad's house while he was out of town, what should I do?",throwaway5521,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/y56hf/caught_my_boyfriends_son_smoking_weed_at_his_dads/,"For a little background, my boyfriend and I have been together for almost four years, both of us are in our late forties, and he has three kids; the one in question is 19 and about to go back to college, and is the only one who lives with my boyfriend. We'll call him Mike. I'm using a throwaway because I know he's an avid redditor. My boyfriend was out of town when this happened.

I went over to my boyfriend's house yesterday to pick up a pair of sandals I'd left there (I don't live with my boyfriend) and to say hi to Mike, but I went through the front door and couldn't find him in the house, so I went through the kitchen to the backyard to see if he was out there. I saw a plastic bag full of marijuana on the kitchen counter, which really shocked me. Mike is a good kid, he works at a high paying internship, makes good grades at a difficult school, and has never had any trouble with the law or parents, so at first I thought it might not be his (there was another car besides the one his dad had just bought him in the driveway). I went out back, and I saw Mike and a friend of his sitting at a table by the pool with some music playing on the outdoor speakers. He must have heard me open the door, because he turned, saw me, and then grabbed something off the table and tried to hide it under his leg (I'm guessing it was the pipe). 

So I walked out there and feigned conversation for a bit, not really knowing what to do, asking them questions to make it obvious I knew (like asking why they had a lighter in the backyard). Mike was trying to hide something, kept asking me ""what are you doing here?"", and eventually I went back inside without him saying anything about it. I grabbed the bag of marijuana, walked back outside, put it down on the table, and said ""you know your father wouldn't appreciate this, not at his house. Especially not after he bought you a new car. Not cool."" He kinda sulked and defeatedly responded ""I know,  you're right,"" and I told him I wouldn't tell his father unless I caught him again. 

But after I left the house I was seriously conflicted about whether or not I should tell my boyfriend about it. This wasn't the first time one of his kids had abused the empty house while he was away: his high-school aged daughter had thrown a party once and been caught/punished for it, and only two weeks ago she had snuck over a bunch of guys to the house while my boyfriend was at work, except someone saw them and reported it to him (they thought she and her friends were intruders). I don't like keeping secrets from him, so I called Mike later to let him know my predicament. I let him know I was in an awkward position, how shocked and disappointed I was, reminded him how much he had to lose, asked him if e realized what could've happened to his father if someone should see them and report it (their backyard goes along a golf-course that gets a lot of players coming through), etc. He apologized, assured me this was the first time anything like that had happened at the house, that they hadn't started smoking when I got there but were about to, and that he'd do ""the right thing"". I told him he should probably tell his father himself, and he agreed, so I resolved not to. 

But I'm still not sure. What if he doesn't tell his father? I know I probably wouldn't want to if I were him, but if I bring it up to his father at some point down the line and he has no idea what I'm talking about, I'll have ratted Mike out against his wishes. So I'm at a loss as to what I should do. I know he'd be quite disappointed (he doesn't take too kindly to marijuana), so some part of me feels like he ought to know. 

tl;dr Caught my boyfriend's son smoking weed while his dad was out of town, don't know whether or not to tell him.

EDIT: some corrections

EDIT2: I know that not everybody thinks weed is as bad as my boyfriend does. Personally I don't mind it, though I've only ever done it in briefly when I was a kid. The morality of smoking is not what I'm after here, it's about whether or not I should be keeping secrets from my boyfriend. Secrets he would want to know and has a right to know."

 |(1) Fat leads to weight gain and an increase in the risk of metabolic syndroms/cardiovascular related diseases and we should have a diet low in total fat, saturated fats.
 |(2) Reducing food down to components (i.e. protein powder is just as good as food with protein in it, vitamin C supplements are as good as oranges, ect.)

[Do you think Americans need to take vitamins?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y41hf/iama_nutrition_student_who_has_spent_the_last_few/c5s51p1?context=5)|Nobody ""needs"" to take vitamins in America. We have plenty of nutritious food available to get all our vitamins. However, some people may benefit from a vitamin if they have a diet lacking in vitamins they won't fix.

[I only eat junk food, and I do not exercise, how am I not overweight?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y41hf/iama_nutrition_student_who_has_spent_the_last_few/c5s5y0t?context=5)|Genetics and hormonal regulation. I'm guessing it will catch up to you at some point and you'll start gaining weight.
[What do you mean by hormonal regulation exactly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y41hf/iama_nutrition_student_who_has_spent_the_last_few/c5s8gn7?context=5)|Primarily, insulin. Insulin drives fat storage by allowing glucose to enter cells, as well as other enzymatic activity relative to fat storage/fat loss. Glucagon is the opposite of insulin, it releases glucose from the cells into the bloodstream to be used for energy.
 |Other hormones include leptin (makes you feel full) and ghrelin (makes you hungry).
 |The interactions/prevalence of these hormones will play a significant role in determining how energy is partitioned (what happens to the fat or carbs you eat) and weight gain.
[How does one have more insulin or glucagon in their system than someone else? Genetics? Specific diet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y41hf/iama_nutrition_student_who_has_spent_the_last_few/c5s8nzv?context=5)|As far as insulin and glucagon go, they are indeed based on both of these things, but are likely dictated more by the specific diet. Insulin is released when glucose is released into the blood from food (carbohydrate mostly) that you eat. The amount of insulin released is proportional to the level of glucose you released, so drinking a soda wil release a lot more than a sweet potato since the sugar in soda is digested faster, while the fiber in the sweet potato will slow the release. Genetics likely plays some role in how much insulin you'll secrete too, as everything functions back to the DNA level, and what is DNA but genetics. In addition, over your life your body adapts (or maladapts) to insulin. If you're constantly drinking soda and eating simple carbohydrates, you will eventually resist the insulin, needing more and more for it to have the same effect (this is how type 2 diabetes happens).
 |Glucagon is released when blood sugar levels are very low, it functions by releasing glucose from cells into the bloodstream, where it can then can be used for energy. When you're sleeping, or if you're fasting (if you're into that) glucagon levels will be higher than insulin levels, generally speaking.
[I have a diet that consists mostly of deep fried potatos, frozen processed chicken, chocolate bars and potato chips.  What's going to happen to my health?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y41hf/iama_nutrition_student_who_has_spent_the_last_few/c5s4vy9?context=5)|Metabolic syndrome most likely. Blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels will go up. Obesity and hypertension are not unlikely, as well as type 2 diabetes, and eventually a heart attack at the extreme side of things.
[What should we be eating then old wise one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y41hf/iama_nutrition_student_who_has_spent_the_last_few/c5s4yvy?context=5)|Natural foods, generally speaking, that evolution has deemed safe to eat. No artificial/synthetic ingredients, processed foods, added sugars, chemical ingredients/stabilizers ect.
 |The history of the human race shows we can survive, and thrive, of many types of diets, from extremely high fat (the inuit) to a vegan diet. All of these diets, however, are free from simple sugars and refined grains, two of the biggest problems.
[Actually, history doesn't show us much. We're living longer than any time in history. Not that this proves added sugars are great, it just points out the history argument is a silly one.

[What's a simple sugar as opposed to other sugar?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y41hf/iama_nutrition_student_who_has_spent_the_last_few/c5s6yz7?context=5)|A simple sugar is a sugar that can't be broken down into other sugars, such as glucose. Complex sugars, any non-simple sugar, are made up of multiple sugars, and can be broken down into there simple counterparts. Lactose (milk sugar) is a complex sugar comprised of the simple sugars glucose and galactose.

 |Sorry, I'm not claiming to know everything, I'm merely claiming I think I have a good idea about the right way to think about the foods we eat, and have seen some of the ways we go wrong. If you look at the state of the health of the Western world, it's pretty grim, so it only follows that there must be some fundamental flaws with the popular nutrition advice we've been receiving. Being young I am yes, less experienced and less knowledgable than many others, but I am also open to looking at things in a different light, not sticking by old theories. I'm really just trying to help some people out, and I like talking about nutrition.
[Are humans meant to be vegetarians? I'm thinking about going on a vegetarian diet for a while.

We evolved eating meat, it made our brains bigger and made new amino acids available to our bodies. While it is completely possible to survive and thrive on a vegetarian diet, we aren't made for it, we're simply capable of either.
[I thought it was impossible to thrive because of lack of vitamin b12. or maybe thats vegan.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y41hf/iama_nutrition_student_who_has_spent_the_last_few/c5s90y6?context=5)|That is vegan, you can get b12 from eggs and milk.

[Don't eat processed foods including refined sugar and processed grain](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y41hf/iama_nutrition_student_who_has_spent_the_last_few/c5s6kmq?context=5)|This is something common knowledge has right, I'm more referring to things like fat is unhealthy and we should be eating lots of grains.
 |1) Independently neither of these are complete proteins, but their amino acid profiles complement each other. Combining the amino acids of rice and beans gives you all 9 essential amino acids.
 |2) It is just sugar, and unhealthy. It is better than kool-aid though, since it's less processed and won't have the artificial colors, and at least fruit juice comes with some vitamins.
 |3) Hmmmm, canola really is not that great, but I guess in terms of picking only the cheap oils I will reluctantly say canola. Olive, coconut, grapeseed, and avocado, I'll say are healthy (but unfortunately not cheap)
 |4) V8 follows the same reasoning as fruit juice, really just a bunch of sugar with a bonus of vitamins.
[Can you make the case that animal protein is 'better' in that it is more easily assimilated and probably a good idea for people with physically active jobs / lifestyles?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y41hf/iama_nutrition_student_who_has_spent_the_last_few/c5s515j?context=5)|As far as simply the protein content, the only real case I can make is the density of it, the real argument I see in favor of meat is the whole package, the vitamins/minerals/fat content that come along with it, as well as what it doesn't have-carbohydrates that will evoke an insulin response. In this sense, it will cause you to burn fat (long sustained energy) over carbs (slow, limited energy) which is good for those people which physically active jobs lifestyles seeking sustained energy throughout the day.
[Are you telling me to drink two drinks every day? If so I nominate you for the Nobel Prize.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y41hf/iama_nutrition_student_who_has_spent_the_last_few/c5s69x9?context=5)|Haha I'm saying there is evidence to support moderate alcohol consumption promotes general health. For example, red wine contains a potent antioxidant called resvaratrol, a polyphenol found in the skins of grapes (and therefore wine) that protects against cancer and I *believe* promotes weight loss.
 |And I'll gladly take the Nobel Prize, thanks haha!
[So skim milk is bad?!  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y41hf/iama_nutrition_student_who_has_spent_the_last_few/c5s6j8k?context=5)|Yes, skim milk contains powdered milk to give it back the consistency it lost with the fat. Powdered milk contains oxidized cholesterol, not a good thing. A general rule of thumb, the more you process food the more nutrients you lose, and the more unhealthy side effects (like the oxidizing of cholesterol) occurs.
[A glass of wine or beer may be beneficial to a person's health, but there are studies that really prove it one way or another. Same thing goes for antioxidants.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y41hf/iama_nutrition_student_who_has_spent_the_last_few/c5s98ed?context=5)|True, I guess one of the problems is that you can find a study to prove pretty much anything you want. From what I know about the behavior of antioxidants in the body and the studies about them, I choose to believe they are a good thing.
[What misconceptions about nutrition do you think are false and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y41hf/iama_nutrition_student_who_has_spent_the_last_few/c5s5r1s?context=5)|(1) fat, generally speaking, is unhealthy and we should limit it: limited scientific data/weak evidence, strong evidence supporting fat being healthy, in large amounts, including saturated fats.
 |(2) we can redue food down to individual components: we like to see the beneficial effects of something in food, like Vitamin C, and throw it into a pill. Food works synergistically, with different compounds helping others out. Reducing our food to the sum of its parts does not add up.
 |(3) Weight loss is governed primarily, and really only, by calories: fat gain/weight gain/weight loss is a well controlled and regulated processes, involving multiple hormones. The type of food we eat, rather than the caloric amounts, is more important in terms of these things.
[I felt better losing on healthy foods though](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y41hf/iama_nutrition_student_who_has_spent_the_last_few/c5s8vb2?context=5)|I'm guessing as part of your calorie restriction you cut out things like soda and refined grains?
[So that stuff about ""good fat"" is bull shit? Olive oil, avocados, etc. Not true? Please expand. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y41hf/iama_nutrition_student_who_has_spent_the_last_few/c5s66q1?context=5)|It's not really bull shit in the sense that it's wrong, it's bull shit in the sense that we precede fat with ""good"" for these things, implying that fat is generally bad. I think of fat as being generally good, with certain types of fat, generally those produced through industrial agriculture and intense food processing, to be bad. With this line of reasoning things like corn fed beef and soybean oil would contain bad fat, while pastured beef and coconut oil would contain fat, which is defaulted as good.

If the ingredients are healthy, the food is likely healthy. (2) The nutrition facts label: added sugars are the #1 thing to be avoided. Don't go by health claims on labels, but do consider information on how the food was produced (i.e. first cold pressing of olive oil is a good thing, grass fed beef is a good thing, vegetarian fed chickens is code for ""we give them corn and soy"" which is not so great)

Look at the ingredients, and you'll probably need to go a natural food store, or natural food section of a grocery store to find it (but watch it for something like this [Link to www.soap.com](http://www.soap.com/p/kraft-spoonables-mayo-w-olive-oil-30-oz-200536?site=CA&amp;utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=cpc_S&amp;utm_term=KFT-102&amp;utm_campaign=GoogleAW&amp;CAWELAID=1323147898&amp;utm_content=pla&amp;adtype=pla&amp;cagpspn=pl) that advertises it as olive oil, but adds soybean and canola as well, so again, look at the ingredients and make sure its just olive oil in there).  If you can get some high quality eggs (omega 3 enhanced at the least, pasture raised at best) make some eggs and veggies. Most of my hearty meals revolve around pastured meat and wild fish, the former might be getting into the side of too complicated while the latter might be something of what your looking for (hopefully). A really hearty snack I like is mixing up a big bowl of berries which a bunch of flaxseed and natural nut butter, or I'll add it to a meal to make it reach the super hearty level.

 |Coconut milk is mostly saturated fat, that saturated fat is comprised of mostly medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs). While fatty acids often are used for constructive purposes in cell membranes or other physiological needs, MCFAs are not used for most of these. As a result, the fat is mobilized for energy, putting the body into a fat burning state (provided there are not excess carbs), which is ideal, and can help people who are trying to switch from a carb loaded diet that causes energy production primarily through glycolysis to a diet that burns energy through beta oxidation.

[Is a healthy diet just a matter of numbers (calories in vs. calories out, number of proteins/vitamins/etc.\) or is there more to it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y41hf/iama_nutrition_student_who_has_spent_the_last_few/c5s5ema?context=5)|Absolutely not. A healthy diet is really quite simple, eat foods that are healthy, the hard part is figuring out what foods are actually healthy now that we're in the age of food science. The numbers do matter at some point, but if you are eating the right foods your body will generally guide you into how much to eat (hunger/cravings is finely regulated, but again in the age of food science these cues from our body get misguided).

Are you taking about the diatetic internship? I'm not trying to be a dietician so I haven't done that, but I've heard mix reviews. I did some volunteer work with low income families, helping them find good food, and it was rewarding yet frustrating in the sense that my superiors had the same misconceptions about health the rest of world seems to have, and I couldn't do much about it. I guess if you find a place you like and have superiors that have similar views to you it'll be good, otherwise good luck.
 |I do know the keto diet is a LCHF diet, which I generally support. I'm not too familiar with the specifics, like how many carbs they allow, and if veggies are ok. Ketosis, generally speaking, is not a bad thing, and is often a good thing (who wouldn't want to be burning up your fat stores?). The only thing with LCHF in general I question is those that exclude things like leafy-green vegetables.
[Keto generally allows 20-40 grams of (net\) carbs per day, and they have to come from vegetables. Dietary fiber carbs don't count, obviously.

Eggo waffles are crap, they are a refined grain that is processed similarly to sugar. Since the grain is refined, much of the fiber is lost, and is a result the carbohydrates (of what it is mostly) is broken down very quickly into glucose (hyperglycemia), which releases lots of insulin which stores the sugar (now hypoglycemia) and stores it as fat and makes you huuuungry again.

I'm guessing you get conventional eggs and butter, if you got these pasture raised I could definitely say there is nothing wrong with this breakfast, save maybe some veggies, but with the industrial version I really can't say how much better it is, only that eggs and butter is better than grains.

[One more question: what is your take on so-called ""superfoods"" and expensive drinks like Limu?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y41hf/iama_nutrition_student_who_has_spent_the_last_few/c5s5fyj?context=5)|The term ""superfood"" is more of a marketing claim. ""superfoods"" are generally very healthy, but the term ""superfood"" is a little misleading in the sense that this one food can solve all of your health needs or do some amazing effect on health. ""Superfoods"" are generally great additions to a healthy diet (I used have raw cacao nibs pretty frequently) but they are not the answer to all your health problems.
 |Haven't heard of Limu, what is it?
[What is your take on Honey?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y41hf/iama_nutrition_student_who_has_spent_the_last_few/c5s98us?context=5)|Honey: added sugar (which is most of what honey is ) never really is a good thing, but in moderation it won't kill you. Raw honey is best, and is certainly better than sugar given that it has more in it than simply sugar, and do these other things (amino acids, vitamins, mineral) it could be beneficial in small doses, or in times when the body could use simple carbohydrates (like after a workout). This quote, from marksdailyapple.com has some info, I've included links to the studies he referenced.
[What is your take on Apple Cider Vinegar?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y41hf/iama_nutrition_student_who_has_spent_the_last_few/c5s98us?context=5)|Apple cider vinegar: Traditionally fermented raw apple cider vinegar (with the mother) is probiotic, so it's reasonable to believe it is good for gut health. This study ([Link to care.diabetesjournals.org](http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/27/1/281.full) shows apple cider vinegar increasing insulin sensitivity in insulin resistant people/type 2 diabetics (this is a good thing, becoming resistant to insulin is how you get type 2 diabetes).
[(and finally\) What is your take on Soy Milk as a replacement for cow's milk?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y41hf/iama_nutrition_student_who_has_spent_the_last_few/c5s98us?context=5)|Replacing soy milk with honey: Soy scares me because last time I checked the USDA data sets (earlier this year) 95% of it is genetically modified. Assuming you get non GMO soy milk, there is the issue of added sugar, which normally comes with soy milk. I would probably pick whole pasture raised milk, even over non GM soy milk with no sugar added, but this is more my opinion and I don't have much evidence to support it.
[Which is more beneficial to your overall health? Chia seeds or hemp hearts. I'm an endurance athlete and have been told hemp hearts are good anti-inflamitories. Is this true? What other foods help with muscle inflammation? I'd rather not keep taking ibuprofen. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y41hf/iama_nutrition_student_who_has_spent_the_last_few/c5s7lxk?context=5)|Oh geesh, here's the thing, scrutinizing individual foods so much is often more trouble than it's worth, and in the case of chia seeds vs. hemp hearts, each of these are healthy and have different nutritional benefits. Chia seeds have more fiber, but more carbs, but more lower net carbs (see where this goes). If I had to pick, I would say Chia seeds, and the only real reason is that there is more information on them so I'm more confident in the data about them.
 |As far as inflammation goes, omega 3 fats are anti-inflammatory and omega 6's are pro-inflammatory, so balancing these out will help. also: [Link to www.marksdailyapple.com](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/top-6-anti-inflammatory-foods/#axzz23N5Py1mT)
[Quick question awesome nutritional man. Eggs and coffee, good or bad?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y41hf/iama_nutrition_student_who_has_spent_the_last_few/c5s71fi?context=5)|Regular eggs and coffee = not so bad ----&gt; decaf/flavored coffe = worse.
 |Pastured eggs and organic coffee = super duper.
[I have eaten one meal a day my entire life.  Is it unhealthy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y41hf/iama_nutrition_student_who_has_spent_the_last_few/c5s6xxb?context=5)|Not necessarily. This reminds me of ""the warrior diet"" (I forgot who made it, a google search would do the trick) which would probably be interesting for you to check out.
[Proof that your a nutritionist? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y41hf/iama_nutrition_student_who_has_spent_the_last_few/c5s6j0r?context=5)|Not a nutritionist, a nutrition student (sorry if that was unclear). I go to UMASS Amherst, lived in southwest, recently took Nutrition 130H - Nutrition for a Healthy Lifestyle, taught by Richard Wood. Does that suffice?
[This is key. Your are a first year student excited about studying nutrition and are giving people actual health advise. This is completely inappropriate and I hope the mods take this down soon. You really lack the training and knowledge to help people make practical dietary decisions. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y41hf/iama_nutrition_student_who_has_spent_the_last_few/c5schit?context=5)|I have a lot more knowledge beyond my experience, which I think is shown through many of my answers, and regardless people shouldn't blindly follow what I say, especially given my age and lack of experience. I've learned a lot more about nutrition outside of school, because as this post says, most of the ""common knowledge"" about nutrition is fundamentally flawed, and this caries over into a university setting. And like I've said to others, if you have a problem with some of the specifics I've been saying, why not raise these issues and make me support them, rather than condemning my simply on my age and perceived level of knowledge and experience, because even though I'm young I'm more partitioning out the advice/knowledge of many older/more experienced people I've read up on, and it just might be right.
[So your freshman or haven't taken many courses in nutrition.(100 level courses\).....](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y41hf/iama_nutrition_student_who_has_spent_the_last_few/c5s8w99?context=5)|See response to Impassive Advisor.

y4aip,2,2012-08-12,3 UCLA grads looking for a Marketing Intern for our tech startup!,kgibby,ucla,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/y4aip/3_ucla_grads_looking_for_a_marketing_intern_for/,"**Who we are:**

Three UCLA graduates (class of ‘11) that are currently working on our own startup, which revolves around a mobile app currently in the Apple app store. We're based on campus, but you don't have to be a student to work with us. We're here because we're part of Startup UCLA, an accelerator program for UCLA startups. At the end of the program, we will be demoing to potential investors, advisors and other accelerator programs.


**Who we're looking for:**

An intern to work with us until mid-September. We might decide to continue from there, but for now that's what we need. You will be assisting in our plans to reach out to organizations to potentially partner with in order to increase the exposure of our app. You might also help conduct user feedback interviews, in which you will have users test the product and relay the results back to us. On top of this, you will have some free reign to explore whatever marketing options you see fit, so it's a great opportunity to get creative and try out experience-building methods.


**Qualifications:**

- Good personality. You're gonna be hanging out with us while we're working, and you'll be talking to people for interviews, so a good personality is important.

- Good writing skills. We're not talking essay writing skills here, just enough that you can write good emails to potential partners.

- Familiarity with guerilla marketing techniques and social media. We want you to be able to understand our product and goal, and then figure out on your own what to do to help us. 

- Familiarity with the web and mobile products is a plus.

Pretty much everything is flexible. At the end of the day, if you have a good enough attitude and work hard, we're interested in working with you.


**Why you should be interested in this:**

You’ll learn a lot and make a really big difference in our company. While the position is unpaid, you'll make new friends, great connections, have a relaxed work environment, and pretty flexible hours, in addition to a fair amount of creative freedom.

***Shoot me a PM if you’re interested!***

[repost from r/gaming topic]",txchris,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/y82jl/what_are_some_ways_that_i_can_bolster_my/,"My issue is that I didn't have any internships, I took a managerial position at a job while in college that was related to computers, but it was more so maintenance than anything else. The job ended up hurting my gpa actually, and has thus far not seemed like a positive in interviewing. To make matters even worse, I went to Europe for like 4-5 months after school, and took another 2-3 months to really get into applying to companies. Would any sector of the tech industry be willing to hire a new software engineer that had a mediocre gpa (from a decent school but not the best; Rutgers), and a past year of no work experience? Also, what things could I do to possibly help my chances given these eyesores on my resume?

I've been applying and applying, but one of the things I mentioned above continuously is a deal breaker for the interviewer/recruiter.

Should I just cut my losses, swallow my pride, and try to get a job at geek squad/apple store/gamestop?

I know from what I mentioned it looks like I don't care, but I am capable and passionate about coding. I would work for free if it was relevant experience in some sort of development role. I tried to get internships, (after school I know, what a moron), and from what I found they seem to exclusively want people currently still in undergrad.

Anyways sorry to whoever read my desperate ramblings, and I appreciate in advance any comments or suggestions someone may have for me.

We scheduled this road trip around this time so that he would be able to come.  I even quit my internship a few weeks early so that we could all go.

I have been planning this road trip for a few months now, it is to New Orleans and the surrounding states.  It would have been just him, another friend, and I, on an amazing trip that would help us grow, explore, mature, and learn about us a group of friends.  We have done two road trips in the past, and they were both fantastic.

As far as I know he says he can't come because he just got a court date (he was assaulted, I believe that he is testifying) that would be on the 20th, 6 days before we get back.  Is this able to be rescheduled?  I don't see why they couldn't push back the one portion where he has to testify.  Additionally he said something about money, but this trip is nowhere near expensive.  I put my own budget at $700 and I am going to have no compromise eat anything drink all the booze trip.  He could honestly get by on $400.

Please weigh in on this subject for me.  Please help me convince my friend to come on this trip, I don't think he understands the amount of disappointment I have.

For anyone that doesn't remember that far back, I work in IT at a small - medium business. We've recently implemented a ticket system to help us from getting bogged down.

Yet, almost every few days, we get a new one.

This morning, we received this:
""OUR PRINTER IS STILL GOING OFF LINE MANY TIMES DAILY.

y71kv,1,2012-08-14,Ex-employer hasn't paid me; what should I do?,confused_2012,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/y71kv/exemployer_hasnt_paid_me_what_should_i_do/,"Hi reddit. Please bear with me on the length of this post, I'm confused and upset about the situation and hoping someone can help me.

I graduated from my college back in May and up until that point I was employed (EMPLOYED! nothing under the table, not as a work intern, not as an intern, not as a work study etc..) by a Writing Support Service as a tutor. Between the date of Oct. 22nd 2011 to May 2012 I did not fill out my time sheets; thus I was not paid. Direct deposit was not (at this time) available as a method of payment. Nobody actually noticed my discrepancy. 

The reason for not filling out my time sheets on time was due to depression; ok. At the end of the year I was feeling great and decided it was due time to actually do my time sheets. My schedule from Oct 22nd to May was consistent (about 6 hours a week) and I did not miss work often. However to account for the few times I did miss a shift, I decided to not incorporate the paid ""tutor meetings"" that we held when filling out these time sheets. The total number of hours ended up being approx 130 hrs. So about $1040 before taxes is owed to me.

Ok, great! My time sheets were filled out, neatly placed in the middle of the Tutoring Services director's desk on the last day of finals week. Awesome. Fast forward a few weeks to June and I had the realization that my director had not attempted to contact me about the timesheets; so I emailed her. In response she requested me to call her, so I did.

My director (my boss) explained to me that her department had in fact run out of money for their fiscal year, so they were unable to pay me. She went on to describe that they had an accountant which kept track of how much money was to be allotted as payment for tutors monthly.. which seemed counter-intuitive to me and convoluted; their departments funds should have been in excess of what they owed me for wages at that time; whatever.

My boss went on to describe that they could not pay me until the new fiscal year, which for them would be July 1st. Ok, great. So it was decided that I would contact her then. 

Fast forward to July 1st, an email is sent and I inquire as to whats next; she replies, a couple of weeks later, that my original time sheets I had turned in needed to be redone for whatever reason. Okay, no problem. I re-do the timesheets and drop them off at her house. I emailed her later that day and she confirmed that she received them. Ok, great. Or so I thought.

Fast forward to August 7th and I haven't heard from her since her confirmation of receiving the updated timesheets. By this point I am upset by the situation. I'm not depressed as I was during the school year so I am thinking clearly and experiencing things without a hazy veil (perhaps others can relate to this). I decided to call her and in being forthright asked what is happened with the timesheets? She responded that she had just arrived back from vacation the day prior and that she would communicate with her boss. She also made the cryptic remark that she / her boss would ""vouch"" for me. 

I'm starting to wonder if i'm being fucked around here, and if my former employer is hoping I will just forget about my timesheets as I go to graduate school.. I am also questioning the legality of it. Reddit I need your help as I am confused and upset about this, and I believe there are people here that are much more knowledgeable about my situation than I. 

tl;dr I didn't do my timesheets for 7 months. Finally did them. Boss fucked around with minimum communication. Nearly 3 months after turning them in, no payment. Help.

edit 1 : there has been great feedback which i am thankful for so far.. i am reading every comment so PLEASE do not hesitate to offer advice, a similar story, comments, etc..

[Your biggest ""Oh Shit!"" moment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y5vn0/i_am_ed_lu_former_nasa_astronaut_and_now_running/c5slsol?context=5)|Probably when the cooling failed in my spacesuit.  The temperature inside climbed to about about 140 degrees F within a few minutes.  Not so fun....
[I think we need to hear this full story, please!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y5vn0/i_am_ed_lu_former_nasa_astronaut_and_now_running/c5snk5r?context=5)|We were actually just getting suited up on ISS for a spacesuit test.  Yuri and I were in the airlock, and all buttoned up in our EVA suits.  Then the cooling failed in my suit.  But the suit generates a lot of heat due to the electronics and also the fact that the CO2 removal system uses an exothermic reaction to remove CO2.  So within a few minutes the airflow into my suit got really really hot (think of a parking lot in Houston on a summer day but while wearing a snowmobile suit_)
[I'm entering the 10th grade this year, and ever since I was a little kid constructing and taking things apart has always fascinated me. I began to research fields of engineering about a year ago and aerospace engineering has really interested me.  One thing that has concerned me is the budgets of NASA being cut.  With this happening how much of an impact will it have on the growth of future space exploration do you see it having in the coming years?  Also will we see more private aerospace engineering firms grow because of NASA's lack of funding?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y5vn0/i_am_ed_lu_former_nasa_astronaut_and_now_running/c5slqoz?context=5)|Glad to hear of your interest in aerospace engineering!  And I share your concern for NASA budgets, and I honestly think that NASA will have to change the way they do things over the coming years as a result.  But I'm sure they will adapt.  Private space ventures will also become more and more common.  So in the end, I'm hopeful!  Good luck!  
[Thanks! Is there anywhere I could find more information about the B612 Foundation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y5vn0/i_am_ed_lu_former_nasa_astronaut_and_now_running/c5slxfn?context=5)|[Link to b612foundation.or](http://b612foundation.or)  is our website.

How much money do you need for your various projects, and how do you intend to raise it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y5vn0/i_am_ed_lu_former_nasa_astronaut_and_now_running/c5slthn?context=5)|Since we aren't asking for government financial support, definitely our main obstacle is funding.  We intend to raise the money from a mixture of large and small donations, much like a museum or other civic project.  In fact, we are trying to raise a similar amount of money as is needed to build the wing of an art museum here in San Francisco.  If the people of San Francisco can raise enough to build the wing of an art museum, shouldn't the people of the world be able to raise a similar amount to potentially save civilization?
[Will you be ""open sourcing"" whatever designs/solutions you come up with or will they be proprietary?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y5vn0/i_am_ed_lu_former_nasa_astronaut_and_now_running/c5snx1p?context=5)|The data on asteroid orbits will be posted online for all to see.
 |The spacecraft itself will be built under what is called a fixed price contract by Ball Aerospace (makers of the Kepler Space Telescope and the Spitzer Infrared Space Telescope).  Parts of the spacecraft design will be proprietary.  
[I applied to be an astronaut earlier this year and am anxiously awaiting hearing back from NASA. I was inspired by the Microgravity University program I participated in during my final 2 years of college (even did the Vomit Comet!\); touring Johnson Space Center, the NBL, and spending time at Ellington Field was a dream come true.  What was the astronaut application experience like for you when you applied?

I got the call on the morning of Dec. 7, 1994 - they asked me if I wanted to come fly the Space Shuttle, and I was completely tongue tied.  All I could say was ""ahh, yeah!"".  
[Could you talk a bit about your experience on both the Soyuz and also the ISS? How comfortable did you get in space? Did you miss Earth and land often? How many other astronauts were there?  EDIT: Could you also talk a bit about the Mars Rover and the publicity it is getting?

[Sentinel is a 5.5 year mission, what percentage of threatening asteroids do you believe will be accurately mapped?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y5vn0/i_am_ed_lu_former_nasa_astronaut_and_now_running/c5sn40e?context=5)|The percentage actually depends on the size range of asteroids we are talking about.  We'll find more than 90 percent of asteroids larger than about 140 meters across (which translates into a roughly 100 megaton impact should they hit us).  We'll also find the majority of Tunguska sized asteroids.  
[I assume to deflect an asteroids orbit you would need to ""nudge"" it, how would we be able to do that? And when in its orbit would be the ideal time to ""nudge"" it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y5vn0/i_am_ed_lu_former_nasa_astronaut_and_now_running/c5sltad?context=5)|Nudge it is exactly right.  Just a couple of millimeters per second of change in velocity is sufficient if done early enough (decades before impact).  So that means run into the asteroid with a spacecraft or tow it with a gravity tractor.  Or both!

[Eg. we can take the case of Apophis which initially had some good impact probability, had that not been dialed down by future observations what were the options available with us at that moment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y5vn0/i_am_ed_lu_former_nasa_astronaut_and_now_running/c5slvuw?context=5)|Apophis was relatively easy to deflect since it has a keyhole passage in 2029.  A gravity tractor can easily deflect Apophis!  The necessary change in velocity is less than 10^-5 meters/second!  
[Yes, the deflection required was really small but we had no technology to do it.  The initial B612 foundation goal was to successfully deflect an asteroid by 2015, why change?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y5vn0/i_am_ed_lu_former_nasa_astronaut_and_now_running/c5smk69?context=5)|All along we believed that the necessary first step of protecting Earth (finding and tracking asteroids) would be done by someone else.  We changed goals when it became clear over the years that nobody was going to do this first step.  So we are going to do that.  
[I'm sure I've read somewhere that at some point we may be able to deflect asteroids into an earth orbit for mining purposes. Ignoring safety concerns, is that even possible?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y5vn0/i_am_ed_lu_former_nasa_astronaut_and_now_running/c5sob19?context=5)|It is only really possible for asteroids whose orbits approach very close to Earth and at an extremely slow relative velocity.  If such asteroids exist, we'll find them with Sentinel.  
[Kinetic impactor although very effective can not be effective against rubble pile, nuclear blast still has political issues, only option available right now with us is GT but that too has size and time limitations,,.

But you do have to be careful not to disrupt it!  Again though, we're talking about tiny changes in velocity (mm/sec or less).  You are correct though that there is little we can do if we only have a warning time of a few years.

We'll solve those by using the solar arrays as a sunshield: see image here:  [Link to b612foundation.org](http://b612foundation.org/media/sentinelmission) And while we will not be the first man made object placed into orbit around the Sun, we will be the first one privately done so!

As much as anything, I think having inspiring technical projects that kids can look up to is important.  Motivation is important!  (it isn't just how the schools operate)  
[Ever seen an alien spacecraft?  It's stupid I know, but my friend is obsessed with UFO's and insists nearly all astronauts have seen them.

[Hi Mr Lu, thanks for taking the time. I was wondering your opinion on how viable do you believe the endeavors of Planetary Resources to be in terms of the actual operational piece of their plan to mine asteroids, as well as the business of collecting water as fuel? Thank you!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y5vn0/i_am_ed_lu_former_nasa_astronaut_and_now_running/c5slsxc?context=5)|I'm really supportive of what they are trying to do, but their ultimate goal is clearly a long way off.  And one thing people need to realize is that Planetary Resources needs somebody to find and track all these asteroids if they hope to visit one someday.  B612 can do that. 
[Part of their plan is to discover and document asteroids using their own LEO product - will the foundation seek to share data with a private venture in the interest of better data for all parties, or does that run counter to the goals of a nonprofit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y5vn0/i_am_ed_lu_former_nasa_astronaut_and_now_running/c5sqblb?context=5)|We'll make our data open to all.

That means its distance from Earth will vary from about 30 million miles at the closest to about 170 million miles at the furthest.  For comparison, the Hubble Space Telescope is 350 miles from Earth. So at its farthest, Sentinel will be about half a million times further from Earth than Hubble!

y6q4x,0,2012-08-14,"I may end up needing to break up with my girlfriend of 8 years. Should I, or how can I resolve this situation? Please help me, this could affect my entire life.",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/y6q4x/i_may_end_up_needing_to_break_up_with_my/,"Me and my girlfriend have been dating for 8 years now, and she is absolutely the love of my life. Here's some background info. We began dating right before freshman year of highschool, and have continued ever since. In college we were in a constant long-distance relationship, which put a lot of strain on our relationship, but I just graduated and she will be graduating next month. I should note that I majored in audio production, which is extremely difficult to find a job in.

She took an internship at a hospital down in the south over this summer, and we had planned to both find work near our states biggest city (and our state is across the country from where her internship is). I had been applying nonstop for work there, when my girlfriend lets me know she changed her mind and didnt want to end up there and wanted to settle in our hometown for a while. Ok, no big deal, that allows me to continue playing with my band ive been in for a year or so. So now I have a lead on a job that I could have in a year or two teaching recording engineering at a local college, which is the first lead I've had after 80 applications nation wide. My band is also finding some momentum. We finished our first album and have begun receiving airplay from some college radios. I should note my dream and guiding goal has always been to play music, and its finally starting to pan out even a bit.

I asked my girlfriend what progress she made in applying for jobs around the area after three months of her at her internship, and she said she applied to two places (even including that big city she decided she didnt want to go to). Fucking two places.  Today she tells me shes getting a job offer down south as an exercise physiologist and wants to take it and for me to come down with her. She says she will only keep the job for two years, and wanted me to give up my band, family, and job lead to come live with her. I told her no, and that she should try to find a job around our area, considering she has a degree in health fitness and could find a job in a hospital relatively easily. She told me no, and she was absolutely going to take this job, and I told her I was absolutely not going to give up my life to live down there for two years.

She said she would be willing to keep dating as a long distance relationship during that time, but I dont know if i can do that. We've been long distance for four years now and it drove me insane. I was so relieved thinking we could begin our life together now, and I just dont think I can go another two years without a real relationship, especially now out of college.

She keeps insisting she wont be able to find a job up near our hometown, and because of how she failed to even attempt to put in effort to make our plan of being together work, I dont know if I'll even be able to trust that after those two years are up she'll be able to stick with any future plans. What do I do reddit? I'm absolutely terrified."
y6lhk,1,2012-08-13,How do I look for a job that I will probably stay at for only a year? ,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/y6lhk/how_do_i_look_for_a_job_that_i_will_probably_stay/,"So this is something I've been pretty conflicted about for a while and I would like an outside opinion or two.

Mini-Resume: I am going into my final year of college as a CS/Math major with a Economics minor. I work for my schools IT department, and did that full-time last summer. This summer I had an internship at a software development company (though I am not doing much development. sad). I also will be web-editor for the college paper and radio station. 

I live in MN, my SO is currently going to grad school in IN. We would like to move in together after I am done with school, but at that point she will only have a year left, and due to unpredictable job opportunities for her we might have to move again. Another issue is that I'm not sure what I want to go into... Software, something Mathy, IT? But that's a different thing entirely.

So here are my questions:

* Is it a good idea to move, given that it is something we both want etc...
* Should I look for jobs in both locations?
* How do I approach looking for a job that I could potentially (but not definitely) be at for only a year
* How do I approach looking for jobs in a location 600 miles away?
* Anything else I should know/do/look for? (broad, I know)

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks"

y9po1,46,2012-08-15,I hope someone got fired over this.,oboewan42,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/y9po1/i_hope_someone_got_fired_over_this/,"Like I've said earlier, I'm just the lowly summer intern here. My main responsibilities include hardware installs, implementing requests for access to shared directories (after making sure they've been approved by the proper channels), wiping old hard drives, Norton Ghost, and spring cleaning. Most of the bigger responsibilities are handled by the Indian helpdesk.

So one day, we come in and there are multiple calls from people who are BSODing at the login screen. We're a multinational corporation - I don't know how many we had here, but all told, there were at least 60 people affected by this issue. We eventually narrowed it down and found out that:

* it seemed to be limited to employee machines, not servers etc.

* it was limited to Windows XP

* it only happened to users who had left their computers on the night before, then restarted in the morning after being prompted to update (red flag here)

* safe mode worked, safe mode with networking did not

* last known good configuration worked for some people, but not others

* the BSOD error message was the same in each case: IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL, citing ""(REDACTED).sys""

So I googled (REDACTED).sys, and it belongs to a piece of software called (REDACTED). I vaguely remembered the name, but couldn't put my finger on it.

As it later turned out, that software was one of the thirty thousand monitoring suites that Managed PC (the division in charge of distributing equipment, setting up initial images, etc) decided it would be a nice idea to buy. It monitors all file transfer activity into and out of the computer (we take trade secrets really, really fucking seriously here). 

It's supposed to be ""unremovable"" in that it doesn't show up in Task Manager, or in Add/Remove Programs. As had become obvious, it installs itself as a driver...

Unfortunately, a Windows XP update broke it. Whichever guy (probably in India) was in charge of the WSUS server shit the bed, accidentally releasing the update out to the masses. The update had been pulled, but it was too late for a lot of people.

So we're reluctantly redirecting them to the Indian call center as per protocol. It got to the point where they actually put a message in their voicemail system saying something to the effect of ""If you're getting a blue screen citing (REDACTED).sys, press 2 then 4"".

And, of course, they don't even try to troubleshoot. Their first line of troubleshooting is a reimage. That's not tech support. That's insanity. Better hope those users made backups!

So I'm looking at the parent ticket info, seeing how bad the damage is. And I see that someone in one of the offices in another state had the crazy idea - why didn't we think of this? - to pop in a boot disk, rename C:\Windows\System32\drivers\\(REDACTED).sys to (REDACTED).sys.old, and see what happens.

***IT WORKED.***

We decided, screw protocol, screw Managed PC, let's just make this the go-to fix. We're fully expecting them to bite our heads off any second now, but really, it's their problem, not ours. So far they haven't even noticed.

(Unfortunately, it only worked on the desktops and about half of the laptops, the ones that are encrypted with McAfee Endpoint Encryption, which we were able to get into via a boot disk and their login credentials. The others were encrypted with ""Encryption Plus Hard Disk"", whose boot disk we were never able to get to work, and which was bought out and quietly discontinued several years ago.)

y9oxx,170,2012-08-15,Miss Elmas,MutantExtractor,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/y9oxx/miss_elmas/,"There are piles of cases in the law firm I am currently interning in that are tossed to the side. The pile is always torn up and the task is tedious to those that have been there for decades. As the intern, the job was handed over to me.

The small room where the shredder was had boxes upon boxes of cases to be destroyed. Though, as I spent the first half hour shredding, I began entertaining myself by reading what was there on the discarded cases none of the lawyers thought to take on.

The first was a case of a Miss Elmas (an alias, no one’s actual name will be posted and their address withheld). 

She lived alone in an apartment complex on a very busy avenue and sent a large manila envelope detailing her case to the firm. She moved here from a very small town where the population hardly ever hit over four hundred and she was very overwhelmed to come to such a busy area such as where she lived.

The landlord of the apartment complex gave her a very good price on the apartment as well as including heat and central air conditioning. To her, it seemed like quite the deal, and I agree. I alone pay one thousand dollars a month for my shitty apartment with my parents, and here she was, paying a mere eight hundred for her place. 

The apartment was very welcoming to her, she said she enjoyed her view from the window overlooking the area and she could see the mall and shopping centers. She liked the way the lights looked when it was night time and her neighbors were very friendly to her. 

There were no issues with the landlord at all, but she said that there was an issue at night when she went to bed. She would go to sleep early each evening to be able to make it to her full time job at the local elementary school (where she worked as an ELA teacher for students who had English as a second language) early the next day. 

However, when she awoke she would often find the window open in the living room where the view was. At first, she admitted to being unsure if she was the one who left it open or not, but after the tenth time, she was sure it was not her doing. 

The paper went on about constant annoyances she would go through inside of her own apartment. How she would have to turn the heat up in the summer because it was so cold in her place and the air conditioning was not on at all to be the cause of it. The reception in the apartment was horrid and she found herself suffering from migraines constantly while she resided within the home (they would go away once she was outside for a short time).

She told the landlord her problem and he kindly told her he would have everything fixed for her. One of the main reasons for her staying there was not only the price but the fact that the landlord of the building was so kind and willing to help his tenants without an attitude. The following week a handy man arrived and looked at everything in the apartment.

He checked for leaks in the gas that might have caused her migraines, he checked the walls, locks, floors, vents, you name it, this guy checked it out. When he came to her and she expected a list of things he fixed, all she was given was the simple explanation that her home was perfectly fine with updated equipment and the works. There was nothing he could do for things that were simply not broken and he left, charging nothing to the landlord who knew him as a good friend.

It baffled her, and she explained that after the handy man left that she felt very sick. She insisted that there had to be something wrong in the air or at least in the water to make her feel so light headed and ill. A phone call to the water district in her area only resulted with another explanation of how they couldn’t do something over one person’s complaint. No one else in the area had problems due to drinking the water or showering in it, they told her to speak to her doctor about it before coming to such conclusions.

She visited her doctor the following week and was given a clean bill of health. She had nothing wrong with her and she left just as confused as she was when she entered. It was frustrating to her and with another visit to her landlord; Miss Elmas tried to talk to him about the apartment she was renting.

“I’m sorry, Miss Elmas, but it almost feels as though you are trying to find something wrong with the apartment to sue me.” 

The landlord was obviously very leery now of her and her actions, which as I saw, he had a right to. She had a very good place to stay and perfect health, and yet continued to complain about things that could not be proven in the slightest. 

Her lawsuit was not towards her landlord, the handyman, the water district or her own doctor, but to another tenant that resided on the floor above her; a Mr. Carter.

Mr. Carter was in his late sixties and had lived in the building for twenty long years. He paid his rent on time every month and never once had a complaint filed against him over the time he stayed in his own apartment. Not until Miss Elmas moved in.

The suit stated that Mr. Carter was a disturbance and a nuisance to Miss Elmas and she was suing for physical and mental abuse as well as for damaged done to her curtains, couch, and kitchen. 

Police reports in her file were numerous and all had the same ring to them. Miss Elmas insisted that Mr. Carter was threatening to kill her and was tearing her home apart while she was at work. Since Mr. Carter was always so quiet and had no real record (aside from stealing a candy bar and some cereal when he was thirteen years old), the Police never questioned him or searched his home. Not until the twenty third report.

They searched his home and asked the man questions regarding Miss Elmas. His statement was very kind; “Miss Elmas is a lovely teacher, she teaches my granddaughter, Melody, who has trouble with her English since my daughter had come from France back to America with her French husband. I’ve never met her face to face, but I hear lovely things about how she’s helped Melody’s speech and writing. I have no idea why she insists on filing these complaints towards me, but I hope she accepts my apology for anything I might have done to upset her this way.”

Finally, the police reports were all done with. No one answered her constant phone calls over Mr. Carter and soon enough, Mr. Carter’s daughter filed a restraining order against Miss Elmas, causing her to lose her job at the school and forcing her to have to move out of her apartment and back to her home town where she stayed with her parents.

I shook my head at the file and shredded it as I read through every complaint she filed, only to come across the attachment from one of the lawyers in the firm. They had done a background check on Miss Elmas and Mr. Carter’s daughter hired a special investigator to look into her as well. The findings were chilling.

Her real name (once again, everything posted is an alias) was Belinda Stevens and she was a schizophrenic. She also suffered from dissociative personality disorder that had her under her parent’s care until she vanished from home one day with their savings. Her parents tried to find her but she had already found a way to blend into her surroundings and took on the name Miss Emily Elmas, the name of one of the doctors that took care of her back home.

She forged several certificates from her Mother to change dates and names so she could be a teacher, though how she was so fluent in French was baffling to her family. Once she was settled into her apartment, Belinda’s medication was then finally gone and was leaving her system, allowing her disorders to show and “Emily Elmas” was going to sleep, allowing the other personality within Belinda, “Joyce” to wander the area and leave the air conditioning on before allowing Emily to “wake up”.

Finally she was found and she went back home, where she then was treated for her conditions again and her parents were told to pay the Carter family a pretty penny for what their daughter had done. 

I shredded the rest of the files and saw a fresh piece of paper on the bottom, I reached for it to dispose of it and let my eyes scan over it. It was a notice from a secretary. Belinda Stevens had gone missing again and the secretary said one of the applicants for the paralegal position seemed rather odd and also seemed familiar with the firm even though she had claimed to be from out of town.

y9jdz,2,2012-08-15,I've been playing an 18khz sine wave to take revenge on the intern in the cubicle next to me. What are some ways you sneakily get back at your co-workers?,youdneverbelieveit,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/y9jdz/ive_been_playing_an_18khz_sine_wave_to_take/,"Backstory:

A few months ago, we took on a summer intern in my office. I listen to music while I work, but I have always kept it at a very respectable level. Once she started, she started complaining every day that my music was too loud. She said she couldn't concentrate whenever I had music on. She even complained to my boss about it. When he came to check it out, he couldn't see what the problem was.

The flipside of this is she talks **very** loud on the phone. It is distracting for those of us around her. Too take my revenge on the double standard, I started looping [this.](http://www.smashinglists.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/highfreq1.mp3) For those who are not aware, this is a sound that most people over twenty cannot hear. As this girl is 18 or 19 though, she can. I play it just soft enough so that she can hear it, without it causing a headache. I don't do it all day, only when she is really annoying me. 

What are ways you get revenge at work without getting caught?"
y9efo,682,2012-08-15,In the Blink of an Eye,CaseByCase,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/y9efo/in_the_blink_of_an_eye/,"You don’t need to know my whole story before reading this, but if you’re curious, start here: [Behind Closed Doors](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/y2crh/behind_closed_doors/)

Classes were still a week away, but I’d arrived at school early to move into my dorm.  My parents (I may have been adopted, but they’re still very much my parents) drove up for the day to help me set up my room.  We met up with my boyfriend, Ryan, and his mom for an early dinner, and then they hit the road.  Ryan said there was a party going on that night, and we should go.  I’m not much of a partier, but he was excited and I didn’t want to put a damper on his mood.  It was rare for either of us to be excited about much, not after the “incident” at the end of the summer.

So I dressed up, put on make-up for once, and met him at the house.  Luckily, it wasn’t too crowded, as not all of the students had arrived on campus this early in the year.  I actually started to enjoy myself, and by the end of the night I was sitting snugly on a couch, in a room with about seven other students, swapping stories and telling jokes.

I have to tell you, ever since the “incident”, Ryan has become very interested in the paranormal.  At first, I thought he was just trying to figure out what had happened to us, but he started researching more and more “true” paranormal events.  To be honest, I find it somewhat fascinating as well, but it’s also terrifying.  Maybe it’s best to stay away.

So I can’t say I was very surprised when I heard Ryan say, “Does anyone have any scary stories?  Like, *real* ones?”  I glared at him, thinking he meant to start telling everyone our story.  But he stayed quiet and waited for someone to speak up.  My eyes fell on a girl sitting across from me.  She was thin, with light brown skin and black hair.  She’d been pretty quiet all night, but when Ryan said this, her eyes widened.  She opened her mouth as if she were about to speak, when the burly football player next to her said, “Yeah, anyone hear about the one with the mental patient and the old lady?”

He went on to tell some cliché tale of some late night hitchhiker, but I kept my eye on the girl.  She looked worried and distracted the whole rest of the night, and just as everyone was leaving, I pulled her aside.

“You looked like you had something to say back there,” I said.  “Whatever it is, I’ll believe you.”

A flicker of doubt crossed her face, and I thought maybe she’d brush it off.  But she took a swig of her beer and began to tell her story:

“I’m in nursing school, and I’ve been interning at a nearby hospital over the summer.  None of the cases really stood out much, until this one guy came in about four days ago.  He had no prior history of mental illness, and his drug tests were clean, but he was having these strange hallucinations.

“The man said that every time he closed his eyes, he could see a forest, clear as day.  It sounded like a very vivid hallucination, like he was standing right there in the woods.  According to this man, it looked just like the woods he’d been camping in a few days earlier, but he wasn’t sure.  That’s not what made him get help though.  He said the woods he could deal with, but what terrified him more than anything was when he saw a figure in the distance, shrouded in fog in the depths of the forest.

“At first, he wasn’t even sure it was a figure, until the figure started coming closer.  The movement was imperceptible at first, but after about a day it was close enough that he could make out some details.  It looked like it had long, long black hair, and it was wearing a tattered, white sheet.  He couldn’t make out the face, not yet at least.

“So every time this man slept, or even blinked, he saw this scene.  He thought there could be something wrong with his eyes, but his eye doctor sent him straight to our hospital.  I think he was embarrassed that there could be something mentally, you know, *wrong* with him, so at first he didn’t want to give us many details.  Until the figure’s face came into view.

“Two days ago, I came into work, and the man was screaming his head off.  Three nurses had to hold him down and sedate him, and finally when he’d calmed down he described to us the full extent of the hallucinations.  The figure was now about thirty feet away from him, and he could see it clearly now.  Its tattered, dirty sheet hung halfway down its calves, and it walked on blistered, bare feet.  Its nails, on both the hands and feet, were long, yellowed, and jagged.  The stringy, matted hair hung straight down, stopping just above the frayed hem of the sheet.  I listened calmly as he described the hallucination, but when he got to the face, my hair stood up on end.  

“The skin was white and cracked, and the eye sockets were hollow, cavernous holes.  The mouth was filled with long, stained teeth.  They weren’t sharp, but they were numerous.  There were too many teeth to even fit in the mouth; some had poked right through the lips and kept growing, curving to fit over one another.  Even though the eye sockets were empty, he knew it was looking straight at him.

“We tried to give him treatment, but so far nothing’s been working.  We had to keep him tied down so he doesn’t try to hurt himself, and he’s been kept fairly sedated.”

She took another sip of her beer and looked straight at me, “Yesterday was my last day at the internship.  I stopped by his room as I was leaving.  He was still pretty drugged, but he asked me to come over.  I asked how he was doing, and he said, ‘It’s standing three feet in front of me now.  It’s close enough to touch…’”

I got chills when she said that.  “You don’t think it’s just a hallucination, do you,” I asked her, already knowing the answer.

“I know I don’t have much medical experience,” she replied, “but there was something about this case…  It just doesn’t seem right.  And he had this friend come in to visit a couple of times, and from what I overheard…”

She shook her head, and I knew she was done with her story.  As I left the party with Ryan, I told him what she’d said.  He listened intently, and when I was done, he asked which hospital it was.

“You have got to be kidding me.”  I was angry.  I knew he was thinking about visiting the man, and for what, to get his kicks from the poor guy’s terror?

“Casey, don’t be mad,” Ryan said, and turned to face me.  “It’s not that I think this is a joke, or a game.  We both know how scary it is when things happen that we can’t explain.  But we’ve faced the unknown before, and we made it.  I want to help other people make it.  Maybe I won’t even be able to do anything, but at least I will have tried.”

I sighed.  I knew he meant what he said, even though it was an idiotic idea.  “I’ll come with you.”

The next day, I found out the right hospital and the patient’s name from a mutual friend of the girl at the party.  Ryan and I drove out that afternoon and made it just after visiting hours had started.  When we stopped at the front desk, the receptionist said, “Oh, Matt’s getting a lot of visitors today.”

Ryan and I exchanged looks.  Could she mean the same visitor mentioned at the party?  We made our way to the hospital room.  The door was ajar, so we peered in.  A man was lying in a bed; there were restraints attached to the bed but at the moment his arms were free.  The man’s eyes were red, and he was using his fingers to keep them pried open.  He was whispering urgently with another man, sitting in a chair next to the bed.  At one point, his fingers slipped and his eyes shut briefly.  I swear I heard him say, *“It’s inches away from my face.”*

Ryan and I hovered outside the door, unsure of what to do.  It suddenly felt very wrong that we were here, good intentions or not.  Here was a man in anguish, and we had no clue how to help him.  As we turned to leave, I heard a shrill cry coming from the room.

Spinning around, I saw the man in the chair had leapt back a few feet from the bed.  His friend, still strapped to the bed by his feet, seemed to be clawing at something—or was he clawing at his own face?  His face was bloody, and in the few seconds I stopped and stared, unable to react, it became more and more mangled.

Ryan snapped out of it before I did, and called an orderly over.  More rushed in, and the man’s friend cleared the room, very distraught.  He ran his hands through his hair, and covered his mouth like he might be sick.  Presently, he noticed Ryan and me standing anxiously beside him, and glanced at our visitor badges.

“You’re friends of Matt’s?” he asked.

I hesitated before telling the truth, “No, we just thought… maybe we’d be able to help.”

The man laughed a nervous laugh, shook his head, and said, “There is no help.”

Just then, one of the nurses came out of the room.  I realized that the screaming had stopped, and I peeked in to see if Matt had been restrained.  I immediately regretted looking, and the nurse said simply, “He’s gone.”

Matt’s friend took a deep breath and closed his eyes.  He then opened them instantly, and absently reached up to pull at his eyelids with his hand.  *He has the same problem!* I thought.

“Maybe there is nothing we can do to help,” I told him pointedly.  “But you should let us try.”

The man pursed his lips, and then nodded once.  The three of us headed down to the cafeteria and grabbed a secluded table in the back corner of the room.  He introduced himself as Victor, and proceeded to tell us his tale.

“Me, Matt, and our friend Derek went camping in the woods north of here.  We’d gone camping plenty of times before, but never in this area.  So the first night, we drive as far into the woods as we can on this dirt road, and then walk a couple miles into the forest.  We find a nice, little clearing and pitch the tent.  The first night was fine, except Matt was a dumbass and spilled about half of our water supply.  We didn’t want to walk all the way back to the truck and drive back into town, so I said we should look around for a stream or something, and we’d just sterilize the water.

“So we’re all a bit spread out in the woods, looking for a stream, when I hear Derek shout.  I head on over, and Derek’s standing by this little, run-down shack, right there in the middle of the goddamn woods.  It doesn’t look like anyone’s been using it for a while, and it’s empty inside.  Derek starts looking around for a water pump, when I hear Matt come crashing through the trees.  He calls us over to the other side of the shack.  I go, but Derek keeps looking for a pump.

“On Matt’s side of the shack, there’s what looks like an old fire pit.  But right in the middle of all the ash and soot, there’s this clay pot.  Only, it’s not a pot, it’s sealed all the way around like there might be something in it.  Matt picks it up, looks at it for a minute, and then throws it to the ground, breaking it.  At that second, there’s a blinding flash of light—I thought it was lightning, but the weather was fine—and then everything’s dark for a few seconds.

“Matt says, ‘Did you see that?’  I think he’s talking about the lightning, so I say, “Yeah, that was bright, what do you think it was?”  Then I notice something on the ground where Matt dropped the pot, so I kneel down and sift through the pieces.  ‘Jeez, are these teeth?’

“’No, I mean, I think I saw someone out in the woods for a second,’ Matt said.  ‘Wait, did you say *teeth?’*  There was a handful of long, yellow teeth among the broken clay shards.  Matt and I are seriously freaking out, and Derek finally comes back over and we decide to go home.  I mean, we weren’t that scared, but since our water was low anyway…

“That night, I have this weird dream where all I see is the woods.  Not like I’m walking through the woods, but like I just have this one view, all night.  It was like the lightning strike burned the image into my retinas.  When I woke up, I could still see it when I blinked.  I talked to Matt, and he said the same thing.  Next thing I know, Matt’s here in the hospital, saying something’s walking towards him in the vision.  And then… well, you know the rest.  Only, I haven’t seen the figure yet, so I guess I’m okay for now.”

“Have you talked to Derek?” Ryan asked.

“Once a couple days later, but he didn’t want to talk about it.  He sounded scared though, so I wonder if he’s going through the same thing.  Hey, maybe he’d talk to you, let me give you his number.”

Victor jotted the name and number down, and leaned back in his chair.  He seemed pretty calm given the situation, I thought, and I wondered if that’s because it’s been all this time and he hasn’t seen the figure yet.  Then something occurred to me.

“You said it was like the lightning strike burned the image into your eyes,” I said.  “Do you remember which way you were facing when you saw the flash in the woods?”

“Uh, yeah,” Victor sounded confused.  “The fire pit was just in front of me, and Matt was standing to my left, right next to me but just out of sight.”

“Can you look around when you close your eyes?  Like, could you look down and see the fire pit?”

“I hadn’t really thought of that, let me try.”  Victor seemed uneasy as he shut his eyes.  “Okay, I see the woods, now I’m looking down and—there it is!  It’s the fire pit.  Jeez, you’re right, I’m standing exactly where I was when we saw the flash!”

I grinned.  We were actually getting somewhere.  Ryan said, “Can you look to your left?  Maybe see where Matt is?”

“I’m trying to, I think he was standing just out of sight though.""  Victor paused, his brow furrowed, eyes still clenched shut.  ""No wait—I see something.  I think it’s Matt, only he’s wearing white…?  And he’s—Oh… Oh God, no.  No!  *NO!”*

Victor jumped out of his seat, screaming at the top of his lungs.  Ryan grabbed me and pulled me away from his flailing arms.  In horror, I saw Victor scratch at his eyes, trying to tear them right out of his skull.  I couldn’t be sure, but before I looked away, I thought I saw scratches, or even teeth marks, appearing on Victor’s face, even after security guards had held his arms down.

Ryan and I were questioned, as we’d been near both Matt and Victor when they died.  There wasn’t evidence that we were to blame for any of it, so they let us go home. As we left, I overheard a nurse saying it looked like both men had scratches on their hands, like they’d been trying to fend someone, or something, off.  We sat in silence for the drive back to our dorms, but as we were getting out of the car, Ryan handed me a slip of paper.  It was Derek’s phone number.

“I’m not going to drag you into this anymore.  It’s really dangerous, and I know that now,” Ryan said.  “It’s up to you what you want to do with this.”

I took the paper. *We both know how scary it is when things happen that we can’t explain,* Ryan had said.  *I want to help other people make it.*  Without giving myself time to second-guess my decision, I picked up my cell and dialed the number.

“Hi, is this Derek?  I’m a… friend.  And I want to help.”

y9ed8,0,2012-08-15,"Got caught smoking by my old man's gf, now she won't stop asking me to tell him. What do I do?",THE_THROWAWAY_ENT,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/y9ed8/got_caught_smoking_by_my_old_mans_gf_now_she_wont/,"A little background: I'm 20, about to head back to college. My dad has been dating his girlfriend for a few years now, but they've been on-and-off throughout, and the rest of my family really doesn't like her. I usually play peacekeeper and act polite and civil toward her, because I do feel bad for her sometimes. She doesn't live with us, which will be important later on.

So this past Sunday, my dad was out of town handling a family emergency, and I had the house to myself for the weekend. So I invite a friend over to smoke, since he was about to leave for school and we wanted to sneak in one last sesh. He brings his weed (I prefer not to keep any myself) and bubbler and loads a bowl in my kitchen before we head outside. We're sitting in my backyard by the pool with some music playing in the background, we each take a hit while hiding from any potential observers, then go sit down at our outdoor table to enjoy the jams before heading back to smoke some more. 

Suddenly I hear the back door open and nearly shit myself. I grab for the bubbler and try hiding it beneath my leg before turning around to see who it was, only to find it was none other than my dad's girlfriend. She played coy, but she had seen the bag of weed on the kitchen counter before coming outside, so she knew what we were up to. She started jokingly asking what I was hiding, why we had a lighter in the backyard, then cracked a few jokes about marijuana. I was uncomfortable, I asked her what she was doing here at the house (for all she knew I was home alone, she was well aware that my dad was out of town). She said she was here to pick up some sandals or something, whatever. She takes her leave and goes back inside, but then comes right back out with the bag in her hands and drops it on the table. She starts guilt tripping me, ""You know your dad wouldn't appreciate this, not at his house while he's away."" And she was right, my dad is pretty anti-weed, and probably wouldn't be too happy to hear I brought it into his house. But she continues ""especially not since he just got you a new car"" (also true), then finally says ""I'm not gonna tell him unless I catch it again."" 

My heart's pounding as she leaves, but I figure I'm out of the woods, so I catch a breather before letting my friend finish the bowl, and we go inside to watch Lord of the Rings. All is good, dodged a bullet, etc., right? NOPE. She calls me an hour later with a tirade about how ""this puts me in an awkward position, I don't like keeping secrets from your dad, what if you got drug tested at work (I intern at an oil company. They don't drug test except during pre-employment screening, and this is my last week anyway), what if it was your little brother or a cop who caught you and not me, you have a lot to lose, etc. I think you need to tell him."" Terrified she's about to go blare the siren to my old man, I tell her that it's my mistake and that she can trust me to handle it myself like an adult, and we agree and the conversation ends. 

Everything's good, right? FUCKING NOPE. She calls me the next day while I'm at work to tell me my car's leaking oil (it was actually my dad's car, but that's irrelevant; what this tells me is that she was at our house again). I think the conversation's harmless, but then she asks ""Have you told your dad yet?"" Exasperated, I tell her no, that I had planned to do it while we were on vacation next week (which is true) because I didn't want to throw this on his plate while he's already dealing with a fragile family situation. So she agrees and drops the issue. And we all lived happily ever after. 

HAHAHA WRONG AGAIN MOTHERFUCKER. I wake up this morning to a long, ellipses-abusive text message from her: ""I want you to tell your dad while you guys are alone here in (hometown)..today...I can't keep this from him..do not think it is right to wait until others are around when he can't really talk to you..he was giving me a hard time about his bad day Sunday..and I had one also betwen you and another situation as well...I did not...so please tell him today..thank you...""

Thus far I haven't responded. What I really want to tell her is to mind her own business and let me handle it the way I see appropriate, since this is an issue between me and my father and none of her concern. Furthermore, that she needs to learn her boundaries: it's not acceptable for her to waltz into our house unnanounced like that while I'm home alone, regardless of how long she's been dating my dad. I made a mistake by bringing it to my dad's house, I can readily admit to that, but I can't suffer her holding it over me like this as though it's some great burden for her to bear, and I certainly can't have her telling him before I do.

So what is this young ent to do, reddit? How do I respond to her latest message, and how do I handle the situation with my dad? 

TL;DR got caught smoking weed where I shouldn't by my dad's meddling girlfriend, now she won't stop nagging me about telling him. What do?

EDIT: I think I might have been a little unclear. I'm not asking whether or not I should tell him, I definitely intend to. I guess what I'm asking is what do I tell her? I want it to come from me first, and I want to tell him on my own terms.

EDIT 2: I've been found out, good job Soups_Soups for catching it"

I was originally a mech. engineering student but did not enjoy it so i decided to switch over to acct/finance. I attend a private college in philadelphia (can provide more detailed information in pm). I have one internship under my belt so far with a federal department. I am willing to do a long distance co-op or take time off of school depending on the internship and time period. I am currently 21, sort of geeky, exceptional people skills, well rounded in most computer based systems (windows, mac, wm, ios, android, symbian, etc.). I have also worked in sales and as a tutor, so my people skills and ability to work with others, i would say, is somewhat well versed.

I always put things off until the last minute or until it's too late. There are so many opportunities I have missed. I could've passed first year of college and not been put on probation and held back a year, I could've worked hard and get good grades and get accepted into the civil engineering program. I could've applied to transfer to civil engineering again after I finished 2nd year. I could've, I could've, I could've... That's the only thing that I ever think about. I COULD""VE FUCKING TAKEN SHIT SERIOUSLY THE FIRST TIME AROUND INSTEAD OF FUCKING TRYING TO PUT OUT FIRES AND SITTING AROUND THINKING ABOUT ALL THE FUCKING THINGS I COULD'VE DONE.

When I tell people that I am an engineering student and is paying for school with my own money and student loans, they all look at me like I'm some kind of wonder child. So what if I take 45 credits a year? It's not the 45 credits that I want to be taking! I had a fucking plan: go to school get my BASC in Civil Engineering, get my P. Eng. and work on massive scale infrastructures around the world. Now because of my laziness and inability to commit to anything I may never see that happen.

I wish I would stop acting like I am comfortable with my life and take some fucking responsibility because deep down I know that I'm not comfortable with this at all. Some nights I go outside, stare at the stars and think about all the things that I will change tomorrow. About how tomorrow, I will get up and apply for 50 internship positions and plan out my life. Yet when the next day rolls around I am just the same person. Out pleasing my friends, wasting time, playing games and throwing my future down the fucking toilet. I fucking wish someone could come around and completely wipe my personality and habits away and reprogram me to be motivated and have 'success attitude'. But that's not how it works is it? Sitting around and waiting for a miracle doesn't work does it?"
y8u6t,8,2012-08-15,Undergrad with a lot of questions regarding internships,WYSOSERIOUS,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/y8u6t/undergrad_with_a_lot_of_questions_regarding/,"So I am about to start my second year at college major in CS, I have so far only been learning Java at school and I've also started learning Python online from Udacity. Right now the most programming related class I've taken has been the basic 201 class and we learned up to arrays, class inheritance, etc in Java. And i'm still pretty basic level in Python because I just started.

 Is this enough to start trying to look for internships? I haven't done any personal projects, but have done all projects assigned in class and some extra ones from the book. If that's not enough what should I be doing right now to get some more practice?

Where do I even start looking for internships in my area, should they be at school or online job sites or something? If I'm interested in network/information security or programming jobs (sorry if that's broad) should I be only be looking for internships in that field? If I can't find specific internships should I just look for anything Computer Science related?

I know there are a lot of intern related questions and I tried to look over them but none of them seemed to match what I was trying to say, so sorry if I'm asking questions that have been asked before.

Long post, I know, but a BIG thanks to anyone that can help me out."

About me:

I only minored in CS during undergrad (I majored in applied math and cognitive neuroscience), but have had a couple of research jobs / internships since then. My coursework was mainly in Java, but I've done most of my job-work (mostly web scraping / data formatting) in Python. I've become very fond of Python.

The situation:

I have a sort-of-offer from an interesting startup that deals with organizing and sending mobile alerts for people enrolled in medical programs. Their program is built in Java.

My perceived dilemma:

Most of the jobs that look exciting to me are more data oriented and deal mostly with some combination of python, r, or some other stats package. This job is more about building an application and is Java oriented. I'm worried that this job might make me less attractive to the future jobs that I'm interested in. On the other hand, I'm ecstatic to have received an offer for a developer position - most places flat out tell me that I really need a BS in CS to be considered.

How possible is it to transfer from an application oriented job focused around Java to a more data driven job using languages that I'm happier with?"

:--|:--
[Who picks what gets played? Especially when it comes to new songs. Does the next big ""hit"" get decided long before it's ever played? Some times I hear the ""latest"" from an artist and it's a total pile of crap. It ends up playing over and over. Eventually it does go away, how is that decision made? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5szfql?context=5)|Record labels pick which songs are released as singles, that's what we get to play. As for who makes the decisions on what we play, that comes down the line from corporate. Before that, we would use music tests to find out what our listeners wanted to hear, and follow national trends. The radio industry is full of copycats.
[This explains very well why I hear the same shit on the radio all the time.  I wish they would go back to those music tests.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5szm5o?context=5)|We do too.
[Has being a DJ ruined any songs for you? I imagine hearing a song repeatedly everyday during the week would take it's toll. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5sz8bg?context=5)|Honestly the worst part about it is seeing how the industry is run. People don't pick popular music anymore, they're given it.
[This is what I've often thought about the larger music industry; since acts are simply shipped to the masses arbitrarily, rather than based on what the people themselves asked for.  Have there every been any cases of a wide disparity between what gets played and what gets requested?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5szd53?context=5)|For me, yes, but that's typically because people request older songs, and we're a new music station.
[Does this even extend to ""specialty"" shows?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5sznlu?context=5)|I'm not sure what you're asking...but based on how I read that yes. We have a prerecorded request show we air every weekend.
[So you're regularly pumping out music that people aren't asking for? That seems absurd.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5szgob?context=5)|At any given time, I have over 100k people listening, conservatively. I get maybe ten phone calls an hour if I'm not giving out prizes. Why let less than 1% dictate the music for all?
[I'll use some examples from local stations.  Alternative Rock Station has a DJ that does weekly metal show (different from their regular format\)  Adult Contemporary Station has a weekly ""Next big thing- Indie and local show""  Local Americana station (independent station\) does weekly Cosmic Cowboy show.  Are those programs (not standard programming\) unable to pick the music or are they still issued specific programming guidelines?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t0bzy?context=5)|I don't know 100% because every station is different, especially locally owned ones, but my guess would be the music is all preselected, possibly a few requests that fit the show if it's a request hour.
[If I may.  Do you think that those ten callers are represenative of more than just themselves?  ie: one person may login to walmart.com and give a great review of a product, but there were many more that use it, think its great, but are too lazy to say anything.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t0sbj?context=5)|No, because it's usually something like ""so and so died can you play.."", ""man I haven't heard achy breaky heart in awhile, can you throw that in?"" or a 12 year old that wants to hear Taylor swift. I understand where you're coming from and I used to think that too, until I started fielding the calls.
[Are radio stations freaking out about Pandora/Slacker/Spotify?  EDIT: for proof, how about a pic of the swag closet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5sz8ix?context=5)|For the most part, no. They look at it as satellite radio again and we weathered that storm. They're more worried about the switch from arbitron to people meters for ratings. But it terrifies me, I use stitcher constantly.
[What artist/song do you hate the most playing? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5szpor?context=5)|Anything about Jesus, the soldiers, or 9/11.
[I imagine that getting into being a DJ requires a fairly decent love of music, so I have to ask--how hard is it to play the crap we hear over the good stuff you love, but not many people have heard?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5szc6y?context=5)|It was hard at first, but now I just accept it. It helps that I work with a genre of music I'm not emotionally attached to also.
[As someone who gets very emotional about music, I'd like to know if that's what got you into the radio industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t0ie1?context=5)|I got lucky, I knew people who worked at a radio station, started working there and fell in love. Up until that point I ha never even thought about it as an option.
[Can you expand on what you mentioned before in terms of listeners choice/calling in requests that you mentioned in the other thread. What actually is going on? Is the playlist set for the day and how do day to do operations work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5szj3u?context=5)|The playlist is preset day to day. The only time you can get requests in is during a request hour, and only about 3-5 songs in that hour are actual requests, depending on the station. Where I'm at, all of the request hours are handled by the pd, the head of the station.
[Follow up: so when radio stations started putting ""the last song they played"" up on their websites, it's nothing new and exciting, they just reveal them one track at a time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5szx6r?context=5)|It is exciting, because it doesn't just go by the computer system. If I have to run a song on a cd, it'll still show up on the ""last previously played"" thing. Well, I think that's cool at least.
[So what do you do when you're in a bad mood. I have worked with radio DJ's in the past and they almost always seem to be in good mood. Just making jokes constantly.  How do you stay happy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5szkki?context=5)|I listen to stand up when I'm on the air a lot to get the positivity going. Believe it or not, a lot of djs are actually pretty miserable.
[Same with stand-up comedians.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t24gp?context=5)|I'm actually a big fan of stand up, I always try to interview them when I can.
[So is clear channel a bad, or a really bad employer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5sz76k?context=5)|I've never worked there personally, but several of my coworkers have an they have nothing nice to say. In my experience, all corporate radio companies are pretty bad.
[Do you play radio hits or underground stuff? where do you spin?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5sz3zl?context=5)|I'm corporate radio, I don't want to say where so I can speak freely without fear of being fired.
[Ahhh... what kind of music do you play?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5sz6bs?context=5)|I play country music, and I'm a redditor...I really wish I was on a different format.
[Do you ever dj for clubs in your free time? if so, do you like it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5szraz?context=5)|No, that's a completely different type of djing. Some of my coworkers do, and they love it more than radio, and you can make a killing, especially if you do both.
[Did you just checkout the Reddit front page ?  Scumbag Radio stations can you elabvorate why do they do that ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5sztin?context=5)|Yeah, it's that's what started this AMA. It's a business model. This happens on top 40 type stations the most. The thing is, most people want to hear the popular song, but they only listen for 15-20 minutes at a time on average, so the station is set up with that in mind. Meanwhile a lot of your classic rock stations that do have listeners that listen longer often times have no repeats all day.
[Interesting..  may i ask ,  How do you get the license to broadcast the music, do you (the station\) need a license to edit/broadcast a song ? how much do you have to pay the copyright owners ? how long does it take you to remix/adapt a song ?  where do you get the transition tracks(i mean the short music between advertisements and programs \), do you guys do them in the station or get them somewhere else ? How long have you been working in the radio station full/part time, also are you a student, have a degree ? how's the pay ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t048m?context=5)|We have to be licensed through the FCC, and we also have two pay 2 different unions for songwriters/artists, can't remember both of them but one is called ASCAP, and idk how much we pay, but it's a lot. I don't deal with remixes, that's usually for top 40 or hip hop stations. All we do is pitch the music up. We make all of our imaging in house, that's what we call what we play in between songs. I've worked in radio for five years, full time for 3, and the pay is crap so I'm going back to school.
[How about the pay ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t0dxx?context=5)|Insulting.
[No problem dude.  As a college radio dj, reading about life inside corporate radio bums me out hard.  It's good to know that nobody really likes the way things are though.  Hopefully the corporate assholes running the show will come to the light eventually. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t193y?context=5)|I doubt it. They're wall street, so they're always trying to boost revenue to boost stock prices, and streamline the process to have more control. One of the guys on our wildly successful morning show makes less than manual laborers.
[What is your day to day schedule like? Standard 9 to 5 or weird working hours?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t01t6?context=5)|Weird working hours. I work graveyard and spot fill in. I work like midnight-5am on the air during the week. I'll occasionally fill in for the morning show producer or for the board op on another one of our stations, but thanks to technology I can edit audio at home.
[What is the overhead cost to run a radio station? What has the overall market trend been when it come to listener numbers over the past few years? Is this high expense and dwindling ears that drive the stations to play the same 5 songs over and over? Does this actually get them listeners?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5szj4o?context=5)|I don't have any idea how much it would cost to run a radio station, but actually we've been really successful where I'm at. The reason you hear the same song over and over again is because radio is all about the masses. People want to hear the popular song, so they play it a lot because they're trying to let everyone hear it, and most people don't listen to the types of station that has that kind of a set up unless they're at work.
[What's the deal with ""all request lunch"" or any version of that title? Can you really play anything requested?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5szjl2?context=5)|No, you still pick and choose. I work at a new country station, so those are the requests I try to fill. You'll never get me to play billy ray Cyrus for you.
[I've always had this feeling that oldies stations and classic rock stations play somewhat outside of the pop station rules, because they're dealing mostly with artists that are no longer putting out new music.  Any idea if that is actually the case?  Is there any more leeway there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5szv26?context=5)|That's part of it, but you're also dealing with a completely different type of listener. Top-40 stations have listeners that tune in in there car, or getting ready in the morning, and listen for much shorter periods of time. Meanwhile the older generation can sit and listen to the radio for hours on end.
[Knowing what you know now, would you still be a DJ if you got a mulligan?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5szcnd?context=5)|That's a tough question. I love my job, I love the people I work with...but I left college for a high risk job with a low pay ceiling. As one of my coworkers puts it, working in radio is taking the vow of poverty. All things considered, no, I've gotten to do some once in a lifetime things that'll I'll never forget.
[How did satellite radio change your job, if at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5szd3n?context=5)|It really hasn't, but I work for a very successful station with a dedicated listener base, that tends to be older and less tech savvy.
[Hey mate, I'm currently doing my certificate in media and broadcasting and was wondering if you had any dos and don'ts for a young start out?  Good relationships to build? industry knowledge? good habits to get into?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t0kro?context=5)|Be nice to everybody, don't be mean to anybody. You have to be willing to work harder than anyone else, and be willing to work for free, because you probably will for the first year or so. And most importantly, never let anyone feel threatened by you, everyone in radio is incredibly insecure.
[So one of our local stations has this thing they call 'Barrel of Monkeys' wherein listeners call in with a song request that starts with the letter the last song ended with. I have always suspected this to be a marketing ploy to increase listener loyalty and that the DJ just has a list of acceptable songs that start with certain letters and he just waits to get a caller who names one of those songs on the list. This gives the illusion that the listeners are choosing the songs when they really aren't at all. Am I at all accurate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t0eoq?context=5)|Each station is different, but radio stations use actors all the time. They can also edit their voice to sound like someone else.
[Another question, what do you think of low-power FM and pirate radio stations? Have you ever heard a pirate radio station in your area?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t0eoq?context=5)|I'm unfamiliar with jack fm stations like that, but no djs doesn't mean more music, it means more profit. Most of the time I'm only talking over song intros/outros.
[EDIT: Have you heard of Jack FM? They seem to have a nationally syndicated common feed channel with no DJs and a bunch of transmitters scattered all across the US that are VERY poorly maintained as can be inferred from their regular blackouts, distorted transmissions, and poor reception at the fringes. They claim that because they have no DJs they can play more music but in reality they have just as much commercials if not more as normal radio stations. What do you think of such a radio station?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t0eoq?context=5)|I'm pro listening to you want, whether that be terrestrial radio, pirate radio, etc. when I'm listening to something for enjoyment, it's a podcast.
[*I'm only talking over song intros/outros.*  So you're one of *those* assholes. Why do DJs do this? You ruin the song when you talk about nothing while the music plays in the back. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t1z68?context=5)|We do that so we don't have to stop the music. The theory is once the music stops people will change the station.
[That's no reason to talk over the entire first minute of Baba O'Riley or the last three minutes of Layla. Why can't you just crossfade the songs? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t27xe?context=5)|Because we have stuff we need to talk about. One way companies advertise is with live reads.
[I think a stronger theory is that once the commercials start people will change the station. Live reads are easily recognizable as commercials.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t2ddh?context=5)|But if I talk about it over the first minute of baba o'reily, you don't change the station.
[Have any good caller stories?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t10s8?context=5)|One time I got a girl to come blow me while I was at work. Facebook has really changed the game in radio.
[Do labels pay to have their artist's songs played on the radio? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5szk83?context=5)|Of course not, that's highly illegal...whether or not it actually happens, idk, our music is decided by one guy at corporate.
[While I agree that it's wrong, why is it illegal? Can you point us to any precedence?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5szw76?context=5)|It's called payola, and it's against the law. There is also plugola, and that prevents trading goods for airtime. This extends to the jocks too, I can't plug dominoes if they give me free pizza.
[What do you do when the song is on? Just listen, read a book, Reddit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t0mjt?context=5)|Listen if it's new and I don't know it, otherwise I listen to podcasts or stand up to help me keep my energy/positivity high. Don't reddit too much though, imgur is blocked at work :/
[Have you had to do anything that you truly regret doing at work?  For example:  a rigged contest or a canned interview you made people believe was live?  (You tell me yours and I will tell you some of mine.\)  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t0hsq?context=5)|One time I didn't give the acid enough time to wear off.
[Is everyone at your place crazy too? Especially production people.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5sz9rp?context=5)|That's why I love my job, I'm accepted.
[Why can't my favorite band, even if I call 100x a day to request it, get played?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t057u?context=5)|Because after you called back the 2nd time to complain about not hearing it yet we hate you.
[I'm in sales and have always been intrigued by radio air sales. I've heard it's extremely cut throat but the pay can be absolutely killer. Can you comment on this? how to get into it, what the reps are like, etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t0mi7?context=5)|It's really easy to get into radio sales, and that's where all the money is, but it's mostly or all commission so it's all on you. A lot of cold calling, a lot of hitting the pavement...I don't really know to much about the day to day of sales, on air an sales are different breeds of people.
[Great IAMA, btw.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t0mi7?context=5)|Thanks! This throwaway is already more popular than my real account in less than a day haha.
[I've been working at a radio station for almost 2 years (Cumulus Portland, ME\) and I'm finding corporate to be a big pain in the ass. They think that making all their stations pratically the same across the board is a good thing. Cumulus has replaced our best jocks/shows with syndicated crap (i.e. Perez Hilton\). Why do you think corporate does stuff like that? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t366o?context=5)|You poor bastard, I've heard nothing good of cumulus.

 |I would have to assume its a mixture of micromanaging and trying to maximize revenue. If they can make more money with lower ratings, they will.
[What can you tell me about the audio file formats used in your on-air system?  Are they MP3?  If so, do you know the bit rate?  And thanks for answering all these questions.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t1hs9?context=5)|Idk the bit rate, but we use PCM wav files.
[I'm impressed!  I thought for sure that stations owned by ""the man"" would use some low bit rate MP3s in order to maximize storage space.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t1p8u?context=5)|Just because it's run by the man doesn't necessarily mean the man knows what he's doing.
[As someone who is planning on going into radio after they graduate, what do you suggest that I do so that I can get a leg up? I am doing internships, and I am doing the college radio station, but is there anything else.  How competitive is the industry?  Any mistakes that you have made that I can avoid?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t16h7?context=5)|The industry is incredibly competitive, the best advice I can give you is to not go into it, but since that's a bummer, become very familiar with computers and editing audio. Get a copy of adobe audition if you can, it's a great program.
[Do you ever listen to the radio yourself in your car or at home? Because to be honest I can't really do radio, the commercials and advertisements kill me, i bought a head unit a while ago that i plug my iPod into and have full control of it that way.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t00on?context=5)|The only time I listen is when I'm trying to improve by listening to other jocks. Other than that, no, I listen to podcasts. That's also helped me, I've been able to book guests I wouldn't have been able to otherwise.
[Are you in a large or small market?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5szd28?context=5)|Medium, haha.
[Are segments ever prerecorded or is there always someone there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t0351?context=5)|No radio is moving to more prerecorded stuff, jobs are being cut left and right.

[As a radio DJ can you tell me why ALL of you are so fucking annoying?  Do you think people actually like to hear your retarded jokes?  Also why do all of you have the most retarded ""DJ"" names?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t1o7l?context=5)|My boss gave me my dj name because my last name is a bitch to pronounce I'm with you, I don't think all that hoky dj stuff is funny, but it's really hard to be funny when you're censored by the FCC, the advertisers, the listeners, and the boss, but a lot of people think that stuff is hilarious.
[How did you get this job? Do you have a degree in anything?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t1atp?context=5)|No degree, got the job through luck and hard work. Degrees really don't help you in radio. That being said, I'm incredibly poor and going back to college.
[The current state of terrestrial radio is dying a gruesome death and more people are moving to the internet. Hell, I haven't listened to over the air radio in months because it's the same garbage every single day. I have moved to online radio and couldn't be happier. I have a receiver at home with wi-fi and an aux jack in my car for my smart phone and the tunein app. People can only stomach the same shit everyday for so long. I for one can't and will not stomach it any longer.  I estimate the current state of terrestrial radio will mostly dissipate within the next five to ten years. Especially with the deep financial trouble the big radio stations are in. They are in the red. How much longer do you give it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t035l?context=5)|Again, it depends on each station. Mine is thriving and just had its best ratings since like 96, and we always do well. Terrestrial radios saving grace is it's ability to be involved in the community, and the ability to give out prizes. Internet radio can't get you front row seats or backstage at the local concerts.
[I hate country music, but maintain that there might be at least a few good musicians in the genre.  you said you're not a fan of country... anything you play that you DO like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t0jl6?context=5)|It's not that I'm not a fan of country, I'd actually say country has some of the best musicians and vocalists in the business. My favorite mainstream band is the Zac Brown Band. Check I'm out, they're amazing.
[How live are ""live"" morning shows?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t04sy?context=5)|That depends. Local ones are live, syndicated ones are moved around. For instance one of our stations morning shows is syndicated, and we start it 2 hours late.
[Just like how some/many McDonalds employees don't like eating McDonalds, outside of work do you enjoy listening to the music that you play at work despite hearing it many times?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t01vy?context=5)|Yeah, I used to listen to country a lot, now I rarely listen to it outside of work, unless I'm in a different market.
[So looking at all of this, it seems there's really no way to provoke change in the industry. What would you say are the major flaws of the industry? What would you do to change them, or what are some changes you'd like to see? If there would be a way to start change, how could we go about it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t3lf4?context=5)|I'd like to see people get more involved with the industry with their dollar, that's the only way these guys at the head will correct their paths. The biggest problem with radio right now is the same problem with America, both are run by the same type of people.
[I am a radio DJ at my school, and I love it.  Our FM can only broadcast within 5 miles. But people can stream it online.  I really love doing it too, it brings out my inner personality.  I want to do cooler things with it in my station, but we don't have the equipment or the money for it.  So my favorite radio station is Radio 104.1 WMRQ (Alternative\) and they have a bunch of cool effects, like they have the recording that says in a deep voice RADIO 1041 WMRQ. I'm sure you know what I mean, but how do they do it? Do you have have it on your board as a button? Or is it all timed? I can re-word if you find this confusing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t42y5?context=5)|All of our imaging is preproduced and scheduled along with the music. In order to make a jingle like the one you're talking about, we would just make it using adobe audition using filters in the voice possibly, and adding all the little extra noises you hear.
[Oh wow that's really cool!  I've always wanted to visit my local radio stations to see what they are like.  Does your station come up with creative DJ names?  How do they decide?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t4a8r?context=5)|No, the formula is usually just 2 first names. My boss made mine in all of a minute.
[What is your favourite artist(music\)? What is your favourite album/ song? What is your favourite genre of music?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t8rb3?context=5)|I like a wide variety of rock and country, lately I've been into honeyhoney, I love there song back to you.
[Is it common practice to speed up the playback of songs? I'm pretty sure I've noticed it on my local rock station.  If so, what's the motivation? More time for advertising?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t1aq3?context=5)|I'm not sure, it could be because they think it improves sound quality. We pitch up all of our music.

[How should a independent artist go about submitting music to radio? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t1p3o?context=5)|Get a record deal :/
 |99% of the music we're given goes directly into the garbage, the rest are saved to be mocked. The only exception is if your station has an unsigned segment, then you would need to get on there website and find out how to submit your stuff.
[Thanks for the reply. My area has a local radio station (big market\), and they do play a decent amount of unsigned artists. But what I've been hearing is that it's payola (like $350\) a slot. Is there anything that could be done about this? Or should the artist give in to the ""pay to play"" mindset?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y7cyr/iama_radio_dj/c5t1zcc?context=5)|Look into it, if it's payola make a complaint with the FCC, but they could just remove that segment entirely. It may not be payola though with legal jargon, there are ways around payola and plugola laws.

For instance, Chris young is a country musician and he released a song called voices that didn't get much traction on the charts. After he had a couple of hits under his belt, he rereleased voices a couple of years later and became a number 1 on the country billboard.

ycfjb,11,2012-08-16,Internships abroad?,Learfz,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/ycfjb/internships_abroad/,"I'm not sure if this is the best place to ask, but I'm still in school so expatriating isn't an option even if I did think it through and decide I wanted to. I'm a computer science student going into my junior year, and after finishing this year's internship I'm starting to look ahead to next summer. Never too early, right?

Anyways, I really want to spend some time abroad before I graduate, but don't have any room in my schedule for a semester abroad or any of the other usual ways to spend some time outside of the US. So I thought an internship abroad might be a good idea. Is it feasible? I've heard good things about New Zealand, Australia, and Canada; I just don't know where to start.

Any suggestions? Thanks in advance."

yb3m6,1,2012-08-16,Nightmares of an Overactive Mind ,yoshi_indo,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/yb3m6/nightmares_of_an_overactive_mind/,"
This week has been a tough one for me, a rather abrupt break-up from a reasonable relationship, the conclusion to a great internship at an advertising firm I thoroughly enjoyed, my $60 earphones are beginning to die, and all this happening along with sudden attacks of sleep deprivation. Just another ordinary week for the soon to be working drone. I am not a spectacular person, I do not have an extraordinarily troubled past. In fact my family is somewhat well off and I felt I had a decent future, no matter how dreary life can become my mind will always find a way to physically and mentally alleviate the pain. Sadly life has a way of bringing down your life, no matter what denominator you belong in. 

After arriving to work on a Monday I sat my desk as usual and began a marketing research I had for an airline company, it was then that my ever constant Facebook tab chimed, it was my girl friend and as stated she decided to break up with me over the internet.  This brought a sudden rush of emotion as I struggled to consolidate my feelings and thoughts; I tried drowning out the sudden void in my heart with my work, and reading a whole pages worth of nosleep. 

That night as I climbed to bed weary of this morning’s events, I began my nightly ritual of recalling the day’s events to find a soothing memory to put my mind at ease. I glanced at my bed side LED clock, its dimly lit green numbers pulsated gently; 1:30. I closed my eyes and instinctively began to rummage my mind for something to cling to, to my dismay all I could recall were the harsh memories of my emotional void, I struggled to drive my mind’s eye from the feeling of emptiness this memory evoked. I struggled to deviate my mind, when I managed to break the chains of this abject memory I could only vividly remember the description of a particular apparition on nosleep. Having a somewhat overactive imagination I would have normally regarded this to be a horrible idea to put my mind in a calmer state, but it was sure better than the dark emptiness that occupied my mind presently. I began to recall the chilling details of its material visage; A pale faced clown wearing a suit, then in detail;, it’s wild frayed hair, its incessantly wide smile on its thin red lips where sharp crooked teeth overflowed from its abnormally huge mouth. Most of all what stuck with me were the description of its eyes; huge dark eyes, unblinking, devoid of empathy, and completely black (I thought this clichéd when I read the post but creating a mental picture in the middle of the night made me realize how effective it was). The face stared at me as I began to feel my body numbing getting ready to shut off. I quickly realized that I was headed toward sleep paralysis, but  my body had already gone numb and all I could do was keep my eyes open, its demented smile still stayed in front of me. 

I saw behind its cruel face my clock; 1:39, and began to furiously will my body into my submission.  The face began to twitch and smile, it knew it had control and my disarrayed state of mind only fed the evil persona I had created for it. It whispered softly “it’s not your fault, its mine”, it began to dredge up the void I desperately sought to forget. My eyes watered and I wanted to scream but I knew it to be futile, it kept repeating the phrase 

“it’s not your fault, its mine”

“it’s not your fault, its mine”

“it’s not your fault, its mine” ….”Mine”…”Mine”

I suddenly realized that I still had no control over it, blood rushed through my body as I began to panic, it began to laugh a chilling shrill laugh reminiscent to that of the Jokers I couldn’t breathe I just wanted to move out of there into a reality I could control. My heart thumped hard as its demonic laughter filled my mind, it was then I realized the sudden spike in adrenalin had allowed me to feel my fingers again, at that point I knew the paralysis would end soon. As I slowly regained control of my limp body, its laughter slowly died and its once pale face grew dim. I now only stared at my clock, the adrenaline and fear slowly ebbing away; 1:46.

The next morning I pried my eyes open forcing the gritty sand falling out of the corners of my eyes, as my alarm clock played its repetitive tune;7:05. I attributed last night’s event to my fragile emotional state, and told myself that today was a new start. So I did my duties at work (this time was research on tourism), forcing myself to only read a couple of nosleeps, instead I erad about some masked festivals around the world relating to tourism, lest my overactive mind uses other people’s experiences against me again. 

1:40 flashed before my eyes my clocks light softly emanating on my face as it seemingly to caress my face. I thought of the merriment I could have been having at one of those masked festivals the cheering, the bright colours…the pale porcelain masks. Just like that I knew I would lose a few minutes of sleep. I steeled my mind as I fought to conjure the horrible images from last night, I felt my body grow extremely warm and all manner of creatures flash before my mind; Slendermen, Rakes, ghosts, blood caked murderers, and even a particularly odd image of a bunny masked splicer (essentially a crazy man with blood on his clothes) from the game Bioshock. I tried to quickly flush my mind, but even as I cleansed the horrifying ghouls from my mind’s eye one creature remained, it’s twisted smile ever present. I stared at my clock, 1:44, hoping to focus on its solid form, its absolute numerical contents to anchor my thoughts. 
It was 2:37 I yearned for the solace of sleep, yet every time I closed my eyes I saw its empty ones staring back at me, its previously pale skin now attaining a porcelain doll like sheen.  When I opened my eyes I felt it waiting for me to enter its domain, I felt eyes peering into me from the dark recesses of my room as all the silhouettes of furniture in my room began to grow human like curves, their crouched forms waiting to be unleashed when my mind would slumber. 2:45, My eyes were heavy but the torment continued, it was strange mental dance with the silhouettes in my room and the porcelain face in my mind’s eye. 2:54, I had trouble distinguishing when my eyes were closed or open, I fought the creeping haze, the once comforting blackness of sleep. The face was clearly visible in front of me now playfully biting its lower lip in anticipation; I was in its domain. I found myself in an empty void standing on nothing my only companion a floating porcelain mask, playfully danced around me its voice now having a static filtered edge “wake up, please wake up” it taunted me. 

I awoke with a gasp feeling the sudden jolt as I found myself getting out of my bed like a bat out of hell. Immediately I felt something was off I couldn’t put my finger on it until I saw the silhouettes in my room began to unfold pick themselves up and move toward me. I closed my eyes and prayed and begged for it to be over, I felt my body go stiff as I began to fall under my floor into my bed. My heart beat like a drum I couldn’t breathe… I couldn’t move. I stared up into the face of a fat man wearing a bunny mask, he was motionless just sitting on my chest (somehow not crushing me in the process). The face appeared out of the darkness behind the man and began laughing, it kept laughing as I powerlessly watched it edge closer to me its porcelain face now shifting between its smooth texture and that of leathery skin as the creases on its demented face stretched to make all manner of indescribable shapes. I wanted to know what it wanted,just as I thought of that it asked me “What would you like me to do?”. I then remembered that it was still a figment of my imagination, but no matter how hard I tried to banish into my subconscious, the fear within my brain would begin to think it impossible, my fear made it stronger. It was a strange realization being completely helpless, while simultaneously being in control of/to ones enemy. I felt the adrenaline kick in again and I smiled inside knowing that this nightmare would soon come to an end, as it sensed my victory the face just smiled and said “you cant run from your mind”, just as he said that the giant man sitting on me began shifting his weight as if it were trying to disrupt the flow of liquids in my body. I panicked as I thought I would b trapped in that hell forever, I move with all my might but managed only to blink. It was enough I just shut my eyes, though I still saw the face floating incessantly in front of me, I didn’t have to deal with the somewhat physical manifestation of a man stop the flow of blood in me. Slowly I tried to calm my mind and move my fingers. The face stopped laughing but still maintained its smile as suddenly felt my thumb come alive, my fingers soon followed and finally the face vanished into the ether. I looked at my clock, 3:10, what seemed like an eternity in hell was only 15minutes of real time. 

I didn’t sleep the rest of the night as I decided to wait for the sun to rise.

I dread what may come tonight, but from last night I learned to fear my mind for what you experience within it is still experience no matter how unreal it is. Remembering dreams used to be a little goal I set for myself, but for today it was the exact opposite. I can only hope to purge the corners of my mind of the events happening these last few nights.

If you don't have a golden hue, the sun is the place to go.
 |Heat, however, comes from the molten center of the Earth. A mountain top is far from the Earth's center, and therefore colder. However, the isolation means you can strip away your climbing clothes and finally lose those tan lines.
[Why are mountain tops not golden then?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y9p22/iama_fake_scientist_ill_answer_questions_about/c5towcy?context=5)|A mountain top starts much paler, so what you see is more tan than it would be, but still not as tan as a person.

 |Assuming it is a non-holiday Wednesday, we could actually test this by periodically sending nuclear reactors in the general direction of Jupiter. Once we are able to see broadcasts from Jupiter, like radio, television, and the occasional joke blog, it will be safe to assume the planet is powered and has developed an appropriate economy in response. Then we would blow up the reactors, of course, to control the threat.
[Are the pieces of gravity on Jupiter really 10 times the size of the ones here on Earth?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y9p22/iama_fake_scientist_ill_answer_questions_about/c5to3s8?context=5)|That's one of the reasons it's difficult to land there because a gravity chunk could hit a rover.

[Follow up: How girl get pragnent?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y9p22/iama_fake_scientist_ill_answer_questions_about/c5tlny1?context=5)|&gt;Who hasn’t wondered, when sitting in a library or on a crowded airplane flight, where all these babies come from?
 |&gt;It all begins with a stork. Imagine a nest in the wild as the sun rises. A stork flies in from the distance, his eyes intense. There is work to do. The stork brings babies to parents without fail and, from that point on, life begins. However, this is only true when the babies are baby storks.
 |&gt;For humans, babies begin when a male’s sperm attacks the female egg. These sperm contain a male’s genetic information and are strongly sexually attracted to the egg. The egg contains a female’s genetic information and is less attracted to the sperm but chooses one anyway because it’s too lazy to keep waiting. If the sperm and egg are in love, based on a relationship of mutual support and respect, they create a new baby.
 |&gt;This new baby contains the genetic information, or “flaws,” from both of the parents. This is one of the reasons it is born bald and crying. It begins to grow in the stomach of the female mother, since the man’s stomach is hairier and might cause the baby to choke. Growth continues and the woman starts consuming more food in order to compensate for the creature growing inside of her. It’s recommended that women not drink during pregnancy, since it’s difficult to know whether the baby prefers beer or liquor.
[I should have dropped out of school and just bought your book.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y9p22/iama_fake_scientist_ill_answer_questions_about/c5tmkdp?context=5)|There's still time to enroll at a new school and then drop out.
[How do we know you are a fake scientist and not a real one? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y9p22/iama_fake_scientist_ill_answer_questions_about/c5tl5hl?context=5)|You may have discovered something called a ""paradox,"" which is a word that means someone has too much time to kill.

One of the funniest books I've read in a while.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y9p22/iama_fake_scientist_ill_answer_questions_about/c5tkupt?context=5)|In seriousness, I think that even for real scientists, the world is more confusing than ever. Let's say you're James Watson. You probably understand almost everything about DNA. Maybe not the cutting edge stuff, but you're an absolute genius. Now put James Watson on Skype.

[Also, how much wood can a woodchuck chuck?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y9p22/iama_fake_scientist_ill_answer_questions_about/c5tky2o?context=5)|According the recent research on woodchuck woodchucking, it depends on the woodchuck's size, chuckability, and preference in wood taste. On average, however, if a woodchuck could chuck wood, a woodchuck would chuck 3 trees an hour, which is why they're a key cause of global warming.

 |The sound they make travels in waves, but those waves have to be registered by an ear (this is the same reason seashells make the noise of waves when you put them to your ear). For that reason, our final answer is no, unless the tree is near an ocean.
 |Please, go into a secluded forest today to give a tree a chance at a dignified death.
[If a tree fell down in a forest and there was nobody around to hear it, would a wood chuck could chuck wood?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y9p22/iama_fake_scientist_ill_answer_questions_about/c5tl128?context=5)|The wood chuck's woodchucking is insatiable.

[Are there parallel universes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y9p22/iama_fake_scientist_ill_answer_questions_about/c5tljyj?context=5)|We cover this extensively in the book. Not only are there parallel universes, but in some parallel universes, parallel universes are perpendicular.

[Can you explain gravity to me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y9p22/iama_fake_scientist_ill_answer_questions_about/c5tlgbh?context=5)|Again, some complex scientific questions are best addressed by our earlier research in the book. Let us know if you have specific questions.
 |&gt; All of us have experienced gravity, since it’s one of the primary forces behind tripping. If you want to explore gravity, try throwing this book in the air and seeing if it stays there or drops to the floor.
 |&gt; What is gravity? Generally, gravity comes from the fact that smaller forces are attracted to larger forces, which is why belly-flop competi- tions are usually won by heavyset people. The moon is bound to the Earth through gravity, the Earth is bound to the sun through gravity, and the sun is bound to its position because it’s too heavy to move. As we get further from gravity’s source, its pull weakens. Try dropping the book off a tall building or a bridge; in addition to giving a passerby some knowledge, you’ll see how gravity changes.
 |&gt; Where does gravity come from? Scientists continue to debate the issue, frequently in midair. Einstein argued that gravity comes from the curvature of space and time, which explains why all of the planets are round. It also explains why going in circles makes you dizzy, because of the additional gravity. If gravity changes, a square Earth may be in our future. The San Andreas Fault could easily become a corner.

[Dear Mr. Senior Fake Scientist,](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y9p22/iama_fake_scientist_ill_answer_questions_about/c5tlxx0?context=5)|Sadly, that depends on the gravitational tides. These tides can be hard to determine, so keep your Richter scale and boogie board with you at all times.

I wasn't paying attention in my science class.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y9p22/iama_fake_scientist_ill_answer_questions_about/c5tlnn5?context=5)|Again, an excerpt works better than new research. This is from the conclusion of our Biology chapter. Please ask if you have other specific questions.
 |&gt; Developed by Charles Darwin during a singles cruise to the Galapagos, the theory proposes that species change over time because of the traits they inherit or the money they inherit. It’s the main reason why Three-Toed Mike doesn’t have any children and the royal family is alive and well.
 |&gt; This breeding process is determined by natural selection, which is also used at many organic groceries. As Darwin observed the mating habits on his cruise, he realized that some men would never have children as ugly as they were. No woman would “select” them for breeding. Natural selection was aided by later theories of mutation, which helped create slight changes in species. Shortly after the introduction of these theories, there was a craze to consume radioactive products in hopes that they might make the drinker mutate into somebody more attractive.
 |&gt; Perhaps the theory of evolution is best known for its assertion that men and apes share a common ancestor. Many apes found this highly offensive, since they consider themselves to be less violent, better climbers, and considerably more attractive than humans. The chimpanzees responded by throwing their feces, though they do that to almost everything. 
 |&gt; Evolution leads to a key question: What will man evolve to next? Perhaps a particularly bookish young person will breed with a computer and create the first compu-man, with incredible powers of calculation and a tendency to glare and have glare. Or maybe man will finally develop a mutation to fly, assuming the wings meet regulatory standards. 
 |&gt; We don’t know what will happen next, and that proves that biology is the continually unfolding story of ourselves. There’s always something new to discover about ourselves when the door’s closed. Our amazing world is full of life: go find it, name it, and eat it today.

Just need some advice.,mypersonalthrowf,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ye9wv/feels_like_ive_been_screwed_over_with_my/,"College student. Only one more semester left to go before I graduate. I was really hoping the internship I had this summer would lead to a full time job.

Hired as an intern to do/use technology X. But I spent 98% of my time doing stupid work with technology Y that I don't really care for. 

I asked repeatedly to more work with technology X but I was told the work with technology Y was much more important for the company at the moment.

Now that my internship is finished I'm being told that they really need a developer with technology X experience and I don't have enough experience with it for them to give me a full time offer.

I'm just so livid right now that they made me do everything different than what the job description was and I don't even know what to do right now.

Should I tell them that I will learn more about technology X on my own and try to come back for an interview? Is this a lesson that I should learn about how not to get screwed over? Should I complain to anyone? Anyone have a similar experience to this?

I'm really just confused and unsure of what I can even do. My co-workers are remaining professional and not discussing this matter with me. I really just need someone to talk to about this and don't really know where to go with this at all.


X: Ruby/Rails
Y: CSS/styling in general

EDIT: 
 
Hey guys, I really appreciate the comments in this post. My final plan is to try to set up a phone call with one of the higher-ups and just give him a short summary of what happened with me and my disappointment with how I and my time were valued. We talked a lot over the course of my internship, but unfortunately he wasn't available on the day I was informed about my future with the company. 

I will also ask if there might be something else they didn't like about me (not enough hours, not enough tasks completed, didn't communicate enough with coworkers, etc). I will say if I spent my summer there I would value some sort of feedback for improvement. Also if one of these issues was the problem, I wish someone had communicated them to me. I can only guess they didn't like me for some reason and didn't even want me around to help me learn Ruby more as per my job. And now they found a reason to let me go. 

 This conversation won't be me begging for a position but just rather me sharing some thoughts about how my experience. If the company cares for its employees as much as I was told, I figure he can hear what I have to say.

This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. I think I have been suffering S.A.D since I was at least 10. I always found it hard to make new friends. I was always shy and felt nervous around people. And it didn't help that I was teased and bullied by kids and teachers in my school, and I was mentally, verbally, and physically abused by my father. Because of these things, I was always an angry or depressed kid. I was angry because I felt that all people were cruel and selfish after being treated the way I did. And I was depressed because I wanted to know why I was so disliked, and why I was so unloved. I always figured that there was something wrong with me. I was a tall, skinny, awkward, ugly girl who was lonely. But I never knew what exactly was wrong with me for me to be so disliked. I tried being nice and friendly to people, but it never helped. I could never seem to connect with them, so because of that, I tend to avoid social situations. This kind of thinking has also lead me to believe that I'm not worth living since everyone dislikes me so much. I attempted suicide by OD'ing on sleeping pills at the age of 15. 

Today, I'm 22 years old. I'm still tall, skinny, and awkward but people won't call me ugly anymore. I can pretend to be outgoing whenever I'm in social situations, but only up to a point. I'm no longer mercilessly teased, and since I'm an adult who's moved out, my father no longer abuses me. But I still feel angry. I still have this irrational thought that all people are horrible. I dislike people, except for a select few like my boyfriend, but at the same time I can never bring myself to show it because of my conscience. I always try to be nice to others or else I'll feel horribly guilty. And what's even more conflicting for me is that I still want to be appreciated and accepted by others. I crave acceptance SO MUCH that sometimes I lose myself in the process. Sometimes, I don't even know who I am. Whenever someone says ""be myself"" I always wonder, how do I do that and will people even like me if I am myself? I know this doesn't make sense, but please bear with me, I'm crying at the moment so this whole thing might not even make sense.

Right now, I have very few friends. Most of my friends are really my boyfriend's friends who only like me because I just happen to be his girlfriend. The very few friends that are actually mine are starting to leave me for unknown reasons. My best friend is no longer my friend because she's been distancing herself from me so much. I tried reaching out to her, and I tried to figure out why she was doing that, but she wouldn't even talk to me. Now she's moved out of town and transfered colleges and she let me know through text. I was crushed. So now I'm left wondering what the hell did I do for her to be that way. I thought we had great times. Sure, we had our arguments like close friends would, but we generally got along great. And now I'm dealing with this. And now I'm worried about this happening to another friend. Just yesterday I tried calling that friend to see if she wanted to hang out for once (we haven't hung out in a month) and she hasn't called or texted back. It hurts so much to know that my friends don't want to hang out with me, and I have no idea why.

Because of everything that I've said earlier, I have grown to believe that I have an unlikable personality and I don't know why I do. I have my flaws like everyone else, but I'm never outwardly mean. I always try to be nice. I always try to be funny. But I'm still very shy, quiet, and conservative so I guess people tend to think I'm always serious and snobby. But what they don't know is that that's definitely not the case. I'm extremely goofy and friendly to the people who I'm most comfortable with. But in social situations with people I hardly know, I'm different. On the outside, I may seem normal (and I guess quietly snobby) but on the inside, I'm an emotional wreck. My heart beats so hard, I can hardly breathe properly, and I'm always thinking about what and how I should look, say, and act. I'm always worried about people not liking me. And after growing up with people who disliked me, and after having close friends drop me, it's hard not to believe that everyone who meets me won't like me for who I am. 

It was even hard to open up to my boyfriend because of this. I'm slowly opening up to him now, but it's no fair for him to be treated that way, as if he's like everyone else. Because I know he loves and cares for me so much, and I love and care for him too, but because of my S.A.D and my self-esteem issues, I can't seem to open up as much. After dating for two years, he knows about my S.A.D, and he's come to understand that I can't open up so much because of me, not him, but I know it's still negatively affecting our relationship. He said that he feels he doesn't know the true me. I've tried opening up to him, and I'm making progress. But when it comes to serious issues like this, I always think that he'll dump me because he'll realize he's dating an emotional wreck of a girl with huge issues. I know it's not the case, but I can't seem to shake that thought out of my head.

And now my anxiety is effecting me in my adulthood. I'm about to graduate from college and I currently have an internship. People say that you're supposed to network as much as possible in an internship, but I find it so difficult to even ask my coworkers a simple question. I've been told that I do excellent work, but I'm horrible at socializing with others. Because of this, most people don't even know who I am because of my quietness, or they don't like me because they probably see me as unfriendly. My internship supervisor doesn't even like me. When I try speaking to her, she always seems like she doesn't want to talk to me. At first I thought it's because she's a busy woman, but I've noticed that she has no problem speaking to everyone else about things not related to work. She wants to know nothing about me and because of this, I feel that she hates me. So I feel pretty lonely at my internship, like I don't even belong. And that's almost always how it is for me in social situations.

I started seeing a therapist last week. I figured that, after crying in the bathroom at work, I can't live my life like this anymore. My anxiety and self-esteem issues are starting to become a huge issue for me in my life every day. My relationships are being effected, as well as my career. I'm even starting to turn to alcohol to calm my nerves, and that's bad. I honestly think that, unless I do something about my issues, I'm going to kill myself in a few years out of feeling like a failure in life. I don't have serious suicidal thoughts now, but it's still a possibility. I'm always afraid in my life, and I don't want to be afraid anymore.

**TL;DR** I've been having social anxiety issues since age 10. Was teased and abused. Always believed that no one liked me or cared for me. Lead me to attempt suicide at 15. Now at 22, I still believe I'm highly unlikable and it's effecting my relationships and career in my adulthood.

I am wondering how, without military service, an applicant for a security analyst, consultant-ish type of job can acquire a top secret or secret clearance. As a sophomore, it seems unlikely any corporation or the U.S. government would hand out a TS clearance. So I suppose in once sentence, I'm wondering how I can get my foot in the door. Internships seem like an obvious answer, but unfortunately I live in a very rural area of southern Delaware USA, so security corporations are almost non existent. Is the military generally the only way to do it? Or is it about connections?"

yhkju,58,2012-08-19,Nearer my God to Thee,neverbacksdown,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/yhkju/nearer_my_god_to_thee/,"I am originally from a nice little suburb in the Midwest, but currently I am living on the east coast doing an internship before I go back to school to finish my senior year.  Because I moved 500 miles away from home, and the company I am working for until January didn’t have the budget for intern housing, I live by myself.  First mistake.  I’ve been here since January and I am slowly but surely making friends at work and making the east coast feel like home.  The apartment that I live in is really nice.  It’s a little expensive, but it’s ridiculously spacious, especially when compared to the college houses I’ve had to share with at least three roommates over the past three years.  It’s on the edge of a really nice little town that definitely exemplifies the historic New England feel.  I thought I was making a pretty penny working for a huge company, but it turns out that rent, utilities and taxes could add up really fast, so I did what any stupid college student would do, I went on to craigslist.  I found a roommate that was graduating in December that was a student at a school nearby and didn’t want to have a lease that went through the whole school year.  It sounded like a mutually beneficial deal.  I helped him move in, and it was nice to have an intelligent person to have dinner with and of course split the bills with.  His name was Ryan (not really but you know how these things work).  Ryan and I became really fast friends.  We were both musicians and both enjoyed stupid things like South Park and Family Guy. 

 Let me take this time to give you some insight on our apartment.  We are on the second floor of an apartment building.  Upon entering, you would see our rather large living room.  To the right is a dining room and kitchen, and straight back is the bedroom and bathroom.  The two of us shared the bedroom, which wasn’t a big deal considering how awesomely big the apartment was.  After about a month of living together, we were practically best friends.  He was working as a choirmaster at a local church, so I would go with him to church to sing in the choir.  

The people that lived below us were strange to say the least.  They were always wearing black. Always.  They were probably in their late twenties and had lots of piercings.  We didn’t really have to interact with them a lot, but whenever we did, they were always really rude or just weird.  There was a man, and a woman.  The man was really tall with long hair.  He had his lip pierced and would wear overcoats (black) in the summer.  The woman was very large and short.  She had long black hair and wore a lot of black lacey things and long flowing black skirts.  Of course, they would change clothes, but on the whole that’s pretty much what their outfits looked like.  Their Apartment was set up exactly like ours except they had two doors, one in the kitchen, and one in the living room whereas we only had one.

Something happened in the beginning of July that has changed my life.  There was a full moon, and Ryan and I were drinking and watching a scary movie like we did a lot.  We heard loud music outside. We looked out our window that faced a big field and parking lot outside our apartment.  Our neighbors wear dancing NAKED in the field while playing some weird heavy metal music.  It was totally gross, and then we saw a light flickering.  They had made a fire in the parking lot that was clearly a Satanist sign.  It was the one of the upside down star with a circle around it.  Freaked the fuck out, we called 9-1-1 and told them about what was happening.  We waited for about 15 minutes, and then we saw the fire truck along with a couple police cars pull up in the parking lot.  As soon as they arrived, our neighbors stopped dancing and looked straight at us through our window.  It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  They couldn’t actually see us because all of our lights were off, but somehow they must have known that it was us that called the police and they were not happy about it.  The entire time they were being taken to the cars, they stared at our window.  Ryan and I were terrified by the fact that they knew we were there.  

That night I couldn’t sleep.  Ryan and I would typically stay up late just talking in our bedroom about random stuff, but both of us were silent.  When I finally did fall asleep, I had a dream where I was in the field that our neighbors had been dancing in.  Ryan was there as well, and we could hear the same music from before.  Suddenly, the grass around us caught on fire.  We both jumped and instead of jumping a couple of feet, we jumped really high.  As we looked down, there was that symbol again.  We both just hovered in mid air for a bit, and out of the fire rose two serpents.  The snakes flew into the air entered into our mouths.  The next thing I knew, I was awake.  It was a Sunday, and I got up to get ready to go to church with Ryan.  We both got ready with again no talking, and when we arrived at the church, My stomach started to turn.  I felt utterly miserable and sick.  I told Ryan that I didn’t think I would be able to make it to church and that I would pick him up after.  He said that he felt like shit too, and that we would have to just call in sick.  His priest wasn’t too happy about him calling off, but if he was feeling as bad as I did, there was no going in.  We went back home and we both were miserable all day.  It almost felt like what I assume going through withdrawal felt like.  We were shaking, had fevers, sweated profusely, and we were nauseous along with having to share the toilet to throw up in.  

The next day, I felt fine.  Well, I wouldn’t say fine, I was just blank.  No feelings really.  I went to work and it was over in a flash.  The entire week consisted of me just going through the motions with no emotion.  When I would come home from work, I would find Ryan just sitting there at the dining room table with a blank look on his face.  That Saturday night, we both for whatever reason just sat at the table and stared at each other.  After what felt like hours, something clicked in my mind.  Ryan was hot.  We were both gay, but had never really been interested in each other especially because I was going to be moving away relatively soon.  I got up, walked over to him, and began to rub his shoulders.  He got up, turned to me and we literally started making out, but it wasn’t tender or even passionate.  It was frantic and aggressive.  He pushed me against the wall and pinned my arms to the wall.  He then bit me where my neck met my shoulder and bit hard.  I felt the pain and started screaming.  But what I heard was completely different.  I heard laughter, my laughter.  I felt the warm blood cascade down my chest.  Internally, I was terrified, but externally, I wanted more.  I blacked out.  I woke up and realized we were still in the living room.  He was on top of me, asleep.  I looked at the clock and it was 12am Sunday.  I felt terrible.  I was sore, and had stinging pain all over my body.  We were both completely naked.  I then noticed that he was awake as well.  This terrified me as I thought about what he was going to do to me.  I noticed that his face was covered in dried blood.  My blood.  He looked at me and I saw tears in his eyes.  He climbed off of my silently weeping, and pulled me close to him as he held me.  It wasn’t aggressive or even sexual.  He was clearly trying to say sorry.  He washed himself off in the sink while I took a shower.  I felt sick as I saw the water go down the drain a reddish brown color.  I had bite marks all over me, and each stung like hell.  I must have gone through two tubes of antibiotic ointment cleaning them out.  Once I was done in the bathroom, I saw Ryan.  He had bite marks on him as well, and I realized I was the one that did that to him.  I started crying and stumbled into the bedroom without a word while I heard the shower start up again.  I knew then and there that not only was he possessed by something, I was too.

We spent the night in the same bed, for some odd reason, we felt safe together, but at the same time, I think we both knew that the biggest danger was the person who had their arms wrapped around the other.   That night I dreamt about when I was younger and I had to do a project on an animal, the animal that I was assigned was a mongoose.  In my dream, the younger version of me was eagerly doing research on this strange mammal, and thinking it was so cool how mongooses fought snakes.  The next morning, we had a long talk.  We couldn’t go to the police because a) they wouldn’t believe us, and b) if they did we would be the ones in trouble.  We also decided that there had to be something that we could do to stop this.  Neither of us wanted to just lie down and let whatever was inside of us hurt the other anymore.  We figured the best place to start was church.  The minute we got into the car, we both had that stomach wrenching pain all over again.  When we started driving, it started to rain, heavily.  When we finally made it to the church, we looked up at the building and suddenly it looked like we were staring at the sun.  Our eyes burned, and the pain in our stomachs got worse.  I looked at Ryan and his eyes were completely blood shot.  We made our way up the steps with each step we felt more agony than the last.  We were almost at the door when I shouted that I couldn’t take it anymore and that I wanted to die.  Ryan grabbed my hand, and it felt nice.  It felt great.  I was getting off on him touching me.  I heard him say that we were almost there.  I went to say that I could make it, but what came out of my mouth was not me.  It said, “I want you to fuck me like you did last night.”  Ryan’s face turned white as he pulled me to my feet.  I could feel the tears stinging my eyes even though he could never tell with the rain as he placed his lips on mine again.  I felt him bite my lip, and with every ounce of strength that I had, I pushed him away toward the doors.  He hit the door and screamed.  All of my pain and anguish flooded from me, as I feared that I had hurt him.  I ran to where he was and saw he was knocked out.  With whatever remaining strength I had, I dragged him inside the church.

It was silent inside the church. I hadn’t realized that we had come so early.  As soon as we were in the lobby, I started to feel something.  It was burning.  I felt as if my skin was on fire.  I saw that the water on Ryan was beginning to steam off and I held him close to me.  I was in the church where the mongoose was going to fight the snakes inside of us.  I cradled him back and forth as I sang Nearer my God to thee quietly in his ear.  The burning was torture, but I knew that I had to wait out the storm.  After what seemed an eternity, it stopped.  I felt calm.  Ryan stirred and awoke.  He looked up quizzically, and I continued to sing to him.  I could have sworn that I could hear a choir singing along side me.

yhdwj,6,2012-08-19,"I'm considering leaving my current career path to follow my dreams. Reddit, have you ever taken big risks and how did they pay off?",BrockThrowaway,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/yhdwj/im_considering_leaving_my_current_career_path_to/,"Some details... I'm a 20-year old Software Engineering student currently at a 16-month internship with a software engineering company. The internship would end at the end of next summer and I'm looking to return to school and finish my degree after that, with only one year to go.  It would be completely pointless for me not to finish my degree, as I've already done 3 years of it. I'm just not positive what I want to do after that.

Partially relevant details: I've recently come to terms with the fact that I'm gay, and started coming out to many of my family and friends. Back when I was in the closet, I hid a lot of my personality, dreams, and aspirations because I had deemed them too ""gay"", and I didn't want to have that stigma attached to me. I cut all of that out of my life and turned to engineering, which seemed like a viable option. In retrospect, I wish I had simply embraced who I was.

My true goal or passion in life is hard for me to pinpoint. Originally, I always wanted to be an actor in film and television. I loved the local productions that I was involved with when I was younger, but quit them in high school when I was trying to hide who I truly was. But I'm also very, very interested in the behind-the-scenes aspects of filmmaking and television shows, such as screenwriting and directing.

Lastly, my other true passion in life is music. I played piano from a young age and consider myself to be fairly talented. I love playing the guitar as well. This, though, I may consider to be more of a hobby than something I could make a career out of. If there was a career here, I wouldn't want it to be music education. I would want to be in a band or as a solo artist, touring and making new music. The style of music I make would definitely be in the ""indie/indie rock"" field.

My goals and aspirations seem so... unrealistic, compared to graduating with a software engineering, getting a stable job, and not worrying about income. But I know I won't be truly happy. I've considered several options, all which start with me finishing my degree. Then they branch out: Should I get more education focusing on tv and film production? Should I get a software job in L.A. (seems like San Francisco would definitely have some options) and see what I can do from there? However, a full-time job would probably be a huge obstacle in trying to break in to the entertainment industry. 

I'm also worried about the diminishing returns on my engineering degree. If nothing works out, I've assured myself ""at least I have a software degree I can fall back on."" But if I'm not working in that field after graduating (and the longer I wait), I feel that my chances of getting a job would be considerably slimmer, especially in the rapidly changing world of software and technology.

Is this crazy? Am I an idiot for thinking of abandoning a solid, well paying job, when so many people are desperate for one? Also, my dreams are a bit different from each other. If I do intend to do this, I have no idea which one to focus on. If I was successful with music, would I still have that itch to get into tv and film? How viable is this, anyways? Moving to California, without having a job, would definitely be expensive. Not to mention the fact that I'm actually Canadian. Should I move to Toronto instead? Or Vancouver?

I would just say that I'm very, very confused and lost about what to do with my life at this point. I feel like after coming out, I've kind of turned a new leaf, and I want to be this different person I had always wished I was.

**TL;DR:** After I get my software engineering degree, I want to completely switch paths and head into the entertainment industry (acting, writing, directing, or making music). I've always had these dreams but hid them because I was trying to avoid seeming ""gay"". Now that I've come out of the closet, that feels like a non-issue and I regret having waited so long to do so (and even having that dumb opinion). I'm thinking I would be very unhappy with a software job. Am I crazy? Do I need formal education for that? What risks have you taken, and have they paid off?"
yh04w,8,2012-08-19,My dog broke my friend's girlfriend's ipad screen while they were at my house. How should the situation be handled?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/yh04w/my_dog_broke_my_friends_girlfriends_ipad_screen/,"Last night, my friend and his girlfriend were over to watch a movie. His girlfriend's ipad was on the coffee table, and my friend had set his glass of Coke next to it. 

Before anyone could react to stop him, my dog ran over and jumped on the couch. In doing so, he either bumped the table or the glass, resulting the glass falling on the ipad. The glass shattered the ipad screen fairly significantly. 

Let me preface the rest by saying I basically have no money at the moment and I live in my mom's basement. My friend's girlfriend told me not to worry about the broken ipad because she would get a new one. I feel that I should cover the costs of repair or replacement.

I told my mom what the situation was, and did not ask for a single red cent from her, but she got really mad at me and told me that if I pay for the ipad, she will want full discretion of who comes to her house and what they bring inside. (Note: She covers 99% of my expenses right now. I am working an internship right now that will lead to me making $1,000 in another month or so. So, if I pay out of the $1,000, it'll more or less eventually amount to money out of her pocket.) 

I don't really care if I can't have anyone over because I don't care much for having company anyway, so there's no need to discuss that aspect of this situation. 

My mom has inquired with her home insurer as to whether they will cover the cost of replacing the ipad.

My question, after all that, is whether you all think I should pay for the ipad my dog broke?

**TL;DR: Friend's girlfriend brings ipad to my home. My dog knocks over glass which shatters ipad's glass screen. Girlfriend tells me not to worry about it, but I feel obligated to pay. Should I pay?**"
ygdk5,2,2012-08-18,(Prospective) Employer being wishy washy. Uncertain about how to deal with it.,lororol,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ygdk5/prospective_employer_being_wishy_washy_uncertain/,"Hi /r/jobs! Throwaway account because I've become a bit paranoid after the accident with the google guy who got fired..

This May I decided I wanted a job. So I flew to London (I'm European), and went through a few interviews. At the end of the first month, I had two interesting internships offers (I am a recent graduate with little experience), and a job offer from company X in Montreal, as a game tester. I chose this last one, especially because it is in the gaming industry and I'd really love to get involved.

So far so good! But here's what happens next:

They tell me to get a visa, so I fly from London back to my country to get a Canadian visa (which takes two bloody months). I also politely decline the internship offers and stop looking for a job.

At first they tell me to hold the visa for a sec, they want me there ASAP; they say that if we do it a certain way, I won't need a visa for the first few months (I won't go into detail). They ask me if it's ok with me, I say yes.

Then they cancel this thing, and tell me to go ahead with the visa, so I request one. They also send me a contract to sign and send back.

Eventually the visa is there. Yay! So they tell me I will be contacted shortly about my relocation.

A few days later they do contact me, but it's about contracts (with developers) being cancelled, and this involves me too (in some unspecified manner).
I speak with HR and the person there is really helpful, and helps me out (otherwise I think I would've simply given the boot).

A few days later they let me know that they'll be taking me in mid-late October, but they do not know yet because contracts  within the industry can vary a lot.

Now, I know it's hard to find a job, and that the gaming/entertainment industry is like that, but is this normal?
How do I make sure I do not wait ANOTHER two months, and then end up unemployed because they decide so?

What's more, I got the offer (which is for short term employment, mind you!) on the first days of June, October is four months away, if it's delayed any more I will actually spend more months waiting than the actual duration of the contract.

And even then, I could've done an internship in the meanwhile, which would've been really valuable for me, or at the very least waited tables (which is a job I actually like, in the right places) in the summer and saved some money, but no, I got stuck waiting and then got told to wait more.

Argh! And I want this kind of job (for several reasons), so I don't want to burn bridges, but I don't really know how to protect myself if they change their mind again :\ (I think I could even find a job before October rolls in, but I would need to spend money to travel, and perhaps it wouldn't be as good..) 

Hopefully I haven't bored you all to death, thanks for reading.

tl;dr I get an offer for a job starting right away, then it becomes two months, then four. Perhaps."

yjixl,0,2012-08-20,The entire process of job searching drives me almost as nuts as having a job,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/yjixl/the_entire_process_of_job_searching_drives_me/,"I am a college graduate who recently left a low end job where within a month because of my hard work I was promoted, basically into a brick wall where I'd never again get a raise or promotion, where I didn't make enough money, even with decent tips, to not pay at least 50% plus of my income to rent. So I left to stay with a friend while doing an unpaid internship in my field.

Now i'm sitting here waiting to hear about a restaurant job with one of my best friends, just so I can have enough money so my dog and i don't starve while doing this internship. I don't know how people can survive for years on unemployment, at my last job I was working 5-6 days a week 40 plus when I could, and putting 60% or more in savings because I knew it had no long term potential, and I'm still needing to be extremely cautious about spending money.

I'll take any low end serving job, especially if it pays ok, but perhaps the most disheartening part is the wait, the almost begging for jobs that 19 year olds seem to have no problem getting, but people my age seem to need to beg and grovel, and bend over backwards, and promise to dedicate 4 years of time to an employer who will pay you poverty level wages, just for them to consider you. 

Honestly, I'll take any job, and have worked many, but it's ridiculous how much you have to bend over for the worst jobs. At one of my last  post collegiate jobs, one of my managers actually said to me ""aren't you dedicated to this job?"" about a position that paid 8.10 an hour at a corporate chain, even though I had a second full time night job at another corporate chain making almost 2 dollars an hour more. 

That's the new American Dream, though. Advance through the ranks of a business so you can be the one making 6 figures a year to tell your ranks of underemployed cooks/baristas/""customer service representatives"" that it's just not in the budget to pay them for a 5 hour day at 8 dollars (or 10) an hour.

There's almost no doubt that I will receive an excellent offer from the company I'm with now after I graduate.

I absolutely love the subject, and I feel that I am learning everything very fast.  Since I finished all my GEs prior, I feel like I'm compressing a lot of material into my head very quickly.  I'm beginning to look at internships, but a lot of them suggest experience in all kinds of languages and databases that I'm not familiar with at the moment.  Most of what I have been doing have been abstract, *nix-terminal applications written in Java or C.  I really want to get some sort of more concrete project under my belt in other languages.  I see a lot of internships ask for ASP.NET, SQL, etc.

My question is, how would you suggest I study these topics outside of the classroom, and what is the best way I should demonstrate my knowledge?  My own website with my work, some profile on LinkedIn / github?  I feel like I have to do a lot of outside work in a shorter amount of time than a lot of other 4-year college students.

Said friend signed up for college the same time I did, went through the same classes I did, and then had the same internship that I did, though at the end of it, I won the position, and he was relegated back to interning. He ended up working for me for about a year, and it became known that he had anger issues. We worked at our college. I was the sole employed network technician, while he was in the intern position with one other younger kid.

I ended up having to fire him for going off on an instructor about pulling him out of class (a big no-no), but she wasn't pulling him out and his teacher made a mistake. Firing a friend isn't fun, but it was made easier by the fact that he made himself look like a fool. He assured me that he had a job lined up already, and middle-fingered his way out.

Cut to six months later. I receive a call from him, asking for a reference. I asked why he needed a job, stating that he had told me a mutual friend got him signed on, but he never told me why. A call to my very trustworthy friend at his former workshop told the story.

* 88: Our Hero
* Mario: Our Hero's former assistant, so named for the resemblance.
* DD: Dat Dude, who employed Mario after I did. DD was a manager at a mom-and-pop laptop store.

88: Dude, I hear Mario's looking for work again. What happened?

DD: 88, you don't wanna know. I know you taught him his stuff, but he's a loose cannon.

88: You gotta tell me, man. I'm not providing references for someone who is making us (specific college) graduates look bad.

DD: Fine. We got a user in who brought her computer in with XP and wanted Vista put on it. So, I gave him the checklist and told him to charge her for the OS, but not the tech fee, since she's a regular.

88: Okay. Not hard to screw up.

DD: Right. Except that he reformatted it without saving her files using Darik's Boot and Nuke.

88: *facepalm* You have got to be kidding me.

DD: I kid you not. She came in to pick it up and he said it was done. She left with it, came back about an hour later, and they started arguing. She said she didn't have any of her files, he said she never asked for them, on and on.

88: Okay, so his customer service sucks. What got him canned?

DD: She called him a fat ass, so he came around the desk and shoved her into a rack of equipment.

88: ... you have to be kidding.

DD: No. Plus, get this: she's pregnant. Massive lawsuit incoming.

88: *facepalm combo*

Turns out she was pregnant and did not lose the child, but she did file a suit against Mario. It pretty much left him in ruins from what I hear, and I refused to give him references ever again.

TL;DR: I caught them all, but Gary Oak summoned Ifrit to set fire to my Delorean. I beat him down with a lightsaber and a Dragon Shout before retiring to Vice City.

I plan on transferring to a university to get a bachelor's of science degree in applied technology. The truth is I can't do any of the heavy math or science classes for the advanced degrees. 

Would my bachelor's degree get my foot in the door to an IT job or a job that is unrelated to my major? 

I keep stressing out about the future because this computer technology degree is the only thing I am interested in and is realistic to achieve. I should be working in the help desk in a couple of quarters and the university I will be transferring to has an internship there that ties into my degree. 

The only other majors I could go into since I can't do the heavy math and science would be business, humanities, english or communications.

ylet3,1,2012-08-21,Should I 'come out' about my marijuana use and cannabis's benefits to my parents in order to save my mom's life and my family?,ficklemeelmo,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ylet3/should_i_come_out_about_my_marijuana_use_and/,"Hey Reddit,

First things first, I posted this over at /r/trees, but I think it is probably too much to read and take in over there. I know it's not something I'd read while stoned. I'm really hoping maybe you guys can help.

Also, this is a throwaway account. Thanks if you take the time to read. I know it's a long one.

_________________

Cannabis and /r/trees (as well as much of Reddit) have truly saved my life from sexuality-related depression and rejection, and I just want to thank you all for being part of that.

Anyway, not all of us are so lucky as to have been properly introduced to the finest herb of all times. My mom is one of these people. 

My mom suffers from a very painful jaw-disorder, TMJ. Being genetic, it is highly likely that I too will suffer from this, but as of now, my previous dental/orthodontic works seems to have helped.

My mom has suffered from this condition for almost all of her life. It has been at varying stages of pain and intensity throughout her life - but it is at it's probably all time high now. Over the past few weeks, I was home again for a while, and I picked up on some new things about her condition that really worried me.

She can barely eat due to the amount of pain in her jaw - it literally clicks and shifts around visibly and audibly as she opens for a bite. My mom has kind of resorted to a diet on almost solely ice cream and iced tea - there's no need for me to emphasize the unhealthiness of that diet.

However, most of all, what concerns me most is her pain management. My mom is a nurse and because of this, she seems to come from the mindset that pharmaceuticals are the be all, end all answer to her pain. She also seems to think she is immune to the effects and side effects of these drugs.

She has gone from high-dosage oxycodeine to lower more frequent doses of oxycodon and through many other medicines and drugs. She is also going through menopause, and is highly emotionally unbalanced and often depressed. She has temper tantrums, goes into fits, becomes irrationally upset and is generally unpleasant because of this. However, I notice more and more lately that she is self-medicating her menopause symptoms and other general depression and, the pain of course. She is really abusing these pills and because her condition is so real and painful - she can easily get the scripts for meds. Her intake is very high.

Well, the pills only make her moods and anger and rage and depression greater, and yet, I think they are also no longer actually helping the physical pain as much, perhaps due to tolerance. She is becoming a dangerous person to be around emotionally and somewhat physically. She is really a bit reckless.

Well, here's where you come in. I've been loving marijuana for a while now. I am a very productive and successful person thus far in my life and I am completing university shortly and have already worked a number of great jobs and internships (you all know what I mean by this...) Cannabis has changed my life in the most amazing and positive of ways, in almost every way. They helped me come to terms with myself and my sexuality and my depression has gotten much better. I just love being me for once.

Well, my parents don't really know how much I use cannabis. As I said, I'm a student living full-time (year round despite major holidays) 1500 miles away from my parents. I definitely am at a point in my life where I can make my own decisions and take responsibility for them. I am, however, still slightly financially dependent on my parents for school and stuff you know. I would never want to do something that would upset my parents because of this.

I feel a responsibility to introduce my mom to cannabis.
I know it will change her life in so many positive ways.
She will probably have a much better time with her pain and there's almost no doubt it would lift her depression and begin to turn her around emotionally. I'm just really wanting the best for her. I want her to eat real food and enjoy her life rather than spending it in pain and misery caused by jaw pain and pain pills.

I've vaguely, in a testing the waters kind of way, brought up the idea of medical marijuana to my parents. My nearly entire family is heavily involved in medicine and pharmaceuticals and are extremely religious and conservative. Because of this, it's nearly impossible to change their opinions on almost anything at all, ever. Especially cannabis, though.

The one time I brought it up in full light (without saying I was user), I was met with disgust and ignorance. My mom proclaimed it burned holes in your brain and turned you to mush and lazy and unproductive and a waste and that whole mess. I couldn't get a word in edgewise. She left the conversation outraged (popping a Percocet may I add), and asked my father if he thought I was a 'pothead'.

I still didn't admit to using to my father - but he told me he truly believes in medical marijuana and it's benefits even as a pharmacist. I vaguely said I wish mom would see it's benefit and he kind of agreed.

I'm at a crossroads though. My mom was just told the procedure they've currently been doing (very intricate set of mouth hardware that's been on for almost a year now) may actually do nothing at all because it seems her teeth have actually grown  into the jaw itself, meaning there's nothing the hardware can do to fix the alignment. Also, the situation is beginning to take it's toll on my whole family. My dad feels frustrated because she is constantly swinging moods or high or low, and everyone in my family is feeling the heat.

Do I tell my mom about the benefits and just come fully to the front with my own cannabis use and hope that I can at least get her to consider it? Do I risk upsetting my parents and the balance between my dependance on them? My mom's issue is rising to a point that it could seriously affect the near future and outcome of my mom's life, and my entire family's life.

**TL;DR** My mom has a jaw condition pain is at an all time high, her pill intake is too. She is depressed and angry when she is not high or when she is coming down. She takes the pills for the wrong reasons now. She eats very unhealthily when she even does eat. My parents are both in medicine and pharmaceuticals and are very religious and conservative. Because of this, they have some very strong, harsh opinions on marijuana. Do I risk telling my mom about my positive outlook and use of cannabis to better her life and possibly save it and my family?"

I'm currently a senior at a middle of the road ""Big State School"". It's at best in the top 100 schools in the country for CS, although I'm not sure where I'd even go to look. Barring disaster, I'll be graduating after the 2013 spring semester with a 4.0 and bachelor's degrees in Mathematics and in Computer Science. I'm also an older student, in my 30s at this point. I just finished up a summer internship doing CS research, and that helped me finally make the decision to pursue a Ph.D. in CS despite my age.

I'm interested in working at the intersection between statistics and CS, so I'm looking at concentrating on machine learning, although I also really like parallelism and would have some interest in doing something there. My question is, where should I apply for grad school? How does one decide? Do you pick a faculty member first? Pick a university first? I have absolutely no idea where I stand in terms of competitiveness... especially since I haven't taken the GRE yet. Should I bother applying to Stanford/CMU/etc? If not, what's the next tier down? Hopefully one of you might have some insight.

Neither of these guys helped me set up the IDS, nor do they plan on learning it (as far as I know). So, here are my questions.

Is there a commercial alternative to Snort that they can implement which doesn't take a massive amount of time investment for learning/using?

How do I actually learn more about Snort? I feel like I'm fumbling around in the dark all the time when I try to learn *anything* about it. Can I learn about this thing without smashing my head against Google for hours at a time?

Interviewed for both QA and development positions. Was offered a QA position first, and jumped on it. Was hoping I could eventually transfer out of QA and into development, unfortunately that never happened. Long story short, it's not likely to happen, as internal transfers within my company are pretty hard to come by for some reason. Looking back on it now, I wish I continued to interview versus settled on the offer I received. 

I've been doing QA for a little over 5 years now. I hate it. (Or maybe I dislike my company, or very possibly, mixture of both.) In the 5 years, I have not really kept up my skills in development. I was never one of those who coded for fun on the side, so needless to say, I'm fairly rusty. My QA skills isn't going to be easy to market, as I've been mainly doing manually testing and not automation. Not for lack of trying, I've asked my managers several times to put me on automation, but due to lack of resources and not planning well enough to put aside the time to start automation projects, it just never happened.

How possible (or impossible?) would it be for me to start development now? Is there anything I can do aside from major studying and brushing up on data structures and other concepts (e.g. OO)? I feel like getting another QA job will be easier than even trying for an entry level dev job. I'm even open to taking an development internship position (paid or unpaid) to get the experience, except I'm no longer a student and that seems to be a requirement for all the internship positions I've been seeing. 

I'm not sure what to do, at this point I really feel like I'm stuck in QA. I rarely see entry level positions for dev, and I don't know how to get my foot in the door. =/"

* Do you think me living in rural Alabama will influence prospective employers?
 I mean everyone thinks people from Alabama are stupid right?
* Do you think an accredited but obscure university will influence employers?
 I had good grades but how do I convince the employers its not because my university is some diploma mill? Is an accredited university enough to convince them otherwise?
* Do you think employers will be scared away by the fact I'll have to relocate to work for them? (Depending on where the job is, I could probably afford to cover the cost of moving myself.)

So, last night was....interesting...

Despite believing I would not sleep, my body had other plans. I did indeed fall asleep, only to come half awake feeling Watcher nearby. I dropped back into a dream. A lucid dream at that. I began to do my normal lucid dream routine, which usually consists of building my dream home. I had begun to put the final touches on my place when Watcher showed up. I tried to ignore him (you know how dream logic works) but he did not leave. he just watched. I awoke with a jolt 30 minutes before I had to leave for work. 

I work at a community college as an IT intern. Today was the day before the fall semester begins, and everyone one working in high gear. Unfortunately, everything possible went wrong today. First, the internet went down with no identifiable cause for 3 hours. Then, the servers began refusing connections. I was tasked with putting the finishing touches on some class rooms, which included some last minute operations on the computers and adding the property tags. The building which contained the rooms was known for its general creepiness. People have experienced temperature drops, strange noises, sightings of ghostly people and even destructive activity such as papers being scattered or things being knocked off tables.

One class room had a small room with windows adjoining it. I had my iPod in and was paying no attention to my surroundings. Suddenly, I felt compelled to look at the window. There he was, in the little side room, watching. I removed my ear-buds and began to listen. Everything was deathly silent. I took a few steps toward the window, making up my mind to try to make contact right then. He just melted into the darkness, and when he did, the noises began. A loud, intermittent creaking began coming from the ceiling and walls. Needless to say, I finished my work fast. 

The strangest part was the second room. It required an entire section of the class room to be connected to the network. They also needed to be imaged (have the operating system installed) and joined to the domain for network accounts. I began this process, and realized that several of the network jacks were not working. They had never been wired in, and since I am not allowed into the wiring closet because I am an intern, I had to call for my co-worker to come help me. Finally, we got the ports working. We began the machine images, only to find that half of them, which had never been connected to power, no less the network, had already been imaged with our custom operating system. They had also been joined to the domain and given the proper accounts. My co-worker, Alison, was just as astonished as I was. 

She is also a believer in the paranormal and knows well the strange things that happens in the building, which is aptly numbered 13. I did not tell her of my Watcher, however, not yet. Alison packed up the tools and took them back to the golf cart while I stayed to finish adjusting the resolution. As I was turning to head out the door, I glanced at the door leading to the teacher office. Watcher was there, and despite the fact I could not see his eyes, he seemed to...wink. I hightailed it out of the room and to the cart. As I hopped into my seat, Alison asked my what was wrong. ""You look pale and you have a wild look in your eyes, are you OK?"" she said. I assured her I was fine, and I was just feeling hungry. She gave me a skeptical look, but did not inquire further. I did not see Watcher again today, but there is no guaranteeing tonight.

It's strange. Although I feel afraid of this thing, I also want to see him again. What should I do NoSleep? And if Joshuapg21 is right, and it is in love with me, how should I prevent from pissing it off while staying straight? 

Thanks for any advise!

I came back last night from summer internship to pack and she dropped this bomb on me. It's really hard because she's always been that strong, independent woman upon whom I could always rely.

I don't think that she'll actually kill herself, but it pains me to know that she's thought about it, and thinks that it would be fine to kill herself. She's not *sad* per se, but she's just so full of ennui that she doesn't see a point in living. Things don't make her happy anymore. She has an unchallenging but well-paying job, and she knows that rationally she's lucky.

* I think what she really wants is a husband or life partner but she can't really meet guys (I know - you're supposed to be happy with yourself before you find someone, but she does think she's awesome; she's just really lonely).
* How can she make friends? I suggested joining a running club or a volunteer group. She does ballroom dancing a few days a week but she doesn't really meet people.
* ~~Adopt a puppy?~~ - she just vetoed this (and adopting a child) because it would make her house-bound
* I can live at home after I graduate?
* live in a coop???? I don't think so but she just hates coming home to an empty house.
* make her volunteer for the Peace Corps???? I don't know, my sister was depressed throughout high school and maybe our middle-class affluence is to blame -___-

Yeah. I don't know. I've talked to her but it's hard because I personally just love living so much and I can't just *make* her start appreciating the little things again. Suggestions?

ypkmq,6,2012-08-23,Rising Senior Electrical Engineer - want to end up programming. Small batch of questions,a_tv_dante,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ypkmq/rising_senior_electrical_engineer_want_to_end_up/,"I was originally a Physics major, then transferred fairly late into the engineering department of my school. To make up the missing classes in order to graduate on time I spent my summers taking classes rather than pursuing internships. Most of the courses I took involved programming on some level, usually MATLAB or verilog, though last semester I took a microprocessors class involving C, and loved it. This sparked me to do some self-motivated programming projects this summer and I found myself fascinated and would love to end up working in this area.

Question 1 - Am I far off track? Will being EE rather than CS prevent employers and recruiters from taking me less seriously? I'm working on filling the gap that might exist between your average computer programmer and me by reading Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - hoping to learn about analyzing algorithms, big O notation, recursion, other topics - is this enough? Is there a way to indicate the knowledge I've gained doing this to employers?

Question 2 - Common advice I see is to post resume your resume publicly (on LinkedIn, Dice, elsewhere) and recruiters will end up contacting you - failing that, send your resume to tech giants. How should my resume look? It currently looks pathetic, my actual work experience is limited the jobs I had over summers that are entirely irrelevant to EE or CS. I started a blog where I've been writing some articles on programming related topics, can I put this in my resume? What else should I do?

Question 3 - I'm interested in web design. I'm considering starting a programming project that is a full-stack web application - I have a solid idea that I believe I'll be able to implement, though it may take a while. Is this a good use of my time? If it is, can I throw the hypothetical end result into a resume?

Thanks in advance! Any help you could give would be really appreciated. Sorry if these are common questions that get answered all the time - I didn't see a FAQ."

I have found that I love programming and am currently working on my first personal project which is a prototype in java for a android app I am going to developing. I am learning swing right now in class so I thought it would be a good place to start.  

I have been in school for 4 months so far and am currently in calculus 2 and intermediate java. Because I like programming so much I think that I have a better grasp on concepts compared to my peers but I am obviously by no means an expert in java. I currently have a 4.0 in the program. The courses are condensed and have a high workload and because of the transfer policy for 2nd bachelor's students I'll be done and have the degree in roughly a year.

At what point should I apply for internships? How much do they expect students to know? I want to get started as soon as possible. Is it possible to do multiple internships within a year? I would be willing to do one (even if its full time) and go to school at the same time if that's what it took. Do they typically pay? I have a mortgage and would need at least minimum wage to survive. 

Thank you for your input and time."
yowe4,4,2012-08-23,"This has been a rocky student year at university, and I need Reddit's advice for probably the biggest decision of my life so far. Any responses would be greatly appreciated.",jammydodger149,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/yowe4/this_has_been_a_rocky_student_year_at_university/,"I will try to some this up as quickly as possible as no one likes reading essays.


So today, I got sacked, fired, whatever for the first time. Sorta. Basically, I am a student studying Computer Science at university, and as part of the course, there is the option to take a year in industry, gaining valuable experience making the whole course 4 years (usually 3). 


Why did I take the course? Because I have always been on a computer, and I was really interested in game development as most teens are. Video editing, animation, gaming, etc. Most aspects really. Had I programmed before? Never, but I was up for the challenge. Have I enjoyed it? I have no idea.


Now, it's difficult. I am not sure where to even start, but there have been so many conflicting emotions building up that I really am at the end of my tether. I finished my second year in June, but since last September, I have been trying to find an aforementioned placement. My logic was always 'internship now; work later'. Needless to say, I fell behind, probably getting lazy too, and boy did it catch up with me.


Ever since I started the course, I was always sort of sceptical about whether I was enjoying the course or not, programming and such. You might say I used the whole search for work to allow me to fall behind in my studies, so I could blame the situation on that, rather than my own inability to keep up. I still passed with a decent grade, but with a lot of support and catching up.  


Obviously, rejection after rejection didn't encourage me to think about development as a serious career choice. One of the things that I regret since starting the course is not truly applying myself. I missed a lot of lectures, a lot of labs, and always caught up last minute (literally). That became my thing until it bit me in the ass during second year.


So yeah, that is my life at the moment in a nutshell. After many, many rejections all due to my lack of programming knowledge, I finally found an internship, but after 3 weeks on trial, I found out today that they couldn't accommodate my learning curve (they *were* only a small company). I packed up my things and left; very sad, and spent the rest of today moping around the house weighing up my options. I've talked to my parents and a few people, but unfortunately I cannot withstand their biased opinions about me any longer. 


In summary, I can either:


*Go back to uni finishing third year, including final year project which I simply have not had the time to research for this summer..
*Take a gap year from uni


Now before I get a suggestion of dropping out, I can't. I won't give up. Even if I don't utilise the degree, I will not drop out. But anyway, it's extremely difficult, as both have their ups and downs. Going back to university now will allow me to finish the course, get the degree, etc, and do whatever I want afterwards. At the same time, a gap year will allow me to scratch up on my programming, and also venture into a few other things I simply have not had the time to do. Like learning the guitar, or getting into animation again. 


It's just, would a gap year be a waste if I would be committing parts of it for a degree I am not even going to use after university? Though I am aware most people go into completely opposite directions of their degrees, I want to be realistic here. 


Ok, it's late, and I need to sleep. Looking forward to any opinions anyone might have in the morning. 


Thanks a lot guys. I mean it."

I already have a gaming desktop I built last year so this laptop doesn't need to any kind of powerhouse. The main preference is budget after meaning some minimum requirements.

Budget - $500 - Without a laptop I won't be able to do any real work but I'm practically broke so the cheaper the better.

Gaming - Pretty much only Starcraft 2 on lower medium settings basically right before it looks like Starcraft 1 again. I would love to be able to play Starcraft during the hour or more gaps between my classes while I'm stuck on campus.

Portability - I know asking for a portable budget gaming laptop is ridiculous but having to lug those ASUS tanks I've seen looks unbearable. So of course the smaller the better. That means I don't care for or need a large screen, a long battery life (2+ hours is pretty much fine by me), a full sized keyboard, etc etc.

Currently I'm looking at http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834246328 which I can get for $350-$400.

yq93x,1,2012-08-23,"The sexual harassment double standard...Gay man, straight man, co-workers...",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/yq93x/the_sexual_harassment_double_standardgay_man/,"Excuse the long post, but I am having a meeting with my boss tomorrow to discuss this issue and I wanted to run it by some im-partial people before I do.  For the sake of privacy, I have tried to keep specifics to a minimum.  If this causes confusion, let me know and I will try to elborate.


I work in the performing arts, and this summer I am at a major company where I am the ""head"" of my department (I'll call it Dept. 1).  My department works closely with another department (call it Dept. 2), and this year that department has a new ""department head.""  We are of the same level, and have the same supervisor who one might call the ""big boss,"" who runs the entire company.

Upon first meeting this fellow at the beginning of the summer, he began to hit on and make passes at me.  Now this is no big deal, as It's not the first and likely not the last time a gay guy will hit on me.  I laugh, tell him I'm not gay and have a serious girlfriend, and move on with my business.  While he continues to hit on me, often in front of other staff members, I laugh it off and think little of it.  But a few weeks in, things start to get uncomfortable.

At my company we have a ceremony where all the departments dress in costume and pay tribute to a statue in the hopes for good luck through the rest of the summer. (Which is really just an excuse to take a break during a work day and have a party and some laughs.)  Being that my crew is very small and not on site when this happens, I generally join Dept. 2 for the ceremony.  I ask the new head of Dept. 2 what he has planned for the ceremony, and he tells me this, ""all of the employees will be carrying me in on a platform we made, and i want you to come in on a rope wearing a loin cloth as my sex slave.""  I'm a little weirded out, and tell him I of course won't do that at my place of employment, especially considering I am a senior staff member, please think of something else.  And I walk away.  

On the day of the ceremony (2 days later) I ask him what he thought of, as I haven't heard from him in a few days, and his response is, ""oh, you're not part of it, you weren't willing to be a team player.""  I get really uncomfortable, walk away, and spend the entire party in my office alone instead of with my friends.

Eventually, I tell myself I'm over-reacting and I just don't know him that well.  But not long after...

I go to a bar one evening with my girlfriend, who is visiting me for a few days.  I see him at the bar and introduce him to her.  He looks at her, looks at me, and says, and I quote, ""I'm going to have sex with your boyfriend before the end of the summer.""  Then walks away.  My girlfriend asks if we can leave, saying she didn't want to be around him anymore.

Again, I convince myself that he just has an odd sense of humor, and agree to go to his place with a few friends a couple of days later to have a beer after a long week.  I don't have a car, so ask if he can pick me up. (I'm thinking this is my chance to talk to him about these issues.)  In the car, I ask him about the incident at the bar, hoping for an apology or a story about how drunk he was so he doesn't even remember.  His response, ""Yup, that sounds like something I would say.""  I ask him not to do things like that anymore, as it's starting to cross a line.  He laughs.  At that moment we pull into his driveway, he gets out of the car, end of conversation.  We get to his house and after a few drinks I go outside to have a smoke with a friend.  About 10 minutes into this smoke, he starts yelling and screaming at me from inside, things that don't make any sense, and that I could hardly understand, but he is obviously really really angry.  Everyone at the party stops and some move to to hold him back as he is coming toward me.  I start to say something to him but hold back and just end up apologize to everyone at the party, as I really don't know what's going on.  So...I immediately get up and walk home.

At this point my summer starts to suck.  At work, I have to rely on my assistant to deal with him as he doesn't seem to want to talk to me, nor I to him.  I stop being invited to any events Dept. 2 has, including trips for our interns (like I said, our departments work together closely) for educational purposes.  Soon after, I hear from my assistant (who is a shared staff member between our departments) that he has been asked to mark down all the hours he works for me.  I ask why, and he tells me the head of Dept. 2 is trying to come up with a plan to ensure that I can't have an assistant next summer. He's planning on saying we don't have the overtime hours in the budget, as we share much of our money and resources.  He has never discussed this with me, and there is no shortage in our budget.

Eventually I get to talking to a close personal friend and divulge this information to him, having told no one else about how uncomfortable I have been feeling.  He gives me this gem of wisdom, 

*""You are holding yourself up to a double standard.  Were He straight and you a female, he would likely have been fired by now or brought up on charges, but because you are male you feel that these things simply don't happen to you.  But they do.""*

I wanted to share this with Reddit, and am asking for opinions and discussion.  I have decided to bring the issue to the ""big boss"" tomorrow afternoon, but am as nervous as hell because I don't feel good messing up his career, or mine if my boss doesn't think my story is the truth or finds my concerns foolish.  Any comments or discussion would be helpful and much appreciated.

**Edit TLDR** - My co-worker is a gay man who I feel has sexually harassed me and I am going to discuss it with our boss, but feel really incomfortable about it and am not sure if I am in the right or if I could have done something to help the situation before it got worse."

Getting an internship for the summer is my biggest priority this year. I've been reading through the posts on this subreddit for about a week now trying to pick up some new ideas and get my formatting down.

I'm currently a junior studying aerospace engineering, so I'm trying to hit up all the big aerospace company booths at the fair. I have several questions regarding my resume and the career fair.

1) Should I have an objective or paragraph at the beginning of my resume to grab the attention of the reader?

2) Is listing my relevant coursework okay, or is that looked down upon in the engineering field?

3) Along the same lines, should I list the courses that I am finishing up this year?

4) I have a really big interest in programming and would love to do something with that and aerospace when I graduate, but I'm not sure how to work that into my resume.

5) Regarding the career fair. Last year I was severely unprepared, and now I'm looking for advice on how to be ready this time. What to ask the recruiters, how to respond to their questions, etc...

Any advice or criticism is of course greatly appreciated"

There was an editor at the company who was being paid ~$1000 per month to do some data entry that could easily be automated, and my boss noticed that. He allotted me about four weeks to come up with a way to automate the process, or at least to make it less time-consuming and to save the company money.

I went on a coding spree and ended up automating the entire process in less than two days, saving the company about $12,000 per year, recurring indefinitely. I was given a small bonus and my boss has been very excited about it ever since, all the while earning $10/hour.

To make a long story short, I paid for my own employment several times over in a matter of days. How can I make this accomplishment come across in my resume clearly and succinctly without giving away any information that my boss wouldn't want others knowing? Has anyone faced a similar situation or know the protocol for a situation like this?

yte72,1,2012-08-25,Ok.... Help reddit... I'm suspicious of my girlfriend and her new friend. I've tried talking to her about it. What's your male/female opinion? What advice can you give?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/yte72/ok_help_reddit_im_suspicious_of_my_girlfriend_and/,"My girlfriend is rich and i'm not. Her mom would threaten to cut her off if she knew we were dating. My gf is totally dependent as in rent, car and med school education. (she began at u toledo last monday.) This has kept me out of huge chunks of her life and has made us completely stop out relationship at times. I love her so I try to make the best of it, but I complain when it's especially awful. We have been dating for nine months and her parents don't know I exist.this makes me feel that she sees me as unworthy. She lies to them constantly to keep them from being upset.


She has been dishonest to me several times in the past and most often involving her social interacting with men. She once went on vacation to st thomas and ended up being accosted by some dude at his beach house at five am even though she didn't really want to be there. Despite that fact of her not wanting to be there, she still danced all morning and went skinny dipping in the ocean - she claims she had on a tshirt and underwear.

About a two months ago, we went through a particularly rocky patch. as a result or if it was going on beforehand, she started up a flirtatious relationship with some intern at work. She would come to my house and we'd have sex and then she would go home and text him goodnight. I found out, she said it was over, but the next weekend, she went out with him again and then made out in the car. The whole time she,was telling me not to worry and that nothing like that was going on. I made her call him in front of me just to make sure it was over, but she wouldn't state me as the reason. She complimented me on how understanding I was being. Now I think she's taking that for granted and my kindness for weakness.

Tl;dr? Here's what's fucking me up right now. Tell me what you think. Should I be suspicious? Do you think i'm wrong?

1. She just got back from a three week vacation with her mom. It was a lot if sneaking phone calls and getting hung up on suddenly. She did talk to me much more than she usually does in such situations.

2. Monday was her first day of med school. She was all concerned about her outfit. I helped pick one out over skype. She wanted to look like she was taking it very seriously and professional. Some dude sat next to her in the class. On break, he asked for her number and she gave it. After class, he invited her to go with him to do some admin errands and to the library to study. She went. She says she told him then that she had a bf.

3. Tuesday, she said he sat on the other side of the room as her. I thought probably because he found out she was taken. She wore jeans and a long sleeve button up.

3. Wednesday, she wore jeans and a t shirt. She said her phone was fucking up and she couldn't message me. After class, she went to a study session and this guy was there. She didn't call me afterwards like she said she would. They walked to their cars together and she told him she liked his watch.

4. Thursday, she wore an extremely tight short skirt and a tight white shirt that unzips all the way down the from and heels to class. We talked later and she went on and on making fun of girls in her class wearing short shorts and sandals and how it was so hard to take them seriously and that they were desperate for male attention.

5. Friday.... She went to class in short shorts and sandals. Just like the girls she talked shit on. I called her out on the hypocrisy. Later that night, friday night, the guy texted get asking her to hang out.

I think my girl is missing obvious signals from guys. I ask her to be more cautious considering the history but she refuses. I'm worried that she hates these girls but sees how popular they are and sees how they're ogled and then tried to be like them. She's acted like someone else for approval in the past. She does things she says she didn't really want to do with guys A LOT. deep down, is it all about attention from men? Can I convince her to be most concerned about my attention? She's 22 &amp; around all sorts of college dudes. This guy supposedly has a girlfriend but she's in cali. Should I be suspicious? Is she going to try to be just like everyone else? Can I make her feel more special than that? Is something going on similar to before? Does it seem like he's interested? Should I trust her blindly? Please indicate m/f in comments."
yte13,0,2012-08-25,I saved my employer a good chunk of change during my summer programming internship.  How do I add this to my resume without disclosing too much information?,enkrypt0r,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/yte13/i_saved_my_employer_a_good_chunk_of_change_during/,"I am just about to complete what I would call an extremely successful internship.  I'm 20 years old and I've been coding since I was ~12, and having this internship has made me realize that I am pretty far ahead of the curve for my age, and I'd like to do everything I can to show that.

There was an editor at the company who was being paid ~$1000 per month to do some data entry that could easily be automated, and my boss noticed that.  He allotted me about four weeks to come up with a way to automate the process, or at least to make it less time-consuming and to save the company money.  

I went on a coding spree and ended up automating the entire process in less than two days, saving the company about $12,000 per year, recurring indefinitely.  I was given a small bonus and my boss has been very excited about it ever since, all the while earning $10/hour.

To make a long story short, I paid for my own employment several times over in a matter of days.  How can I make this accomplishment come across in my resume clearly and succinctly without giving away any information that my boss wouldn't want others knowing?  Has anyone faced a similar situation or know the protocol for a situation like this?

Thanks!  "
yt8qp,0,2012-08-25,Halp reddit... Need relationship advice/opinions from girls and guys. I'm suspicious of my girlfriend and her new friend. Am I insane? Is it founded? She won't answer me so i'm turning to you. ,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/yt8qp/halp_reddit_need_relationship_adviceopinions_from/,"So... Here is the story. I've been dating a girl for about nine months. She comes from a rich family while mine is pretty dirt poor. This is a major issue. She comes from a jewish family &amp; her mother is very controlling. I was raised catholic - the religious stuff doesn't matter much - &amp; never met my real dad. The relationship she had previous to me was with a guy with pretty much the same background as I and when her mother found out about it, she flipped the fuck out. The mother has, on several occasions including this one, threatened to cut off her own daughter from money &amp; the family if my girlfriend doesn't do as she's told or as is expected. She is completely dependent on them for everything. They pay her rent her bills for food cars credit cards clothes school etc and she is fearful of upsetting her mother and having those things taken away. Obviously, she broke up with her previous boyfriend and her mom had successfully ""killed a mosquito with a bazooka."" 

As a result, my girlfriends parents have absolutely no idea that I exist. As I say, we've been dating for nine months now. This has of course put tremendous strain on our relationship, at least for me. She says that she's used to it so it doesn't bother her as much. She goes on frequent family vacations and it is nearly impossible for us to communicate like a normal couple because she has to hide everything. There are major events in her life that I can't partake in because her parents will be there. She just got into med school and I was supportive the entire time however I could not attend her first days ceremony even though we talk about being together forever. All because her parents would disapprove of me. I won't even get into what that does for my self esteem: knowing that my girlfriend doesn't think i'm good enough to throw caution to the wind and tell her parents about and knowing for sure her mother wouldn't think I was good enough. A huge problem is that in most of her other life, she is a come what may, let the chips fall where they will kind of person and very sort of free with herself but not so with this. It really feels like, if she can't tell her parents about me, she doesn't approve of me on some level either. Like, even though I don't have much, my love for her isn't enough to gain enough approval from her.

we've had ups and downs like any relationship. I've got glaring issues of my own, but ones that i'm completely open with her about. I'm a pretty jealous guy. I was in the military for quite a while so i'm sort if ocd about things and I could really improve my temper. I'm seeing a shrink on a regular basis. I'm not very trusting as I have been severely burnt in the past and I try to be very upfront and clear about it to... Sort of ask for my partners help keeping it on check. The problem is that she has lied to me various times about things both big and small. Once, she lied to me about going to some appointment even though I didn't give a shit at all. Another time, she lied to me for months about some situation involving a group of guys she admitted to flirting with in st thomas. It ended with some guy trying to make out with her at the end of the night in his beach house after they all went skinny dipping. (she claims she wore a tshirt while everyone else was naked.) She claims it's all because I make it difficult for her to tell be things. I'm willing to admit that that is true and that i'm partly to blame however, I won't take all of it.
A few months ago, things were especially rocky for us. For about a month, she was in a flirtatious relationship with an intern at the place where she worked but claims that she was completely innocent the entire time. We got into a huge blow out and the next day she went into work and gave her number to this other guy. They went out for drinks one night. that same day, she was at my house talking about working things out and then later was on a date with him. We stayed together but a few days later I found out that she was still texting him acting obviously interested. She claimed that she was just using him and keeping him around in case things between us went south. But she also said that she was completely uninterested in him and never going to see him again. We broke up again on a wednesday. She showed up at my house unannounced on saturday and again we decided to work things out. Later that night she went to a movie with the guy and made out with him. We were back together again on monday. The whole time I was stressed out and worried about what,all this,meant for our relationship and she went on and on about how everything was just fine and that I had absolutely nothing to worry about. She told me to look into my heart and just belie her that nothing was going on and I did, but the whole time it really was. She made my own heart into a liar. But I gave her another chance. She was surprised how understanding I was about the whole thing. My jealous ridiculous self made her call him right in front of me and to tell him it,was over. I just wanted to be sure and it was impossible to trust that she would really let me know if it was or not. However, she wouldn't tell him that urges because she loved me. It was almost as if she was ashamed to admit that to him.
Currently, it is her first week of med school. Like I said, I couldn't go to her ceremony. After the ceremony, she went on a three week vacation with her mom and we had to sneak phone calls and I had to endure being hung yo on when her mom came in the room.... Ill break down the rest sort of short hand. Just the facts.
On monday, in her first day of class, this guy sat down next to her. When a break came up, he asked for her number to hang out sometime and she gave it to him. Class ended. She went with this guy to do various school admin errands then claims she had lunch by herself. Then, she met this guy at the library and they studied together for a while. She says she told him about me by saying, I have to call my boyfriend. Another note on monday, she was very concerned about what she was going to wear. She says that she wanted to look like she was professional and taking school seriously... I helped her pick out an outfit over skype. This becomes important later.
On tuesday, after she had told this guy she had a boyfriend, she says he sat across the room from her. I took it as he was no longer showing interest. It sounded like her feelings were hurt. She also dressed in jeans and a collared shirt that day. 
On wednesday, she claimed that her phone wouldn't work most of the day and I barely heard from her until ten o'clock at night. She wore jeans and a tshirt. She also says she was having lunch with some girls that she met. They were planning a party for friday. After class ended, she went to the library for a guided study session. There were six people there and this guy was one of them. Afterwards they walked to their cars together and as far as I know, their conversation consisted of her telling him how much she liked his watch.
On thursday, she wore the shortest, tightest skirt she could get away with without being totally trashy and a shirt that completely unzippered in the front. She looked good in it, it was just obviously a sex appeal outfit and not something a person would normally wear to class. As I say, she was wearing jeans and t shirts basically the other days and now she was dressed for a date just for school. I complained about it. I just wanted people to take her seriously and for her to be consistent &amp; to not try so hard working on an outfit to go sit at a desk learning for eight hours. I just thought it was silly&amp;  obviously meant for other purposes. I didn't want her or anyone else distracted because of her. She agreed that she didn't want to be a distraction. She said she didn't want to be the kind of girl to impress with her looks at school and would rather impress other ways. She talked shit on girls like that. FINISHED IN COMMENTs Almost done

yv72r,5,2012-08-26,Questions about life directions,Glassbottom,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/yv72r/questions_about_life_directions/,"Im 21 years old, and I don't like to work. Right now I'm doing an intern ship for 40 hours a week. I enjoy the things I have to do, the company I'm at is amazing, pays amazingly and overall I'm very lucky to have found them. The problem is, I do not like the feeling I'm getting afterwards. I live with my parents, and every night I'm thinking to myself, in two years I have to do this for the rest of my life and it makes me sad (the feeling goes away when I'm on my way to work though, and when I'm at work I don't have the feeling at all).

I don't really have any friends at all, I just like to sit behind a computer all day and overall don't enjoy socializing. But now that I'm experiencing working 40h/week for the first time I realise that I have to stop that lifestyle. I like to compete in video games, but that requires a lot of time which I don't have anymore.

I've started to hit the gym, hoping that if my body looks good I would get enough confidence to improve my social skills (will this work or am I just fooling myself?). I'm also starting to play soccer again, not because I enjoy it so much, but more that it will distract me from what I'm really thinking. Which is, if I finish my study I have to work 40hours a week, how will I survive this? The only reason I'm coping with it right now is because I know that after 5months I will go back to school and have a lot more time to play games.

Lucky for me, school is very cheap and I'm thinking of doing another bachelor study after I finish this one (Computer Science duhh^^). After I finish that one I want to get my masters degree in CS so that I know I will have an easy time to find a job and that it will pay a lot. In two years I'm finishing my current one (CS), then three years to get another one and then 2 more years to get my masters degree. I would be 28 by then and hopefully I will have matured enough to be comfortable enough to work all day every day.

I enjoy school and studying, and since I would already have my CS degree I'm thinking about what to do next. At CS 98% are guys and living the life I'm living right now (school - home - game - school) which I want to avoid. I want to go out, meet girls, have fun, party etc. Any recommendations on what I should study next to help me change my life? I'm interested to some degree in teaching, economics and law, and I know that I will want to work in one of those directions for a couple of years when I'm taking a break from working with computers programming stuff.

I know that this is a long wall of text, and I don't really know what I'm asking exactly but decided to post it anyways to maybe get some responses from people with similar experiences."

So I've been asked to make a form on a ColdFusion page and send the information via SOAP to a WSDL on a different server. I know the guy who is in control of the WSDL server and he is willing to open the servlet open for CORS, but I can't get anything like http://software.dzhuvinov.com/cors-filter.html to work.

I've outlined the problems I am having with that here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12149355/apache-tomcat-and-cors

Now, if I can't enable the server to allow cross domain scription, I'm stuck working through a proxy. I've talked things over with someone who had a similar problem and they worked through a java proxy, however he said I'm SoL for doing that since I don't have access to use Java on the server I'm working from. I can use ColdFusion Components.

So... has anyone built a SOAP proxy with ColdFusion Components or know how to enable cross domain scripting? I've been stuck on this task for a full week and have made very little progress on this end.

Intermediate Skill/Understanding of: HTML/CSS/Javascript/PHP/RubyOnRails/CodeIgniter/SQL/MVC

Like most programmers, I've dabbled in a lot more (C#/C++/ColdFusion/Actionscript/etc) but I'm primarily a web developer. I feel like I'm at that stage, however, where I can pretty much figure out how any language works. In terms of actual job experience, I've had two summer high school internships at Microsoft (Excel and Research) where I was primarily using C#. Recently a freelance database design job which involved using MS Access and VB.

But, I'm a college dropout with only one freelance database design job on my resume in about 4 years. Most of my knowledge is practical but I have some theoretical knowledge from my time at school.

Am I hireable? I like to think the lack of a degree isn't the biggest deal, but sometimes I have a voice in my head that nags at me and tells me otherwise."
ywibs,35,2012-08-27,How did you get your start?,Obvious-Implyer,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/ywibs/how_did_you_get_your_start/,"Hey guys, I'm 17 and going into grade 12 and *really* need to start looking into future careers and schooling and what not. I am looking to finish this year and go on to do Computer Science at a university level, hoping to break into this area of work (or programming). I already feel I know a lot about hardware (as I work as a hardware (primarily server actually) refurbisher for the community in my spare time) so I have that all down pat.

So my question is: How did you guys get your start? What influenced your decision to do this field of work? What sort of schooling did you go through? What do you recommend for someone to do trying to get into this area of work (internship, specific area of schooling, etc)?

EDIT0: Right now I kinda manage the IT for a local senior centre (running/maintaining their website, file server, computers/computer lab) and its going really smoothly. They only have 4 office PCs, 5 computer lab PCs (that have required virtually zero maintenance up to this point), a rock solid file server, and an off-site web server. I have experience setting up servers/software of all kinds (Linux, Windows, Mac OS servers) along with my hardware knowledge, but haven't really done anything too major (the most of my software experience is just like setting up VMs, LAMP/WAMP/MAMP servers, file servers, deployment, stuff like that). Would any of this experience be good to get documented for future use? Would it even be credible as its mostly volunteer work?

EDIT1: I live in Canada if that makes any difference."
ywcy8,1,2012-08-27,"Reddit, am I lost in career and life?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ywcy8/reddit_am_i_lost_in_career_and_life/,"My age and a bit of a background. I've just turned 31 and I'm in my junior year of college in an Aeronautical Science program.

I became an EMT early in college and followed that up volunteering as a firefighter after having an incident at home where my father almost died in my arms. After that my parents were divorced and my father told me that he had no son, after years of growing up in a violent environment. I wouldn't speak to him for about 10 years after all of that, the day before my first commercial pilot check ride no less. 

I did that up until an off chance when my mother and I spoke about aviation. It turned out that she had always wanted to be a pilot but never told me. I was growing sick and tired of always seeing people at their worst so I thought I would give it a go.  I checked out some schools and enrolled in flight school where I graduated around 2008 with all of my commercial ratings and instructor ratings at the top of my class. I went on to instruct until I got an invitation from one of my top Regional Airline picks to come in to interview. I nailed the interview and was offered to begin training. I was loving life, a young, new pilot with all of my flying career in front of me, until that call. During our 3rd or 4th day of systems class I got a call from my mother. My last grandparent, my grandfather died. I was a mess. I'd go on to miss 2 to 3 days more of class all while HR was ""figuring out what to do with me"" just to end up going back to training and missing the funeral (in a foreign country) just to fail the test, and out of my potential job. I was told to go pack my things and leave. HR was totally aware of the situation, but they were unwilling to give me any bereavement since I was not technically an employee (you have to pass the final check ride to be officially offered the position), they gave me the choice of either leaving and trying to apply at a later date, or at least try the test after missing so much material. My familie's wishes were for me to stay, it was my dream...... To be shattered. 

So now, through all that, a tarnished professional pilot record and years lost in depression and anxiety I continued to instruct a little bit, but in general, just be a miserable person. My father got back in contact with me but he is miserable and I just get so depressed and upset talking to him. He didn't even bother to call for my birthday this year, whatever. 

Anyhow, I'd love to get back into an aviation job. I recently had an interview with a fixed wing company that flies medical and life flight type stuff. I thought I was a shoe in with my medical background, being bilingual, etc. long story short, after multiple calls and follow ups, I never heard anything back, no ""yes"", no ""no"". 

What I've found; by the way, through all these years of no female, or emotional contact (read: no girlfriend in since I can remember) is that I have passion for flying still, but I've grown sick of trying and in wonder of if I will ever be able to have that future with whatever record that airline gave me. 

I've always loved cooking, and while speaking to an exec chef friend of mine, he recommended that I Stage (intern) for a little while with one of his chef friends here in town. I pretty much jumped on it, ordering a pair of chef coats, pants, clogs, and whatever else the next day. Am I crazy for skipping around this much? I asked my friend, whom we grew up together as babies and who is helping me get my foot in the door if I was crazy and he said no,  ""WE are crazy, if I weren't cooking, I'd be a pilot. At least you could always do that on the side if this is for you""

I wanted to ask, after this........ ""ride"" that I've had. Where do I stick? Does anyone think that it will just ""click"" some day? I am still instructing part time because I love working with people and flying. I am also doing quite well in school, but have considered after this semester, now that all of my basics will be done, that I may go to my local college for a more ""substantial"" degree. 

This turned out a lot longer than i had expected, I suppose I just needed to get this out of me. I'm just very tired, and sick living my life in complete regret of the past, wondering if it is worth even trying to go on to find some morsel of happiness in my life. Because it has been far too long since I've tasted any kind of true joy. I feel like I have so much to give, but I can't get out of this shell that seems to surround me. 

If you've gotten this far, thanks for listening :)

I KNOW I am lucky.
I KNOW I should be happy.

But that's why I think I am crazy.

I'm about to graduate in December and already have an extremely well paying part-time position as essentially tech support (with a humanities degree at that). But, it's awesome tech support.  I really like the job, I like the people I work with, and they want to give me full time once I graduate.

But... I'm just unsatisfied. I've been this way ever since I got my first job, I view every single one as experience leading me to the point I am now. But, now that I'm at ""that point,"" I can't stop viewing it as experience. 

I *miss* looking for jobs and experiences. I've already been essentially offered another well paying internship at a well known tech company once I graduate as well and I can't help but to expect that I'm going to take it, even though I already have the full time job.

Anyways, any advice? How do I settle? Is it okay that I don't? I realize that I'm still young and have barely started on the career track, but I also know many people (even in actual tech fields) that would kill for the position I'm in."

I don't get paid too much, you can Google how much I get paid.
 |The device basically just captures images every 2 seconds, unless you are moving faster. That's all I know really. It uses a lot of data.
[Thanks for your reply! Here are some follow-ups if you don't mind.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c607ym1?context=5)|It all depends on the assignment. Right now I'm stationed in NYC going re-dos of some areas and around upstate. I usually do around 20 miles in NYC a day. In upstate, usually around 80.
[*For further understanding can you clarify how many miles you drive in a day or a shift?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c607ym1?context=5)|But this is considered a part time job, I only drive 2-3 times a week. The rest of the time I'm sorting through and finishing off data to be sent to the other teams to implement into the software. I need to make sure multiple GPS align with the metadata in the camera.
[*Since you're not in the Subie, what car did they give you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c607ym1?context=5)|I drive a Nissan minivan. In the NYC office, we recently got the vans from Nissan since they are upgrading the taxis to these new vans they have. But yes, the majority of the fleet are Subaru.
[*Do you just drive the speed limit on the specific road you are on? I just curious as to how speed would effect the quality of the picture since it's every 2 seconds.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c607ym1?context=5)|Usually I drive the speed limit. Like I mentioned, the cameras can adjust to the speed. At 60 mph they take them much faster. However sometimes if I can, I will drive slower if there isn't a lot of traffic. It's safer, easier on the equipment, and produces a little better resolution.
[*The same person never drives the same route again.*  Is that policy, a rule -- if so, why -- or does it just work out that way?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c609i0n?context=5)|You know...I really don't know! There is a myth that this is the design of the plan, but just the way that your schedule and routes are planned out, you usually are always visiting uncharted land (at least by you). I did do some overlap driving in NYC, but that was just to get to another one-way street. Up in like MA or something, I do a town and never see it again. But I have been to Massachusetts only once so far. 
[What is your favorite part of the job,aside from knowing millions will take virtual trips of what you photograph?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c607sxm?context=5)|I just love driving. Gridlock, open roads, highways. I have a destination, but there is never really any stress involved. It is just fun. Of course, it is a lot of hard work and the pay isn't all that great.
[Don't get fired for sharing information. Not saying they'll care but on the chance they do be careful.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c608wts?context=5)|Nah they can't figure out It's me. But I wouldn't share any critical info.
[*the pay isn't all that great.*  I always thought working for google = 6 figure paycheck. And now the spell is broken.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60fnyg?context=5)|I don't work for Google, I'm just contracted by them. I work for a separate company that owns the tech that does this. Google contracts that company.
[Could you elaborate on the hard work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c607vm2?context=5)|Well it is a little stressful when planning the route and changing drives, etc... You need to review all of the data before submitting it. If one of the cameras got bird droppings on it, you need to go back to that spot and do it again.
[Thanks for the response..Bummer on the pay. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60bm5b?context=5)|Yeah its part time though. I won't say what else I do, but I do make a living doing something else. This is just for some extra money and fun.
[Type of vehicle, route, office location, 2,100 miles driven... They could narrow it down.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c608ypz?context=5)|True, but I don't mind. It isn't as glamorous as it seems. Plus that is only an office location, not MY home office. But either way, I wouldn't say anything I can't share with friends.
[Dude, Google. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60cn50?context=5)|Nice to meet you Mr Dude.
[You drive and review the data?  Interesting.  What is the software that you use to review the footage?  Is it a standalone version of maps?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60f6z9?context=5)|I can't say the name of the software. But it stitches together the images like you would see and from there, we review it in a more fluid motion that what you see on the computer.
[I think we all know what else you do.  I'm joss keedink!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60gu6m?context=5)|I don't get it lol.
[So... we're your friends? :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60cctt?context=5)|My real friends.
[Are you worried about this AMA getting you fired?  (legitimate question given that idiot Chrome guy\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60bip5?context=5)|Not really. Didn't break any rules or give away any secrets. I feel this IamA is a service that educates people on an unknown topic.
 |Plus I'm contacted through a third party, so I'm not worried. I respect both companies enough not to say anything I can't. If I had stopped the job, that is different.
[Oh it TOTALLY is a service.  I have a ton of questions but almost every single one violates your NDA and would probably get you fired if you answered them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60byar?context=5)|Could be. But try and ask. And if I can't answer them I will let you know.
[How much data does a google car record in a day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c6094td?context=5)|Usually 1 TB a day, give or take.
[Do you upload that data in real time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c6094td?context=5)|Nope, SSD. There is a remote backup that does transmit real time GPS status.
[Also, why does it take so long for a area to get updated in Google Maps?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c6094td?context=5)|Not sure, I just drive. After I send it, I dont know what happens to it.
[What capacity is your SSD? What's the resolution on your cameras? Can you provide any other specs on your equipment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c609o9l?context=5)|I can't talk about the equipment for whatever reasons they say. The cameras I do know are 3 MP I believe. We usually fill up about 1 TB a day, and have to change SSD once or twice. So I believe they are below 1 TB. 
[Likely 512GB, that seems to be the largest commercial SSD.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60gvxz?context=5)|Would make sense. They don't have any general markings, but I'll read the little writing on the back.
[So who plans the route, you or your manager?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60abil?context=5)|I get point A and B. I plan the route so at least I know what to expect along the route.
[So what's the most efficient way to capture a grid/city like street pattern?  Do you go first with streets north to south and then east to west?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60abil?context=5)|It depends. NYC is just easy because of the grid-like streets. Usually I just go with the flow and what has one-way streets and doesn't. Also, Google Maps Traffic actually does work and helps.
[If you go far away do you stay in a hotel or do you back home?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60abil?context=5)|We usually like leap-frog to our goal. Sometimes we do stay in hotels, but that isn't all too frequent. Usually we can stay near another Google Office or so and go from there.
[Do you park your car home or at Google's property?  If its at home how do you protect the gear?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60abil?context=5)|We can park on Google's property. But the company that owns the tech is called Immersive Media. 
[What are your favorite pizza toppings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c608gyz?context=5)|I don't know, I hate pizza. 
[Dafuq.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60a1c8?context=5)|I like calzones better. 
[I feel like this has the potential to become the least popular AMA response comment ever. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c609qiv?context=5)|I was just anti-feeding the troll. 
[Whats your favorite topping within a calzone?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60gklh?context=5)|Pizza bites.
[Oh, you mean, an inside out pizza?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60fpx3?context=5)|No, like Slyvester Calzone, you know, from Fairy Odd Parents.
[How often do people try to pose for photos? Thanks for the AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c607ufg?context=5)|Most don't expect us to come, and when they do, they get that ""deer in the headlights"" look. And before you know it, we are gone. And you're welcome! I just joined Reddit because I saw so many people do cool IamA and I thought my job was pretty unique.
[How do you find out when the car will come through your area?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c609mop?context=5)|I'm not entirely sure. It is basically classified data, I wouldn't release it and no one else on the team would either. I really don't know. 
[What is the funniest thing you have driven by and thought how awesome that is that people will be able to see it online?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c608oqi?context=5)|I saw a naked guy hitchhiking but I had to delete that. Umm sometimes I saw funny marquee signs around businesses. A Burger King sign was broken in to and people made it say ""Eat Twat at BK"". 
[Have you ever driven by something hilarious, and made a point to look it up after it gets uploaded? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c608012?context=5)|Honestly I just pay attention to the computer with the GPS or the road. I don't really site see, too occupied with doing the job to do so. After reviewing the stills at the end of the day, once in a while I will see something funny. But I don't really care about it after I upload it.
[How many miles have you logged so far?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c609c9j?context=5)|Around 2100 miles. Haven't been doing it for too long.
[The pictures on Google Maps are kinda old now. Not that I don't appreciate the effort, but when do you think they'll update the images? Is it an on going project or more of a one-off thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60ax82?context=5)|Some places get updated frequently because they develop and change. It takes about 6 months to a year to appear after we take the pictures. 
[How do people react to you when they meet you on the streets?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60ax82?context=5)|Well, since my car isn't labeled yet, they don't really know. Some people do and wave. With other drivers though, everyone knows and it can get annoying.
[Do you get afraid when going into bad areas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60ax82?context=5)|A little. I would no matter Google car or not. I have a panic button that relays my location directly to the police which helps.
[Worst thing that's ever happened to you while driving?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60ax82?context=5)|Nothing really. I've had birds poop on the camer array, and not notice until it was time to review and I noticed an entire section ""whited-out."" Kinda ruined my day.
[How much gasoline/petrol have you used in total?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60ax82?context=5)|I really don't know, I just fill up with the company card when needed. Otherwise, whenever I get the car the next day, it always has a full tank. Somewhere out there, an intern probably just fills the cars all day. 
[You moght wanna be careful about this, a Google employee got fired for posting on Reddit... But on with the questions.  Have you ever deliberately put yourself in a snapshot (say, outside of your house?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60anhc?context=5)|My house isn't located near any of the routes I drive, and I wouldn't. I don't really like Facebook, let alone post my own picture for the world to see. Plus, I have to edit anything like that, and my face would be blurred anyway. 
[Do you have to stop if someone does something dumb?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60anhc?context=5)|Well in NYC, can't really stop. If it's the suburbs, and I see a guy who know's what's up, I will stop and just inform him who I am and what I am doing and that it is advised if he get's out of the shot. 
[How many hours a day do you drive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c607w0g?context=5)|When you start, it is around 5 hours or so. When you get more assignments, it usually goes into 8 hours. This is very rare though. It all depends on your area. A huge suburb might take a short amount of time versus like NYC you know.
[Has anyone ever flashed or mooned you? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c608nkn?context=5)|I think only once. Like I mentioned, they usually don't see us coming or are prepared to do anything.
[Did you ever have any interesting encounters with people, good or bad, that have stood out to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c6085tw?context=5)|I've been pulled over by a cop who didn't know what it was (my car is brand new and isn't labeled yet). He had a good laugh, and there was footage of me getting pulled over, but I had to erase it.
 |Bad? One guy told me he would sue me for photographing him in front of his house. He tried to follow me, but he gave up for whatever reason. 
[That's hilarious, but I can see how the job could also have its dangers since the giant cameras on top of the car tend to make you a bigger target. Are there any safety precautions you're taught to take when faced with potential carjackers or anything of the like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c608ct9?context=5)|Well doors locked of course! We are required to check our cell-phones in when we sign-in. However, there is a panic button which signals the police and our supervisor. That button disables the car 1 minute later and locks the perp in. It also starts backing up all data we have for the day.
 |If it is really rainy or windy, we usually don't go out. Makes for bad pictures and hard to control the van. 
[You might want to censor the info about that button. If a thief knows about it, then it might not be as useful for security of the car (Thief might then research on it and how to override it\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60gsfe?context=5)|Perfectly safe. I will not disclose the exact location, and there is no way to override it. There is no documentation on that device, it is proprietary.
[I like that feature.  How does it backup the data? Cellular?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60f8ye?context=5)|Yes, it has a 4G LTE data connection always connected.
[Fine then, I was just checking to make sure it was okay to disclose that it exists.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60h2l3?context=5)|Oh of course. I am being very careful about this IamA, there is plenty I wish I could mention but can't.
[There was a recent post of a guy who took a picture of a Google car and said ""they wouldn't continue until I went inside the house""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c609a10?context=5)|Sometimes this can happen. Never happened to me, but the general rule is if they know who you are and are close enough, try to scare them off. When you aren't looking, they can do something like mooning. Then you would have go back later and redo that area.
[What has been your most memorable experience so far? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c609g20?context=5)|Maybe just when someone recognizes the Google car and chats with me at a red light or something.
 |That and the time I got pulled over and just had a fun talk with the officer explaining to him the details of what I was doing. 
[Did he pull you over because he was actually concerned with the cameras or because he was a fanboy? :p.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60a149?context=5)|He didn't know what it was. My car is new, and doesn't have the decals on it yet. So he was just making sure, as I was crossing the GW bridge and you can't take pictures on there. 
[Why on earth are you doing this? Don't you remember what happened to the Chrome guy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60cbid?context=5)|I didn't break any rules of the NDA. ;)
[Can you smoke in the car?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c609u3o?context=5)|Nope. We are required to check cell phones with the garage. The volume of the stereo is limited. We are limited by an ""X"" amount of stops we can make for food, etc....
[Why do you check in your phones? What if someone in your family has an accident, how will they contact you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60k62i?context=5)|We have Google voice on the computer. But so we aren't distracted by our phones. 
[Do you know roughly how long it takes for the images to appear online? I just remembered that I was driving behind a street view car on the highway a couple months ago so I'm wondering when I might be able to see myself.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60av61?context=5)|Usually 6 months. But you would barely be able to see anything identifiable. License plates and faces are blurred out, plus the resolution alone isn't that great. 
[Whenever I see a Google Maps driver, I smile and wave because (a\) hey, I love you guys and (b\) I'm hoping to end up on a map.  Am I the only one who does this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60a656?context=5)|It happens semi-rarely. Most people don't know what to expect until they read the sides of the car. By then, we are already down the block. In NYC, it is very common. But I can't prevent that. 
[ highway too signs sometimes. Makes it extremely annoying.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60ikol?context=5)|That is usually by mistake, as it tends to blur any text it assumes it to be a license plate. And I believe VT has green plates with white lettering.
[Do you drive through dangerous hoods?  Do they have special cars or vans to go through those dangerous areas where guns are the norm and guys are hanging out on corners?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60bsye?context=5)|Some parts are dangerous. No special cars though.
[The Emerald City?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60gvzm?context=5)|Saphron City? Wasn't that in one of the Pokemon games?
[Do you check out good places to eat on the route before heading out? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60cwvr?context=5)|Sometimes yes. Usually I don't know my route until I plan it. So while planning it, I make sure to find a good places from the Google reviews. I try to stay away from chain fast food places unless during the night. I like smaller, individually owned restaurants.
[Have you found any new favorite spots or restaurants since you started google mapping?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60cwvr?context=5)|I have found a couple of good places, but since I don't live near where I map, I don't have the chance to really visit them. 
[Have you thought of getting a professional transportation license and making this kind of thing a longer commitment like limo driving or truck driving? Or is this more of a side job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60cwvr?context=5)|Nope. Just want some extra money saved up so when I start my new job, I don't have to worry about finances if it costs me a little extra to move.
[If this is a side job, what are your future plans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60cwvr?context=5)|I can't say, and if I did, it would be highly contradictory to my current job. ;)
[Do you have any ability to decide what to cover? For example, when I'm using Street view, I sometimes notice that tiny side streets have been missed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60aw6x?context=5)|Yes for the most part. If I have to get to my destination and for some reason, one route works better, I'll take that route. That means that for whatever reason that day, this street hasn't been driven down because of time, etc... We try to stay in the most common places people will look. 
[Have you hit any deer/objects yet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60az41?context=5)|Nope! And if you did, I bet they would take you off the program. You need to have as good of a driving record as the driverless car. 
[I am 21, have a clean driving record, and live in Ontario. How do I find a google maps driver job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60mwnm?context=5)|You can't *find* the job. It is listed just as a driving job, nothing related to Google whatsoever. 
[If you reviewed the footage and noticed there was someone in one of the pictures that was waiting to photobomb, what happens?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60a2ty?context=5)|Well if it is past the time I drove by there and nothing happened, whatever. But if I can prevent you from being photographed, I will. Our imaging software does the rest to block out plates, addresses, names, faces, etc... 
[ when's the next round of photos going to happen, I have my old truck in the driveway in my house picture, and I haven't had that truck in a few years.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60a2ty?context=5)|I have no clue. Basically it's like an unknown route each day. I get the point A and B, I have the rest of the day to plan and get there. Tomorrow, I continue from point B to point C, etc... I technically work for Google, but I am contracted by a separate company that Google contracts for this job. 
[1- How do you apply for this job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60h543?context=5)|Read the title post.
[2- Are they planning to make it completely worldwide? Like Middle Eastern countries don't have street-view. Is there a chance that they will have it soon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60h543?context=5)|I really wouldn't know. But from my own guess, I wouldn't say any time soon to dangerous areas. 
[3- How old are you and how long have you been driving with a clear record?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60h543?context=5)|I won't say my exact age, but I am under 30. I've been driving clean ever since I got my license as a kid. 
[I can understand this. I just had a great idea is love to see on the site, but for another question, as a driver does this help you familiarize yourself with the local places? I know when I'm out and about, driving to my friends houses I know it helps me a lot memorizing the roads and such.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c609kxj?context=5)|Well I don't drive around the place I live. But I do get to do some sight-seeing when I park and such. I loved Boston. NYC has gotten a little tiresome, and the team is pretty much done there. I will be sticking more to New England from now on.
[Do you really have to wait for people to get out of the way before you can keep going?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c608520?context=5)|What do you mean?
[If people are in your way trying to get in the shot do you take the picture or wait until they leave?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c6087ce?context=5)|Well I don't control when the picture is taken, I can only stop the recording. Usually people don't get in the way of moving cars. 
[I've stood on my lawn and the car has stopped until I went inside. How long would you actually wait for me before driving off?  Basically, are you BOUND to a certain route?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c609rdx?context=5)|We are given starting point and end point. We must plan our route ourselves so that the whole area has been covered. There is a unique Google Maps overlay we use on our computers that, when we reach our data coverage area, it says like ""80% complete"", etc....
 |Usually we do stop for as long as possible. However, if it is the end of the shift or we are behind, we will try to edit you out if possible. If you do anything stupid and we can't edit, we have to come back some other day or month to get that street. 
[Put me down as 'disappointed'.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60bp6c?context=5)|How so?
[What's the procedure when you record something you shouldn't record, like a prostitute on the side of the road, or a naked person? Do you record the time on your clock and does someone go and delete it later?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60crm8?context=5)|Well I try to pause the cameras. Prostitute isn't that bad. If its a naked person, then there is a possibility to edit him out, otherwise we need to come back to that location. We review our own pictures of the day. 
[How much were you paid, and did you go to anywhere that you felt you needed to lock the doors? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60bj27?context=5)|Not going to give exact numbers, but not much. Google it.
 |We always lock the doors anywhere. 
[Naw, given my employment I'll bing it, and if it doesn't work, We'll rip your guys idea off and fix it ;\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60bw3i?context=5)|Ha! Well I'm not a hardcore Google employee, but I catch your drift ;)
[What speed limits do you have?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60hw1p?context=5)|Normal speed limits on the roads, but we go slower if traffic allows.
[Sooo, triangulation... do you do it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60bssi?context=5)|What?
[I'll take that as a no. triangulation ... You can find the location of routers this way if you scan while you drive. Google has been suspected of doing this and gathering location data of it's users because of the Google mapping process.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60bw9h?context=5)|Yeah one thing that I won't comment on.
[I am europian, don't know to much about the US and it roads. so im sorry. My question is: is there any place you would love to drive or does it not mather for you to much where you drive? Given the option to drive anywhere in the world.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60fofp?context=5)|If I could choose where to drive, it would be along the west coast, like Seattle. I love cities along the coast. I would never want to drive in the midwest due to all of the storms and boringness.
[Another question, how did you get this job?  I think it would be interesting.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c609bhd?context=5)|Read my title post, it explains it.
[What music do you listen to while cruising down the road?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60eykh?context=5)|Good question. Usually a good variety. I like OAR, Switchfoot, Dream Theater, A7X, Linkin Park. I usually have Pandora going on quick mix, so I find new artists that way.
[How boring is it on a scale from 1-10...10 being ultra-boring. what freedoms do you have while you're driving? can you listen to music etc? what other things besides driving do you have to do (operate the camera, adjustments etc\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60xz2i?context=5)|It's a 5. I get Pandora, but I do have to pay attention to the equipment, the road, the weather, the data, people, etc...So it's never that I'm not busy doing something. I like driving, so it is fun. I get to see some cool towns for free.
[Hi, my first time using Reddit, What if someone does not want his house to be in the picture? What can he/she do? Isn't that invasion of privacy? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60p4vw?context=5)|Nope! Since the street is public domain, anything in view is recordable. I can stand on the sidewalk and photograph your family eating dinner (creepy I know). But since I am not trespassing, nothing can be done unfortunately. 
[How many miles do you drive a week? are the routes planned out? if you drive an insane amount of miles do you stay at a hotel for the night or do you always end it during work hours and go home?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c610cbu?context=5)|Not to sound condescending, but I answered those questions so many times in other posts.
[I've heared that Google plans to(maybe already has started?\) Street View hiking trails and the like. How do I get this job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60lljg?context=5)|I wouldn't know unfortunately.
[How far away do you go? For example, will someone from New York end up also driving in Maine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60lh0n?context=5)|Read my title post. But it just listed the job as a driver, nothing Google related on the listing.
 |As far as driving goes, yes you could be if you wanted.
[What codes of conduct to you have, like if someone tries to photo bomb or cause any trouble?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60lwca?context=5)|I do believe I cannot disclose that (yet). But for the most part, we will stop and chat for a little bit, then ask you to leave. If someone is behind us and does something wrong, then we have to try to edit it out, or we come back later. 
[Would you force someone to get off the road? Because there was a recent post about a driver forcing a redditer to go in the house as he video taped him. Let me get you the post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60ibp8?context=5)|If they were in the road yes. If they were inhibiting our work yes. Once in a while I'll let a guy hold up a sign or do something funny. By 6 months later, he won't remember or won't care anymore.
[Wasn't some guy fired for simply posting his google shirt, and you do all this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60fa4k?context=5)|Nope, read the facts dude. He posted sensitive and critical information about release dates, etc... I haven't. 
[Where do you apply for a job like this??  It's not in Google careers. Who do I contact NYC area.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60tsdh?context=5)|You wouldn't know. The job listing was just for a driver for the third-party company, it didn't advertise Google in anyway. Really just got lucky, you can't apply in person, they only accept applications every year or so. 
[Can I punch you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60gdnt?context=5)|Would it be in Street View-mode?
[I've recently stumbled upon this on google maps. Russia is a crazy place   How does google deal with incidents like this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60f1yh?context=5)|There is a huge rulebook with how to deal with all kinds of things. It's in there, so its best not to answer that.
[Who decides what roads are too insignificant to drive down?  There were times that I've seen some smaller roads on Google Maps not have the street view option. Wondering who makes that decision....](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60onee?context=5)|Usually the drivers. We have high-priority streets that we MUST go down, but as to get to the ""finish"" line, that is up to us. Some streets are just not right at the time, or there is a reason why they aren't recorded (ie error, person in the road, etc..)
[Has anything ever happened to you like the one car that got chased by the guys in wetsuits and had tridents?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60rcim?context=5)|Ha! Nothing really. I had a couple of young kids know what it was and do some funny stuff like stand on their heads, etc... But since my car isn't labeled, most don't know what it is, and by the time they do, I am gone. 
[Funniest thing seen while taking pictures for Google Maps?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/yzoft/iama_recently_employed_google_maps_driver_i_drive/c60h0xx?context=5)|Hmm not sure, nothing too out of the ordinary yet. I've seen some weird people in NYC.

z1ekk,5,2012-08-29,Career advice for 20-year old?,[deleted],sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/z1ekk/career_advice_for_20year_old/,"Hey everyone, I'm currently a 20-year old student working and attending school (both full-time). I'm currently the sole sysadmin for a 35-person financial services firm, and have been doing so for the last year. We're a 100% MS/Windows shop, and I manage everything that plugs into the wall. I make $38k/year with 2 years of experience (resident/small business IT support for a year before my current gig).

I have been looking for a new position for a number of reasons, among them: the pay is well below market for the area, the organization is highly unlicensed and unwilling to do anything about it, my boss will skate over the 10 things you do well and just hammer away at one mistake or uncompleted task, and I am generally just being given tasks that really have nothing to do with IT. I'm also getting to the point where I know the network like the back of my hand and not learning anything, which I really don't like. Half the thrill for me is researching an issue you've never encountered, learning a lot more about the technology in the process, and then putting the resolution under your figurative ""belt"" so you know what to do if you encounter it again. I really love that knowledge acquisition process, and I just don't feel like it's happening here anymore.

I have spoke to a recruiter and gotten three interviews so far- all three have offered me a position for around $55k, but I also feel like each is primarily going to be help desk with the possibility of advancement at some point in the future. I don't know whether to hold out for a position where I'd be given keys to the kingdom right off the bat (like I am here), or to work at one of these MSP's, make decent money, and then move up in the same company.

I understand that I don't have 7 years of experience, but I would say my resume is pretty impressive- I spearheaded and completed our XP to 7 migration (working with an IT intern we had), succesfully completed an Exchange 2003 to 2010 migration, and successfully migrated some of our critical infrastructure from baremetal to ESXi5 with very little issues. I would never say I know everything or even all I need to know, but I would argue that I'm competent enough to land another sysadmin position.

What do you guys think I should do?"
z1b6s,3,2012-08-29,Why can't I get a job?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z1b6s/why_cant_i_get_a_job/,"Geo political, social, and economic factors aside. Let me start with a seemingly common synopsis with in my life. That a company just doesn't have room for me. Now while the economy is in a down swing I just can't seem to buy it it that where ever I go they suddenly are just cutting back (I work in IT by the way). 
Let me provide an example. I worked for a company called ASK, it's a managed IT services shop. I was intern and I busted ass. Scheduled 8-1 (salaried at 40 bucks a day) and I'd be there 7-5 (if there was work to be done). At the end of the internship I was told that ""I was one of the brightest technical minds that the head IT had worked with but my talent was raw (not enough experience)"" and ""there just wasn't enough room"". Now as far as know this was BS because that same day I heard the CEO talking about bringing in more guys. I figured out how to use aspects of their CRM that they didn't even know about. I wrote scripts to automate installations of large jobs for client systems. I knew things that they didn't; bottom line (not that they weren't sharp). You see all these posts about how people browse Reddit at work. Never once did I use the computer for any thing but work. I never even got a chance to get out in the field (but one time I picked up a Backup drive from a site, oooo so engaging(sarcasm)). 

Example 2: I had a friend reference me for an interview at a company formally known as Netarx, now a division of Logicalis. Over the phone they're talking about how swamped they are and that they NEED people. I thought the interview went great. I clean up well (6'4, 220 good shape. I feel it's important to note I'm not a shmuck) Suit, Tie tack, Real nice shoes, The works. I answer questions well and feel I'm quite sharp in conversation. Yet after the interview, its all ""well ya know we're not quite sure if we need more people right now"".

There's more examples very similar to these situations. 

Either way, I know that this is a super open ended question but I'm at my wits end. Any advice?"
