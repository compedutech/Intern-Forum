So far Ive been teaching myself, C++(on the recommendation of my internship manager), python, R and SQL. I've understood the gist of it all but are there any good websites and any tips for practising and getting better at it? whats a day like for a data scientist in a big company as a graduate or entry level? 

note: I used a mix of youtube, khan academy and code academy to learn this for a few months now. I started off with linkedin learning but the videos were long and dreadful. I like having a problem, trying it out myself and if i get it wrong comparing it to the solution and learning from there.

Thanks!"

good on first teacher (she was my club advisor and i had her as a science teacher for 2 yrs)

average on second teacher letter

probably not very good on the counselor letter (it's an underfunded public school)

**Interviews**

here's what i remember

Stanford - pretty average, i was super nervous bc it was my first one

Bowdoin - i did this in a hotel lol also the girl and i had nothing in common major wise but we connected so well and shared a lot of laughs!! she made me feel really comfortable!!

Cornell - not like this one matters since it's non evaluative but the guy seemed bored lol

Penn - LITERALLY THE BEST i was super nervous but after a few minutes both myself and the guy were laughing and smiling, interview went on for like 90 minutes and we even exchanged book recs

special interviews:

usc wbb - online interview where the computer asks a question - i prepared so much for these and i thought i did fine

berkeley met - i remember my skin was acting up that day lol but other than that there were only 2 questions although the last one was not one that i expected

**Essays**

stanford essays were way too ""trying to be quirky"" when i'm not actually quirky

i rewrote my common app essay just for stanford so stanford had a different one than all the other schools

personally i thought my penn m&amp;t and general penn essays were great and personal to me!

thought my northwestern essay was pretty unique too

my usc wbb essays focused on my ""uniqueness"" of being chinese american but learning/being involved in italian language and culture (the program takes place in America, Hong Kong, and Milan)

my vanderbilt essay talked about ec #2 no quirkiness at all

for any college that asked about songs/music i always gave an exo song hehe

**Additional Information:**

pomona and columbia both mentioned specifically my advocacy work w the feminism club and my environmental research. 

i applied for a lot of school merit scholarships since my family would receive no financial aid so that means i started writing/applying pretty early

i sent a classical voice portfolio to stanford, good thing i didn't send it any where else

according to my spreadsheet i wrote 73 essays and had 3 distinguishably different common app essays

anyways, anchor down lol"

This sub played an important part in it.",pgg1610,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/obbwol/after_8_months_of_job_search_and_learning_landed/,"[Job search statistics](https://preview.redd.it/s3gbot2xyl871.jpg?width=2100&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f38c2be7551e133424dfd72f711f157badf7604b)

I have mostly been a lurker in this subreddit, reading the tips, hacks, and suggestions members meticulously draft. In my journey from Chemical Engineering focused Ph.D. to Data Science and ML application, this subreddit has been vital. During my job search and interview prep the cheat sheets and tips shared by everyone in this subreddit were helpful resources, beyond that I felt I was not alone in this journey with users sharing their career insights, up &amp; downs. As I finally look towards beginning a new phase in my life, a big thank you to everyone in this subreddit, the selfless writers, didactic bloggers, and well-wishers, I owe a part of my success to you all.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 1: Chemical Engineering PhD at a university in the midwest. I was able to start a DS-focused project which later had a strong ML component and had an industry internship last summer (2020). However, during my job search, I realized the research I do doesn't translate well to industry and there are no open positions in the roles that might align well. I took some supplementary courses (Coursera &amp; Datacamp), set up a portfolio website, and widened my network. The tips and anecdotes shared in this subreddit were a crucial source of motivation and support.

Edit 2: I am an international student on an F1 so I had to factor in time taken to get my work permit and willingness of the employer to sponsor my eventual work visa. The average time to get a work permit is 180 days which brought in another constraint.

New role: My new job is focused on drug discovery modeling at a pharma company.

obcn8o,47,2021-06-30,"[University] My perspective: NUS/NTU* or ""top overseas university""?",user_terminal,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/obcn8o/university_my_perspective_nusntu_or_top_overseas/,"Warning: This view may be biased as I am going to NUS to study. But some of my friends with the same A Level results are going overseas to study in good universities. This is a summary of the long discussions I had with some of them.

\*I didn't include SMU and SUTD in the title as they are more niche universities

**Going to top overseas universities to study**

**Pros:**

1. Reputation  
Hard to avoid this question. No doubt at the present moment, despite the rising status of our local universities, Cambridge and Oxford etc. enjoy greater brand recognition. How significant is this phenomenon? Talking to adults, it is quite significant still. But talking to my peers -- most think that it is not so significant. Perhaps it is because NUS has risen in global standing significantly since our parents' days compared to now.  
But what do **employers** think? My opinion is that your university CGPA is more important (and the honours you graduate with), and that only is for your first job. I think that as you go into your second, third job, experience matters **way** more. The only exception is academic positions in our universities. Strangely, NUS and NTU prefer to hire professors who did their PhD overseas, maybe to create a more ""diverse faculty"" which is a factor in global ranking systems... (very smart of them)
2. ""Overseas experience""  
Some people prefer the environment overseas. Whether it is the weather, or sometimes, just wanting that sense of adventure. Perfectly valid reason. 
3. A freer environment  
This may be important to those studying the more \*controversial\* topics (I'm thinking of the social sciences and political sciences here). Also an important factor for persons who feel Singapore is too repressive on the social aspect (gender and sexual minorities, etc.)

**Cons:**

1. Cost (it's all about the money, money)  
Not just the school fees, but the living expenses there are higher than in Singapore. Unless your parents are rich, or you get a scholarship, or you are lucky enough to get some form of sponsorship from your university (still requires your parents to be fairly rich though), studying overseas is not an option for most. And about scholarships...
2. Being bonded to a scholarship  
I have no problem with being bonded. In fact, its a guaranteed job after graduation! A great perk especially in uncertain economic times. But do I know what company or field specialization I want to go into? Not really, at this point. So being bonded may mean me working 4-5 years in a field I do not enjoy, wasting time that could be spent gaining experience in a field I prefer to work in.
3. New environment  
This may be exciting to some, but horrifyingly daunting to others. If you don't feel comfortable going overseas, then don't. Wait till you are emotionally ready to face that challenge.

&amp;#x200B;

**Studying in NUS/NTU:**

**Pros:**

1. Rising reputation of local universities  
It seems like its always good news with regards to our academic standing -- rising rankings, new R&amp;D breakthroughs, etc. And our universities are attracting talents from all around the world, and if you think you can get into a top university overseas -- you are a talent who can be added to our local universities, and contribute to the academic scene here. You literally add value to your degree.
2. Much lower cost  
You will start work with much less debt than your friends who studied overseas. That puts you on a much better economic footing starting out to work -- helping you score that dream apartment or car potentially earlier than your compatriots.
3. More relevant industry experience  
Assuming that you want to work in Singapore in the future, the connections you form in the local universities will be more relevant to you. Companies with regional or even global HQs in Singapore. Local employers. Internships in Singapore offices, where you get to know people who work in your field in Singapore.

**Cons:**

1. More stressful studying environment (?)  
Can't confirm this. Heard that scoring well in Singapore universities is much harder than in overseas universities - and greater peer pressure and a more competitive academic environment. And the bell curve god (or demon?). But also heard from some seniors that NUS is quite chill. Tbh, idk.

This is just my personal view. Don't downvote if you disagree -- comment and share your views! I am sure many people are also having the same thoughts in their head.

As said in the title, I'm a comp sci major going to the cybersecurity track and I want to know what type of side projects or things I should learn independently to help me secure an internship. 

My future set goal right now is to graduate college with a bachelor's and start working for certificates so I can secure a future job in the penetration testing field. Although that's the idea, the inevitable future may think otherwise. 

Things to know about me (Please feel free to criticize my life choices). I'm the type of student who hates any electives or any topic that doesn't directly correlate to computer science. Basically, anything not math or compsci is an L. As result, my grades suffer from English classes, science classes, and history classes. I don't fail my classes, I just live with the mindset of ""C's get degrees"" but I do try to get an A or B on Comp Sci/math. My cumulative GPA is also below 3.0. I'm basically anxiously stressed and live life on the edge every single day thinking about the harsh reality of my downward spiraling future.

So what are some ideas for side projects? What should I teach myself? Any tips on life? 

Tldr: scared of future and don't know what the f\*ck I'm doing"

obi1n4,0,2021-07-01,(Maryland) Police found drugs that weren’t mine. Under suspicion it could have been planted.,GunzBlazein180,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/obi1n4/maryland_police_found_drugs_that_werent_mine/,"What happened: 
I recently was pulled over for making an illegal lane change. Which I fully admit guilt to. I should add the car is not even mine, it’s my brother’s. More likely than not 80% of the stuff in there belonged to him. Anyways I was fully cooperative with the officers, and even asked if they would like to search the car. The officer asked me if there were any guns or weed in the car. Definitely no guns, but I told the officer “there are some ashes that I know of,” and that there “might be some weed somewhere in the car(pothead brother) but I’m not sure”. I didn’t even bother trying to hide anything and even offered to let him search my car. At this point my only concern was not having my license. Which I was in the process of getting renewed, but after Juneteenth became a holiday, my Friday appointment got cancelled and I had to reschedule for mid July! I know the car probably has some weed it always smells like it. I wasn’t too concerned probably some residue, cop didn’t seem to care either. Besides, I knew the worst thing my brother would leave is a pocket knife or something, definitely no guns or anything of that nature. I just expected the cop to find some marijuana residue, maybe even a gram or two, and write me up hundreds of dollars in tickets. But that’s not at all what happened. 

The drugs, and possible explinations:
After searching for a few moments, he came back to me to ask me again “so your sure there’s nothing in there I should be concerned about,”. His tone said “I caught you now you liar,”. I mean at this point I knew he found something, I just didn’t know what it was. So when he asked me to explain why I had mystery object im the car, I didn’t know what to tell him. He didn’t tell me what it was, but still wants me to come clean and confess. I genuinely didn’t know what he found, it could be anything. All I’m thinking is “fuck, this doesn’t look good maybe my brother left something bad”. Any interrogation attempt he made instantly failed because I knew just as much as he did, actually probably less because I still didn’t know what he found. I just begin thinking hard and start guessing “was it a knife… maybe you mixed up a screw driver by accident? …. Is it perhaps my brothers work tools,”. It was none of that, it was something I didn’t expect, he showed me some pills. My first assumption at this point was that my idiot brother left them. But my brother does not take pills, the only thing he’s ever done was weed and alcohol. I called after the stop, but he denied it and told me not to get him involved. I felt sick to my stomach, I know my brother isn’t popping pills, and if he were he’s have no reason not to tell me. I couldn’t think of anyone else they belonged too except this one friend I had who has a prescription for similar looking drugs, I hadn’t seen him in some time but he’s definitely been in this car the past month(which is how long my car has been in the shop), so I decided to call him right away and ask about it. He told me there’s a chance they can be his, if they were adderalls he is prescribed those and could’ve easily misplaced them and asked me to describe how they looked. I told him they were in orange and blue capsules. He said he only has a script for adderalls which look like capsules clear on one side and orange on the other. I did a quick google search on adderalls to see if they matched, without a doubt the same exact pill. He told me he’s willing to give the cop a report and everything. The only remaining issue is the blue and white pills that were found. Those are not his. And I don’t know what they are, I tried googling blue and white capsule pills, they could be anything. And frankly this is the scariest part for me because I don’t know how illegal they are and what the penalty is for getting caught with them.  

Besides my brother lying about them not being his, how else could they have gotten their. I don’t do pills, neither do most of my friends. My brother might be a pothead but he’s definitely not a pill popper. In fact I’ll even say he is anti-non-weed-drugs. How else could they have gotten there? I seriously think the cops could have planted it. Something was just weird, I’ve been pulled over/stopped many times by police but this time felt different. They were nice and understanding, perhaps too nice and understanding. From experience, every time I’ve been pulled over/stopped by police they try to give me the chair(Obviously an exaggeration). It’s just weird the one time I get caught doing something illegal they are understanding. I mean the cop didn’t even write me a ticket for the expired plates(I told him I only was using my brothers car because my car is in the shop, and that I didn’t even know the plates expired. Nor did he write me up for not having my license, or for having an expired one. These are all things I 100% expected a ticket for,  honestly I never had I had an instance where the officer didn’t write the maximum amount of tickets. But nope they gave me warnings for that, and told me not to worry. But I am getting charged for possession(don’t know exact charges), so obviously I am worried. I’m not trying to be a conspiracist, but I’m starting to believe it was planted. 

As silly as it may sound let’s just think logically. If I were to get pulled over and had illegal pills with me, all I have to do is hide them next to my testicles inside my underwear. I have all the time in the world, the cop gives me a minute before approaching the car. I even get another chance when he walks back with my ID(passport and pic of drivers license). The pills were so small I could have easily hid them. To add even more to the suspicion, the cop that had pulled me over told me his body cam was on, only at the end. Not when he first approached me. And coincidentally he wasn’t the cop that searched and found the drugs either. I don’t know if that cop had his body cam on or not. 

Bottom line, I don’t know who’s they are. I’ve texted every friend who’s been in my car if they left any pills by accident. I made sure not to mention the cops found it, hopefully someone will fess up. Anyways what do you guys recommend I do? This is really concerning because I am a junior in college, and with a drug charge I can have a hard time finding a job or internship. I have only have $1200 in rainy day funds, I don’t know if I should use it for a lawyer. If I get a public defendant I probably can work with that. I feel like there’s no evidence against me. The cop said “all I have to do is take a drug safety program and it will get cleared”. Yea right, like I’m supposed to believe that. I need to know every way possible I can fight this.

Edit: An idea of the best/worst case scenario will be very helpful"

I'm debating taking a second job along side my other 9-5 and would like to hear if its being done by others.  The side gig would be along the lines of about 10 hours a week and about %70 less in $/hr at a chem/bioinformatics startup.  I did an internship with this company during my masters and really like the folks who work there.  I'm a recent MS Bioinformatics graduate employed full time at a large company scripting dashboards and buying software for the R&amp;D department.  No real qualms with the 9-5 outside of it being bad for my chances of getting another legit data science or bioinformatics job elsewhere.

Benefits of side gig:  
More interesting work (by a lot as it will be mostly novel research)  
Money (9-5 salary + side gig)  
Network (rubbing shoulders with some folks who are a big deal in the chem/bioinformatics field)  
Boost to CV

Downsides:  
Effect other employment (I work from home and would keep meticulous track of hours)  
Time away from family and other hobbies (This is really one of the big ones as I'd be basically signing up for 50+ hour weeks)

I only hope to do this for at most 1 year and then either have made a place to go full time at the startup or have built my CV enough to work somewhere else."

It's definitely tempting to have that flexibility in choosing where to live and not having to commute but from my internships, I do find I learn a lot more from being in person.

Is starting off as a remote full time at a remote-first company detrimental to career progression? How important is a company being remote vs being important as a factor in choosing where to kick off my career?

Fast forward to today I am in my last year( second last semester) and I have nothing to put on the resume for the campus placements.

What should I write on my resume so at least I have a fuckin resume. I don't have anything to write on it. The last thing that I can think of is that I was the sports captain of my high school.

&amp;#x200B;

Had no past experience other than sports but I think that its irrelevant for my field. I have no work experience but I recently did a online internship but its not from a popular company that everyone knows (I heard the name of the company for the first time when I saw the post for that internship)

Basically I feel like I am a fuckin loser."
obnrp7,3,2021-07-01,"Sh!t Is hitting the fan...I need some brakes on this d@mn bicycle !! Oh and I might be homeless soon, long rant.",feelingtoomuchpain,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/obnrp7/sht_is_hitting_the_fani_need_some_brakes_on_this/,"So two months ago...I got diagnosed with ADD. Ever since I told my mom this and had kept her updated it began to be a headache. For one...she thinks that Im not utilizing my meds properly because Im not physically doing anything. Shes not mobile as much now and my sister just moved back home and we currently live with our grandma.

My sister has the tendency to sort of push the envelope while Im already skating on ice. Shes the feather on the camel. The weight that makes the ice break when it was already melting (me).  Like if I slack back on something and she comes around (moves in) doing the exact same thing...my mom will start having a tremendous issue with it. I suspect my sister has a form of ADHD because our symptoms are alike but manifest in diff ways. We both have pets...but we aren't able to attach to them. The only problem is that mine sort of tore up some things in the house that Id have to repair before I move (nothing major though but he did tear up a bit of rug). My mom and I have been taking care of my sisters dog. Like yesterday it was raining and thundering. My sister had him near a tree...the dog isnt well trained so he has the tendency to jump on people...hes a big dog.  Any who...because my sistet hasnt been here in two days, which is normal, usually she can be gone for a whole week, I go and get him myself. 

This pushed my mom to...sort of want us to give our pets away. Which I get.

The other problem that I mentioned before...about her always wanted to see physical action is what annoys me. She always needs to see things moving around her. Like progress or what not. Whenever Im not doing something she wants...she gets fussy. I made this summer about getting my mental health in check because I want to get better internships and fucking graduate next year which is another expectation that my sister didnt complete and now I have to do it to satisfy my mom.  I expressed that its hard to multitask her issues and fill the seats that no one else is doing (going to the store for groceries, washing clothes, cleaning, etc etc). Which I do wash clothes and whenever I did go grocery shopping, I was told that I should save my money and whatever angelic act they wanted to put on. I dont understand telling me to stop doing something and then on down the line...you want me to do it.  Including with taking care of her. Since I was a kid my mom has had issues with her body. I would immediately become her nurse because my sister was elsewhere on her own accord and I had to step in. In my younger ages responsibility was always stressed. Routines were always stressed. At 7 and on up my family had this strict thing with me washing dishes on sat and sun. If I didnt do them then I was a ""lazy heifer"" for having the audacity to want to watch cartoons. I should feel the need to contribute and show my usefulness as a damn kid. It was always what I needed to do to help out. I think the fact that I developed early and was taller than most children that it gave her the appeal that I was older...but I wasnt. I was tall but had the mentality of a child who wanted to watch toons. 

Over the years...my mom and sister put me through a lot of shit with their choices(letting shitty men live with them and I would come home to domestic violence, which caused us to go broke and change our routine of living). I couldnt move away. The expectation to keep my head high and show ability to multitask, and hold my composure was always stressed. I had to be dynamic and be okay with facing adversary that wasnt my own. This is all important because I feel that now im older ...Im slightly rebelling with my condition that I didnt even know it. 

My mom knew I had a pattern for not keeping a routine up for no longer than 2 weeks (I never fucking knew this until two days ago!)  since I was young and never thought it was suspect at all until I mentioned having ADD. Yet she expects a snap back...so I can be useful to the family. It would be easier to handle my mental issues and be the back for the family...but it isnt. I keep telling her its a process. Give me a moment. I had a years worth of habits to break through and the older I get, the expectation to pick up slack has gotten immense since Ive gotten older. 

I am good at spontaneous acts of contribution  when the pressure isnt expected. Like ive always gone grocery shopping and replenishing other household items and etc on a whim. Not when people were breathing down my neck expecting it. I dont know why I have a visceral reaction to pushback against expectations .  They see it as an act of being inconsiderate and being spiteful or showing disrespectful disinterest when I dont do a gesture or dont do something someone in the house has to do. I keep explaining to them that I dont disagree with them...but to bare with me for the meantime. Yet no...its bad and I need to change my attitude. Like yes I know it is what you need. I know that. When I complain about others in the household...they rarely accomodate me either. Instead theyll take my genuine condition and try to get pay back by saying and doing anything that they feel is bullshit. Its along the list of making fun of my suicide or making jokes about my fits of wanting to die. Ive never made fun of anyone elses pain.  

My mom tried to get me help on and off over the years but the problem I have with her is that its never about ME. The counseling and the reason she wanted me to get better was to make her life better. So I could become more productive for her as a teenager. It wasnt because I had personal goals of my own. Even during arguments one of the reasons was because she got ""sick of you having that look on your face"". Now that Ive found the culprit...its not good enough because im not giving her enough action. Anything I do good recently...she attributes to the meds...even though I am waiting on a refill. Ive been doing these exact same things before the medication. 


During my depressive state, she told me that I appeared lazy. Instead of sad or just wanting to be alone. Everything is about physical action with her or moving around. I feel like she tries to do so much on the outside of her body that she isn't quite...balanced in the mind. And Im too focused on the inside that its hard to do whats needed on the outside for it to count. My mom and I are not and have never been in sync to live as one in a household. When shes up,  im down and when Im down, she is up. This constant teetering.

Truth is...I hate living here. I never wanted to move here. We moved here when I was 16 and now Im 22 (in college). Whenever I got the energy to wonder about moving away, distractions happened. 

Now the family is apparently sick of me. My grandmother has always used my lack of organization as a crutch to put immense pressure on me. As a kid she never liked me much either and would push her aggressiveness out on me. This is where the whole 7 year old being a heifer bit came from. Their problems with me had always been about chores. And keeping routine. My grandmother had always voiced how she ""didnt give a shit if I moved"" and that she would ""be glad"". Even though I never told her my plans to move in the past...my mom did and decided to laugh about the reaction and to tell me for some reason.

Two weeks ago my mom mentioned me moving into student apartments and I voiced how I wanted a more traditional apartment and of course she didnt think my idea was good and thought her idea was better because she ""knew me"". Yet she doesnt. She misses certain marks all the time. 

I want to help. I really do...but on the other end...I do need to just save for the meantime and leave. Im tired. I dont like any of them. I dont hate them...aside from my grandma because she kept up a lot of shit between me and my mom over the years and loved to watch us argue. 

Now my mom is planning to leave for another state... The state I originally planned to move to if I should add.  I dont plan on staying here but I wanted to move away as well. I was going to move with her and stay with her for a couple months until I saved up enough and move.. But living with her for most of my life, I can attest that we are two different people. We cannot live in the same place. I admit my organization issues have been a constant problem over the years but I need time to put me first and sort of act in my own pace and not because others are counting on me.  Living on my own with my own responsibilities to keep it together is best. 

I never had time to breathe and stop. I had to always keep things together internally, get my shit together so it wouldnt add stress to the family or pretend to.  In middle school I started noticing this. When my add started to grow... I had my mom agree to tutoring. When the tutoring didnt help and when my studying habits were terrible, she'd whoop me. Her frustration was that she couldn't work and keep the house in order and make sure I was doing my part in school. It was more of a way to get me back in line so she wouldnt have to stress. When Id tell her my issues...she would shrug it off and call it lazy. Just this big ass head, like she knew every fucking thing. You can't really talk to her. Its more like you talk and she listens but when you hear her interpretation of what you said, its like wtf did you hear me say! 

I guess I have gotten tired of playing whack a mole and trying to jumble my things and others needing me there. Which Im always here. I couldnt always get up and leave. 

I know I sound inconsiderate.. I know I sound like a jerk and irresponsible. I am however just voicing what my weaknesses are and what I cant handle at the moment."

I got my undergraduate degree in biomedical engineering in 2014 and started a master's degree that I never completed because my mental health really took a turn for the worse. My parents convinced me to switch to computer science since I had some coding knowledge and they wanted me to get back on my feet so I did a master's degree in CS and have gotten some good jobs and accumulated a lot of computing knowledge. 

However, even though I objectively have a good job now I really miss working on engineering problems and I feel like I made a mistake switching careers at such a tumultuous time in my life. I never really had a passion for coding like I did for engineering, it was just something that I could do and was guaranteed to make good money. I still remember pretty much everything from my undergraduate education, and I feel like even if I start over from an entry level position in some medical device company that would be preferable to where I am now. The problem is, my only relevant work experience is one internship from 2015 and I am not sure how to make myself an attractive candidate to engineering companies today. I am willing to put in work, I am just not sure where to start.

Any advice would be appreciated, and please feel free to be as brutally honest as you need to be."

some background: from JC arts stream, did a marketing internship for the past five months but i’ve also been doing competitive sports since young (and currently also part-time coaching) so interest for both is pretty much the same. i’m legit fine with doing either!

ntu pros:
- school reputation/ranking
- better school/social life
- they have my sport as a cca (only ntu and nus have it)
- have a sibling in the same course (so they can help me if need be i guess)

ntu cons:
- specialised field - not really sure what to do with this degree (i suppose i could go into teaching pe/coaching or sports management but it sounds like i’m grasping at straws)


suss pros:
- marketing is a really useful degree to have, can be applied pretty much anywhere

suss cons:
- not as high ranking/reputable
- really pathetic student life (also have a sibling in this school who has almost no friends and has probably only been to the campus twice in the past year)
- feel like i’ll be miserable &amp; fomo because i was looking forward to meeting new people and having the whole uni experience


all in all, i’m not really sure whether i’ll enjoy/do well in each course because they’re both kinda foreign to me tbh. i’m just scared because each course could lead me down drastically different paths. would appreciate any opinions/advice 🙏"
obonxq,2,2021-07-01,"About to graduate college, torn between two career paths. What should I do?",hdiayw55,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/obonxq/about_to_graduate_college_torn_between_two_career/,"This is going to be very long, for anyone willing to take the time to read and give advice and your opinion, you mean the world to me. 


If you don’t want to read it all, skip the the bottom pros-cons list for the short version 



Like the title states, I’m graduating college in 2 semesters (one year). I grew up in Illinois and moved to Indiana for school to get a Purdue Mechanical Engineering Technology degree. I have always been interested in cars and specifically engines (they don’t have to be just cars). Without trying to brag about myself, I consider myself to be a very intelligent and creative thinker. I’m great at problem solving, building, innovating, and modifying. The ideal engineer. My own personal car is built, turbocharged, and tuned off my laptop all by myself, completely self taught. I also had to build/machine a small steam engine for a college class. Not only did my engine preform well, but shattered every previous record at the school making it the highest revving wobbler engine ever made (for this class). All that sounds great, but this is where my dilemma comes into play. 

This summer I got offered an internship back in Illinois to work along side of other Mechanical Engineers at a company that makes and sells medical respiratory devices. One of the 3 CEOs is a very close family friend that I’ve known my whole life. He went out searching for me. I was hesitant at first because my passion has always been cars, but after long talks with my girlfriend, I decided to take it and see what comes of it. I came to the conclusion that maybe if I like this job and it pays well, I can make cars my hobby outside of work. 

Long story short, I absolutely killed it here at this internship. I completed the entire 8 week program in about 2.5 weeks which “wowed” everyone here. From that 2.5 week mark to current, they have just been giving me “real” engineering work which I have been excelling greatly at. I have done a tremendous amount of work and a very short amount of time for this company. The CEO, Engineers, and myself are very proud of the accomplishments I’ve done in this short amount of time. I had a sit down meeting with the CEO a few or two ago and was told I will 100% be getting an offer to come work here in 2 weeks when the internship ends. After talking with some Engineers, I was told to expect somewhere in the ballpark of $70,000 starting salary. This is where the dilemma starts. 

To sum this internship up, even though I’ve had great accomplishments, I don’t love working here. I don’t care whatsoever about medical devices. Not only that but my biggest complaint is the company itself. It’s a small company that started out 9 years ago and rapidly grew into a $65 million dollar company. That greatly appeals to me seeing that there are only 2 other engineers here, I could be in the top 3 engineers as the company grows and expands which is huge. My issue is because the company is so small, the engineers are swamped with work. 15 different projects at the same time isn’t an exaggeration. I’ve also been told the CEO that I know also has crazy unrealistic deadlines for projects. Projects that should take 3 years (with proper inspection and FDA testing) are told they must be ready for consumer sale in less than 12 months time. That’s insane and near impossible, easily the biggest complaint of the engineers here. I thought maybe the engineers were exaggerating at first, but I’ve seen for myself first hand these crazy unrealistic deadlines. All the engineers tell me to use this job as a backup and go look elsewhere so I don’t “hate my life” everyday. 

This company has pros and several cons that I will weight over at the bottom paragraph. 


Now for my other option-look for jobs in Indiana. Indiana has a significantly lower cost of living than Illinois does. So much so that in my certain situation with loans, buying my first house, etc, I’ll be able to get just as far in Indiana with a $52,000 salary as I would in Illinois with a $70,000 salary. You might think I’m crazy for these numbers but I’ll explain late. Trust me for now. The issue with Indiana is I don’t have a “Guaranteed” job like I do in Illinois. I very well could graduate and end up working at McDonald’s. While I’m exaggerating, you never know and the unknown scares me. 

Some addition info I did not mention earlier. I currently have an apartment with my girlfriend of 3 years. We have had some long and mature talks and decided that wherever my job takes me, we will move there together and buy a house. (She doesn’t know this but I plan on getting engaged before that happens). She is going to be a teacher and decided that she can be a teacher anywhere, but it’s hard to be an engineer with a good company anywhere. The kicker is she’s on a full ride scholarship. That scholarship says she has to teach in Indiana for 5 years after graduation. If the breaks that contract and moves out of state, we will need to pay back $24,000 that she received for a scholarship. I’m already going to be graduating with $30,000 in student loan debt. So by taking the Illinois job, sure it’s $70,000 starting salary, but now we have to pay and additional $24,000 back in loans. Also the cost of living is significantly more in Illinois, which is why after using serval online tools and calculators, we decided me getting $52,000 salary will get us just as far in Indiana with the lower cost of living and not having $24,000 in loans. 

The next thing I didn’t mention is I am currently at school for Mechanical Engineering Technology (MET). I went into the major and degree thinking there was no difference between it and regular Mechanical Engineering (ME). Turns out there is and MET (my major) gets paid less than a regular (ME). Well I want to be an (ME) not just for the pay, but I like the work better too. It’s too late to switch my major at school as it would set me back 2 years at least. The nice thing about the Illinois job and I would have the ME title. This means all future jobs I will have an ME title and my physical degree doesn’t even matter that it says MET. If I went with Indiana on the other hand, I have no idea if I would be an ME or MET. I could always progress, I would hate starting at the bottom of the barrel. 

Now it comes down to pros and cons of both. 

First up: Job in Illinois.

Pros: 

Guaranteed offer, rapidly growing company, first of 3 Engineers, $70,000 starting salary, start off with an ME title. 

Cons:

I don’t love the work, crazy unrealistic deadlines (this worries me the most and is a big complaint), cost of living in Illinois is insane, the company skips critical testing and quality checks to rush products out, most likely an hour commute (houses near company are expensive or very old), expected to work on 10-15 projects at once, have to pay back $24,000 in scholarship money if we move to Illinois. 


Second: Job in Indiana. 

Pros:

Very cheap cost of living, do not have to pay back scholarship money, girlfriend has an opportunity to teach at her “dream” school in Indiana. 

Cons:

Nothing is guaranteed. I do not have any connections or jobs lined up at the moment. While there’s still a year before a graduate, the unknown is very scary. 

Neutral (could be a pro or con):

A job in Indiana could also have crazy unrealistic deadlines or it could be my dream job. We have no clue at this point. 




It really comes down to do I take a job in Illinois where the cost of living is crazy high, take on an additional $24k in debt and am unhappy at my job but make $70,000 starting with an ME title? 

Or do I decline the Illinois offer and try to find a job in Indiana where cost of living Is very affordable, no additional debt but I don’t have connections or a job lined up? 



If you have read this far, thank you so much. You already mean more than you know to me. I’m afraid of making the wrong choice and I just want to have a good future for myself and my gf. I don’t have anyone in life to give me adult advice, so I’m turning to Reddit for help. Part of me thinks I suck it up and take the job in Illinois and be unhappy all the time but make good money. The other part of me knows money doesn’t buy happiness and I shouldn’t take it because I don’t want to come home in a bad mood every day. Please please please let me know your opinions. Thank you so much."

For some background info/context that you might find interesting:

I'm a Neuroscience Major and I attend a well reputed public state university in the U.S. I took a Java course in college the beginning of my sophomore year and really liked it so I decided to self study and picked up decent python and java skills over the course of my sophomore year. I managed to somehow land an internship my sophomore to junior year summer which I learned a lot at. My Junior year I did literally nothing software or programming related at all, and my skills got rather rusty. I started applying to software jobs/internship towards the end of my Junior year and managed to somehow end up getting another software engineering internship where I'm learning so much and have been doing better than some of the junior devs here according to my manager. I got to work on things like Spring boot applications and data migration between two physical servers in Oracle (which I hear is usually reserved for more experienced devs). I have 0 projects on Github and I've never practiced leetcode a day in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

Now just recently I signed an full time offer at a decently big company (30,000\~ employees) as an SDET. My compensation package is 78k base salary, 6% bonus dependent on performance, 10 days PTO, unlimited sick leave, 3% match on 401k, and a solid Health, Life, Dental, Vision, A&amp;D insurance plan mostly covered by my company(I pay tiny 60$ a month for insurance via them).

I will be working with them full-time as I finish my last semester in college where I'm only taking 7 credit hrs (I'm graduating in 7 semesters instead of the usual 8 since I took classes every summer to get ahead)

So my role is an SDET, the only issue is that I have never in my life done any sort of testing. I've never used Junit, Selenium and many of the other technologies that I will need to use in my new job according to my hiring manager. I'm feeling major imposter syndrome already and I'm nervous about not being good enough for the role they're taking me in for. But at the same time this is a extremely rare opportunity that I simply cannot let go of, plus I know the hiring manager took a massive risk in hiring me because I'm a big question mark right now and I don't even have my degree yet.

My start date is late July and I feel like I need to learn so much before then to appear even slightly competent, plus I'll need to figure out work/school/life balance.  Any advice on literally anything relating to the industry or how I can get better would be very much appreciated. Especially if you've been in my situation where you've been taken into a role you feel unqualified for while in school. Thanks!"
obrnn1,10,2021-07-01,Same Projected Coordinate System and same Geographic Coordinate System but layers are not lining up?,kellassidy,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/obrnn1/same_projected_coordinate_system_and_same/,"So our GIS technician left our office and his replacement has yet to be hired on. As the resident planning intern I volunteered myself in the interim thinking that my crash course in ArcGIS a year ago meant a simple map for a brochure would be no sweat. Unfortunately,  I only have access to about a quarter of the files that made it onto our shared drive. Of the files I do have access to, I'm not supposed to alter them whatsoever so that the new tech can start right where \[ex-tech\] left off. I thought ""Ok, that seems easy enough, I'll just make a new folder and just make use of the files that were uploaded from \[ex-tech\]'s folder.

Cue my dilemma. I add the Florida base layer and the Lake &amp; River layers. I get the different coordination warning message and close out of it, wanting to take a look at everything first since so far everything I've edited has been set to the same coordination system. I notice the lakes &amp; rivers extend a bit beyond the state outline and decide to adjust the coordination systems. Ok, no problem. Updating the coordination system is easy enough.

To save myself a Google search on how to do it, I remove the River/Lake layers and add them back in, and then try to transform the coordinate system from the error message. I pick the wrong system and after trial and error with the define projection and project tools I finally get everything on the same page, but the Lakes layer is missing.. I decide to start over again and remove the River/Lake layers and to my horror I've altered the coordinate system of the very file I was warned explicitly not to make changes to. I panic and try to put everything back based on memory. I fix the Lakes layer, but the River layer will not go back to the way it was.

Learning from my mistakes, I export everything into a new geodatabase so that I can play around with things without messing up the river shapefile even more. But now I'm at a complete loss. I don't understand why this isn't lining up the way it was before. I've changed both the geographic coordinate system and projected coordinate system using the define projection/project tools and set the data frame coordinate system. I'm pretty sure both the river and lake shapefiles were originally in GCS\_North\_American\_1983. Currently, all of my layers have a projected coordinate system of NAD\_1983\_StatePlane\_Florida\_North\_FIPS\_0903\_Feet and the geographic coordinate system of GCS\_North\_American\_1983.

My boss does have all of \[ex-tech\]'s files saved on an external hard drive, so it's not like this shape file is lost forever... But as a teacher's pet I dread his disappointment (and he's also on vacation until next week, so I can't ask for it until then anyway). If someone could point me in the right direction to get the river shapefile back to normal I would be so so so thankful!

I’m currently 3 days past a deadline, even though I’ve pulled like 2 all nighter this week to work. The other couple interns are way smarter than me, and I’m feeling really discouraged.

obug69,1,2021-07-01,Move across the country to take a job I don't know I'll like???,yahoo696969,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/obug69/move_across_the_country_to_take_a_job_i_dont_know/,"Hey folks, looking for some advice / insight

I Just graduated from a 4 year with a degree in automotive engineering technology. I've been working as a contractor for a company right near where I grew up/went to school. It's basically doing line maintenance at a medical device company. Which has been a great job for the past couple months as it's been nice to save up some money, pay down those student loans and just chill out after a pretty intense 3.5 years of school. It's really not a bad job, but it's ultimately (even if I got hired on (which looks plausible if I wanted to) it's not really what I'm super interested in doing. And the career path forward at this particular company doesn't look particularly good. So I just don't see a lot of reasons to stick around in a potentially dead end job I don't really care for. Basically in the the shortish term, I've got a job I don't mind doing that pays pretty well, but is probably not something I want to make a career out of.

With that being said, recently a automotive company I had 2 previous internships (that I really enjoyed) with reached out and offered me a interview for a sr. Test technician position that's located all the way across the country. I figured I should at least hear them out and gain some interview experience... Low and behold I've got a offer for it.

It's worth noting I've done a similar type role doing test technician type work on engines during a previous internship (at a different company) and I while I found the work interesting I'm still not sure its something I really want to make a career out of. But I also don't really know exactly what kind of role I do want to make a career out of.

 Regardless, while I'm pretty sure I won't hate the job, I'm also not getting a feeling that makes me really want to move cross country to a city where I know literally nobody. So, would it be best to just stick it out where I'm at, and keep my options open for something I feel more confident about. Or just jump in and go for it?

 I'm kinda leaning towards the latter, but I'm still just kinda hesitant to leave my family and friends to do so.

Any thoughts or advice is appreciated

Thank you!"
obuhy0,1,2021-07-01,Should I get Leetcode Premium or something else?,prabhjot24,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/obuhy0/should_i_get_leetcode_premium_or_something_else/,"Hello,

I feel like this question or something about leetcode is asked a lot in this subreddit but I wanted some advice pertaining to my scenario. 

I am currently a college student about to enter my second year. I decided middle of freshman year to switch majors to CS as I enjoy it a lot more than biology. I am not very good at coding currently and do not know much about data structures and algorithms. I want to be able to spend this summer learning CS in order to create some side projects and land an internship next summer. 

This is why I want to know if leetcode would be a valid option in order to learn. I know many people say that leetcode premium is not worth it since there are free questions, but I want to get premium because I learn a lot by going through solutions and seeing how the code works. Also since I am possibly using leetcode premium for summer or so I am planning on getting a year for $160. As I said earlier, many people do not like leetcode or some may possibly say that premium is not worth it for me since I am new which is why I hope if anyone has any suggestions to other websites, free or paid, then it would be much appreciated. 

Thank you for your time!"

My understanding is that internships are not that common as well as entry level roles. Is this true?

I am decent with Linux and can code well in Python. 

My plan was to take the acloudguru learning path for devops and then some udemy courses on docker and kubernetes followed by getting the SAA.

Would this be a good route for me to take? Or should I try to get a role in backend or something and transition over to cloud/devops later?

obweoz,1,2021-07-01,Lost,oceansofglovers,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/obweoz/lost/,"I'm going to be a senior next year and I luckily have an internship this summer. Problem is that I am terrible. I do not know what I am doing half the time and can be stuck on a very small set-up problem (not even coding) for a day or two. The company is not small but it is definitely not big, so there is not someone I can reliably call on for help so I try my best. Also, I don't mean to sound ungrateful but I have no idea how people sit in front of their computer peering at code and through pointless meetings for years on end.

I'm not good at coding and I don't necessarily like CS either. I do however like technology and want my career to be somewhere on that spectrum of critical thinking.  (Yes I am aware that if i did not like CS I should have done something about it sooner, but I was having mixed feelings for a while and well... I'm here now.)  I have wanted to find a way to venture into tech management, but I have been met with either "" you need years of experience to start"" or just straight up looked down upon for taking an ""easy"" path.

At this point I know I am going to finish my degree, beyond that... no idea.

Hopefully I am not alone. I am just ranting/open to suggestions. Do I tough it out and try to get a good job? Do I take a break and find out what I actually want to do? Is there a job for someone like me out there? If  I am being shameless, I just want to be paid well. I want to give myself and my family a comfortable and good life. I saw CS as a way to do that but that path is looking bleaker now.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: CS major who struggles very hard at basic internship things, not a big CS fan, but likes technology. Needs help finding out what to do with their life and is very lost."

obycdd,32,2021-07-01,"Advice/Rant: Hired as an Engineer, chucked into IT",ThrowRA555-555-5555,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/obycdd/advicerant_hired_as_an_engineer_chucked_into_it/,"I'm a recent Electrical Graduate and I accepted a job offer as an Engineer I (nothing more descriptive than that) about a year ago at a high-tech/bleeding edge company. I don't want to say the real name of the company so imagine them as SpaceX since I view their work as similarly bleeding edge and will use analogies as such. 


The job description didn't say what specifically we were going to do and the hiring team said that we would find out when we got there (a year after accepting it), so none of us knew what we were doing. Some of us talked and we were all getting the same salary so nothing seemed out of the ordinary. I was supposed to have an internship with them last summer but due to COVID it got cancelled last minute, so I really had no idea what department I was going into. After a week into the onboarding process of our group where they told us about the different ENGINEERING departments we were going into (any of which I would have been anywhere from stoked to okay to be in) they told us our departments. Out of about 20 new hires in my group (all of which were also recent grads and most of which were also going to be in the prior internship that got cancelled) all of them got into actual engineering departments  and roles relating to the company's purpose and only me and another guy (who was very vocal about wanting to go into IT and was well qualified) got IT roles. 


I felt like I got punched in the gut. To rub salt in the wound, they made a fun game out of the ""department reveal"" that was reminiscent of the bachelor. It would have been fun if you got into a department relating to your degree and what you thought you were signing up for, but not so much for me. I've never been fired before, but I'm pretty sure it felt a little like this when I saw my role as clearly IT and nothing to do with what I've worked so hard the past 4 years for. I tried my best to keep a straight face and pretend that I wasn't completely decimated since I immediately had to sit down and talk with my new supervisor, who revealed to me my role/department.


I fell in love with the company after a career fair and company info session with them my freshman year of college and wanted to work there since. The work they said they did at the info session sounded awesome and I immediatly knew that I wanted to do that. I was already in the closest degree path I could be and took 2 elective courses (as many as I my schedule would allow) relating to the field to train myself up as best as I could. I never wanted to do IT or pure software and instead was dead set on going into that specific field. Some of the other new hires had degrees not immediately relating to the field but still very important to have on the engineering teams, so the thought never occured to me that I was not going to get an actual engineering role/department. They say that they allow you to request to switch departments after 6 months, but to use the SpaceX analogy, what engine testing manager or life support department head would want to bother with an IT person requesting to switch to their department? I feel like my career path has been taken away from me and forcibly changed against my will and that my resume and experience are slowly rotting away. I know C++ and assembly, but they want me to learn Python and Unix which I never bothered with before. I'd like to think IT got first pick since I took relevant classes to the industry, but its hard to be that hopefull.


I feel angry about being tricked into taking a role that I worked so hard to steer away from. I feel embarassed for excitedly telling all my friends and family (especially my grandpa, who inspired me to go into engineering) what cool high tech things I thought I was going to work on (things so high tech that they are basically classified as government secrets), when instead all I'm doing is requesting computer servers from Dell and making a scanner talk to a database for my first project. I feel stupid for accepting a job offer without knowing exactly what I was going to be doing. I feel betrayed by a company I was excited to work for for nearly 4 years. I feel like I'm not good enough for not getting an engineering role like everyone else despite all my hard work and relevant classes. I feel trapped because I signed an 18 month lease on an apartment, owe my parents money for new furniture, need to get a new car fairly soon, and can't switch departments for 6 months (if the other departments will even want me after that). I'm worried that I'm stuck on this career path since I have no other experiences on my resume than a semester long research with a professor and the claim that I was going to have an internship at a kickass company. Plus seeing that I worked at a company for a week must be a career ender in a background check, so I'm stuck at the company for at least a year.


What should I do? Have any of you been in a similar situation? Should I let my supervisor know now that I don't want to be in IT (and hope he doesn't hold it against me for 6 months)? I'm going to try to take technical training given by the company so I won't be so far behind and I won't have lost too much of the knowledge of my classes in the field, so I'm not sure how well I can keep that secret. I also don't know how long I can keep up the facade that I don't find the work miserable. I can have fun programming an arduino to turn a motor or control some hardware feedback, but running a database thats pure software seems unbearably boring to me and is something I've never done before except for an intro course to c++ sophmore year. I feel like this is pushing me away from the career I want, making me appear less competent for the work I actually studied for and want to do."

I honestly cant even believe i'm considering this but pls hear me out. For reference, I just finished my freshman year of college.

My college was a really bad fit for me—I do very poorly socially at a huge school w/o a campus. I really tried to stick it through because i felt like transferring was like giving up, buuuuut i finally decided to leave. that was late April. I only applied to UChicago since it was the only app still open.

They took eons to get back to me, but I got waitlisted. i think it was cuz I applied extremely late and they had no more space. summer comes, they take no one off the waitlist bc the class is full. the transfer admissions director was way nice to me and i got a personalized rejection letter telling me to apply to their grad school lmfao ...

i'm going on a gap year rn because i can't bear to go back to my school, and i'll be doing internships and maybe 1 or 2 classes, and then applying to around 15 schools for *fall 2022 as an incoming sophomore.*

**HERE IS THE DECISION WE MUST MAKE:** In addition to the 15 schools, should i apply to UChicago again? (for the THIRD TIME BY THE WAY. bc surprise, in addition to fall 2021 transfer, i actually had applied ED1 in high school.)

**pros**: I would get my decision in March, while the rest of my decisions are in May. I would be going to a school I definitely liked if i got in. I have a decent chance because of transfer ED and I know they probably like me. and i have nothing to lose. other than my dignity of course.

**cons**: emotional turmoil if i don't get in cuz of this stupidly tumultuous relationship with their school. i'd just be so embarrassed because I don't want to be that loser simping over a college, because I PROMISE i actually like my other choices, I just feel like im throwing a good opportunity down the drain if i don't apply.

oc1bml,2,2021-07-01,Life is Beating Me Down,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/oc1bml/life_is_beating_me_down/,"I’m 21 years old and about to be a 5th year senior in university. This all started about 2 weeks after I turned 20 in September 2019. I came down with catastrophic health problems. This wasn’t anything common, but it wasn’t life threatening…to other people that is. One day I woke up, and everything was just different. I’ll start with the day that everything changed; or when I noticed it changed. (Even though this was almost 2 years ago, I remember it like it was an hour ago)

**The Day Everything Changed**

It was a regular weekday and started with my normal routine. No breakfast, shower, watch a little YouTube and then I went to class. I always arrive to class early, and when I used to wait for the professor to arrive, I’d read some news on my phone. But while I’m reading, I notice everyone around me starts acting weird. It was only a couple of people in the class, but they were all acting the same. They were sniffing and rubbing their noses, making comments like “do you smell that” and “it smells like shit.” But when they sniffed and rubbed their noses, it was in my direction. So I try to smell it, but I don’t smell anything. Eventually I smell something a little bit, but I couldn’t smell anything that irritate me the way it irritated the other students. By this point, I knew it was me. You ever just get that feeling? But then something happened to prove my hypothesis. I look to my right, and this guy 2 seats over from me is giving me the nastiest look and sniffing. He face was of pure disgust. I had never seen anyone look like that, let alone at me. The image of his face is something I’ll never forget. I try to sit through class, but it gets harder and harder and my anxiety keeps skyrocketing. When the professor came to my side of the room, she jumped at the smell and tried to play it off. After this, a lizard was on the whiteboard for some reason, and you know how students are. I used that opportunity to run to my dorm. When I got to why dorm, I took three showers that. Nothing changed. 

2 days later, I ditch school and go home early one morning, and tell my dad everything that happened. He told me I could go to the doctor, so I went. They gave me no answers. I’ll sum this part up. This is basically when I learned that my parents weren’t invincible and all knowing. In essence, they just wanted me to suck it up, even though they didn’t say it that way. Its easy to say that when you don’t have to deal with on the daily basis. I stayed home for a week, asking my family did they smell anything but they said no, which was probably true at the start. But eventually I noticed them rubbing their noses and making remarks about the smell, even though they aren’t directed at me. At one point, I knew they were lying to me and I didn’t know how to feel. I understood why but I also felt betrayed. I was confused. At first I couldn’t smell the odor at will, but over time I could. I wont get too gross, although it may be a little too late for that. 

I tried to say strong, but I couldn’t. Each day and every-time I had to deal with people, a piece of me was destroyed. I stopped going to class and layed in my dorm room staring at the sealing for 5 months straight. The neighbors on my hall would beat on walls, yell , and call be names through the window. I ate apples, ramen noodles, and only drunk water because I was too scared to go to the cafeteria. Eventually, I started living in my car in parking lots. Sleeping in it as well. I couldn’t escape no matter where I went. 

Over this time span, I visited about 7 or 8 clinics. I told one doctor my symptoms, and he literally asked me “what do you want me to do??” He gave me some anxiety meds and basically told me f off. Around December, a doctor diagnosed me with hemorrhoids. I finally learned what was causing this. At least I thought I did. 

I continued experiencing the same situation in the Spring of 2021, and then covid happened. During this time, I literally just hid in room depressed. Although this depression was not nearly as bad as it was when I was alone in my dorm room. It was so hard to live with myself. I didn’t want to be in the same room as myself, and I still don’t. I didn’t spend time with my family because I don’t want to see them rub their noses. I felt guilty for not spending time with them and I still am. I don’t know, I think I’m just weak or something. 

Eventually, in July of 2020, I ended up going to a gastroenterologist. (I should have went here first, but didn’t know how doctors worked, in terms of specialist and stuff).

oc1c2c,2,2021-07-01,Life is beating me down,[deleted],mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/oc1c2c/life_is_beating_me_down/,"I’m 21 years old and about to be a 5th year senior in university. This all started about 2 weeks after I turned 20 in September 2019. I came down with catastrophic health problems. This wasn’t anything common, but it wasn’t life threatening…to other people that is. One day I woke up, and everything was just different. I’ll start with the day that everything changed; or when I noticed it changed. (Even though this was almost 2 years ago, I remember it like it was an hour ago)

**The Day Everything Changed**

It was a regular weekday and started with my normal routine. No breakfast, shower, watch a little YouTube and then I went to class. I always arrive to class early, and when I used to wait for the professor to arrive, I’d read some news on my phone. But while I’m reading, I notice everyone around me starts acting weird. It was only a couple of people in the class, but they were all acting the same. They were sniffing and rubbing their noses, making comments like “do you smell that” and “it smells like shit.” But when they sniffed and rubbed their noses, it was in my direction. So I try to smell it, but I don’t smell anything. Eventually I smell something a little bit, but I couldn’t smell anything that irritate me the way it irritated the other students. By this point, I knew it was me. You ever just get that feeling? But then something happened to prove my hypothesis. I look to my right, and this guy 2 seats over from me is giving me the nastiest look and sniffing. He face was of pure disgust. I had never seen anyone look like that, let alone at me. The image of his face is something I’ll never forget. I try to sit through class, but it gets harder and harder and my anxiety keeps skyrocketing. When the professor came to my side of the room, she jumped at the smell and tried to play it off. After this, a lizard was on the whiteboard for some reason, and you know how students are. I used that opportunity to run to my dorm. When I got to why dorm, I took three showers that. Nothing changed. 

2 days later, I ditch school and go home early one morning, and tell my dad everything that happened. He told me I could go to the doctor, so I went. They gave me no answers. I’ll sum this part up. This is basically when I learned that my parents weren’t invincible and all knowing. In essence, they just wanted me to suck it up, even though they didn’t say it that way. Its easy to say that when you don’t have to deal with on the daily basis. I stayed home for a week, asking my family did they smell anything but they said no, which was probably true at the start. But eventually I noticed them rubbing their noses and making remarks about the smell, even though they aren’t directed at me. At one point, I knew they were lying to me and I didn’t know how to feel. I understood why but I also felt betrayed. I was confused. At first I couldn’t smell the odor at will, but over time I could. I wont get too gross, although it may be a little too late for that. 

I tried to say strong, but I couldn’t. Each day and every-time I had to deal with people, a piece of me was destroyed. I stopped going to class and layed in my dorm room staring at the sealing for 5 months straight. The neighbors on my hall would beat on walls, yell , and call be names through the window. I ate apples, ramen noodles, and only drunk water because I was too scared to go to the cafeteria. Eventually, I started living in my car in parking lots. Sleeping in it as well. I couldn’t escape no matter where I went. 

Over this time span, I visited about 7 or 8 clinics. I told one doctor my symptoms, and he literally asked me “what do you want me to do??” He gave me some anxiety meds and basically told me f off. Around December, a doctor diagnosed me with hemorrhoids. I finally learned what was causing this. At least I thought I did. 

I continued experiencing the same situation in the Spring of 2021, and then covid happened. During this time, I literally just hid in room depressed. Although this depression was not nearly as bad as it was when I was alone in my dorm room. It was so hard to live with myself. I didn’t want to be in the same room as myself, and I still don’t. I didn’t spend time with my family because I don’t want to see them rub their noses. I felt guilty for not spending time with them and I still am. I don’t know, I think I’m just weak or something. 

Eventually, in July of 2020, I ended up going to a gastroenterologist. (I should have went here first, but didn’t know how doctors worked, in terms of specialist and stuff). This guy tells me they were bad and I need surgery. Fast forward to December 2020, I get a Hemorrhoidectomy in hopes of solving the problem. And I had another in May of 2021. I still have the smell problem, which doesn’t make sense. 

And now we are in the present day. Throughout this all, I have become a social recluse. I stopped talking to my friends because I knew that they wouldn’t accept me like this. I couldn’t confront them like this. In this pathetic state. The pandemic was helpful in the sense that I could take courses online, now I don’t how to proceed. I can’t sit in class smelling like this. I don’t know what to do. I was thinking about just dropping out and leaving, or trying to get an internship and move out or something.

oc1fx1,1,2021-07-01,another year alone,onesingleghost,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/oc1fx1/another_year_alone/,"idk why i'm (26) posting this, maybe to see that i'm not alone or maybe for encouragement? i just really want to get this off my chest.

i know a lot of people say this (which says a lot ab society imo) but i think i'm going to be alone forever.

no matter what i do, i always end up alone. i'm not just talking about romantic relationships, in fact i strongly believe that at least at this point in my life i'm aromantic. but i've been spending weeks in my apartment and the only time i really go out is to get takeout. i have a few friends, but they are in relationships and that means that friendships (at least with me) are on the back burner for them. but in any case i'm always alone and i've always been. in high school i didn't have many friends. i didn't get the chance to go out much because i was always babysitting my younger sister. we were latchkey kids. 

in college, same thing, didn't make many friends. it was a little easier when i lived in dorms/ student housing, but those days are long gone.

in between living with family and living on my own at different points, it was the same deal. i moved to a city where i finished school. started building friendships but the pandemic ruined that. i moved back to the city where most of my friends lived and idk why i thought it'd be different. i'm graduated now as of a few months ago. i have an internship, but it's remote. i spend my days at home all the time, all day and all night. even though i have friends they only wanna hang out if it's with their other friends too. 

it doesn't help that my roommate has a lot of friends. she's never home and i always am and it just makes me feel like a loser. i've tried making friends through social media or on apps but they all fizzle out so quickly. when i have energy, sometimes i'll go sit in a park and read or go jog or ride my bike to distract myself, but it's getting harder and harder to push myself to leave the house.

i'm losing interest + energy in all my hobbies and i've had a history with depression since i was a teen and it's sucks to know that i'm slipping back into it, because it just makes it that much harder to not think about how lonely i am. i'm currently taking a break from social media because it only makes me feel worse. i've done this all before, and here i am again, alone.

i don't really know what to do at this point. i'm seeking therapy again because a separation from a horrible friend resulted in a huge blow in my self esteem as much as i hate to admit. everyone else is moving on with their lives and making new connections while i'm stuck in the same place. i try to put myself out there but nothing is working. i feel like i'm just going to be moving from place to place looking for a home that doesn't exist. 

it's not that i don't like myself, i do. i think i'm pretty great! but no one else seems to and i know it ""doesn't matter"" but after spending my whole life so far by myself, it would be nice to have real friends again. i know that adult life means that you're more busy, but i see my friends hanging out with other people all the time. i can't help but wonder when i'll get to experience that.

i'm also on the neurodivergent spectrum, so i'm sure that plays a role. sometimes i can be a bit awkward but i really do try my best to be sociable. i've tried going to groups to make friends with similar hobbies that meet frequently because that's the key to making friends as an adult according to the internet. nothing works and nothing changes."

I've applied to about 120 jobs over the span of 3 months. I feel so mentally beaten down from all of this. I feel like me comparing myself to other people has been making it harder though. So many people that I went to school with (who aren't CS majors) are easily getting jobs in their fields while I'm struggling. I was talking with CS grads from my school, and they said that they've been having a rough time finding jobs too. One person (who graduated a few years ago) said that it took him 8 months post-graduation to find a job.   


I'm just struggling so much with my motivation to continue finding a job in this field right now. I have a summer internship worth of experience, but that isn't enough to these ""entry level"" jobs that require two years of experience. It feels like I can't compete."

DAY FIFTY-SIX

PERSONAL PROJECT STATUS: CLASSIFIED

CORPORATE PROJECT STATUS: BREAKTHROUGH

A personal note: They're talking about me, I know it.

On the advice of Mister McNugget, we compared the bare bones code the system loaded up against current code. While we could see how things had been layered onto the system, we could not tell what order despite looking for everything.

See, the problem is thus: If you take a bunch of files and one at a time save them as patches you can look at the file creation/modification dates. However, if you copy ALL of the files once you have them all patched and put together, to the new location, all of the time/date stamps for both creation and last access are the same.

This eliminates forensic computer examination to determine the file age.

However, Mister McNugget has a different way of looking at it. Xer is a corporate entity through and through. Joined NSO at the age of twenty-five as a management intern and has clawed xer's way up through the intense fight.

Additionally he has the 'corporate eye' as she likes to put it. It allows xer to examine things and come to his own conclusions that might not be obvious to anyone other than him.

After a couple hours of examination xir began to identify sections of code that were patched in to patch something else.

Xster McNugget has stated that some time after the initial 'skeletal code' was established, corporations or governments began to layer things is. Xir reminded us that she is the direct descendant of General McNugget, who burned Tampa to the ground during the War of the Box, and that although he dislikes it, xe is perfectly capable of looking at things with a corporate military eye.

Another breakthrough is the fact that the Hardware Analysis Team has been working on what all of the circuits in the bare bone system do.

One of the circuits is responsible for *phasic transmission*. You read that right. Phasic transmission.

Despite everyone *know* that you cannot transmit phasic energy through electronics, there is a section there that allows the transfer of phasic energy.

However, the circuits are energized and throw the small strange-matter fuses the minute the system is engaged.

The Hardware Analysis Team has posited that the system is engaged with some kind of energy overflow.

To that extent, we activated a repeater in a phasically clean chamber, allowing no leakage in or out.

The system powered up, and the phasic circuitry went live and blew the strange-matter fuses.

The system is capable of making phasic energy record transmissions, but whatever is pushing that signal is overloaded.

A breakthrough, but not one we understand.

PERSONAL ADDENDUM

Today at lunch Doctor Hermans and I almost confronted one another.

I saw a tiny ant, bright red, crawl out from under his fingernail and onto the table. I crushed it with my middle finger and held it up for him to see.

He turned red at seeing I had seen what he had tried to do. That he had tried to put that ant into someone's food so it would infest them. That I had crushed his minion.

He now knows that I know.

DAY SIXTY-THREE

Mister McNugget and I nearly had a shouting match. I referred to him as 'she' for some reason. Which is odd. Mister McNugget is in a male's body, is using the name Carl Susan McNugget, his digital ID visible through your datalink lists his gender as male.

Why did I refer to him as a 'she'?

He then remembered that I am off of my medication and merely gently suggested I take a second to ensure that I correctly gender people.

It felt off to me. I don't know why.

Oh well.

\--Marco

DAY SIXTY-EIGHT

Personal Project: No Change

Corporate Project: Stalemate

I know I'm off my medication. That things are different and my perceptions are skewed.

I wish I could examine my previous journal entries, but their under security lockdown.

I could swear that Doctor Nyomn was a male. Yet, there she stands, five foot three, one hundred two pounds (pounds? Why pounds? Why not kilos?), brown hair, brown skin, green eyes. Female secondary characteristics and primary characteristics.

Yet I seem to recall her being a male.

Going off my medication, I don't remember the whispers last time. They're in the shadows, in the dark.

I've taken to sleeping with a night light.

Mister McNugget has asked me if I'm sure I should be off my medication.

I know there is a good reason. My thoughts move faster, I make deductions quicker, I can put logic chains together faster.

Mister McNugget checked my speed test for logic puzzles by comparing results done now to my prior corporate testing. I'm over 275% faster.

I can tell I make him uneasy, but what do you expect?

I have a hypothesis, but it's not able to be proven.

I'd have to create an experimental clone, and I won't do that.

Another note. I've smelled cigarette smoke a few times in the corridors, yet there are no Treana'ad on our research team. I've informed maintenance.

\--Marco

^(you know who you are)

DAY SEVENTY-TWO

Yesterday we have a breakthrough, if you want to call it that. I guess you could.

The network started doing rapid data transfers. Really fast ones. For roughly an hour.

Then it went completely dead. Still. All but a single molecule/atom of the spooky matter dissolved away. It then all reformed, and the system began transmitting as normal.

We're not sure why.

The other strange thing is there was a heavily encoded message that appeared on the internal mail server, addressed to nobody, with no origin address. It's from something or someone called ""ARCHANGEL GABRIEL"" but the message is so heavily encoded even Green Team Three is stumped.

I found half a pack of cigarettes with the label ""LUCKY STRIKE"" on them in the female bathroom when I went to check the smell of cigarette smoke. I turned them into security and now we're on a low level lockdown.

Mister McNugget had to deal with several dozen of the security personnel breaking open the armory and getting out weapons. There was a full blown firefight in C-Section as the security personnel had to do fire and advance on something. Casualties were bad. Out of sixty men and women who did a sweep and clear of C-Section, twenty-two are dead and nineteen are injured.

Mister McNugget came to my room late this evening, apologizing for interrupting my day off, and handed me an Iron Key of all things. It contains the footage. He asked me took it over, uncharacteristically intense for such a quiet and thoughtful man.

I looked it over.

^(your name is marco)

There is no evidence of gunfire or other violence directed toward the security teams, but each time you can see the *effects* of gunfire upon the bodies, armor, or shielding of the security personnel.

I saw a secman get his head blown off by *nothing* and another secman get grabbed, their left arm pulled over their head, and a, and stick with me here, shot them through the armpit and into their chest with the weapon of a *previously killed secman.*

Despite the video evidence, they were engaged with something.

Something deadly.

There's something going on.

I checked everyone's biometrics and pictures against who I am in here with.

They all match.

So why do I feel something is off.

In closing, after much deliberation, I have decided that it is unethical to create a clone to experiment on.

But what if, stay with me here, what if... I do the experiment on myself.

We still have the capability to cross-sheathe. I can switch to a new sheathe with what I need.

\--Marco

DAY SEVENTY-FOUR

I cross-sheathed. I have no standard SUDS, just what we're calling a Gen-Zero SUDS implant and a datalink, Pre-Glassing version. It's bulkier, different circuitry.

It's funny how documentation and exactly how something is done can be lost in such a short amount of time.

While normally I should have been yelled at by Mister McNugget, he didn't seem to care.

While I was being resheathed, there was another firefight in C-Section. A squad got pinned down and massacred. Eight secmen killed.

Security footage is, well, confusing.

Mister McNugget figured it out within viewing sixty seconds of video footage.

The hour long firefight last week? The hour long firefight this week?

They're the same incident.

Somehow, the team from this week opened fire on the team from last week after someone cut the throat of the team leader.

Except, the team leader is alive. They survived having their throat cut.

I viewed the data.

I didn't say anything, although Hermans is looking at me like he knows, with those ants squirming under his skin.

Other than that, there's nothing yet.

\--Marco

^(he knows he knows he knows he knows)

DAY EIGHTY-ONE

Earth is gone. Sorry, TerraSol is gone. Something called ""System Demi-Dimensional Security System"" kicked in, AKA ""Bagging"" the system.

At last communication with corporate, over twenty MILLION Lanaktallan ships had attacked Fortress Sol.

We've got a problem.

Our *only* contact is through a superluminal array that communicates ONLY with Terra.

We have no contact.

Worse, we have no FTL.

We're stuck here.

DAY EIGHT-SEVEN

A Screaming One.

Holy shit, I was attacked by a Screaming One.

It happened after a test on the relay system. Mister McNugget has demanded that every testing team is escorted by at least five secmen.

They reinforced the phasic circuitry, upped the p-amperage of the fuses, and turned the system on.

Doctor Relklink began shrieking, frothing at the mouth. He attacked everyone.

He killed half of Phasic Interaction Research, two of the secmen.

Doctor Ulnith beat him to death with an oscilloscope.

I was in the bathroom, in the last stall, making notes, when the lights in the bathroom went out.

A Terran male kicked open the door, stark naked, and attacked me. They were frothing at the mouth, screaming, bleeding from their eye sockets.

I put the heel of my hand into the bottom of their chin and while their throat was exposed drove my stylus into their windpipe before giving them a punch just beneath the sternum to make their heart and lungs forget how to work.

I stood over him and watched him die.

A Screaming one.

A fucking Screaming One attacked me.

ME!

ATTACKED FUCKING ME!

Security isn't sure where they came from. Everyone is accounted for.

Except for him.

I saw Mister McNugget look at me.

He recognized him.

After all, I'd killed him the same way this time too.

oc3pin,0,2021-07-02,Staying at my current internship vs jumping to another one,objectivelystupider,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/oc3pin/staying_at_my_current_internship_vs_jumping_to/,"My university requires its CS students to work a certain amount (namely, three semesters or ""blocks"", which spans a whole year) of paid internships (i.e. co-ops) as a graduation requirement.

My current co-op is a ""double block"" and will end in August. Now I'm on the search for my third block after that, and I've already interviewed for a couple companies and am waiting on them to respond to me with their decisions. 

My current company has recently told me that they're open to the idea of extending my internship contract to cover that final block, I just need to make that request formally. 

Now, if any of my pending interviews returns with a job offer, I don't expect their compensation or benefits to be hugely different than what I currently have. They're all internship positions, all remote, and the companies are all from the same area/city so compensation will likely be pretty consistent. 

I also really enjoy working at my current internship, but know I'd also enjoy working at any of the jobs I've interviewed for. So there's not a lot of personal preference here either.

All this will (likely) leave me with the choice of either sticking with a place I've already been with for half a year, or making a switch just to have another internship on my resume. 

I know the idea of jumping around early on in your career as a developer is usually a good thing, but I'm still a student and these are really short-term intern positions - if I make the jump I'd only be working for the second company for 4 months and then I'll be back to classes.

I feel like staying would allow me to be more productive because I can skip the whole onboarding process and will be working with tech I'm familiar with. At the same time, having two companies on my resume before I even graduate might look better than having one, longer internship - but then again, would it? I think some recruiters would like the fact that I stayed at one internship for a whole year.

Any opinions/inputs would be appreciated. Thank you!"

I just recently changed majors to Computer Science at my university before this past spring quarter of college without prior coding experience besides some Python courses at a community college on the side... and I struggled a lot this past quarter. I took 16 units of C++, stats, Boolean algebra, and a software engineering course but I made it through and I told myself that I would spend the summer relearning C++ and trying to give myself a crash course in data structures/algorithms to get better with programming since I know that these are fundamental. 

I’ve just been feeling so stressed and overwhelmed because I’m technically a year behind in what I should know since I finally was able to change my major so late in the game. My anxiety and stress have been at an all time high. Other people in my grade seem to know so much more than I do and are landing internships or building their own projects and gaining experience that I don’t have. I feel like I should be at this point that I’m not at yet because my fundamental knowledge isn’t as strong as I’d like it to be right now and I’m scared that I won’t be able to land an internship or a job while I’m in college because the field is so competitive. I guess I just feel really inadequate right now but I really do have passion for the field and I want to get better. I’ve also been feeling really alone because I don’t really know a lot of CS majors at my school since I changed majors during covid and I haven’t had anyone I could really go to for help or advice in the field.

If you could share any advice, words of encouragement, or your own story that would be immensely appreciated because I feel really lost right now. Thanks guys."

I’m an upcoming sophomore and I came to the cs major with no experience or knowledge, I had to take two intro courses to coding in both semesters for my freshman year (one intro to coding for my major where I learned Python in my first semester and one intro to coding for all engineering majors where I relearned Python and crammed learning Java for my second semester. Every CS major had to do it idk why), and like two weeks ago I just started to prepare for internships by studying data structures algorithms for the first time and doing leetcode (which I’m struggling in). 

I sorta am understanding algorithms like merge sort, insertion short, linear search, and such but the book I’m learning it from just feels so convoluting with its explanations. And, when I look at easy problems on leetcode my head just goes static looking at the problems and solutions cause of the use of algorithms. Point being, I feel so unprepared with my and it feels so overwhelming, and I was wondering if anyone feels this and would share how they’re deal with this?"

As the title of my post suggests, I am a final year software engineering student in Canda without any prior internships. I have one 4 month research term which didn't result in any publications, so I am not sure how useful that will end up being on my resume. 

Due to many personal reasons, I was never able to thoroughly invest my efforts into harnessing my technical skills beyond a certain novice level. I feel as though throughout my university life, I have picked up really bad habits of late night studying, skimming through the material only for the sake of regurgitating it during exams, and just being complacent with professors whom, during the pandemic, started spoon-feding course material. My third year final exams were fully multiple choice questions and while I have recieved splendid grades, I feel as though I have learned nothing.

oc9sn6,0,2021-07-02,Recent CS grad thinking about relocating - input would be helpful,SauteedAppleSauce,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/oc9sn6/recent_cs_grad_thinking_about_relocating_input/,"Hi. I'm a recent CS graduate and am wondering if I should relocate to another city. I have an internship with a relatively big tech company and a few projects under my belt (both school and personal). The current metro area that I live in currently has around 500k population. There aren't a whole lot of SWE jobs where I am that has a tech stack I'm interested in, and I'd say half of the SWE engineer jobs listed seem to just be a support role.

Would relocating to a bigger metropolitan area (~ 2M population) be better for me if that area has a more demand for what I'm interested in?"
occgj5,5,2021-07-02,Big 4 Tax to M7 or T15,Jaded-Pirate-6707,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/occgj5/big_4_tax_to_m7_or_t15/,"Hey everyone. I'm a senior in undergrad and a Real Estate Tax intern at PwC. I should be finishing my accounting program at Rutgers by the end of this fall. My original plan post-graduation was to get my CPA and work in the public accounting world for a few years and later exit to industry for some tax role. However, this path sounds (and always did sound) excruciating and depressing to me because (1) I don't particularly like tax or accounting in general, (2) studying for the CPA would be a long and stressful endeavor because of reason 1, and (3) I don't want to be an accountant for the rest of my life, and isn't a CPA really only useful to accountants? 

I recently became serious about abandoning this CPA plan and adopting a new one. That new one being, getting an MBA from an M7 or T15 school. As I understand it, MBAs from good schools can lead to roles that are all about leadership and development, which sounds really interesting to me. Tax accounting seems to focus more on compliance and number crunching, which I don't find interesting. Maybe I'd like auditing a bit more?

Anyway, here are just a few questions I wanted to ask:

(1) What do you think of this new plan? Good? Bad? Risky? Harder than CPA plan?

(2) Will 2-4 years of big 4 TAX experience be of any use to me during the grad school application process? Would big 4 AUDIT experience be more useful? 

(3) Do you think big 4 experience, in general, is not that lucrative and that I should look into interning (and eventually work full time for 2-4 years) elsewhere?

(4) Is work experience really all that important for getting in? Would you say the GMAT score, GPA, extracurriculars, etc. are more important? 

(5) Specifically, what are some of the jobs an MBA leads to? I was thinking investment banker, private equity, financial analyst, marketing manager, management consultant, or CEO, but please correct me if I'm wrong.

Thanks, everyone! Really looking forward to seeing your ideas."

I have very little Software Engineer experience from that and the only language I learned was Java. I currently work as a systems administrator using Linux doing a lot of server administration. I want to start a career in software engineering but I know where I stand, which is practically intern level. I considered going back to school for a masters in software engineering but I would hate to waste my time and money knowing that I could be in the same position due to lack of experience. 

Has anyone else experienced this and what did they do to overcome those obstacles? I have been told to just start doing it in my own time but I really don’t know where or how to start. I adapt very easily to new technology. Are there online tools? Are there mentors out there that will help guide me in the right path?

ocdzpm,2,2021-07-02,Unsure of whether to end mentorship/friendship,tee3ruh,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ocdzpm/unsure_of_whether_to_end_mentorshipfriendship/,"I (32f) have had a mentoring relationship for about six months with Lisa (20f). I work in a really niche industry wherein one-on-one mentorship is a mandatory part of study from before uni due to the fact that university placement in this field is unbelievably competitive. To enter a course of study for a bachelor's degree takes on average 3 or 4 years of specialised study and even then, only a small (less than 10 percent) number of applicants will be successful. It's pretty normal to need to apply a few years in a row to get a place at a school that is a good fit. Wash, rinse and repeat at the master's level, and again for additional postgrad degrees and internships. For jobs, it's even worse. You compete until the day you retire. 

It is standard to charge frankly exorbitant prices as a teacher who works actively in-industry concurrently but I have known Lisa for six years through her parents and am aware that neither she nor her parents have money. She started asking me advice on things like boy trouble about four years ago, and we developed a friendship of sorts; a kind of big sister thing. I've therefore been tutoring her for free in the last months, often commuting to her city (about an hour away) to work together since she doesn't have a car and I didn't want her taking the train while covid was rampant. 

Lisa has applied for university placement this year, and only began serious study when she came to me six months ago. As I said before, this is a very short period of time to work before trying for uni, but as she's turning 21 before the start of next school year I didn't want to ask her to delay. She hasn't gotten acceptances from schools in our country, unfortunately, but she was accepted to a small school in a bordering country (about four hours from her hometown) where her primary professor would be somebody that she already knows and would be quite nurturing; Lisa is naturally gifted, but will need some extra work to catch up to her peers who have studied years longer than she has. She does not want to move abroad, though, and recently told me that I am ""not to mention the idea of studying abroad up ever again"". 

She has one last entrance exam in a week for a school in-country, and I've been telling her not to let her sense of self be shaken by having had other rejections; she keeps on saying horrible things about her person and abilities, which I believe will only lead her to further lose confidence and additionally to tank her last exam. She said that she is so sure she will fail that she is considering not even sitting the exam at all. 

Last night, she absolutely lost her shit at me when I told her to stay positive in advance of the exam for the sake of her nerves, and said some really hurtful things about my character that can't be unheard. I understand her stress and fear, but this behaviour has been escalating for a few months, and last night was only the boiling point. I know that I should give her more leeway because we are ostensibly friends and our friendship shouldn't require professional levels of respect, but she hasn't been treating me like a friend lately, either: there is a lot going on in my life (a parent suddenly critically ill, an escape from an attempted car jacking, and extreme work stress) that I haven't told her because the words ""how are you"" have not come out of her mouth in more than a month. The thing is that, due to our age difference, I have established a precedent of complete stoicism where her more immature behaviour has been concerned, and I don't really know how to call her out on it now. 

I have been contemplating telling Lisa (after her last exam) that, if she decides to take another year of study before uni, I am unwilling to continue teaching her. She first off needs to understand that the way that she's acting has consequences and may impact her academically if she continues this behaviour in uni (under pressure she's been rude to specialist colleagues that I've enlisted to help her, and above all she has been disrespectful to my husband, who also happens to be in-industry and who has been very generous with her). I also feel that since we came to our working relationship via friendship she is unwilling to take on difficult assignments that I set her which are necessary to her progression, and that she would be more willing to take on challenging problems that are set for her by somebody that she refers to formally and to whom she takes on debt to pay heaps of money. 

That said, though, she has had very few adults in her life that she can actually trust. Part of the reason that I chose to be close to her four years ago is that I thought she needed to know that she could ask for help without having a person bail on her; the idea of telling her to look for help elsewhere and to pay for it makes me feel really sick. I had mentors who gave me the world, and I want to pay forward to Lisa what they gave to me. But I'm very hurt by how she's treated me and I am really upset at how she has been to my husband when she's come to our home, even if the issue is simply stress. I am not her mother, she is of age, and I cannot tell her how to behave. 

Would it be horrible of me to tell her to find (and pay for) a new teacher? And if not, should I be honest in that I've found her behaviour atrocious, or should I just chalk it up to being over-committed at work?"

My responsibilities consist of creating new surveys for the company and analyzing the data. Before walking in, my manager and sub-manager knew I was completely new to the field and having to learn everything about HR is a huge learning curve. During the interviews, my manager told me that there will be a HIGH conversion rate if everything goes well. It's only been a month into my internship, and they told me I am moving too slow. Ever since my first day, they have given me 6+ projects and their reasoning was ""you're gonna be our main researcher when you get converted, so we want you to get hands on experience"". I work 12+ hours each day as I am bombarded with work, with no self learning. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday my manager told me that I am moving too slow in our 1:1. He told me he will be posting the job mid july and that if they find someone new, I will not be coming back, but if I improve and show them that I can actually do it, I will be chosen. But what are the chances if you are comparing someone who has the skills already to an INTERN??? I am so confused, and honestly super bummed out as I know I have to be looking for a job soon as my internship ends in about 3 months. I just can't believe they want me to be on top of it after 1.2 months.. I am learning and I am working my hardest, but I dont think thats an expectation that can be accomplished so easily. Of course I'm not typing up everything here, but these are the general information... Am I moving too slow? or is my company just very inconsiderate?"

I hope you guys can help me choose which offer would be good.

The first one is a big service-based company that pays me the least and has the most structure, but I really don't think a dev role is guaranteed here as it can vary from testing, support to dev. They have good training and most of my alumni work here. I am told that I can double the offer by giving exams conducted internally 

The second is a well-structured small sized startup, their offer is almost double of the service-based company, I am pretty good in frontend js frameworks and also neat in backend js the role allows me to do dev work in here they have stuff like staff management, hr and a good amount of devs the work here is good in an interesting field, have some senior devs and follow a good mentor-mentee pattern

The third is a very very small startup, its a couple of friends founding the startup a total of 3 devs of witch 1 is an intern that's it the whole startup is a team of about 5 people handling everything I've joined them as an intern to see how the culture is and how stuff is going on completing about 20 days here all I can say is things are really messy but the people are good, devs get the job done but still it's messy, I really don't think I can learn from anyone specifically as there are 0 senior devs here but the work is abundant and to my taste and most importantly everyone is pretty chill.  They are paying almost triple of what the service-based will pay me 

Now I have about 15 days to select one and I seriously can't think of what should I go with, I am the type of guy who loves to do stuff with js but if need be can transition to anything and can be flexible in any technical role, I seek good experience and learning so help me choose one as its really really confusing for me.

I know getting an internship is hard and competitive, but this seems to be exceedingly difficult. I'm not even targeting Fortune 500 companies. So many of the companies I've applied to are small and around the area. I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

I graduated in June, 2020. I had an internship at a company a year prior, and got promoted to a full time position just after I graduated. Good salary too, $75k a year on top of a bonus. Things were going great, but come November, I got laid off with two days of warning.

After getting laid off, I had a couple other major life events hit me hard. I  took a couple months off, then started grinding leetcode back in January. I also spend some time getting better with a collection of web dev technologies (HTML/CSS/JS/Node, etc - trying to get into full stack). Since April, I've been sending out apps consistently. Since then I've sent out hundreds of apps. I've gotten a couple interviews, but no offers - I was passed up by someone with more experience both times.

I was hoping for a similar salary as when I started, but I guess my expectations are too high. I'm wondering how low I should set my goals now. A recruiter reached out to me wondering if I would accept $25k/yr for a full time job. I respectfully declined.

Lately I've been sending out 10+ apps a day. I've gotten my resume looked over by multiple people telling me they thought it was good. I'm tailoring my skills to the apps and highlighting my work experience. I'm also going through a course learning about microservices, learning how to build an e-commerce app. It really sucks though seeing all of my peers passing me up and my parents going from telling me they are proud of me to telling me I need to focus on my career. I'm grinding every day, but I have a hard time just being able to sit back and relax without falling into a pit of self-blaming. Like if I'm not spending every day applying to new jobs and grinding leetcode with small breaks, I feel like I'm wasting my time.

So what should I do? How low should I set my sights regarding salary (I live in the Seattle area). How low do I need to shoot? Should I just get a job at McDonalds or something?"

oco4oh,2,2021-07-02,First few years not ideal. How can I present myself?,one_of_A,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/oco4oh/first_few_years_not_ideal_how_can_i_present_myself/,"My experience basically looks like I failed at each thing. I'll briefly give an overview. This is all at one company.

Year 1: summer internship + intern for a year until hired at graduation.
 
It started as an IT/administrator type thing because that's what I thought I wanted to do. I swear after 4 weeks went by where they gave me nothing, I went to another manager and started learning full stack development. This is from scratch pretty much, besides programming basics. I got decent. Still was a beginner. But they let me keep going after graduation.

Shortly after, I started another project with a different team. It was a bit out of my scope but even when I'd get some kind of mvp up, company changes wasn't letting me deploy it in a certain way. I wasn't really growing as an engineer in my time there so it was out of my scope anyway. I was still in that rookie mode. I needed more time (realized this in hindsight. Improving your coding skills is not improving your engineering skills)

I permanently moved to the other team, using a low code platform. Manager had plans for me to do alot of front end stuff. Pandemic struck and they were let go and the team got a new manager. So I'm on this team where I don't have a role. I'm the new, extra person. I keep learning the platform but still don't really establish a role.

I made a mistake one time (owned up, and it really wasn't that bad, and I didn't grant myself admin rights, and I fixed it and it never came up again)

Except it kept coming up and coming up month after month. I got set up to fail. Pip'd. Then I just left. Sure, I am not a great engineer yet, and I understand that if I'm not a good engineer, it's gonna look like I'm lazy, or this and that and if I can't provide value, then it is what it is.

So knowing I want another chance in an actual coding role, how do I let people know this?

I struggle because honestly, I don't have preferences and I am not particularly strong in a specific language, or framework or whatever. I struggle to do personal projects and tutorials because I just think ""yes I can complete this if I follow this video step by step."" So I just don't do it, almost because it's just another longer version of doing a hello world. 

If I could be honest, I'd say that I have the foundatioms to learn any language. I have my BS in CS and am earning my masters.  I need a place to start to continue growing as an engineer. I am not really motivated by my own ideas. I want to solve problems proposed by others. Isn't that what working is? Does there have to be something wrong with that? 

But of course, I can't be honest, or can I? I really wish I could lean more into my actually personality instead of having to be this ultra extroverted corporate employers dream. I like myself. 

So I guess my real question is, how do I package all of the crap I just said in a way that can attract the type of employer I'm looking for (someone who will let me start and learn engineering on the job, trusting my foundation from my education and prior experience even if it's not spotless and looks like 3 years of failure)

I know someone reading this will know exactly what to say. Appreciate the help! Won't give up...."
oco9zn,5,2021-07-02,CS degree vs coding bootcamp,AlCodez,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/oco9zn/cs_degree_vs_coding_bootcamp/,"I apologize for the long post, TLDR at the bottom.

I am a recent graduate from UC Irvine with a degree in biology. I wish I had known the job market for bio-related jobs was extremely competitive, but here we are. During my second year of college, I wanted to switch to computer science, however, intro classes were almost impossible to get, so I was never able to switch.

Now as a graduate, I find myself still wanting to break into the tech field. It's an in-demand field with high growth in the coming decade, and I feel I have real interest in it. I'm taking an intro to python course at a community college and I absolutely love it.

I am aware that there are multiple paths that can lead you into software engineering. For one, Oregon State University offers an online post-bacc computer science program that can be completed as quick as 1-2.5 years, for a total of around $30k. I know there are various coding bootcamps as well than can prepare you for employment within 6-8 months, for around $10k I believe. After a fair share of research, I came to the conclusion that a degree &gt; bootcamp in the long run. Having a CS degree alone gets you through HR filtering systems because from what I've read - some employers don't even look at your app if the degree box isn't checked. In addition, assuming I go through with this program, it would give me the opportunity to apply for internships, of which I know go a long way when searching for full time employment. Lastly, I've read that having an understanding of the fundamentals of computer science theory provided by a CS degree is very valuable to a programmer.

I know I've essentially answered my own question in that I believe a degree holds more value, but for some reason I keep circling back to the idea of a bootcamp. Maybe it's because I want to become employed as soon as I can, or maybe I'm afraid that if I drop 30k on a CS degree, I still wouldn't be able to secure employment. I personally don't know any bootcamp grads, so I can't ask about their experience and when I try looking online, I see mixed reviews. I've read that there are lots of scammy ones, and if I don't know if this is true - but apparently they are also losing credibility because the market is increasingly becoming more and more saturated. I don't know how common this path is, but I've also considered doing both - probably degree first then bootcamp, or vice versa.

And yes, I am ware that it takes much more than simply knowing how to code in order to get a job - like having personal projects, having a good understanding of data structures and algorithms, grinding leetcode, networking, etc. If any bootcamp grads can share their experience, it would be very helpful.

TLDR: Biology grad from UC Irvine looking to get into software engineering. Trying to decide between a second bachelor's in CS or if a coding bootcamp would be the way to go. Cost probably wouldn't be an issue, so I'm not taking that too much into account. I would appreciate any feedback."

I'm a computer/data science major about to graduate from a US state university in fall 2021. I'm hoping to travel across Europe in spring 2022.

My hope was to either find an internship over or do remote/freelance for American companies while abroad. I can afford to spend a few thousand dollars, but could make it a ""full"" 6 month trip if I was able to make some money while over there.

I was wondering:

* If anyone has suggestions for how an American could get a a spring tech internship in Europe?

oct9q1,8,2021-07-03,My experience with internships,voukebr,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/oct9q1/my_experience_with_internships/,"# My experience

I just finished my first internship at a local software house, I was working on the financial part of it but that gave me the opportunity to get along with all parts of the business, from engineering to marketing.

I was paid about R$50/day ($10 US dollars/day) which is ""good"" but most of it was to pay college. As it was my first time applying to any job it took about a month to get the job. I did apply for about 50 places that I would like to work and got a job as customer experience intern (coffee and excel maker). At first I was close minded about it and quite sad but the moment I realize that I could talk to people with more experience to learn, BOOM. They teached me about Python, SQL and some softskills.

I finished my internship because the company was bought and they moved to other country.  But the networking I did helped me a lot. Last two weeks I spend talking to the people I worked with and they helped me with a lot of info about which company were hiring and most important, more networking.

So I sent 20 CV's through linkedin and sent 10 CV's to company's with people that knew me already. I got in total 6 interviews but yesterday at my second one I already got a good offer at a company I like. Deal closed.

What I learned from all that, your first intership may not be the best or in the area that you like but do it for the networking and experience. 

I'm at my second year of college and I live in Brazil, that's why my english may sound a little funny.

If there's anything I can help just say it :)"
octjy6,2,2021-07-03,"24 y/o interested in UI/UX, front-end development with a tiny bit of full stack and software dev/engineering on the side, and product design, with opportunities to do UXR and product management if I so choose to climb that ladder, as well as leaving room to possibly do cyber security (penetration)",ichillonforums,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/octjy6/24_yo_interested_in_uiux_frontend_development/,"This is going to be all over the place, this post has been a long time coming.

I'm 24F (will be in August) and feel I have a late start and am going to have a hard time catching up now. Nothing but a retail background, no good references. I feel like I've wasted 6 years of my life. Graduated high school in 2015, I feel very old now.  After many bouts of depression due to life problems, and problems at  home, general procrastination, tons of uncertainty, im FINALLY starting to have some success with narrowing down my career niche and what I want to go into that would truly make me happy. UI/UX would make me happy, truly, it would. My only gripe is that I would want to also do something that utilizes my mental loops and anxiety, which is why I think penetration testing would also be great for me. My only fears about penetration testing are 1.) learning the 'beginning hump' stuff sounds like it's going to possibly be a bit hellish, but once I'm established a bit in it I think it has the potential to utilize a side of my brain that I want utilized. My only fear with this, however, is what if down the line after I put all this work in for the payoff and I end up hating it down the line still. I plan to study for and obtain my CompTIAs. I would also like to do product design but I think I would have to also be in UI/UX for me to really enjoy product management, I could go 50/50 with it or 75/25.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention in my title (well I didn't have room anyways) that I would love to do iOS development almost just as much as UI/UX (I'm thinking I basically wanna UI/UX my own apps and then code them with swift. I would freaking LOVE that!!) However, this idea I've put on the backburner because I do not have a MacBook and obtaining one sounds like something for the faarrr distant future. Finances are tight and I can't imagine buying a macbook is a good idea right now, I have an $800 overdraft fee (don't ask... investments gone wrong, despite my conservative measure), no income, need 5k for years-overdue dental surgery that I'm sure is infected (therefore I'll probably need another surgery to deal with the infection as well, as the main surgery isn't even for the infection) and god knows how much else for major stuff gone wrong with the home, and then I would like to get cataract surgery (yes, so young. And especially bad for a prospective designer!!!) so an outfit seems like an ultra luxury right now, let alone a macbook. Because of how strongly I feel about UI/UX and iOS development, this worried me about how I'm going to pivot into incorporating iOS development into my career later down the line after I'm already established and have everything set up perfectly how I want it \*besides\* that. I don't want to wreck the whole thing, not sure if that's a valid concern (I'd be firstgen for a 'fancy' career so I'm an incompetent imbecile)... Despite making great success with narrowing the niches I truly love down,  I still feel lost. I feel so old, not knowing what to do from this point on. Whenever anybody asks me if I want to go to college or plan to, I say, ""I'm allergic to loans"" (which is true), and ""I plan to get a doctorate in computer science and cyber security whenever I can pay it off in full up front"" which, as far as the degree goes, sometimes I question if I actually want to do that or if it just sounds good... my burnout levels are high, I'm prone to burnout, same with anehdonia, it seems like it would be a lot of work, perhaps even a bit too masculine for my taste, but only doing UI/UX, ios dev, and product design &amp; possibly management would probably be a bit too feminine for my taste. Definitely getting a design major would be too feminine for my taste, and I have no interest in a graphic design major, just not my thing. I plan to some courses on TeamTreeHouse, fiddle around on tryHackMe (but not sure how good of training tryhackme really is, if it's worth it I'll even pay to keep with it diligently, I like the interface a lot), and eventually I want to do Skillcrush and DesignLab, but god that seems so far in the future because of affordability. I really, REALLY want to do those though. Like, by a fuckton. I may even do Springboard after designlab if I get that far. Maybe.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a person who only feels safe in duality. Overseeing mini operations seems very fun to me and possibly even essential because I like to see the ins and outs of things, it fuels my need for omnipitence in my field, but I need to be dedicated to something that has a solid foundation as well, despite these mini operations. I want to work in a company, where I'm always working with my team 75% of the time, the ""goal"" is static and solid (not to be confused with limiting and unnurturing to creativity and different ideas of how to make the goal work, THAT would not work for me. Let me get as left-field and woo as I want, while still grounding me. Interdependence with focus on EVERYONE'S best interest), but despite this solid foundation I'm also always venturing out and getting a change of scenery and seeing other companies and other niches of STEM especially tech as a part of my job. I feel like I'm asking for SO MUCH here, I am probably head in the clouds.  I want more focus on design than tech, but I definitely NEED that tech aspect, and for it to never go away. Something where I will always have to do ""harder"" tech for my job, but it makes up like 35% of my job, will never be discouraged or swept away, and something where if I learn more tech in my free time it will make me more of an asset to my job. I consider myself ambiverted. I don't think I'm extroverted enough for things such as marketing, which concerns me as somebody who would like to freelance a lot. Marketing and digital strategy (except for maybe SEO but I have my gripes with SEO as well because I feel it discourages creativity) seem too light and fluffy for my taste, but maybe when my burnout is REEAAL bad, it could be a good plan Z backup. Maybe. No. Scratch that part. Just seems below me, as bad as it sounds. I don't really like to sell, as a person who comes from a low-income background and family, the thought of having to sell and market my services puts me into a panic and scarcity state, I like to either have decent quality clients come to me, or have seamless transitions throughout my career (for example, if I learn UI/UX, I have no problem finding a UI/UX job that is a right fit for me and I don't take jobs with a sketchy environment out of desperation or FOMO underutilizing my skills until it's too late). I want to have 50-70% of the time where I HAVE to come into the office, but the remainder I have the ability to have flexible hours and also freelance. For example, a perfect setup for me would be, boss says that I/we MUST be in the office 9-5 every day for 4 months, then the next 4 months we have a flexible schedule but must still come into the office, then the next 4 months we're back to our strict 9-5, then the next 4 months we're working completely remote and basically freelancing, then the next 4 months we're back to our strict 9-5, rinse and repeat. If I don't have a strict structure/freedom balance, I FREAK OUT. Not sure if this is an autistic thing, an individual thing, or a result of growing up in situations where people are always trying to either under or over contain me, and now it's a genuine need post-trauma. I actually like structure a little bit more but just barely.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm tired of being passive and broke, so I want to pull myself up by my bootstraps and go hard (Hell, I was actually thinking about doing an internship at several, several different places that offer apprenticeships, and then possibly choosing from there who I'll ultimately do an apprenticeship with. I'm not sure if this is possible though. I'm not sure if ""apprentice interns"" are a thing, and apprenticeships also scare me for the reasons I'm about to go into)... but despite wanting to bootstrap, it's also VEHEMENTLY important to me to work where it is friendly for women. I have been referencing InHerSight. I prefer it also to be very very neurodivergent friendly, but want that to take away from the professional environment either, or turn into a huge neurodivergent circle jerk. I know I'm probably just sounding like a huge jerk at this point. It's hard, because I want it to be a SUPERB environment for women, but don't want it to be a place with a bunch of raging liberal archetypes either, I would prefer an environment where almost every single person there identifies as a moderate, independent, centrist, or libertarian in some way. I know politics isn't the most work friendly topic so I know you're probably wondering, why does this matter. The answer is because, well, frankly, vibes don't lie and I don't want to feel on edge or like my nervous system is alerting me whenever I am around colleauges and a lot of fields and companies are ""known"" for having certain types of people, archetypes, and political views, a lot of those generalizations are valid in some way. I'm basically using this forum to post everything I can think of for you guys to help me find a good match, or a good way of divvying up the types of work I want to do, making them seamless, etc... therefore I know I am getting oddly specific, probably sound a bit boujee, and harping on things that seem to not matter, but I am simply giving you all I got here as to collect good advice, so that I can choose the best from what's realistic. Because again, as a basically firstgen, I don't have the best barometer on what's realistic and corporate sense. Patience please. Anyways, I worry a lot about toxic work environments, and getting trapped in one that I didn't know was toxic. Those are my biggest fear. Loads of work with underpay, sexism, passive aggressive or hostile work environment, asking for a day off or switching days and it being a problem even for the most reasonable of reasons, being duped into working doubles or triples (shifts) regularly, these are all my fears.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, I could also do some technical writing for my job and probably be happy. I do plan to blog in my own free time as well, but I DO NOTTTTT plan to ever not do this completely individually. I mean I could maybe do publications and rack up a good portfolio of those, but I'm not about to contract myself to be under certain types of censorship. My artistic integrity is VEHEMENTLY VEHEMENTLY important to me.

I'm feeling very self-conscious about my lack of jobs I've performed satisfactory at due to depression about knowing I wasn't in the right field, and about my lack of knowledge about how careers work in general, and I sound like a mess right now, and probably entitled, and probably like I don't know what I want. I do but I don't, I think I'm so much closer than usual, but this is why I'm posting here. I'm spitting out words, I just need help finishing putting them together and making them concise so that I can work on my momentum without panicking every 2 seconds about all of my efforts going in vain.

&amp;#x200B;

So, in my job, I want my main areas of focus to be:

\-UI, UX, front-end development, iOS development, product design

and my lesser areas of focus, but that I have to still DO (I wanna be like forced to do some of these things. Like non-negotiable employer forcing me lol, it just takes up a BIT less of my career than the other things I mentioned above): full stack development, probably one back end language we use more than usual, software development, software engineering (btw, is there actually a difference between software development and software engineering? Even if so, I want to be forced to do both lol. And yes, I am aware of the difference between UI and UX so no I am not just using them interchangeably), maybe technical writing

Not sure where this goes: penetration testing. Now the reason I'm not sure where this goes is because until I've done it for long enough I won't know whether I want it to be on my first hyphen or my second hyphen, which I find to be REEAALLY inconvenient.

oczchv,8,2021-07-03,Tips on finding a bioinformatics internship as a PhD student?,whiskeyriveroats,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/oczchv/tips_on_finding_a_bioinformatics_internship_as_a/,"Hi y'all - I'm a second-going-on-third year PhD student (US) in bioengineering and strongly considering a career in bioinformatics. To make a long story short, I've found that my passions have changed from my research (synthetic biology) to focus more on the computational/analytical aspects of my PhD, and I'd like to explore this further. I have a few questions:

1) Where can I look to find internships in this space? I'd like to get a sense of which companies would be hiring PhD students as interns and what skills I would need for the job. I'm on an NSF GRFP so I can apply for funding for an internship, so I'm not too worried about that. However, I will need some time to brush up on technical skills.

2) What are the basic technical skills I'll need? I work primarily in python and I'm entirely self taught, which leaves me feeling like I have a few deficiencies in this skillset. I have some work I could use as a portfolio - namely, using python to analyze NGS data including recently a large (&gt;8GB) dataset that has pushed the limits of my coding skills. Are there other languages/tools/etc that I should become familiar with?

3) Are there exercises I should do to build these skills? I've been working through Rosalind in my (limited) free time and it's been quite helpful for learning how to implement some basic algorithms. It often leaves me feeling like my code could be improved a lot though. In many cases I feel that my code could be written to be faster, leaner, and more agile, but I don't know where to start with better programming practices.

4) Any networking strategies for breaking into this space? For the bulk of my PhD we've been in COVID, so conferences have all been virtual, and only recently have started including ""networking hours"". Though things are beginning to open up, I'm looking for alternative ways to make those connections.

Apologies for dumping a ton of questions - any and all advice is appreciated whether it answers these questions or not. Thank y'all!"

od297p,2,2021-07-03,[NY] [CS/HS] - Looking for advice creating/tweaking a high school Computer Science curriculum,RChickenMan,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/od297p/ny_cshs_looking_for_advice_creatingtweaking_a/,"Greetings, real teachers! I've found myself in kind of a funny position. I'm a brand new teacher, starting my first job in the Fall, and my certification area is Math. I have, however, worked for 15 years in the software engineering industry, and therefore in addition to teaching a few sections of algebra, I will also be teaching two sections of computer science.

Here's where things get funny: I am this school's first and only computer science teacher, and my AP is letting me decide on which course I'll be teaching, how to teach it, etc. In other words, I will essentially be building this school's CS program from the ground up by myself! I don't want to spend too much time litigating whether this is a good sign or a bad sign about the school, but for me, personally, it's very exciting: I come from the startup world, so the idea of being given the autonomy to build this up from scratch is really appealing to me. But I know it'll be a lot of work on top of everything else which comes with being a new teacher.

We're participating in this program:

[https://blueprint.cs4all.nyc/curriculum/](https://blueprint.cs4all.nyc/curriculum/)

And I can basically pick any of the high school-level classes, and of course tweak the curriculum to my liking (I'm not required to teach one of these curricula out-of-the-box, so to speak, but I do need to pick one of these courses as a starting point).

My main concerns are as follows:

1. **Grade-level appropriateness** (including room for differentiation). This is kinda tricky, since we're starting from scratch: Nobody, including myself, admin, etc., has any idea what these kids will be capable of CS-wise. This is a non-screened class in a non-screened Title 1 school, for what it's worth, and we are not requiring any prerequisites or background knowledge. Also note that I am only one person, and have no intention of offering a ""sequence"": I already have two preps (Math + CS) and therefore have no intention of offering multiple levels of CS! Fortunately, CS does lend itself to differentiation, but I still want to nail down an appropriate starting point.
2. **Strong presence of CS theory and fundamentals**. This is being coded as a math class, and I therefore feel a responsibility to offer something which is truly Computer Science (data structures, algorithms, digital logic, discrete math, etc.), rather than just a web development class (plus I, personally, have no interest in web development--I'm more of a backend kind of guy!).
3. **Real-World Applications and Results-Oriented**. While I want enough CS theory and fundamentals to justify teaching this as a math class, in order to foster student engagement and enthusiasm, I want the curriculum to include some space for students building things which they can be proud of, and mesh with their preconceived notions of what one could do with a computer. This could include web development, game design, robotics, etc. (I plan on having a little ""science fair"" at the end of the year where I'll invite industry leaders and engineers to the school to ""judge,"" maybe offer internships at my ex-employer, etc.)

I'm also thinking through how much emphasis I want to put on actual coding. My concern is that if we focus too much on actual coding, we'll spend too much time ""in the weeds"" on syntax, debugging errors, etc., rather than exploring more areas of computer science in greater depth. I'm wondering, for example, what would be more valuable: Students building a very rudimentary game in Python, or students building something more complex in a ""no-code"" tool (such as Scratch)? I'm fairly certain the answer lies somewhere in between, but I'd like to calibrate my curriculum accordingly.

If you did happen to look at that list of courses, I've basically boiled it down to Exploring CS and CS Principles. They seem kind of similar, and if anything CS Principles is just a more advanced version of Exploring CS (but again, either curriculum can be tweaked and differentiated as needed!). The latter is also includes the option of taking an AP exam (not the advanced AP CS exam; it's kind of a more watered-down version), which is nice.

So CS teachers of reddit, what has worked in your classroom? What inspired students in CS? What frustrated them? How are you balancing CS theory and fundamentals with real-world applications? How are you balancing hands-on-keyboard coding with other means of exploring CS concepts?

Thank you so much for your input!"

I'd say this is mostly because our lecturers are always promoting how good it to us. 

I recently read a reddit post though that made me not so confident. It was basically explaining how just knowing GIS software like ArcGIS, or spatial methods and analysis isn't nearly as promising as it used to be about 15 years ago. I'm starting to see that even finding internships is very difficult (atleast in my country South Africa). I've got some cartography, python, sql, QGIS, spatial analysis and remote sensing experience aswell as some basic photogrammetry experience.

So I guess what I'm asking is do you think this degree will be sufficient going forward? And if you were in my position right now, what's the number one skill/field of GIS you'd focus on the most to get better job prospects after graduation?

I understand this is a pretty loaded question and I highly appreciate any feedback.

Thanks"

28, recently got my undergrad in data visualization, no internship and little bit of releveant projects

As you can imagine, job applications have been rough for me. It has become somewhat of a daily routine where I do them by nature, without expecting much results.

One particular company that I have been applying for many years is Boeing. I've applied to so many positions, from small internships to mid-level, in different department as well, and yet I got the classic ""you're profile is impressive, but we decided to not to move forward with our application"" response.

This has been happening before I completed my undergrad and after. 

As much as I hate being a deadbeat son living with his parents still and getting desperate for a job, I don't see any reason to apply to Boeing anymore. My parents are pressuring me to at least start as a low-level assembler/technician and then transfer from there, but I was rejected from those positions in the past and those jobs aren't too open the last time I checked.

I know my parents are pressuring mt because they love and concerned about me, but I feel so discouraged to apply at Boeing again. 

And it's not just Boeing; Other companies, despite me having a good background, has been repeatedly rejecting my application as well. Best Buy, J.C. Penny, Costco, Fred Meyer, etc/ Yes, they don't offer the career jobs that I want, but I don't understand why I get rejected from positions as simple as cashier or customer service.

I will continue to search for a job, but I don't see any point in applying to the companies I've mentioned. I am just going to get rejected again"

What advice do you have for aspiring Undergraduates and others who want to pursue research in Reinforcement Learning?|The standard advice is to aim for a phd. Let me add some details to that. The most important element of a phd is your advisor(s) with the school a relatively distant second. I personally had two advisors, which I enjoyed---two different perspectives to learn from and two different ways to fund conference travel :-) Nevertheless, one advisor can be fine. Aside from finding a good advisor to work with, it's very good to maximize internship possibilities by visiting various others over the summers. Reinforcement Learning is a great topic, because it teaches you the value of exploration. Aside from these things to do, the most important thing to learn in my experience is how to constructively criticize existing research work. Papers are typically not very good at listing their flaws and you can't fix things you can't see. For research, you need to cultivate an eye for the limitations, most importantly the limitations of your own work. This is somewhat contradictory, because to be a great researcher, you need to both thoroughly understand the limitations of your work and be enthusiastic about it. - John
ALOT of the papers I have read are so difficult to follow and understand. What is your strategy for reading and understanding papers?|This becomes easier with experience, but it is important to have a solid foundation. - Akshay
RL results from papers are known to be notoriously hard to reproduce. Why do you think that is, and how can we move towards results that are more feasible to reproduce?|There seem to be two issues here - An engineering solution is to export code environments with all the hyperparameters (say in a Docker image), so that someone else can grab the Docker and run the code to exactly reproduce the plots in the paper. But this is a bandaid that is covering up a more serious issue - The more serious issue is that Deep RL algorithms are notoriously unstable and non-robust (A precursor problem is that DL itself is not very robust). Naturally this has an effect on reproducibility, but it also suggests that these methods have limited real-world potential. The way to address both of these issues is to develop more robust algorithms. -Akshay
What do you believe about Stephen Hawking suggesting machine learning and AI would be the greatest threat that humanity faces?|The meaning of ""human"" is perhaps part of the debate here? There is much more that I-as-a-human can accomplish with a computer an an internet connection than I-as-a-human could do without. If our future looks more like man/machine hybrids that we choose to embrace, I don't fear it that future. On the other hand, we have not yet really seen AI-augmented warfare, which could be transformative in the same sense as nuclear or biological weapons. Real concerns here seem valid but it's a tricky topic in a multipolar world. One scenario that I worry about less is the 'skynet' situation where AI attacks humanity. As far as we can tell research-wise, AI never beats crypto. -John
&amp;#x200B;|I might be an optimist but I like to think ML/AI and technology more broadly can create great value for humanity (technology arguably already has). Of course there are concerns/challenges/dangers here, but it seems to me like climate change is a much greater threat that is looming much more ominously on the horizon. - Akshay
What are some notable lesser known applications of reinforcement learning?|Well, ""the internet"" is a little snarky, but there is some truth to it.  Much of the internet runs off targeted advertising (as opposed to blanket advertising).  It annoys me, so I use ad blockers all the time and prefer subscription based models.  Nevertheless, targeted advertising is obviously a big deal as a business model that powers much of the internet.   You should assume that any organization doing targeted advertising is doing a form of reinforcement learning.   Another category is 'nudging' applications.  How do you best encourage people to develop healthy habits around exercise for example?  There are quite a few studies suggesting that a reinforcement approach is helpful, although I'm unclear on the state of deployment. -John
How would you recommend getting started in learning to implement ML programs for someone who doesn’t want to necessarily go into research but more the functional aspect of programming it. Would a PhD still be a requirement? A masters? Or would you say experience counts just as much?|This depends a great deal on what you want to do programming-wise. If the goal is implementing things so that other people can use them (i.e. software engineering), then little background is needed as long as you can partner withone someone who understands the statistical side.
&amp;#x200B;|If the goal is creating your own algorithms, then it seems pretty essential to become familiar with the statistical side of machine learning. This could be an undergrad level course or there are many online courses available. For myself, I really enjoyed Yaser Abu-Mustafa's course as an undergrad---and this course is online now. Obviously, some mastery of the programming side is also essential, because ML often pushes the limits of hardware and embedding ML into other systems is nontrivial due to the stateful nature of learning processes. -John
How would you deal with the states that are underrepresented in the dataset (especially in offline RL)? Any strategies to emphasize learning in those states instead of just throwing them away?|I've found that memorization approaches become more useful the fewer examples you have.   Other than that, I know that many offline RL approaches simply try to learn policies that avoid unknown regions. -John
There are so many methods in RL and there is little theoretical understanding on why it works and why it doesn't. What is the best way to solve this problem? How to get a job in MSR as a masters student working on RL in robotics?|This is why we're working on the theory =) But there are a couple of issues here. If you're talking about Deep-RL, well deep supervised learning itself already has this issue to some, lesser, extent. Even in the supervised setting my sense is that there is a lot of art/intuition in getting large neural networks to work effectively. This issue is only exacerbated in the RL context, due to poor exploration, bootstrapping, and other issues.
&amp;#x200B;|On the other hand, my experience is that the non-deep-RL methods are extremely robust, but the issue is that they don't scale to large observation spaces. I have a fun story here. When this paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03765) came out, I implemented the algorithm and ran it on an extremely hard tabular exploration problem. The first time I ran it, with no tuning, it just immediately found the optimal policy. Truly incredible!
&amp;#x200B;|In my opinion the best way to solve this problem is to develop theoretically principled RL methods that can leverage deep learning capabilities. Ideally this would make it so that Deep-RL is roughly as difficult to get working as DL for supervised learning, but we're not quite there yet. So while we are cooking on the theory, my advice is to try to find ways to leverage the simpler methods as much as possible. For example, if you can hand-code a state abstraction (or a representation) using domain knowledge about your problem and then use a tabular method on top of it, this might be a more robust approach. I think something like this is happening here: https://sites.google.com/view/keypointsintothefuture/home.
&amp;#x200B;|On the job front, at MSR we rarely hire non-PhDs. So my advice would be to go for a PhD =) - Akshay
Thank you for doing this AMA! My question is around applying RL for real-world problems. As we already know, oftentimes it's difficult to build a simulator or a digital twin for most real-world processes or environments, which kind of nullifies the idea of using online RL. But this is where offline/batch RL can be helpful in terms of using large datasets collected via some process, from which a policy can be learned offline. We've already seen a lot of success in a supervised learning setting where an optimal model is learned offline from large volumes of data. Although there has been a lot of fundamental research around offline/batch RL, I have not seen much real-world applications. Could you please share some of your own experiences around this, if possible, with some use cases related to the application of batch/offline RL in the real-world? Thanks!|One of the previous answers seems very relevant here---I view real world reinforcement learning as something that exists as of 10 years ago and is routinely available today (see http://aka.ms/personalizer ). With regards to the strategy of learning in a simulator and then deploying in the real world, the bonsai project https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/autonomous-systems-project-bonsai?activetab=pivot%3aprimaryr7 is specifically focused on this. -John
The vast majority of RL papers benchmark on games or simulations. In your opinion what are the most impressive real world applications of RL? Let's exclude bandit stuff.|I really like the Loon project (https://psc-g.github.io/posts/research/rl/loon/), although Google recently discontinued the Loon effort entirely. Emma Brunskill's group has also done some cool work on using RL for curriculum planning in tutoring systems (http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/ordering/). There are also many examples in robotics, e.g., from Sergey Levine's group. The overarching theme is that these things take a lot of effort. - Akshay
Multi-agent RL seems to be a big part of the work that's being done at Microsoft and I've seen there's been a deep dive into complex games that feature multi-agent exploration or cooperation. While this is surely fascinating, it seems to me that the more complicated the environments, the more specific the solutions found by the agents are which makes it difficult to extract meaningful information about how agents cooperate in general or how they develop behaviour and its relevance in the real world. Since the behaviours really are driven heavily by what types of interactions are even allowed in the first place, how much information can we really extract from these multi-agent games that is useful in the real-world?|I think we will look back on our present state of knowledge for how to cooperate and consider it rather naive and simplistic. We obviously want generally applicable solutions and generally applicable solutions are obviously possible (see many social animals as well as humans as examples). As far as the path here, I'm not sure.  Games may be a part of the path there, because they form a much safer/easier testbed than real life.  It seems likely to me that games will not be only element on that path, because cooperation is not a simple problem easily addressed by a single approach. - John
Is anyone at MSR seriously pursuing AGI and/or RL as a path to AGI?|It depends on what you mean by 'serious'. If you mean something like ""giant models with zillions of parameters in an OpenAI style"", yes there is work going on around that, although it tends to be more product-focused.  If you mean something like ""large groups of people engage in many deep philosophical discussions every day"", not that I'm aware of.  There are certainly some discussions ongoing though.  If you mean something like ""leading the world in developing AI"", then I'd say yes and point at the personalizer service (http://aka.ms/personalizer ) which is pretty unique in the world as an interactive learning system.  My personal belief is that the right path to AI is via developing useful systems capable of addressing increasing complex classes of problems.   Microsoft is certainly in the lead for some of these systems, so I regard Microsoft as very ""serious"".  I expect you'll agree if you look past hype towards actual development paths. - John
Will it be possible to develop an artificial consciousness similar to our human consciousness in digitized structures of AI, if in particular structures of AI will digitally rebuild the artificial structures of neurons and the entire central nervous system of humans?|One of the paths towards AI that people speculate about is simply reading off a brain and then simulating it. I'm skeptical about this approach because it seems very difficult, in an engineering sense, to accurately read the brain (even in a destructive fashion) at that level of detail. The state of the art in brain reading is presently many, many orders of magnitude less information than that. -John
Does `u/thisisbillgates` ever wonder around the offices wondering what people are up to these days?|Well, both of us are in the New York City lab, so even if he were, we wouldn't see him too much. But we do have a yearly internal research conference (in non-pandemic years) that he attends and we have discussed our RL efforts and the personalizer service with him. -Akshay
There have been nice theory works recently on exploration in RL, particularly with policy gradient methods. Are these theoretical achievements ready to be turned into practical algorithms? Are there particular domains or experiments that would highlight how these achievements are impactful beyond the typical hard exploration problems, e.g., Kakade's chain and the combination lock?|There's a large spectrum in terms of how theory ideas make their way into practice, so there is some subjectivity here. On one hand, you could argue that count-based exploration (which has been integrated with Deep-RL) is already based on well-studied and principled theory ideas, like the E3 paper. I think something similar is true for the Go-Explore paper. But for keeping very close-to-the-theory, I think we are getting there. We have done some experiments with, e.g., [Homer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05815), on visual navigation type problems and seen some success. [PC-PG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08459) has been shown to work quite well in continuous control settings and navigation settings (in the paper) and I think Mikael and Wen have run some experiments on Montezuma's revenge. So we're getting there and this is something we are actively pursuing in our group.
&amp;#x200B;|As far as domains or experiments, our experience from contextual bandits suggests that better exploration improves sample efficiency in a wide range of conditions (https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04064), so I am hopeful we can see something similar in RL. As far as existing benchmarks, the obvious ones are Montezuma's revenge, Pitfall and the harder Atari games, as well as visual navigation tasks where exploration is quite critical. (For Homer and PC-PG, our group has done experiments on harder variations on the combination lock.) - Akshay
Hey guys, thank you for the contributions to the RL field, much appreciated! I'm a ML engineer and we're trying to implement Contextual Bandits (and Conditional Contextual Bandits) in our personalization pipeline using VowpalWabbit. What are your advices/recommendations for someone in my position? Also, what are the most important design choices when thinking about the final, online pipeline? Thank you!|Could you use aka.ms/personalizer? That uses VW (you can change the flags), and it has all the infrastructure necessary including dropping the logs into your account for you to play with. My experience here is that infrastructure matter *hugely*. Without infrastructure you are on a multimonth odyssey trying to build it up and fix nasty statistical bugs. With infrastructure, it's a pretty straightforward project where you can simply focus on the integration and data science. - John
It seems like RL (or, for the matter, ML) models in general could sometimes be variable and uncontrolled in performance; what are some metrics (beyond good ol' machine validation) that y'all leverage to ensure that the model's performance is ""up-to-par"" especially in high-stakes/dangerous situations like the medical field or the financial sector?|In many applications, RL should be thought of as the ""decision-maker of last resort"". For example, in a medical domain, having an RL agent prescribe treatments seems like a catastrophically bad idea, but having an RL agent choose amongst treatments prescribed by multiple doctors seems potentially more viable. Another strategy which seems important is explicitly competing with the alternative. Every alternative is fundamentally a decision-making system, and so RL approaches with guarantee competition with an arbitrary decision-making system provide an important form of robustness. - John
Thank you so much for doing this AMA! Contextual bandits are clearly of great practical value, but the efficacy and general usefulness of deep RL is still an area fraught with difficulty. What, in your opinion, are the most practically useful parts of deep RL? Do you have any examples?|There are two dimensions to think about here. One is representational complexity---is it a simple linear model or something more complex? The other is the horizon---how many actions must be taken before a reward is observed? Representational complexity alone is something that deep learning has significantly tackled, and I've seen good applications of complex representations + shallow-to-1 horizon reinforcement learning.
&amp;#x200B;|Think of this as more-complex-than-the-simplest contextual bandit solutions.  Longer time horizon problems are more difficult, but I've seen some good results with real world applications around logistics using a history-driven simulator. -John
Different research groups have very different strengths, what would you say is the forte of MSR in terms of RL research?|Microsoft has two RL strengths at present: the strongest RL foundations research group in the world and the strongest RL product/service creation strategy in the world.   There is quite a bit more going on from the research side.  I'd particularly point out some of the Xbox games RL work, which seems to be uniquely feasible at Microsoft.  There are gaps as well of course that we are working to address. -John
AI and ML are 2 different things. But to the observer, it seems basically the same thing (at least in my experience). Where do you see the difference in real life applications of AI and ML?|I think the difference between AI and ML is mostly a historical artifact of the way research developed. AI research originally developed around a more ... platonic? approach where you try to think about what intelligence means and then create those capabilities. This included things like search, planning, SOAR, logic, etc... with machine learning considered perhaps one of those approaches.
&amp;#x200B;|As time has gone on machine learning has come to be viewed as more foundational---yes these other concerns exist, but they need to be addressed in a manner consistent with machine learning.   So, the remaining distinction (if there is one) is mostly about the solution elements: is it squarely in the ""ML"" category or does it incorporate other AI elements?  Or is it old school no-ML AI? Obviously, some applications are amenable to some categories of solution more than others. - John
Can you think of any applications of bandits (contextual or not) in the Oil &amp; Gas/Manufacturing industry? I'm not thinking about recommender systems or A/B testing for websites - such companies have very few customers, which are themselves other companies. So the setting is very different with respect to a web company, for example, which has a huge crowd of individual customers. But bandits are such a beautiful framework 🙂 that I'd love to find an application for them in such a context. Any suggestions?|Almost certainly there is, although I am not super familiar with the industry (as John wrote elsewhere here, RL is a fundamental essentially universal problem of optimizing for value). One nice application of RL more generally is in optimizing manufacturing pipelines and Microsoft has some efforts in this direction.
&amp;#x200B;|I have also seen this toy experiment (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.08151.pdf section 7.3) where an RL algorithm is used to make decisions about where to drill for oil, but I'm not sure how relevant this actually is to the industry. Bandit techniques are also pretty useful in pricing problems (they share many similar elements), so maybe one can think about adjusting prices in some way based on contextual information? Here is one recent paper we did on this topic if you are interested (https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11650). -Akshay
Hi I am asking this from the perspective of an undergraduate student studying machine learning. I have worked on a robotics project using RL before but all the experimentation in that project involved pre existing algorithms. I have a bunch of related questions and I do apologise if it might be a lot to get through. I am curious about how senior researchers in ML really go about finding and defining problem statements to work on? What sort of intuition do you have when deciding to try and solve a problem using RL over other approaches? For instance I read your paper on CATS. While I understood how the algorithm worked, I would never have been able to think of such proofs before actually reading them in the paper. What led you to that particular solution? Do you have any advice for an undergraduate student to really get to grips with the mathematics involved in meaningful research that helps moves a field forward or really producing new solutions and algorithms?|* Finding problems: For me, in some cases there is a natural next step to a project. A good example here is PCID (https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09018) -&gt; Homer (https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05815). PCID made some undesirable assumptions so the natural next step was to try to eliminate those. In other cases it is about identifying gaps in the field and then iterating on the precise problem formulation. Of course this requires being aware of the state of the field. For theory research this is a back-and-forth process, you write down a problem formulation and then prove it's intractable or find a simple/boring algorithm, then you learn about what was wrong with the formulation, allowing you to write down a new one.
&amp;#x200B;|* When to use RL: My prior is you should not use """"full-blown"""" RL unless you have to and, when you do, you should leverage as much domain knowledge as you can. If you can break long-term dependencies (perhaps by reward shaping) and treat the problem like a bandit problem, that makes things much easier. If you can leverage domain knowledge to build a model or a state abstraction in advance, that helps too.
&amp;#x200B;|* CATS was a follow-up to another paper, where a lot of the basic techniques were developed (a good example of how to select a problem as the previous paper had an obvious gap of computational intractability). A bunch of the techniques are relatively well-known in the literature, so perhaps this is more about learning all of the related work. As is common, each new result builds on many many previous ideas, so having all of that knowledge really helps with developing algorithms and proofs. The particular solution is natural (a) because epsilon-greedy is simple and well understand and (b) because tree-based policies/classifier have very nice computational properties, and (c) smoothing provides a good bias-variance tradeoff for continuous action spaces.
&amp;#x200B;|* Getting involved: I would try to read everything, starting with the classical textbooks. Look at the course notes in the areas you are interested in and build up a strong mathematical foundation in statistics, probability, optimization, learning theory, information theory etc. This will enable you to quickly pick up new mathematical ideas so that you can continue to grow. -Akshay
On the note of exploration: Even if we were able to get provably correct exploration strategies from tabular learning (like r-max) to work in function approximation settings, it seems like the number of states to explore in a real-ish domain is to high to exhaustively explore. How do you think priors play into this, especially with respect to provability and guarantees? Thanks!|Two comments here: *    Inductive bias does seem quite important. This can come in many forms like a prior or architectural choices in your function approximator.
&amp;#x200B;|* A research program we are pushing involves finding/learning more compact latent spaces in which to explore. Effectively the objects the agent operates on are """"observations"""" which may be high dimensional/noisy/too-many-to-exhaustively-explore, etc., but the underlying dynamics are governed by a simpler """"latent state"""" which may be small enough to exhaustively explore. The example is a visual navigation task. While the number of images you might see is effectively infinite, there are not too many locations you can be in the environment. Such problems are provably tractable with minimal inductive bias (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05815).
&amp;#x200B;|* I also like the Go-Explore paper as a proof of concept w.r.t., state abstraction. In the hard Atari games like Montezuma's revenge and Pitful, downsampling the images yields a tractable tabular problem. This is a form of state abstraction. The point is that there are not-too-many downsampled images! -Akshay
Hello, perhaps this is a slight bit off-topic, but I was wondering what your favorite films of all time are, and if those had any bearing on your careers?|I loved Star Wars when I was growing up. It was lots of fun. I actually found reading science fiction books broadly to be more formative---you see many different possibilities for the future and learn to debate the merits of different ones. This forms some foundation for thinking about how you want to change the future. -John
What field is possibly booming for AI applications in the future?|All of them.  This might sound like snark, but consider: what field benefits from computers? - John
How do you detect &amp; prevent over-fitting in your ML models? Do you have generic tests that you apply in all cases, or do you have to develop domain specific tests?|I mostly have worked in online settings where there is a neat trick: you evaluate one example ahead of where you train. This average evaluation (""Progressive validation"") deviates like a test set while still allowing you to benefit from it for learning purposes. In terms of tracking exactly what the performance of a model is, we typically use confidence intervals which are domain-independent.

How close are we to having home robots that can function almost as well as a human companion? Like just having someone/thing to talk to that could sustain a natural conversation.|Quite far in my view. The existing systems that we have (like GPT3) are sort of intelligent babblers. To have a conversation with someone, there really needs to be a persistent state / point of view with online learning and typically some grounding in the real world. There are many directions of research here which need to come to fruition. -John

Ok, I'll bite: What is ""Responsible reinforcement learning""? What is ""Strategic exploration""? Are you using Linux? :))))|&amp;#x200B;From last to first: I (Akshay) use OS X and I think John uses Linux with a windows VM. Strategic exploration was this name we cooked up to mean roughly """"provably sample efficient exploration."""" We wanted to differentiate from the empirical work on exploration which sometimes is motivated by the foundations, but typically does not come with theoretical guarantees. Strategic is supposed evoke the notion that the agent is very deliberate about trying to acquire new information. This is intended to contrast with more myopic approaches like Boltzman exploration or epsilon-greedy. One concern with the adjective is that strategic often means game-theoretic in the CS literature, which it does not in this context.
&amp;#x200B;|Responsible reinforcement learning is about integrating principles of fairness accountability transparency and ethics (FATE) into our RL algorithms. This is of utmost importance when RL is deployed in scenarios that impact people and society, which I would argue is a very common case. We want to ensure that our decision making algorithms do not further systemic injustices, inequities, and biases. This is a highly complex problem and definitely not something I (Akshay) am an expert in, so I typically look to my colleagues in the FATE group in our lab for guidance on these issues. -Akshay
""How do you view the marginal costs and tradeoffs incurred by specifying and implementing 1) more complicated reward functions/agents and 2) more complicated environments? Naturally it depends on the application, but in your experience have you found a useful abstraction when making this determination conditioned on the application?""|I'm somewhat hardcore in that it's hard for me personally to be interested in artificial environments, so I basically never spend time implementing them. When something needs to be done for a paper, either taking existing environments or some mild adaptation of existing datasets/environments (with a preference for real-world complexity) are my go-to approaches. This also applies to rewards---I want reward feedback to representative of a real problem.
&amp;#x200B;|This hardcore RL approach means that often we aren't creating slick-but-fragile demos. Instead, we are working to advance the frontier of consistently solvable problems. W.r.t. agents themselves, I prefer approaches which I can ground foundationally. Sometimes this means 'simple' and sometimes 'complex'. At a representational level, there is quite a bit of evidence that a graduated complexity approach (where complexity grows with the amount of data) is helpful. - John
Recently, there have been a few publications that try to apply Deep RL to computer networking management. Do you think this is a promising domain for RL applications? What are the biggest challenges that will need to be tackled before similar approaches can be used in the real world?|One of the things I find fascinating is the study of the human immune system.  Is network security going to converge on something like the human immune system?  If so, we'll see quite a bit of adaptive reinforcement-like learning (yes, the immune system learns). In another vein, choosing supply for demand is endemic to computer operating systems and easily understood as a reinforcement learning problem. Will reinforcement learning approaches exceed the capabilities of existing hand-crafted heuristics here? Plausibly yes, but I'd expect that to happen first in situations where the computational cost of RL need not be taken into account. -John
How much of the research done on bandit problems is useful in practice? Every year there are a lot of papers published on this topic with small variations to existing settings. Seb Bubeck wrote in a blog post that at some point he thought there was not much left to do in bandits, however new ideas keep arising. What do you see as future direction that could be relevant in practice? What do you think about the model selection problem in contextual bandits|Thanks for the question! * Things can be useful for at least two reasons. One is that it can introduce new ideas to the field even if the algorithm is not directly useful in practice. The other is that the algorithm or the ideas are directly useful in practice. Obviously I cannot comment on every paper, but there are definitely still some new ideas appearing in the bandit literature and I do think understanding the bandit version of a problem is an important pre-requisite for addressing the RL problem. There is also definitely some incremental work, but this seems true for many fields. I am sympathetic though, since it is very hard to predict what research will be valuable in advance.
&amp;#x200B;|\* Well, I love the model selection problem and I think it is *super* important. It's a tragedy that we do not know how to do cross validation for contextual bandits. (Note that cross validation is perhaps the most universal idea in supervised learning, arguably more so than GD/SGD.) And many real problems we face with deployments are model selection problems in disguise. So I definitely think this is relevant to practice and would be thrilled to see a solution. -Akshay
Is reinforcement learning suited to only certain types of problems or could it be used for computer vision or natural language processing? I have used RL as part of the Unity ML agents package which makes it easy to make game AI with using RL but haven't seen many other use cases.|I think of RL as a way to get information for the purpose of learning.   Thus, it's not associated any particular domain (like vision), and is potentially applicable in virtually all domains. W.r.t. vision and language in particular, there is a growing body of work around 'instruction following' where agents learn to use all of these modalities together to accomplish a task, often with RL elements. -John
What steps are you taking to prevent human biases from affecting your algorithms, to test whether they have, and to mitigate any biases you find developing? What advice would you give others on how to account for biases?|One obvious answer is ""research"".  See for example this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02453 which helped shift the concept of fair learning from per-algorithm papers to categories.  I regard this as *far* from solved though.   As machine learning (and reinforcement learning) become more important in the world, we simply need to spend more effort addressing these issues. -John
How will the advent of quantum computing affect the way we do ML &amp; AI?|I expect relatively little impact from quantum computing. Some learning problems may become more tractable with perhaps a few becoming radically more tractable. -John
Hello, during my last semester at college I did some research and implementation of an AI that used Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning to become a better bot at a shooting game (unreal tournament 2004) by practicing against other bots. I haven't followed the more recent updates in this topic (last 5 years), I remember this approach of RL to be promising due to its capabilities of making the environment (combination of states ) Hierarchical and reducing computation time. Has HRL become a thing or was it forgotten in it's original paper? Also do you have openings in your area for a software developer?|HRL is still around. Our group had a paper on it recently (https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00590), but I think Doina Precup's group has been pushing on this steadily since the original paper. I haven't been tracking this sub-area recently but one concern I had with the earleir work was that in most setups the hierarchical structure needed to be specified to the agent in advance. At least the older methods therefore require quite a lot of domain expertise, which is somewhat limiting.

I have a few questions: What are you biggest fears in relation to ML or AI? Where do you see the world heading in this field? How dependent are we currently on ML and how dependent will we be in the next 10 to 15 years? What is the coolest AI movie?|One of my concerns about ML is personal---there are some big companies that employ a substantial fraction of researchers. If something goes wrong at one of those companies, suddenly many of my friends could be in a difficult situation. Another concern is more societal: ML is powerful and so just like any powerful tool there are ways to use it well and vice-versa. How do we guide towards using it well? That's a question that we'll be asking and partially answering over and over because I see the world heading towards pervasive use of ML. In terms of dependence, my expectation is that it's more a question of dependence on computers than ML per se, with computers being the channel via which ML is delivered. -John
^(the below has been split into two)|&amp;#x200B;
[1] I implemented RL for pacman and it was pretty fun! Just curious, why are researchers interesting in gaming RL?|Nice! I did the same thing in my undergrad AI course, definitely very fun =) Gaming is a huge business for Microsoft and gaming is also one of the main places where (general) RL has been shown to be quite successful, so it is natural to think about how RL can be applied to improve the business.
[2] Are there any papers you'd recommend that cover recent efforts to make RL more explainable?|If by explainable you mean that the agent makes decisions in some interpretable way, I don't know too much, but maybe this paper is a good place to start (https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03478). If by explainable you mean accessible to you to understand the state of the field, I'd recommend this monograph (https://rltheorybook.github.io/) and checking out the tutorials in the ML conferences. -Akshay
How is ML/AI improving Microsoft product? Is it applied outside of Microsoft and benefiting the society as a whole? Thank you|There isn't a simple answer here, but to a close approximation I think you should imagine that ML is improving every product, or that there are plans / investigations around doing so.   Microsoft's mission is to empower everyone so ""yes"" with respect to society as a whole? Obviously people tend to benefit more directly when interacting with the company, not even that is necessary.  For example, Microsoft has supported public research across all of computer science for decades. -John
Can you describe the sorts of problems one could expect to solve/work on if they worked in Data Science at MS?|""All problems"" is the simple answer in my experience. Microsoft is transforming into a data-driven company which seeks to improve everything systematically.  The use of machine learning is now pervasive.
How do you deal with a machine learning task for which the data is not available or hard to get per se?|The practical answer is that I avoid it unless the effort of getting the data is worth the difficulty.

Hello everyone.

I am an international student who is going to study MS Computer Science in the US. I got a few admits for fall 2021 and this whole rollercoaster ride from applying to grads schools to getting admit/rejects is nothing but full of ups and downs. This pandemic really drained me physically and mentally, from re-applying again for fall 2021(I had admits in fall 2020 but couldn't visit US due to covid) alongside a full time job to getting covid itself to constantly checking US visa website for a slot amidst the slot shortage, it's been hell of a ride. Although, I am preparing in terms of visa, flights, apartments etc in order to join for fall 2021, I feel I am lacking on the academic side as I am switching from a non CS field. I thought things will be okay and I will get a few months before joining my university to study since I have lost touch and have been working a full time job for the past 4 years. But things didn't go accordingly and I feel like I should defer to spring 2022, take a few months off and study courses of interest and also prepare for interviews so I don't face difficulty at the university as I will be taking a whole lot of graduate courses. Luckily, my university is offering me an option to defer to defer to spring 2022 as well. But is going in spring a good option? The fear of covid coming back and stumbling the visa process is boggling my mind. Moreover, I will be joining in spring 2022 so I won't.be eligible for summer internships and I was looking forward to it as my program is unfunded although there are opportunities for TA/RA but still you have to be very proactive and lucky at the same time. Also, I have heard joining in spring is bad as I will be lagging behind those who joined in fall and may not be considered for TA/RA. Also, fall semester is better as the core and foundational courses are mostly offered in fall. For spring, the course selection is not good most of the times. Is defering to spring a good option?


Kindly share your opinions. My visa appointment is very close and I need to decide as soon as possible.

So here's a brief look at my profile -

**Undergrad** \- BTech, Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, top 10 engineering school in India (a non-IIT, *i.e.* NIT, though)

**CGPA**: 9.38/10 (3rd within my class)

**Internships**: 3, out of which 1 is international (France) - all research-oriented. Contributing to ongoing projects and learning some computational techniques. (No publications, though.)

**LORs:** Internship guide (1 international and 1 from India), final-year thesis to-be-guide (1), faculty advisor/mentor under whose guidance I've co-headed a Material Advantage professional chapter within the college. They're all fairly strong (with aspects of my candidacy substantiated with specific incidents/events).

**GRE:** Haven't taken yet, but practice test scores are \~164V/165Q. Targeting higher.

**TOEFL:** Yet to write or take any practice tests, but I'm hoping this will not be a limiting factor as long as I meet the minimum score.

**Other relevant information:**

* My main interests lie in battery materials and their discovery through computational materials science - DFT, molecular dynamics, the likes. I have a clear progression in terms of how I got exposed to and interested in this domain, and this should reflect in my SOP.
* I'm leaning towards Europe or Canada simply because of the cost aspect, but there are some wonderful professors/programs that I would love to target in the US as well. I'd like to choose the best-fit programs in the US to use my resources efficiently.
* Ultimate aim is to get a PhD.

Here are some of the unis I've been looking into. I'd like to know if I'm in over my head (especially given the lack of publications, lack of experimental exposure due to COVID) -

***In the US (all MS in MatSci/MSE):*** UT Austin, UCSD, UC Berkeley, CMU, GATech, UMich, TAMU

***In Europe:*** Erasmus Mundus (MESC+), DTU Denmark, TU Delft, EPFL, KIT, Uppsala University

***In Canada:*** UWaterloo, UofT

Given how long and complicated this process is, I'd really like to plan out the most realistic options and ensure I'm choosing the best possible programs for me.

I'd really, really appreciate it if I could get some help in figuring out at least the ballpark of where these unis lie in comparison to my current profile. And also maybe suggest things I might have overlooked.

Please help this panic-stricken wreck terrified of the endless possibilities. Thanks!"

ECs: All sorts of finance ECs (clubs, internships, competitions) but notable are: RA for a finance professor, 1st place in my schools stock pitch competition, VP of investing club, top-tier investment banking internship offer for next summer. Have been working on an online education platform to help small business owners in developing countries. I’m pretty optimistic about it, so hopefully it gets some traction. I speak a couple of Southeast Asian languages and am learning more. Also, I’m pretty good at weightlifting (had the state record for my weight class in high school)

Interesting stuff: I’ve always been super interested in investing, ever since I was 14 and my parents opened me a brokerage account so I could buy my first stock. After high school I lived in the Philippines for 2 years as a religious volunteer, where I realized finance might actually be something I could use to help lift people out of poverty. My essay will mostly talk about my passion for impact investing in emerging markets. Would love to work at a place like the World Bank or Bain Impact out of school.

Specific questions I have: 

Are my ECs too focused?

What schools should I target? Can’t transfer to Wharton but what about Cornell Dyson, Columbia, UPenn CAS or Chicago?

What are my chances at said schools?

What can I do from now until March to be more competitive?

I'm planning to study further at TUM, however, my German is not at the level I would be comfortable studying, therefore I will take a year off to improve it. Meanwhile, I would like to work in the industry to get my first working experience. Therefore, should I try landing a junior position or should I focus more on internships? Is there anyone who has gone the same path?

I'm looking forward to hearing from you. And in advance, I'm thanking for all your responses and advice.

Best regards

I just wanted to know if making personal projects are necessary? I thought it was about getting a CS degree and landing some internships and then a job. I also wanted to know that personal projects are just things you built on the side? So it’s not things you built for companies you interned or worked for?

I have got a job offer but I have doubts regarding the background check. I have 2.10 YOE, and in resume I mentioned regarding work done in current mnc company and also work done for college project with startup.

Here issue is with the role I mentioned for work done with the startup during college. I mentioned role as Software engineer intern, I was confused for the role as the work I did was a college project and people from startup helped a lot and also built a working prototype. 

In the end, I got completion letter from startup which were addressed to my college H.O.D.

Currently, I only have that letter copy with myself. 
Also this job requires someone with 3+ YOE and I counted both work to apply for this position.

I am worried about the job offer that I got. I need some suggestions on what should I be doing to clarify this."

When I told them about the offer, they became quiet and weren't really happy for me. They started telling me, why do you want to move so far away from us, do you hate us, what's going to happen to us when you're gone to who's going to take care of us, and basically talking shit about the job. Everything they said just made me feel guilty and made me really doubt my choices. It made me feel like every choice I'm making regarding my future is wrong. After few days of thinking and mostly being guilt tripped, I declined the offer and decided to take on an internship in my hometown. However, its been about a month since I started the internship and I'm starting to dislike it. I feel like it isn't something I want to do and if I had taken the job from out of state, maybe I would have been happier. I know that it's too late now to ask if the job is still open, but there's just always that feeling of what if I took that opportunity, would I be in a happier position than I am now? 

I guess I just don't know what to do right now. I still have a few months before being considered for a full time position and I don't think I want to stay at home or in my hometown. It just feels like I'm in a box that I can't get out, and no matter how much I try, I'm always going to be put down. I want to be able to leave with a somewhat good relationship with my parents and the rest of my family, but I don't know if they'll ever understand why I want this for myself. 

Does anyone have similar stories of wanting to leave and was successful in doing so without feeling the guilt? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

I know that VIT has a bad reputation due to its strict rules- hostel in time, etc. But I'll be a day scholar and I want to know which is better from a purely academic perspective ( research opportunities, internships, etc)

I spoke to a lot of seniors and this is their opinion:

**VIT:**

**cons:**

\- overcrowded

\- the category system

\- strict rules (this isn't relevant for me)

**pros:**

\- FFCS (I get to do many electives and can use the 4th year to do other stuff if I'm done with my credits)

\- has a good brand name abroad (This is important for me, since I'm planning to do my masters abroad)

**SSN:**

**pros:**

\- less intake

**cons:**

\- Affiliated to Anna University: Couple of my seniors said that their curriculum isn't updated and this causes a lot of hindrances during internships and placements.

my\_qualifications: just finished class 12 cbse  (PCM)

PS: A bit more about myself: I took CS in 11th and 12th, and I absolutely love the subject! So no matter where I go, I'll be coding on the side. (Planning on taking up OSSU or teachyourselfcs)

I just want to know where I'll get the most number of opportunities.

Any opinions on this are appreciated.

I have been a JavaScript developer for about 4 years now, and have gathered experience with frameworks such as React and React Native. 

I'm also currently enrolled in a BTECH in Software Engineering, and the school is sending us out on a mandatory two months internship to experience the ""professional world"".

I reached out to a company I'm really interested in, and after examining my CV they said they will give me the role. The only drawback was that they use Flutter with Dart instead of React Native, and I will be required to learn how to, and code in Dart.

I understand the importance of learning new technologies, but for just a two months internship I don't know if it is a good idea. 

Who else has faced such a situation? What did you do, and did you later regret your decision?"

This intern has around 7 years of educational experience with programming. Every time he commits something, he refuses to do any testing and asks me to do it for him instead. When I did the tests, sometimes basic functionalities did not even work, an error page is generated right away and other times, there’s a million other edge cases. And when he refactors my code, he assumes that it’s working, and just pushes without checking it and I ended up taking the blame for it. 

One time, I told him “hey, the coupons are not working as intended when using this particular code.” He then went to code, and 5 minutes later, he says “okay, done, pushed” i went to check, the exact same problem remains, and he would often time ask me “are you sure you’ve pulled.” Or “can you test it again”. Then I had to repeat this same process 4-5 times, whereby he says “okay done pushed” and then it still doesn’t work before we finally fix the issue.

I’m quite mad about it, but I’m thinking if perhaps this might be the norm for senior or more experienced devs to just code and then pass the user testing to the junior/beginner devs."

* Find a summer internship abroad (2022)
* Find the last internship also abroad (spring 2023)

I would like to know if I would do my computer science minor in the spring of 2022 if that will give me any advantage like finding a summer internship in the US so that I have extra experience in comparison with the fall of 2022 where I have to search for a spring internship of 2023.

oe7u96,50,2021-07-05,Bad internship experience,fallenyangel,nus,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/oe7u96/bad_internship_experience/,"Hi guys! Im a Y1 law student currently interning at a small firm. However, so far I've been having an absolutely terrible time at the firm. The workers there scream at the interns for every little thing (not knowing how to use the printer even though no one has taught us before, scolding us for asking them how to do everything). They then excuse themselves by saying that it's because they are too busy to help the interns. Note that the things we've asked about so far are things that have never been taught to us before.

Acc to all the interns, they have not discussed what our allowance is, nor have we signed any sort of agreement etc. Yet, they expect us to work weekends and stay late. This is despite the fact that we are only supposed to work weekdays 9-6 pm. The worst thing about this was how it was phrased . During my first day, I was told by one of the workers that while she was not going to stop me from leaving early, I should be ""responsible"" and stay late. This was basically exactly what she said to me, and in the most condescending tone ever. Because of this, I'm scared to leave work on time

Honestly, working here, even for such a short time, has given me actual nightmares, insomnia and has made my anxiety come back. My parents advised me to just give up on the internship. There has been so many incidents that I was unable to mention in this post so this really is the tip of the iceberg. 

I would like to ask for advice, is being treated like this normal? Should I stay on for one more month? If I do quit, will there be any repercussions?

Here is the seventy-first installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

I’ve noticed that when we pull user equipment for repair or replacement, we tend to just throw it into a messy pile in our equipment room and the SysAdmins will say “we need to contact the manufacturer to see if that’s still under warranty” and then just walk away from it..  There’s laptops sitting there that were pulled on my first day two weeks ago and haven’t been touched since.  I’ve asked the SysAdmins if the manufacturer has been contacted yet and they said “no, we’re going to need to do that though,” and when I ask if I can contact the manufacturer to go ahead and get that completed, I’m told that they usually do it since they know all the info to give them.

So what we have now is a pretty big pile of stuff sitting all mixed together with no notes on anything, and the SysAdmins insist they know what needs to be done on everything on the pile...  but yet nothing has been done. Is this something I shouldn’t get involved in since I’m just an intern or should I reach out to my manager and see if I can help get a more formal process created for documenting what each piece of equipment needs and it’s status?  I want to contribute more than just what the internship expects but don’t want to potentially annoy my manager and the SysAdmins I work with by undermining them.

""I can't believe it,"" I complained. ""I can't fucking believe it-""

""Language!"" Uncle Lyle snapped.

Mom and I gave him a thunderous look. Avi just laughed.

""A,"" I continued, ""how did you capture one? And B, how are we not dead?"" I stood there in the basement, watching the Purple alien swing gently from the ceiling. When Mom got home, she had hung her upside down from a meathook Avi lent her, and wrapped her in plastic from Avi's butcher shop.

The result was perverse.

""And C, if we get raided I had nothing to do with it, ok?:

""Whatever."" Mom slapped the alien awake. ""Mind taking Jason upstairs?""

""Yeah sure. Hey Jason. Ever play Minecraft?"" I was just relieved to not be involved in this.

""What's Minecraft?"" The kid was busy staring at the Shil'vati hanging up in our basement.

""Come on. We gotta go grab my laptop and I'll show you."" The laptop in question was my old computer I used in high school that had, miraculously, not committed Hara-Kiri yet.

""No videogames, please,"" Lyle added as we made for the door.

This time the look Mom and I gave him could have curdled milk.

""Fine. Fine. Whatever.""

And with that, Jason and I were gone. He followed me up as I went and got my laptop, setting up in the kitchen. As I got started and showed him the basic stuff, I noticed something.

Jason wasn't staring at the game. He was doing that thing where he stared blatantly at my scars while kinda trying not to be caught staring.

""Hey, uh…""

My little cousin quickly averted his eyes. 

""It's alright,"" I said. ""I got hurt a few months ago. Sorry if it's scaring you."" I slid the mouse and laptop towards him. 

""It's alright."" Jason tried building a house. ""They look cool.""

That wasn't what I was expecting. I was just glad I wasn't scaring him.

""Wanna see something else?"" I clacked my teeth together.

""Woah!""

**Barbara waited till the kids were gone, then counted to ten and gave her prisoner another wakeup slap.**

""Where am I?"" The alien moaned.

""Somewhere,"" Barb said. ""And we have so much fun in store!"" She gave Mr. Avi *the look* and he reached down and started laying his tools from the butcher shop on the table. The alien looked terrified at all the knives and saws the man laid out. If she could have, she would have jumped at the scha-WINGG some of those butcher knives made.

""But first…"" Barbara shot up her prisoner with a diabetes needle she'd purchased. The alien made a little ""eep"" as Barb injected it. ""You have been injected with a compound known as GHB. It is designed to enforce compliance. Truth serum."" Ok. That wasn't how GHB worked at all, but the aliens probably had different names for it, so the lie still worked. Second, it wasn't even GHB. She'd shot the alien up with saline solution after boiling the needle for hours. No need to kill the client.

""Second, it is an amnesiac. You will not remember this session."" Far as real GHB was concerned, that was true, though admittedly GHB was only a mild one. 

And that was Avi's cue. He spoke into a tape recorder. ""Beginning session… thirty.""

Barb could see the confusion and horror in the alien's eyes. How long had it been here? What had it already told Barbara and company?

""You can understand us, can't you?"" Stupid question. It'd been begging them in fluent - if accented - English the whole ride home before Avi knocked it out with a knock to the noggin. Still. It helped to establish a dialogue.

The client nodded frantically.

""Good.""

Barbara looked over to Lyle, then back at the client. ""Who kidnapped my baby brother? My nephew?""

The alien looked around frantically. ""I- I- I- I-""

Barbara sighed. ""You didn't hear any rumors? No… accidentally hearing someone talk? No… coming across a few files that got put in the wrong place?""

Avi sighed. ""Well… in ancient times, people would eat the brains of prisoners to gain their knowledge,"" he lied. The alien's eyes slowly widened as he picked up a butcher saw. ""A barbaric practice,"" he added, slowly inching the saw towards the client's head. ""But an effective one."" The saw got closer and closer.

""Wait!"" The alien yelled. ""Don't eat my brain! Come on! We can figure this out! Don't eat my brain!"" She cocked her head back, trying to get it away. ""Don't eat my brain! Fuck! I'll talk! Come on! I'll talk! IlltalkIlltalkIlltalk!""

""I think she's had enough,"" Barbara said, turning off the saw, barely an inch from her skull. She had a new idea. ""Who were those girls protecting you?""

""My *llologaxe*- uh, um, security professionals. They weren't my usual ones. Mom had them pull off a squad to protect me - *please take those knives away* - but they got called away for some special assignment, and I got Khrova and Irinia instead.""

""Rich girl?"" A squad taken for a special job… didn't take a genius to put two and two together. ""Who were the old crew?""

""Miss - I really don't want anyone to get hurt -""

""A lot more people - namely yourself - are gonna be hurt if you don't talk,"" Avi growled. He whirred the saw a few times.

""Okay, okay, fine. They called themselves Head Splitter.""

Once the girl was done talking, Barbara followed Avi into the other room. The old butcher turned up the furnace till he was sure nobody could hear him.

""Barbara, we need to talk.""

""Of course."" Barbara knew exactly what this was about. ""Favors for favors. You helped me out, it's only fair I help you.""

Avi nodded. ""You know about my big operation in the works. I need you to get people involved. Guns, too. Weapons. Replace what you used.""

Barbara nodded, lighting a cigarette off the rapidly heating furnace. ""That's a tall order."" She took a drag. ""I'll see what I can do.""

""I knew I could count on you."" Avi nodded.

**Jason and I were clearing out the side of a mountain to build another house** for our city when Mom came back upstairs. To clarify, he was, I was watching.

""How goes the cold-blooded torture?"" I kept watching Jason. 

""Wow, keep it down, would you?"" Mom went to the fridge and got a case of beer. She passed me one.

""He can't hear us."" I tapped the headphones on Jason's head.

""Good. Lyle would have both our heads if Jason heard that. Now, you still know that hacker kid?"" Mom took a drink.

""You mean the one I knew in high school?"" Mom was referring to a friend of mine from High School. He was some crazy computer geek who'd help people with things in exchange for Red Bull.

""Is that a problem?""

""I don't even know if he's still around… or alive."" I opened my beer and took a drink. ""I mean, last I heard of him he'd been arrested for identity theft.""

""Can't hurt to take a look, can it?""

""Guess not."" I drained my beer.

""Mind feeding our guest before you go?"" Mom fished in the fridge for some chopped liver. Passover was coming, figured she must've cooked it for the seder.

""Sure."" I took the bowl and went back downstairs. The girl must've heard me come down; she tried to turn to look at me.

""I told you, I don't know anything else,"" she moaned in accented English. The girl sounded German, almost. Or Russian. I couldn't place it exactly. But she sounded like she'd been crying.

""Relax."" I put down the bowl and got a spoon. ""Food.""

""Oh, thank the Empress! I was worried I was gonna die down here. They already tried to eat my brain-""

""Wait what?"" I took a fork and scooped out some of the liver. ""Open.""

She opened her mouth and accepted the meaty paste.

""Damn- thaf really goof- what iv it?"" She chewed and swallowed. 

""Chopped liver."" I got the next bite ready.

""I'm gonna have to see about getting some of these *Chopt* animals sent back to Shil…""

""Nono, it's chicken livers, chopped into paste."" Damn, what was I doing? I was Tom the Alien Slayer, and yet… 

""Ohhhhh."" She opened up for the next bite. 

""You know, you're a lot nicer than the other Interior agents I've run into."" I slid the fork in.

""I'm not an agent. Maybe that's why,"" she said once she swallowed. ""Mom sent me here to learn how to be one. It was like… what's a job you don't get paid for, but it gives educational experience?""

""An internship? ROTC?""

""Yeah, that. Like… I don't even want to join the Interior. But like… Mom got it in her head that being a teacher wasn't a good calling for a D'Saari, which sucks because, like, I'm not even gonna inherit anything, so why should it matter?""

""Yeah, that blows."" I didn't claim to know anything about how the Shil'vati nobility worked, aside from them being assholes. Wait… ""Did you say you wanted to be a teacher?""

""Yeah! Small children.""

""No kidding? I wanted to do the same thing. Was actually gonna start student teaching, but then, well…""

She knew exactly what I meant. ""Yeah… I know how that feels. I'm sorry.""

""Wasn't really your fault. I guess… well, you didn't personally invade my planet, did you?"" I didn't know what I was feeling. These last few years, the Shil'vati had all just been the masked soldiers who made my life very difficult. I guess they were like people. Some were awful, some were great.

""You know, hearing you wanted to be a teacher? Didn't surprise me one bit,"" the prisoner said after I gave her another bite. ""I saw how gentle you were bringing that boy upstairs. He yours?""

""Nah."" I shook my head. ""Cousin."" Should I have been telling her this?

**Data Officer Borzun sat in her office,** staring at her screens and equipment. She sifted through data upon data. She had access to all the communications channels from across the planet. Here was a dispatch about a viral disease in the China region that had been eradicated. There was something about fighting in one place or another.

The Human internet was a frightening thing. In some ways it behaved more like a living creature, albeit one made mostly of porn. That being said, it was easy to jack her equipment into it. One of the first things she'd done was set up a monitoring system. Certain terms were flagged- names of high-value individuals, anything relating to the Interior or Shil'vati operations on earth, things related to Shil'vati military capabilities. Any time a flagged term was mentioned, the system would look into it. Most of the time it was just nerds discussing tactics from the safety of their armchairs, or somebody discussing the news. Anything that didn't check out was kicked directly up to the data officers to appraise.

This one was a doozy. Somebody in Warfield, Maryland had literally entered a string of terms into a computer. ""Head Splitter. Interior. Warfield Chainsaw Massacre. Uncle Bill. Tapporata."" Borzun was fairly certain the Head Splitter in this case was not the EDM artist.

Borzun got on the line to Director Rishi in Maryland. ""Hey boss?""

""Data Officer Borzun?"" Rishi looked tired, like she'd just woken up. 

""We have a possible security breach in Maryland."" She sent Rishi the file. 

""Is this the whole thing?"" Rishi yawned. 

""That's it. String of words. I suggest taking Head Splitter and moving them to a secure location. Preferably not a Shil'vati-run location; if Warfield was anything to go by they'll attack those first."" Fuck yeah, Intercept, ascertain, advise! ""Whatever started at Warfield? I think it's still going on.""

""Mhm…""

""It's an obvious trap, too. Keep radio traffic to a minimum, use couriers whenever possible.""

Work up my It knowledge through studying these certs in order and then go try for an internship or some entry level IT role:
Comptia ITF+, A+, Network+, Security+, CySA+, CASP+, CISA, CISSP. (now I may not necessarily take all the basic level cert exams but I was thinking about studying it all, to have a decent amount of IT knowledge to start an IT career)

What do you guys think about this, any tips on other certs I should consider and on how and when to start job hunting?

oeh88s,4,2021-07-05,Is my internship experiences indicative of how a Dev job is?,MConanE,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/oeh88s/is_my_internship_experiences_indicative_of_how_a/,"LONG POST ALERT

Background: I am a very bad CS student, I didn't started learning coding until I got into my forth semester. So, I was stoked when I got selected for this unpaid internship in the end of my sixth semester.

First day: On my first day, we (me along with other interns) had a meeting in which we were instructed that for the first five days we would be given some challenge questions and on the sixth day we would have a technical test and that test would determine our tasks. I was super afraid of the technical test because I suck at LeetCode question and even asked Reddit communities for help and got good resources to prepare for it.

Technical test day: We were called for a meeting and we all were instructed that we got evaluated on the basis of the challenge question submission and the test would not take place (jebaited, I guess) and then we were divided into group. I got put into a group in which our mentor instructed us that we would be going to work on a live project and that we would be instructed and taught Spring Boot so that we could create a Web API in Spring Boot.

After a week: A week passed by and we were given no instruction no meetings held, like we all were ghosted  and one day out of the blues we were told to go through a different framework, Dropwizard, documentation and learn about Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection in a day. Next day during the meeting people were literally **shouted on and kicked out** of the Google Meet for not answering question about the topics and then we, well the one who were left in the meeting, were told to create a sample API using Dropwizard in a day again.

A week goes by again: We were ghosted again and after a week we were just handed over git repos for the API project that was already completely developed in Dropwizard and we were tasked to migrate those APIs to Spring Boot, we were never instructed to learn Spring Boot to an extend that we could simply migrate a production level API. I tried to understand the Dropwizard code and quickly realized that I am not able to understand anything, it used many Java dependencies that I was not familiar with, I asked for a documentation for the API so that I could understand what function did the API served, turn out that didn't **existed** and we would have to literally guess what function did the API served and then code the same logic in Spring Boot. I was struggling a lot with the project and thought that I wasn't made to be a Dev. Completely demotivated I asked many question regarding the code in the group chat for several days, but didn't got any reply instead a message came to the group chat that in 2 days we would have a meeting to evaluate our progress. In desperation I PMed the mentor to help me with the code and even send him some code snippets to guide me if I am doing things correctly. I got no replies.

The Meeting day: The meeting got pushed from 9 AM to 1 PM then to 5PM then to 7PM and at last to 10:30 PM. Our mentors got through the reviews of all the female interns present in the meeting first, I don't know why maybe because it was late in the night, he was raising his voice a lot and sounded very mad and angry, turns out the I was not the only one struggling with the project, all the girls got called out for not asking questions when they got stuck, maybe because I started asking question and didn't got any reply for my 7 question in the public group chat they thought it was a lost cause, after that all the girls were asked to leave the meeting and then the mentor came for **THE BOYS**, my turn was first and I got absolutely obliterated, it was like a scene from a drama show, I didn't got any chance to explain my side, mentor was not holding his voice level anymore, it was like he was squaring up IRL for a fight over the Google Meet. I was asked to leave and not waste other people's time with question because in ""**Corporate**"" setting nobody is **spoon fed**, but I was asking for documentation and help so that I don't screw up the live project. I didn't knew what I need to do to ask question and get answers. After the meeting I was so blown away.

I struggled with completing my task. I also thought about quitting the internship, but I couldn't as in my head this was god given opportunity to a kid who has wasted two years of Uni and still somehow got an internship after a year. So I didn't quit struggled for two to three days more afraid of asking questions and then I asked my mentor to take me off the project and put me in one of the other group as  I heard that group had a very cool mentor. He complied with my request and then puts me in a different group were interns get no meeting no projects no instruction, it felt like they were just passing days for past 2 and half weeks. The internship ended with me in the no project, no experience group and I still haven't got my internship completion certificate.

Am I not cut to be in the Dev industry? Is this how the ""Corporate"" culture is like? Or I just had a very bad experience?"

I'm a mechanical engineering student and I graduate next semester (Fall 2021) with my B.S degree.  I want to go into renewable energy or aerospace. I worked really hard in trying to score an internship for this summer but unfortunately wasn't able to get one. To make up for this, I still really wanted to utilize this summer for engineering related projects so that I can still gain experience, and so up until now, I've been working on a gocart, a universal gearbox and a mechanical clock.

I started working on them a few weeks ago and I'd say I'm about 25% done with the gocart, 75% done with the gearbox and 10% done with the clock. I chose these projects because they seemed challenging to me at the time and I just wanted to show employers that I still did something during the summer. These are things that I really enjoy working on, but they're also not really related to the industries I want to go into and I'm not sure if employers will really care unless it's a project that was done under an internship or some sort of oversight. I'm also actively applying to any co-op positions I find for the fall semester.

I also realize that having an FE certification may be really helpful when it comes to applying for jobs for the first time. However, I'm not sure if FE certifications are sought out in the renewable energy or aerospace industries.

I guess I'm just really worried and feeling super lost right now. I don't know how I should utilize my time and what would be most beneficial for my career, and I don't want to waste any time.  I'd love to hear some advice on what you guys think would be most beneficial for me to do for the remainder of the summer!

Thank you!!"

I anticipate scoring around a **155 on the quant and 157 on verbal of the GRE**, and my cumulative GPA is currently **3.5/4.0**; I am not sure what my major GPA is, but I have mostly B's in my dept.'s courses and 3 A's. I will also not have time to retake the GRE. Have done/currently doing **2 research projects;** currently working in the field of **computer vision** this summer on developing an underwater visual perception system for a robot to find the direction that a human diver is pointing to with the **UMN IRV Lab,** and previously did a project with my **college's CS dept.** trying to utilize **NLP** to develop a framework for novice tech support tickets v.s. those originating from more experienced users. Both projects produced **0 publications;** the latter project did not go anywhere, and I am not totally sure the former will either (since it is a new field of study for me). I am also working in **1 internship**, **not really related to the CS fields**; it is for a non-profit social justice org where I am doing some basic data hygiene/basic data analyzing (like pie charts kind of stuff) + shadowing their data coordinator. One of my rec. letter writers is the head of my CS dept. who I have taken one course with (my intro CS course), but he is my major advisor; my other two writers are CS profs, one of which I have taken multiple courses with (the one's I got A's in), the other I did the NLP research with. **I go to a pretty small but highly rated LAC** in the US (if this means anything in admissions).

I am currently aiming for **University of Nevada - Las Vegas**, **University of Nevada - Reno**, and **UNC-Charlotte**, the last being a dream school (mainly for the VERY high GRE scores of their accepted students), and the former 2 being near where I am living. I am mostly struggling with the GRE aspect of my profile, I am pretty shit at standardized tests and there are a lot of other personal issues/academics I am trying to take care of at the same time. I want to target schools where GRE may not be required, or typically accept students with GRE scores similar to mine; don't care about rank or if its offered in-person v.s. online. GRE info isn't readily available on most college sites I have visited, but maybe I am missing a lot that exist. Any school recommendations/advice is appreciated!"

I'm wondering if a Mechatronics major is going to be worth keeping?

I'm currently working part time as a casual Software Engineer, and dropping the Mechatronics will mean I'll be able to work a lot more, and get more experience (which I think will be possibily more valuable?), I also have an internship at the end of the year with a trading firm doing software dev, so I'm wondering if the mechatronics major would be useful for the career path I'm heading down? I'm loving the comp sci part of my degree, and the subject I failed (Elec Eng), I hated. However, I would like to get into embedded systems at one point.

&amp;#x200B;

So should I:

\- Keep both, work less.

\- Only comp sci, work more.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would be appreciated :)"

I chose PS because I had an internship in a small company and I felt it could give me insights of the business side of things. But it's not the case for my current job.

I wanted to try software engineering because in my current role, I had an opportunity to work on a small project that involved Java coding. I felt the excitement of coding again and felt my current job is boring in comparison. And it also felt depressing when I just realized PS is a demanding job that requires shift working and possibly working long hours with no reward.

I couldn't move to a software engineering job internally because this is a 2 year grad program and they do not want people to freely switch between SE and PS. Recently I have a colleague who said they will be moving to a software engineering job and I felt like I want to do that too.

Are there any tips for me to move to a software engineering job? I'm starting to pick up leetcode again and brainstorming for projects that I can work with. At the same time, I'm also applying for software engineering jobs but it seems like my resume could be holding me back. So is it too late for me to switch jobs, or should I be spending some time working on coding then I start applying for jobs?"
oenfqy,62,2021-07-06,Extraction,ModestMite,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/oenfqy/extraction/,"I sat quietly in a rather empty public park, patiently waiting, or at least trying to.

They’re supposed to be here by now. I tapped my foot as I fiddled with the data rod in my hand, What if I’ve been set up? Damn it I knew I shouldn’t have trusted that damn intern, I’m going to get arrested and tortured and-

“Calm down doctor, we’ll get you out of here” A voice that was not my own popped into my head, I instantly jolted upwards and looked around me, behind me I saw a young woman sporting white hair and wearing Kevlar armor, at first glance she looked like an ordinary soldier, but as she walked towards me I noticed her eyes glowed purple and a feeling of calm flooding over me 

“Sergeant Molly Faun, Disciple really but you don't care about that, I’m part of your extraction team” Sergeant Faun stretched her hand out, I stopped for a moment before shaking it “This way Doc, we need to get you out of here” She grabbed what looked to be some sort of weird sort of projectile weapon, although this specific projectile was sticking out of the front of the gun and glowing orange, and set off into town, I quickly followed her.

“You said you had a team, where are they?”

“They’re waiting for us up ahead, it’s easier to sneak around when you can influence the thoughts of others” as she said that last part she turned to look at me, the glow in her eyes intensified briefly before normalizing again.

We walked for like 5 minutes before Sgt. Faun stopped “We need to get up there...” she pointed to a building at the end of the street “But there are too many patrols to simply sneak past...” she pulled back the bolt on her weapon, which made the projectile glow brighter and two prongs to extend from the top and the bottom of the weapon, before returning it to its previous state “So we’ll have to fight through them, follow our lead and you’ll make it out fine” Normally the prospect of being involved in a firefight would have made me a nervous wreck, but for some reason, I felt unusually calm.

“You see those benches over there? Go take cover behind them” I followed her orders dutifully as Sgt. Faun climbed to the roof of the building behind me. I hadn’t spotted any patrols as of yet, so I decided to count myself lucky. I peaked out from behind the bench and saw a normal trooper, a riot trooper, and a humanoid-shaped mech with a huge sword sticking out of its lower arm.

“What the HELL are those?” I whispered as I watched them patrol the streets.

“They’re not something you need to worry about, keep your head down, it’s about to get hot” I got down as low as I could, practically laying under the bench right as gunfire erupted down the street. I hunkered down below the bench as I looked up at the building behind me and saw Faun fire her strange weapon, it needed to be reloaded after every shot but it went out with a resounding bang every time it fired its strange orange projectile, I couldn’t see if it was any damage from where I lay but I assumed it was doing its job.

As the gunfight raged on I started hearing footsteps behind me, I whipped around to see a riot control officer standing behind me with his stun baton in hand.

“Doctor Zuktrakvilu you are wanted for stealing classified information and will be arrested and put on trial for your crimes” The officers spoke in my language, as he went in with his stun baton, his arm was sliced off by an electromagnetic axe that came flying from behind me.

“Close one aye? Wouldn't want you getting zapped would we?” I turned around to see what I assumed was a member of the extraction team, he was wearing a uniform I recognized as a Navy Uniform, some special forces unit whose name I couldn’t remember “C’mon mate, we gotta get you safely to Firebrand, keep your head down and follow me” The unknown soldier helped me to my feet and let me down the street, stopping every so often to fire at a nearby target with his shotgun, I tried keeping my head down as low as possible as more and more return fire whizzed by us. “This is Boymel, we’re pinned down near the end of the street,” Boymel spoke into his radio, shortly after nodding and turning to me 

“You see that building over there?” He pointed at the building Faun had pointed to earlier, I nodded “Our exfil is on that roof, on my signal, run towards the building as fast as you can, Faun will make sure to get you on that roof, got it?” I took a moment to ponder how she was supposed to do that but thought better than asking and gave him a nod. With that Boymel turned to fire at the incoming soldiers, he took down 2 of them before the rest of them started levitating into the air, all of them surrounded by a purple glow that was starting to become familiar. Seconds later a very loud gunshot rang out as one of the floating troopers was shot, then another.

“Doc! Now’s your chance, go for it!” Boymel grabbed me by the shoulder practically picking me up, I started running towards the building as fast as my unathletic body could, as I drew closer and closer to the wall I started doubting how Faun was supposed to help me get up this wall if she was nowhere near me, but as I did, I felt as if the ground below me pushed me upwards, I soared through the air, easily clearing the guardrail on the top of the roof and landing right next to an armed soldier, this one clad in a full suit of what seemed to be metal armor and wielding an SMG.

Glad you’re finally here doctor, I’m Lieutenant Shwartz” Spoke the armored figure “Let’s get you out of here once and for all shall we?”. The sound of jet engines drew nearer and nearer before it came from right above us, I looked up to see a transport of some kind, it had two engines coming from each of its sides, and it stood at a stable hover right above us. A long rope fell from the transport with a harness attached to it, which Shwartz grabbed and helped me put on, once it was on she gave the rope two good tugs and I was pulled up at a resounding speed.

“Welcome to your new home Doctor” I was greeted at the top of the rope by a pilot who helped me get into the transport.

It’s finally over 

I would later be informed I fainted into the arms of the pilot, before being woken up at the base of operations of those who rescued me."

Hello guys

To put you in the context,I am [B Sc](https://b.sc/) computer science student, next year is my final study year therefore the internship is necessary for my graduation. The problem is that I study in Hungary,but I only speak French and English as European languages which made it almost impossible to find an internship with these languages as most of the companies require Hungarian. through an internet search, I found this service [http://internships-spain.com/](http://internships-spain.com/),which claims to help me find an internship placement in Europe,I pay 200 euro as a deposit and complete an extra 600 euro if they find me one. Please for the ones that would suggest looking by myself I sent around 500 application so far and only got admitted in like 3 international companies for interviews which were extremely hard,I mean I just need an intern position to learn any IT company.

So could anyone tell me if the one I found is a reliable service or could suggest me a similar service.

Many thanks"

During my bachelor's, I realized that I don’t have much interest in electrical engineering and I concentrated all my efforts on machine learning. But the pandemic caused many companies to not come for hiring students from our colleges. And companies that came were mostly for software developers. 

Since I needed an urgent job, I started studying DSA and practice questions from leetcode. I also found an online internship as a developer in a startup during this period. 

Initially, I was out in the first round (coding round) itself for many companies and in the end, I passed the first round of a fast-growing startup. There were three questions out of which two were easy. I had seen a question similar to the 3rd question before (which was also the hardest) so I was able to solve that in time and I passed the round. Pure luck!

The next round was a video interview with an interviewer. He again asked about a coding problem. I had solved it before so I explained the solution to him, coded it an IDE, and passed that round as well. Lucky again!

There were two more rounds in which they asked about database concepts and my project. And after the 4th round, I was selected and I recently joined the company.

Though we are still in the orientation phase, I am very overwhelmed by everything now. My mentor is trying to be supportive and helpful but I am not able to follow even very simple things sometimes he asks me to do. I really feel like I don’t deserve to be here. Plus, I will be working as a backend developer which I don’t know anything about apart from making simple web apps using Node and express by following Freecodecamp.org tutorials. And here, I will have to do it with java. 

I really feel like I don’t deserve it or I am not qualified to be here. And I am really worried if my performance will go bad. 

How can I get out of this mentality? Can someone help me? What are the things I should learn?"

I have coding experience from first year as well as from taking CS50 (a free online course) and a Data Science Specialization. I'm planning on applying for internships within the next two months. 
I'm really nervous because I'm not sure if I'm well equipped enough to stand out. 
In general, how would you recommend a student prepare for such an internship? Ie. what sort of things should that student study or teach themselves to be prepared for such an internship (ie. a Two Sigma internship). 
I really appreciate any and all answers!"

The problem, I did too well and was able to retire from 2014 and could continue to do so almost indefinitely.   I did so after my last client failed to pay a long time associate of mine that impacted my reputation.

I'd like to get back into programming BUT my perceived problems:

1. I've been out of the industry for ~half a decade.

2. I am financially independent so I am a serious flight risk during high stress or inevitable ""bad"" times.

3. I am slightly older than the ideal twenty to early thirty something (turned 40 in the pandemic).


Despite that I miss the problems/challenges and more importantly the available hardware/servers of the professional world.

I have still being coding so I haven't forgotten that part of my craft.   I seasonally work on a [non-blocking web framework](https://github.com/devdave/txWeb/blob/master/README.md) and recently I made a python wrapper around a [music server like dll](https://github.com/devdave/pybass3/blob/master/README.md) so I am not completely out of touch with being a code monkey.

Anyone have any advice on how to get back into the industry OR would it be better for me to look toward being a principal engineer/code monkey for one or more startups?"

I’ve been thinking about this and I thought I would seek an advice here. 

Today I made the not well-received decision of going to grad school straight from undergrad ( I was offered a full-ride scholarship at Japan's top university and I just couldn't refuse).

with that being said I still can't stop myself from thinking about the fact that I will be lacking the professional experience that typical master's students have when they graduate (I did an internship for a year at a US governmental agency as an undergrad but that's about it).

Anyway, my question to you guys, what kind of GIS skills you would expect a fresh master graduate to have when hiring?

My plan is to try to improve my technical skills through online courses and self-study to make up for the lack of professional experience that I will have by the time of my graduation. Currently, I have been focusing more on expanding my GIS automation through Python skills and I intend to keep doing that while also looking for an internship as soon as I get to Japan this fall but other than that I can’t think of anything else to do in this regard. If you have any tips or suggestions please let me know. 

Thank you"

I'm in a bit of a career predicament—although I think it's a good problem to have—and could use some advice.

I'm about to turn 25—am single and have two jobs. One is a remote content marketing contractor position (pay is standard monthly, doesn't change based on assignments) I've had for 1.5 years.

The other is an on-site 9-5 marketing coordinator position for a medical clinic that pays salary that I've only had for three months.

**So here's the issue:** the remote gig is now offering to **pay for me** to travel with them to major US cities and abroad to shoot video, probably at least once a month. I'll also likely get a raise from them soon. With this raise, I'd justttt be able to pay my bills but will have minimal leftover for savings/investments. In order to be able to travel with them in this manner (which I very much want to) I'd have to leave the salary job I just got.

The thing is, the salary job is much more of a resume-builder than the contractor position because the contractor positon involves creating certain content (videos, blogs, podcasts) that some future employers may find laughable &amp; immature (can't really say more about what it is).

I feel like I need to build my resume more (have a pretty usless lib arts degree, just got an MBA from a no-name school last August)...remote job was my first real substantial position out of college and the salary job is my first real resume-builder out of college (had multiple internships during undergrad).

Should I just take advantage of my youth and be able to travel/have more freedom or stick to having both jobs for now so I can build my savings/investments? If I keep both jobs as is, I'd be making $20k more per year than I spend.

I hope I've provided enough info for those who'd like to provide advice. Thanks!"

My numbers are decent but I'm worried if I've messed up my chances because of my recs and lack of publications. I started off in neuroscience research because I was considering medical school, but after an industry internship, realized that my interests fell more under the genetics and bioinformatics umbrella. 

GPA: 3.7/4.0 in Biotech with a specialization in Bioinformatics from a T20/30 school - low tier UC

GRE: 328 - 162 Q, 166 V, 5 writing

Research: 

* 1.5 years in a genetics lab doing bioinformatics research
* 1 10 month industry internship in bioinformatics (major biotech company)
* 1 3 month industry internship in bioinformatics and genetics (major biotech company)
*  I am continuing as a full time bioinformatics researcher in the same genetics lab mentioned above for the next year
* 2.5 years (freshman-junior year) in a neuro/psych lab but this is completely unrelated research so I'd prefer not to really make this a major point in my application

Papers/Presentations:

* 3 undergraduate level presentations at my university of my bioinformatics research, 2 presentations of my neuroscience/psych research
* 2 industry presentations of my research projects
* Undergrad thesis (unpublished) in bioinformatics
* 1 middle author paper in neuroscience/psych - came out well after I lost touch with this lab
* I'm hoping to be working on a manuscript by the time I apply so I can mention that as well

LORs: This is what I'm very concerned about as my recs are pretty weak. I can get 1 from my PI in the genetics lab, and I'm hoping to get 2 more from professors that I have taken programming/bioinformatics courses with. I should be able to get one from my research supervisor from industry as he has a PhD and I completed a research project with him but I don't know if this will be a very influential letter for academics..

1. CMU - Comp bio
2. UPenn - Comp bio

I started a job during COVID right after my Masters. I was an intern here for a year before. I didn't really wanted to join that but because of covid I couldn't really find another job. 

Now it's been a year and I feel like it's time for me to move on. The reason why I want to leave is because the work is very repetitive like building dashboards with the same database. Also, I don't really get to use any new tools and I feel really out of touch from what's going on in the industry.

The problem is I'm feeling anxious thinking about leaving the company because my manager is a delight to work with. He lets me have a good work life balance, respect boundaries, zero micro managing. Basically, I don't think it can get better than this. He is even letting me work with someone else on an ML project I was interested in.

How do I leave all of this? I am constantly asking this question to myself what if the next manager I have is toxic and I have a miserable life.

Thanks!

I've had to start the onboarding process and I'm supposed to be relocating to start the job soon. I keep procrastinating because the fear I have is literally crippling. I've never been a good programmer, that's why I switched my major from comp sci after failing some classes. I sometimes wish I hadn't bothered to interview with this company. Anticipating this job has given me nothing but unbearable anxiety. I  don't think programming is my strength and even if I could be better at it, there's SO MUCH about this job I don't know. I asked my future manager about the technologies they'll be using and I have next to no knowledge on them.

- what should I bring with me? (Resume, cover letter, references, anything else?)

EDITED : 

Hey guys, I don't know how to show my appreciation for all the support/advice and heartwarming comments.. Never have I ever thought I would get so much love and comfort from strangers on Reddit. I couldn't reply to every comment since there were too many, but I did just finish every single one of them and gathered some commonly asked questions to answer!

&amp;#x200B;

* Don’t do the internship, take care of your health first
   * I won't be doing the internship during the chemotherapy. Of course, health comes first to me as well, I just wanted to decide whether or not I should tell them about my cancer and ask for a spot next year, since I thought maybe telling them about my cancer could affect me later on when I look for jobs.
* Can’t you work during your chemo?
   * I'm currently outside the country where my family is, and I'll be getting the necessary treatments here. So even if I wanted to, I wouldn't be able to... unless they allow remote working from outside of US.
* Props to op for making this fake sob story up
   * thanks
* How did you know you had cancer? any symptoms?
   * Lots of people were asking this. I didn't feel too comfortable sharing this at first, but I got so much support and advice from you guys so... My tumor is near the pituitary gland, and I was suffering from Diabetes Insipidus, where you drink a shit ton of water(crazy thirsty) and pee every 20-30 minutes since your brain doesn't release the hormone that prevents diuretic action.(ofc I didn't know what it was for like 10 months) I got blood tests and urine tests several times, but everything came out normal. The doctor could suspect that it is Diabetes Insipidus only after I brought it up. Then, Brain MRI and PET scan, and biopsy to find out what it is.
* Did you remove the tumor during the surgery?
   * No, the surgery was solely for biopsy.
* Do doctors think you’re going to make a full recovery?
   * Yes, I was diagnosed with Germinoma, with a very small tumor size too. They think it would take 2-3 times of chemotherapy and 6 weeks of radiation therapy. around 4 months of treatments
* Work on side projects/learn if you can
   * I thought I was finally done with side projects after securing an internship but I'll try to work on side projects and do more leetcodes..
* Plus you now get to look like Jeff Bezos
   * Fuck.
* Beware of the laws around cancer and disability
   * This is probably really important to know.. Does anyone know where I could find more information about this?

Anyways, thank you so much everyone once again. Also, I really appreciate everyone who messaged me to give help/advice. I just emailed the company to connect me to an HR person so that I can stay in touch with him/her to discuss some health issues. I'm a young healthy big boy, and like many of you guys have said, I will kick this tumor shit out of my brain ASAP and keep you guys updated. Feel free to ask any questions about cancer or whatever here and I'll be more than happy to answer them. Sending love and huge hugs to everyone!!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥"

I was offered a junior full stack developer position with a small company and it's pretty much me and another new developer, my manager and the owner. Everyone seems to be very experienced and knows how to code well except myself. I know imposter syndrome is a real thing but man this is rough.

My counterpart is very knowledge and works in the terminal very quickly. I'm paying attention so I can get better but I feel like there's so much sensory overload. I'm pretty much breaking down and seeing what he does better, all the way down to how fast he's typing, how he moves files and navigate through terminal, git knowledge, etc.. There's no doubt he's the better employee.

I'm watching all this and knowing I need to up my game in those fields on top of learning how the company operates and learning their tech. There's so much to learn and I don't know how long it's going to take for me to internalize everything and be able to even be on par with my coworker. The stress of having to produce too scares me because I've always made stuff at my own leisure.

I guess I'm just venting but I'm also a little shell shocked. Does this feeling go away or do you deal with this type of stuff a lot and you just become numb to it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

I managed to get this internship through a friend of the family whose company was desperate to teach young people about security due to the shortage of security personnel. I expressed my interest to him in CS, and he put me in touch with his boss who I interviewed with.

They prefaced with me that 1) I am their first security intern they’ve had, so they don’t necessarily know what to give me to do. And 2) I will absolutely not be doing help desk or customer service.

So now I’m drifting.

For the most part I am completing NSE Cert training, dipping my toes into CEH training, monitoring security problems, listening to everyone talk in meetings about stuff I have no idea about, and looking up everything I hear that I don’t know.

Occasionally I’ll have productive conversations about what I could potentially do like writing a script to automate the sorting of IPs, working on certain projects, deploying software, trying to hack an old laptop with Win 7 as an intro to pen testing, etc.

But as of today, I’m on my third week, and I feel like I’m not really doing anything. Some days I’ve had lots of free time, and I feel guilty because of how they talk about how busy they get with tickets. I want to be doing good work to beef up my resume and gain valuable experience, but I’m not even sure what I am supposed to be doing. They created this position for me to fill and I feel like I’m letting them down.

Every time I ask about what I should be doing, reading up on or learning, I don’t really get a straight response. I have been told directly to continue what I’m doing and if I get bored just do training for certs, which I’m okay doing. But I feel like I am not doing anything “particular”. When I’m beyond bored or clueless, I resort to researching and scrolling through CyberSec news.

At times this amount of free time makes me wonder if everyone around me in the office (not that many, most work from home) are as busy as they seem. These people are Network Admins, Tech Analysts, SOC Manager, Project Managers, Internal Audit, etc. So I know they’ve probably got to be doing something right?

What should I be learning? What doing I be doing?

Sorry for the ramble! Any advice is appreciated!"

ofedjj,411,2021-07-07,College Admissions Cheaters Often Win,ADMISSIONSMADNESS,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ofedjj/college_admissions_cheaters_often_win/,"The biggest myth that admissions offices present is that the review process is a science. Holistic review isn’t a precise thermometer that measures temperature accurately. In reality, it’s neither an art nor a science but a series of hunches and gut feelings. 

Even supposedly objective criteria such as grades and AP scores can be gamed by savvy students, further calling into question whether reviewers can decipher what is authentic or not. 

By cheating, I don’t have in mind falsifying resume credentials on an application or lying on an essay. 

I see posts from time to time about admissions counselors who claim they can tell fraud or not, but can they really when they read applications in less than ten minutes and hundreds if not thousands of applications each cycle? They’re reading way too quickly to assess the claims you make at anything other than face value. Reviewers usually take the applicant’s word for it. 

Some portals, such as the University of California, have shifted to students self-reporting their grades and SAT scores. Because that information is easily verified with an official transcript required for enrollment, very few students cheat on that portion of the application. I imagine for every thousand students who misrepresent themselves on an application, perhaps one is actually caught and “blacklisted” with their name circulated among elite institutions. Reviewers can’t detect fraud with any reliability, although they love to claim omnipotence on the subject to scare would-be deceivers. 

By cheating, I have in mind the time-tested tradition of looking over your classmate’s shoulder. Donald McCabe with the Center for Academic Integrity [conducted a longitudinal survey of 70,000 high school students](https://www.academicintegrity.org/statistics/) from 2002 to 2015. Two-thirds of students admitted to cheating on a test or plagiarizing a paper, with 95 percent of respondents admitting to some form of cheating.  

Because the penalties for academic dishonesty are so high, no student will ever publicly admit to fraud. On the contrary, people accused of cheating will deploy any means to denounce the charge and preserve their reputations, often committing themselves to further lying on top of the initial cheating. There are no incentives to come clean unless it’s to snitch on other cheaters and receive leniency.

Rutger Bregman in Humankind undermines the conventional narrative that humans are innately selfish and prone to evil. He argues that people are generally decent and aren’t intrinsically motivated to lie and cheat. We want to get along and feel included in our family and communities. Poor incentives within society nudge people toward bad behavior. 

**Elite Universities Corrupt Value Systems**

Our modern society inverts pro-social virtues such as honesty and integrity in favor of winning, even if that means fraud, deceit, or manipulation.  

“Blaming the system” doesn’t excuse or absolve the cheater who deserves some form of punishment. “Everyone else is doing it” also isn’t an acceptable defense. We’re left with a situation where the unfortunate few who are caught pay steep penalties. As long as the admissions arms race persists, cheating will be a natural response, a problem most educators and admissions staff prefer to ignore. Consequently, cheating is a silent yet systemic social problem.

Many of my clients go on extensive rants about pervasive cheating in their classes (although, predictably, none ever admit to cheating themselves). Some even write college essays criticizing their underhanded classmates. 

A group of students once pulled me aside at a high school visit when I worked for UT-Austin, begging me to do something about their unscrupulous valedictorian. Honest students resent their classmates who show up to class unprepared and swipe scantrons from a teacher’s desk or circulate answers among a group of cheaters. Traditional definitions of plagiarism are inadequate for the smartphone generation. 

**Every aspect of college admissions can be gamed.**

There is no part of the college application that a determined family can’t manipulate. One recommendation by Varsity Blues ringleader Rick Singer involved referring students to online schools where students could independently study AP classes. Earning high grades at less-rigorous high schools boosted the applicant’s overall GPA and class rank.  Supplementing coursework isn’t explicitly illegal. Few if any artificially inflated GPAs will get detected by admissions counselors. Many students opt to take summer school classes at their primary campus to earn more grade points and free up space for more GPA-boosting AP classes. 

In the past few years, I noticed a substantial uptick in students earning 4s and 5s on more than 15 AP exams, many of who self-studied. I asked a few how they managed to balance what seemed like an impossible course load for even the most ambitious students. Never implicating themselves, they admitted that on obscure corners of the internet, you could illicitly access AP question test banks provided by College Board intended for use explicitly by teachers to help their students prepare. Memorize the test bank and skim official preparation resources, and there is a decent chance you will pass, especially during the COVID period’s online exams reduced to less than an hour. Cheating is an efficient strategy for overworked and sleep-deprived students.

A Redditor laments in a mocking post, since deleted, about a cheating classmate who gained early admission to Harvard. “[Their cheating] coupled with all those posts about people faking passion and being admitted to schools that are like wE cAn TeLl WhEn yOu ArEn’t PassiOnate, should remind you that AOs AREN’T ALL-KNOWING JUDGES OF YOUR WORTH.” 

Because most students know at least one cheater who will inevitably gain admission, cheaters’ successes undermine the entire higher education system’s integrity. The college admissions madness incentivizes everyone to cut corners, with few unwilling to face social exclusion by being labeled a snitch. 

Another user responded to the disgruntled post that “[the saying] ‘cheaters never prosper’ is absolute bullshit.” They’re right. 

Admissions counselors aren’t Saint Peter with an all-seeing God on their side that can pierce the hearts of any soul. They’re more like a Judge Judy that squawks a lot but doesn’t have any unique insights into human character. Cheaters often win, including electing to the presidency a man who cheats on his wives and lies about everything from recorded phone calls with world leaders down to his golf handicap. 

Professor James Lang argues in *Cheating Lessons* that academically dishonest climates are pervasive at all levels of education.  He estimates at least two-thirds of all students will cheat at least once. A few become the habitual deceivers that appear in college essays or frustrated Reddit posts. Extrinsic rewards such as gaining admission to elite universities or earning a prestigious internship normalize dishonest behavior because the means justify the ends. Students are responding to incentives in their environment. Honesty requires more courage than surrendering to the pressures to take shortcuts. 

Professor Mollie Galloway expands in a review of Lang’s book that cheating isn’t necessarily more pervasive than in previous generations. Still, dishonest behavior is less stigmatized and perceived as increasingly normal. “The [educational] culture encourages students, particularly those from upper-middle-class and affluent communities, to see cheating not as a compromising of their values but rather as a warranted and morally sound mechanism by which to attain the status they believe they are afforded.” 

**A few high schools cultivate a culture of cheating.**

Administrations feel pressure to maximize their AP exams passed or SAT scores earned to recruit future cohorts of students. Schools receive accolades when their graduates earn prestigious scholarships or university spaces. There are subtle pressures for teachers to turn a blind eye or administrators to cover up academically dishonest behavior. Teachers who are committed to honesty fight a never-ending battle like trying to stop alcohol consumption during Prohibition. Alcoholics will find a way to drink, and students will find a way to cheat. 

Institutions punishing cheaters and plagiarizers is so rare that, when it happens, the incident often makes national news. 

Cheating at New York City’s most prestigious magnet school, Stuyvesant, didn’t end after they fired their principal, Stanley Teitel, for covering up a 66-student cheating ring in 2013. The New York Post reports five years later, “Cheating is most common among students in their third year, the most academically challenging because the grades count heavily on college applications, the December survey found. A whopping 97 percent of juniors said they had engaged in academic dishonesty, while 56 percent of freshman said they had already cheated after just four months in the school.” Stuyvesant is the second-largest feeder high school in the country for MIT, Princeton, and Harvard. 

**The Tragic Case of T.M. Landry**

The most heartbreaking example of a culture of systematic cheating occurred at Louisiana’s T.M. Landry. Named for the husband-and-wife-founders and principals Tracey and Mike Landry, it is an unaccredited college preparatory school housed in an abandoned factory. When Landry seniors started gaining admission to Cornell, Stanford, Princeton, and Harvard, among many other elite universities, between 2013 and 2018, it seemed like a tremendous success story. 

Landry enrolls mostly black students from rural Louisiana, a state with one of the nation’s lowest-performing education systems. Black families placed their trust in the Landrys, who promoted family and unity and an alternative education outside of white society’s norms. The Landrys announced their 100 percent four-year college acceptance rate, made famous by viral YouTube “decision reveal” videos viewed millions of times. Wealthy families and organizations donated hundreds of thousands of dollars, and white and Asian students began enrolling.

Educators and school administrators nationwide wondered how Landry students could overcome such long odds. A New York Times investigation revealed a culture of violence, abuse, and outright fraud. “Visitors and cameras paraded through what had become a Potemkin village.”  

Because the school wasn’t accredited, they do not receive any government funding and consequently fall outside regulations and oversight. Class attendance was optional. It was, as one student described it, a “house built on water.” 

Mike Landry humiliated and demanded absolute obedience from his students, resulting in a 2013 conviction for battery. He required students to begin class by saying “I love you” in different languages, including an invented language, Mike-a-nese, to him directly. “Love” in Mike-a-nese is the word “kneel.”

Students and families began speaking out following abuse allegations and substandard classroom instruction. Mr. Landry threatened to withhold transcripts if anyone left the school or blew the whistle. Students who chose to leave had their grades altered to ruin their future college prospects. He threatened students that elite university admissions officers had cameras in the school, so they better behave themselves.

T.M. Landry’s Ivy League success comes down to outright fraud. Mike Landry doctored transcripts to show outstanding grades for loyal students, even for advanced courses that they never took or weren’t offered at the school. The Landrys pressured students to report their family incomes as low as possible on the applications. Teachers recycled recommendation letters to laud students for extracurricular activities that didn’t exist. In some instances, teachers recycled recommendations from previous years for future students without changing the names. 

The Landrys counseled students to “go deep” on their essays, which pressured students to exaggerate or fabricate hardships that play into racial stereotypes and poverty tropes. They were the kinds of hardship stories that elite universities eat up. The only genuine instruction that students received revolved around the ACT. It was the only admissions factor that T.M. Landry staff couldn’t easily manipulate. One graduate, Bryson Sassau, commented, “If it wasn’t on the ACT, I didn’t know it.”

T.M. Landry’s graduates had mixed results at their respective elite colleges. Some earned their degrees despite entering college with writing and math skills that were many grade levels below their college classmates. Others, especially those who spent the most time at T.M. Landry, floundered and dropped out. 

Because their high school degrees weren’t accredited, some alumni had to earn their GED to enroll at local colleges and begin their studies again. Landry college prep destroyed dozens of families whose elementary-age children didn’t learn phonics. High school juniors tested in reading at a fourth-grade level. 

Mike Landry defended himself by appealing to a culture that values credentials over character. “So what, we’re not accredited… Three years in a row, Harvard took us. Stanford has taken us.” 

Taking a page out of the corporate public relations playbook, the Landrys employed the law firm Couhig Partners to respond to the Times’s allegations. Couhig based their 23-page report on five interviews that excluded the dozens of testimonies investigated by the Times. Predictably, their internal investigation minimizes the claims and amounts to “move along now, nothing to see here,” while noting that there might be areas for minor improvement. 

In other words, the means justify the ends. 

The tragedy of T.M. Landry embodies the admissions madness taken to its logical conclusion. The Landrys are a symptom of the admissions madness, not a cause. 

Elite universities seek diverse, academically stellar students. High schools everywhere will respond to these incentives, and families want to send their children to schools with a noted track record of success. In the worst-case scenarios, school cultures cater their entire curriculum and deploy any measures to meet those expectations at the expense of genuine learning or even a safe learning environment. 

**Universities are to blame**

T.M. Landry and Varsity Blues are two sides of the same coin. The former exploited an admissions system that values diversity, whereas the latter defrauded universities by leveraging extreme wealth and privilege. As with the Varsity Blues scandal, university administrators responded in horror, wondering how such a thing could occur. Yet, they’re the architects of a system that creates such perverse incentives that distort basic human decency. Look in the mirror! 

It’s also ironic that, on the one hand, admissions officers claim to know the context and resources of a given high school, while on the other, the Landrys hoodwinked dozens of elite colleges over a series of application cycles. If universities can’t reliably catch a fraudulent high school, why would we believe they can consistently identify individual cheaters? 

In *Talking with Strangers*, Malcolm Gladwell suggests that we’re generally trusting and tend to default to the truth. In UT admissions, senior staff trained us to presume what a student writes or reports on their resume is true. Admissions processes aren’t set up to identify fraud or look for subtle discrepancies in transcripts relative to a school’s profile. 

I don’t believe the posturing of a former Stanford admissions counselor who posted a Reddit thread under the username “empowerly,” insinuating that applicants will get caught if they cheat.  Given infinite time and resources, it’s theoretically possible to catch most cheaters most of the time. However, there simply isn’t enough time, sufficient information, or willpower to detect fraud in practice. Admissions gatekeepers are not the gods that they convey themselves to be publicly. Pretending to be all-powerful causes more harm than good and injects more anxiety into the system.

The immediate result of posts like that of the former Stanford counselor was to create a sense of paranoia among student Redditors. Dozens of comments wondered, “Will my ECs seem exaggerated? What if they contact my counselor?” The most honest response reads, “I presume you know that some students will take advantage of this information and lie better.” 

Sentiments like /u/empowerly’s reinforce college admissions counselors’ omniscience that provides the architecture for T.M. Landry to deceive their students that universities watched them. We are reluctant to acknowledge cheating unless there is overwhelming evidence suggesting fraud occurred. 

Educators are also averse to leveling claims of fraud against a student unless they’re highly certain. Their reputations and careers are at stake if they wrongly accuse a student. It isn’t surprising that the Landrys’ deceit succeeded for many admissions cycles. To their credit, at least some of their unwitting alumni earned life-transforming elite college degrees that wouldn’t have been possible otherwise. 

**TLDR: Cheaters, whether they are aware of their dishonesty or not, often win.**"

Hi everybody! Hope everyone’s safe and doing fine. My story, which I’ll try to keep short, is that I love the place I live, I just hate most people and the government.

While I’m not planning on moving anytime soon, it’s a very long and tedious process and I thought it would be better if I started preparing now. Preparing like saving up some money and working for my CV. All I’m asking is some pointers. Is this a good plan? Should I consider something else? Maybe some other countries? It will be minimum of 7 years if everything goes according to plan and during that time a lot can change. But this also gives me time to learn new languages and have appropriate funds, etc. 


i’m planning to become clinical psychologist though i haven’t decided 100% yet 


My situation is: 

A) I work and managed so save up around 3k$ for just one year. It’s not much but hopefully I’ll manage to save up more. 

B) I’m studying full time; just finished freshmen year at uni and I’m also learning german 

C) I’m supposed to start internship in September. Plan in taking additional voluntary jobs as well as participate in different scientific projects that my uni offers. 

My plan is as follows:

A) after finishing uni I hope to get scholarship in the UK (there are some scholarships offered to students from my country so I’m hopeful). The reason why I want to do masters in the UK is bc it’s only 1 year while in other countries like Germany (which I’m also also considering as a back up plan) it’s 2 years. At the end of the day, I’m going to go wherever I get scholarship as I want to save up as much money as possible. 

B) after completing the scholarship programme I’ll have to stay in my country for two years which is a prime time to work on PhD I think. PhD will take 3 years. 

C) start looking for a job, which I know can take some time. 



Here are my reasons to why I want to move to the above mentioned countries:

A) UK - an english speaking country; I’ve been there before so it’s not completely foreign to me; not too far away; I have relatives there which doesn’t play a huge factor but they’re the prime reason why UK is number one on the list; psychology is on the list for occupations in demand (i think that list has like a name or something but i forget what it is, sorry)

B) New Zealand - I’ve never been there but that country seems absolutely stunning and it’s easier immigrate to compared to the UK. Also, english. 

C) Australia - pretty much same reason here as for New Zealand. I think it’s a bit harder to immigrate there compared to New Zealand but I haven’t done much digging, yet. 

D) Canada - easier to immigrate; english speaking; a bit far away but it’s ok. I’m planning to learn french anyway. One drawback, however,  is that I’ve heard it will take forever to get my license and honestly I know this is going to be a bit of a problem everywhere but at least in UK I have some grasp on how it works. Here I have no idea and obviously I’m going to do more research but up until now it’s been quite confusing. 

E) Germany - easier to immigrate to, I’m learning german so hopefully by then I’ll be fluent. I don’t really want to go there but I’m keeping my options open. 

Ancestral visas are not an option for me even though I have relatives here and there. I also don’t want to go to the states but I guess that will be my last resort. 
I’m not planning on changing majors as I am happy with my studies and possible job opportunities, whatever the pay may be or however hard it may be to immigrate with that degree. 

Finally, these are my questions:

A) what other countries should I consider?

B) What countries, in your opinion, I should focus on more?

C) personal stories are welcome. I often hang out on country specific subreddits but this one has been the most helpful to me, so I would appreciate perspectives of different people. 

Thanks in advance and sorry if it’s too long."

I tried doing a couple internships with some big companies to try to find my interests and I liked some aspects of the jobs, but it always felt like it doesn't quite
contain everything I'd want to do. I've had a interest in programmming for a while and more recently investment banking/consulting but I went to a state school so
investment banking/consulting would be alot harder to get into until I got an MBA from a target school and I don't think my skills are quite up to par with like lets
say a comp sci student but I definitely still plan on trying to get into/ try both of those fields.

I guess I'd say ultimately, is it bad that I don't have a specific job path/career i want to follow in my major or is that how it is for alot of people?"

My first job was full stack. It was a very underpaid internship which lasted 4 months.

My main criticism from my boss was that although all my back end tasks worked as intended and I could do the front end he expected me to know what to do next based on the bigger picture. He said you have to think like a full stack engineer who considers the user experience rather than cranking out tickets.

(example: build a search box by user. In addition to doing that you should:

\-know to arrange alphabetically by last name

\-know that when the page refreshes to have it reload to have the same window visible.

\-if I show a table, consider what the results mean to the user and edit the view accordingly

\-when you have 2 modals, you should know when you close the top one, it doesn't close both, but reveals the second one.

To me that type of insight takes experience. Was he wrong to hire someone who is new for that type of responsibility? 

He says 1 in 20 coders can do it naturally in his experience.

Should I seek out backend only to start? Or at least minimal frontend or frontend that don't require these sort of meta decisions?

I also seems to be doing this project alone, both my supervisor and PhD student(in computer science) don’t know much about pandas dataframes. Neither do I! My strength is chemistry and I have never coded before! I have been trying my best and learning but no one will help/teach me.  My supervisor and the phd student are not working with me but more just giving me tasks and checking in once a week. So I’m reaching out to see if anyone can help. (Bare in mind I am very much a beginner who is so confused as to why I am doing this project alone.)

I am using Jupyter notebook and we have a large data frame for the bulk modulus (and other properties but I’m working on the modulus rn). This data frame has a bunch of materials with different values for the modulus. I managed to remove any entries that were not at standard room temperature, and count the number of duplicates that were present. Now I saw that there is a pretty simple way to remove duplicates but here’s the issue: it’s the same formula with the same conditions, but the values are all different. I don’t know which to delete and which to keep. I need to somehow group them together so that I can compare the different values I have for the same entry.

The phd student who is assisting  had me install ElMD and do ratio vectors for the formulas, to check for duplicate compositions. I don’t understand this or know how it is helpful. Currently I have been tasked with making numpy arrays of the composition vectors. Which I might have done, but again I don’t understand the outcome or why I am doing this. I know I need to look at each formula and analyse the different values but I have no idea how to do this. And my issue is a bit too long for google. If anyone has any suggestions I would really appreciate it. I will add a picture of my data frame after this post

Started at a FAANG-adjacent company as a junior software development intern back in January. Thought everything was going well, pay is very high for my first job + equity and benefits, got a very good rapport going with the hiring manager and I thought I was off to kick-start my career with a bang. Little did I know what was going to transpire in the subsequent weeks.

So first project I get put on is a simple CRUD app for delivering information to users in a non-duplicated interface. Simple I thought, threw together some SQL tables and wrote up and endpoint that used queries to build up the data into a JSON API response and render it on the frontend. My manager was ecstatic with my work and said he was impressed with my performance.

I guess because he was so impressed, he put me as the lead on another project that had been brewing in the stables for a while and had finally passed spec. He made me the lead and gave me 2 other junior developers to work on it with me. Was excited to lead a project and went into it with gumption.

The first time I got on a call with one of the other junior engineers things seemed a little weird. We were working on a pair programming item together and he kept putting aside the computer to check his phone. Then when we started working on the code he seemed to not know some very basic things. Dependency injection, basic type system knowledge, etc. I politely walked him through what he didn't know but in the end of my head I was thinking what the heck could be going on if this guy is a junior developer and has been at the company for almost another year.

So I filed it away in the back of my head and told him to go ahead and make a pull request (we don't use GitHub) and I would review it and give him any feedback. Well when the thing came in it was a mess to say the least. Full of improper type casts, SQL errors, etc. I left several comments on the pull request and he made another commit within a few minutes which showed me again he hadn't taken the time to understand it.

At this point I didn't know what to do so I reached out to my manager (the one who had put me in charge of the project). I told him that the other developer's work didn't seem up to the standard that I would expect. He asked me to look at the code which I thought was weird since I had been put in charge of the project. As we were looking at it together he told me he thought that it was good (which it was working ""fine"" after more updates had been made despite that it wasn't clean code even 10%) and he left it at that.

So at this point I'm not feeling great but I continue to work and as the project goes on I told the other developer to write a REST endpoint. This was when it dawned on me he didn't know what it was. This guy is a JavaScript developer all his life and has never edited a simple backend framework before. So I patiently walked him through it. Meanwhile the other developer is eating tacos in the backyard and not participating at all. When he finished the endpoint it was 100% a mess, wrapped up in syntax errors and non-clean code work.

I went to my manager again and told him about the problem and he suddenly acted frustrated and angry like I wasn't doing my job. He insinuated that it had been a mistake to put me in charge of the project and said he would take it over himself. Now I've been made to feel like an idiot and I'm one of the 3 dev's working under my manager on a project that I was originally the lead.

To make matters worse the company only has 1 QA working on the entire project so anything that comes out of the woodwork because of this junior not knowing what he is doing is going to bite me in the ass indirectly.

After feeling micromanaged and uncomfortable with my boss I am thinking about trying to jump to a different company but I'm not sure how it will look after only 6 months. I grind a lot of leetcode and I don't think I would have a hard time landing a job with a better company but I don't want to give a bad impression in my resume and I don't know if I am going in the right direction as this is my first programming development job. Just looking for anyone who has had a similar experience and can advise me what you think about my situation and what I should do. Thanks."

&amp;#x200B;

I see plenty of posts talking about the red flags of different dev jobs, such as the golden handcuffs, ""unlimited"" vacation time, etc. I know internships aren't going to include crazy benefits or huge pay, which is why I am curious what is *GOOD* for an internship and what is *bad*/should be avoided if possible. What are some of the things I should be looking for when applying for internships in the software dev field? I understand that at this point, I would love to take whatever I can get, but I have worked some HORRIBLE careers in the past and I really don't want to go down the mental path that those jobs caused me again. I left those careers for this one in hopes that I can turn my love for coding into an amazing career, but I would hate to have a horrible first impression.

For some context, I have no internship experience and a 3.18 GPA.  
  
I had basically spent the last year of my classes depressed and stressed out (You can check my earlier posts to find plenty of proof of this lol) that I wouldn't make it, wouldn't find a job, and was really struggling to find purpose. I am still trying to accept that this is real and even though I'm finishing up the last of my onboarding paperwork it still feels a bit like a fever dream!

You don't know what opportunity is waiting for you around the corner, so stick it out and keep chugging until your done even if it takes longer than you'd like or your resume isn't as beautiful as you'd hope!

The goal was to get some hardware to load it on, but we never got that far. In fact I just wrote up the code, school ended, and I stayed busy with other priorities. Big priorities. Big.

In contrast to my internship, I'm looking for something where I may work with a team, working with C programming, or Verilog, or both, digital systems and with macroscale electronics (as opposed to the nanoscale thermometer technology), or large-scale systems (idk like VLSI or ASICs), or embedded programming; and at this point I'm just dropping buzzwords and I hope you can chime in.

I'm a grad student finishing up my final year for an MS in EE/CE. My BS was in EE and most of my senior courses have been heavily focused in Automation and Control Theory along with many generic intro courses such as embedded systems, computer architecture, and digital image processing. I feel like I'm at a crossroads in finding what I should focus on in this last year.

Background - I had been set to work in a controls intern position at a fortune 500 company last summer, but then the events of 2020 ensued, hundreds in my branch of the company were laid off, and my position ended up being relegated to meaningless online business and sales training for the entire company's intern class (I.T., Sales, Data Science, and like 10 engineers). I got paid, but earned no technical experience. After this, I started on my MS in EE/ECE because it was free and I could be better set to land a job out of state with my lack of real internship experience. Here in Oklahoma, most of the entry level electrical positions are in RF and Instrumentation/Automation for the FAA, the local air force base, and other government contractors. While I am qualified and received an offer for one of these positions, they pay poorly (even by the dirt cheap living standard here), are not what I'm into, and I would much rather be in Texas where I'm from. I also worked directly with the FAA on an automation project and it was a terrible experience. I want to explore some computer engineering topics so I have the option to either get out of here or just fall back on one of these EE jobs.

TL;DR, I have a full tuition waiver and basically a free year to delve into computer engineering and software topics that the tech companies in Dallas, San Antonio, and primarily Austin are focused in. I don't have a ton of experience at all in CE outside of some dinky microcontroller projects, an intro solid state course, and basic digital and logic design stuff. Outside of that, I have some pretty irrelevant linux and I.T. experience. I'm decent at C and Java and completed half of a CS minor before I decided I hated the professors and people in that overcrowded department (at least at my institution). I really just don't know much more about the CE path because half my MS courses were double-counted with my EE degree.

What kinds of things should I try to study alongside school to build more CE skills and potentially land a silicon job? 

FPGA, VHDL/Verilog, and Python or Ruby seem to top the list, but I didn't start in this major so the paths of specialization are hazy for me still. It seems to me that even within the CE degree at my school, only precursory topics are covered in this area and they mostly just take EE courses, so I have no clue how those guys land anything but pure CS jobs. 

Or am I just stupid for thinking I can make this effort this late in my schooling? As with many senior or new grad engineering students, I'm not even sure what I've gotten myself into earning this degree.

Let me know,

I am a bit freaked out right now. So until recently all the GRE centres in my city were closed and I have applied to a few US universities without GRE for MS in CS, Spring 2022.  


I have 3 years of work experience working at a namely Labs department of an MNC and a research internship at the same place with a CGPA of 8.3 from a tier 3 university.   
I have pretty strong LOR's from my professors and my manager and I am hoping that a patent I applied for will be published soon.   


Is it too ambitious to apply to universities in the range of 20-60 rank(CS department) from Usnews?    


Or maybe I should give GRE, although I have not prepared for it yet and it might be too tough to crash course through in between my messy work-life and the resignation policy requires 3 months notice.

og3hen,2,2021-07-08,Math+CS or medicine?,lil_broccoli69,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/og3hen/mathcs_or_medicine/,"Let me preface this by saying that in my country, one applies to medical school or a joint bachelor's and master's degree directly after secondary school, so both are in direct competition. I have about an equal interest in math and biology. I'm especially interested in neurology, pharmacology, machine learning and finance &amp; economics. Beyond this I'd really like to move to the US if possible.  


Math+CS:  Some of the most interesting work exists here. Working as a research scientist at a big tech company would be ideal. Equally as interesting would be working with developing algorithms or doing quantitative research in some fund or economic research institution. Having said all this, there are some pretty major uncertainties with these, even if I'm fairly confident in my own talent and drive.

First of all, most of these jobs are concentrated in the US and UK, and while an internal transfer with an L1-visa is feasible, it's not a given. Secondly, while the program I've applied to is very competitive, the university isn't well known outside of the country, and even if it was, employers would have trouble differentiating between how competitive each program is (think &lt;5% vs 50% admissions rate). Lastly, my country doesn't have great researchers in machine learning and lacks the culture of research internships, so I'd have to go out of my way to gain research research experience and publish something of significance.

The ""fallback"" with this path would be to work as a software engineer. I've taken a look at leetcode medium questions and I'm confident I'd be able to perform well at FAANG-type coding interviews given some study and practice. Some uncertainties pertain of course, but there are thankfully a few FAANG-companies here that seemingly have quite liberal internal-transfer policies. 

My concern with software engineering is that I'm not sure how much I'd enjoy it. Don't get me wrong, building and improving stuff is fun, but a couple of people have told me that even at FAANG software engineering is mostly boring and not that innovative or creative. I'd highly appreciate if someone could confirm or deny this. I'm sure I'd enjoy working as a specialized physician more than a software engineer who does maintenance and bug fixing the majority of the time.  


MD: There is definitely some interesting work here too. Working as a clinical researcher or as physician+researcher at a university hospital is something I can see myself doing although it seems quite dumbed-down. It's not at the level of a research scientist in CS or anything close, but it's still enjoyable work. It's also way less competitive and seems to be the most likely scenario if I decide on going to medical school. Getting good grades during medical school itself seems significantly easier also which would make a few years of my life less stressful.

Beyond this, getting admitted to a US residency-program is simpler than I thought where some specialitets have an admissions rate of over 50% for internationals. Furthermore, the medical school I've applied to is very well known internationally (despite having almost the exact admissions cut-offs as math+CS) and has some exchanges with top US medical schools.

  
TL;DR: Math+CS can potentially lead to very interesting career paths, but there's a high risk of not getting them where the fallback isn't all that great. Best career paths after medical school aren't as good but seem more likely with the fallback also being a bit better.

Any advice or pointing out misconceptions would be highly appreciated. I only have a few days decide and have already thought about this extensively."

I've posted in the Germany subreddit too just in case)

I'm planning to apply for a Masters in Visual Computing at the Univerity of Saarland after I finish my undergrad, and was wondering what my chances look like for admission so for those who got in the CS Masters program at the University of Saarland, it'd be awesome if you could share your stats! Thanks so much!

Here's what mine looks like (in case anybody was wondering):

* Undergrad: Double degree program in CS at two partner universities
* GPA (1st degree) : **- \~ 82%** (1st-5th semester), 
* GPA (2nd degree)**: \~ 88%** (6th-8th semester, 1 semester left), though I should get it to around **- \~ 91%** by the time I graduate 
* No research publications as of now, but currently contacting professors for research opportunities next semester, so hopefully would get at least one pub
* Work experience (prob not relevant though): TA'd twice, had one summer internship as a software engineer at a quite reputable tech company

\*\*\* I tried using the Modified Bavarian formula as suggested by some German universities and my GPAs were equivalent to: 2.065 and 1.584 respectively.

\*\*\* Also, I know Saarland specifies that the minimum GPA/grade must be 3/4 or 75%, so I know that I do reach the minimum requirement, but I am aware that admissions would probably be very competitive since I heard VC at Saarland is one of the best courses in Europe."

&gt;""During the entire process, Kaseya has shown that they were willing to put in the maximum effort and initiative into this case both to get this issue fixed and their customers patched. They showed a genuine commitment to do the right thing. Unfortunately, we were beaten by REvil in the final sprint, as they could exploit the vulnerabilities before customers could even patch.""

That's all fine, shit happens. But what's really really bad is that Kaseya NEVER told their customers about this and gave them a heads up to shutdown or otherwise protect their environments. 

I'd be sending my overtime bills to Kaseya with this information. So much time and money would've been saved if Kaseya owned up to their shit to their customers. 

Security loopholes is a part of programming, always has been, always will be as long as humans are doing the coding. Companies need to stop treating security issues with their product as something horrifying and be open about it.

I don't know about you, but I'll 10/10 times buy products from a company that tells me to turn off their shit because it's insecure until they can patch it, but I'll sure as hell never buy Solarwinds products when they try to blame an intern. And from now, not Kaseya either.

The majority of the program consists of courses in systems programming, software development, testing and maintenance. 

2) The networking/security is mainly about networking the first two years and security the third year. First two years will be courses in networking fundamentals, enterprise networking, advanced enterprise networking, routing and switching, two Linux courses, database management(SQL and python, a few courses in Windows. We also learn about cloud infrastructure, specifically Microsoft Azure. The program also offers a two day Azure boot camp with the option to the write the exam at some point afterwards.

Both programs offer internships. Two back to back paid internships (8 months total).

ogavu6,50,2021-07-08,A-Z on Building your network on Twitter - Following the right people,mnist07,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/ogavu6/az_on_building_your_network_on_twitter_following/,"In a previous post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/oc9gt7/advice\_from\_someone\_who\_got\_rejected\_from\_all/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/oc9gt7/advice_from_someone_who_got_rejected_from_all/)), I mentioned how important it is to stay active on social media platforms particularly Twitter. Since then, I got a lot of queries about how to start following the right people and navigating through the academic side of this platform.

\***Disclaimer**\*  
*My observations might be biased towards STEM courses since I come from a similar background.*

The reason I promote using Twitter is that academics love advertising on it. This can include new research, availability of PhD/ MS positions, availability of TA/ RAship positions and even internships. In my own experience, I got an opportunity to work as a Research Assistant at Emory University through Twitter, which eventually led to my acceptance into an [MSc+PhD program](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/biomedical-ai). So here are a few things I have observed over time on following a relevant set of people so that more such opportunities are visible -

* **Start by following the famous ones** \- This will keep you updated about the latest news and events. For the machine learning community, this can include people like Andrew Ng, Fei-Fei Li and countless others who are very well known in the community. 
* **Read papers, Follow authors** \- This is something that has led me to so many opportunities. Whenever you read a research paper, especially one which is pertinent to your field, take a moment to search the authors of that paper and follow them on Twitter.  This will further build your network, and will also give you access to the latest developments around that particular paper, project, etc.
* **Follow prospective research groups** \- Sometimes, the PIs are not available on Twitter. In such cases, you can follow the research group itself and even the graduate students working in the group. The students are a reflection of the work that is going on in the lab and are relatively more easily approachable in case you want to know more about the group.
* **Follow Conferences and Workshops** \- This is something that I have discovered very recently. Conferences, especially the major ones, are gold mines of resources.  Competitions, workshops, and other sessions that are a part of these conferences are frequently advertised via these pages. For instance, recently, I got to attend mentorship sessions as a part of ICLR2021 and CVPR2021 which gave me a chance to interact with top researchers in my field. Workshops allow you to dive deeper into a niche subject and gain more information on events happening in that domain.
* **Engage in conversations** \- In case someone has tweeted about your favourite paper, engaging in conversation will not only augment your knowledge but make you more noticeable. But make sure that the conversation is meaningful and you are not just for the sake of tweeting something out.
* **Write about your favourite paper and mention the authors** \- There can be several reasons to write about a paper. You might find it very interesting, you want to summarize the key observations and results for your audience, you might even have a doubt that you want to confirm with the authors. Doing this over time can help you become more noticeable in the community.

In summary, how I like to think about social media platforms is that by following a relevant set of people, I will automatically come across relevant opportunities (like I did in the past). You can use other platforms like LinkedIn as well but I have had a higher success rate on Twitter. 

Remember, it is not always about doing more projects and publishing more papers, sometimes making connections can be your next game-changing move.

As many of the people in CS here know, the interview prep grind can be time consuming and difficult, especially if you have never done it before. So as a fellow terp interning at Snap, and this fall at Facebook, who has also gotten offers from Uber, C1, GS and Cockroach Labs (not a flex, but showing that I actually have the credentials to help you pass technical interviews) I would like to offer free mentorship to prepare you for technical interviews.

What I will offer:

* A comprehensive study guide, based on what I did and studied to help me prepare for interviews
* Short coding assignments that will help you understand the theory and implementation of basic data structures like Linked Lists, BSTs and Graphs
* 1 on 1 mock interviews with technical questions

What I am looking for:

* Ambitious people that are willing to spend 1-2 hours per day on weekdays and 2-4 on weekend days preparing for their technical interviews
* A good attitude
* Willing to learn Python or already know how to use it

If you are interested just DM me, I'll be responding DMs for the next week or so, ideally I'd like to start the prep on Monday 19th.

I'll be helping \~5-6 people, since last time I did this I helped 2 people and one of them got a Capital One internship offer, so I want to try a bigger group this time"

ogd3rb,13,2021-07-08,Student Teaching Experience help!,Flat_Independence565,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/ogd3rb/student_teaching_experience_help/,"Hi! First time poster here! 

I need some advice/ words of encouragement. I’m in my senior year of student teaching and last year I had a very poor experience with my supervisor and I’ve been assigned this supervisor again this year. Our supervisors provide feedback about our observations and also are our support during our internships. This supervisor treated me very unfairly last year and I’m scared it will harm my experience with my senior year of student teaching. 

Here’s just a few things that happened with this supervisor:

-would email others in my cohort and not reply or communicate with me on meetings (I did all my responsibilities, yet this supervisor did not even try with me)

-our first phone call meeting after my first lesson observation she told me that she didn’t like the lesson and said (and I quote) “you’re being very quiet are you crying? I know that if someone was saying this to me I’d be crying” and yes I was crying

-the phone calls (no in person meets ung due to covid) would last about 5 minutes in total and all that was pointed out were my weaknesses. There was never any positives. 

-the feed back forms about my lessons were 3 bulleted points with less than 15 words each (the strengths portion would often be left blank)

-due to covid we film our lessons and upload them.  You can leave comments on them while watching them and from the time stamps, it proves this supervisor did not watch the lesson in entirety. (A comment would be made at minute 4 say at 6:30pm and then at minute 46 another comment would be made at 6:32pm)

After all of that, I would assume I am a terrible future teacher. But, my mentor teachers have told me that my lessons are great and other teachers have asked me for the lessons so they could use them. I just don’t understand what this supervisor has against me. 

I feel I was treated unfairly and have talked to other students who had this supervisors and also didn’t and their experiences were night and day compared to mine. I am considering talking to the department head but I’m worried they will switched my placement school. I really like the school and county I’m placed in and would love to teacher there in the future. 

Did anyone else experiences this or anything similar? I’d appreciate some advice  or encouragement for my senior year😊"

1. Do not trust anyone. Co-workers will backstab you when they get a chance. Do not befriend them and do not reveal personal details about yourself and your life. They don't truly care about you.   
(I get that there are some nosy people out there, but this is going a bit overboard and makes it seem like everyone is evil. If you work full time you'll spend a lot of time with your co-workers, if you can't be friends why not at least be civil?)
2. Never ask for help, it is perceived as weak and you are bothering other people. No one will help you anyway, even if you are a ""team"", everyone is there for their own gain.   
(I wasn't allowed to ask for help in school either)
3. If something goes wrong, it's most likely your fault because you're an inexperienced intern.  
(It can't always be our fault, even if it is, if we learn from the experience and never do it again we should be good.)
4. Never ask for a raise / negotiate your pay, especially if you are a woman.   
(This is really sexist and if you are a good worker you don't deserve it)
5. If you are sexually harassed, HR will not help you. Leave and find another job.   
(I don't know how true this is) 
6. If you're not working 996 (9am to 9pm, 6 days a week) you are not working hard enough. Also don't leave the office before your boss does or else they'll think badly of you and fire you.  
(I heard her say most people in China work 996, it sounds exhausting and they don't have a work-life balance. Also the boss thing is bullshit.)
7. You should not feel tired after work, if you are, you are weak  
(How is staring at a computer for 8+ hours a day not tiring? We're not robots, even robots will get tired after operating for a long time)

Please don't follow the advice she gave, if it isn't blatantly obvious. Does anyone else's parents say similar things?"

I am studying Mechatronic (Diplom engineering, 10 Semesters) in Germany (equal to Master), soon I will in the 7th semester. And in my university the 7th semester is to do an internship or study for a semester abroad. I choose an internship semester for financial reasons (cannot afford the aboard one right now).

I found an interesting position for the internship in an IC manufacturing company, my job will be in the labor looking for the Failure rate, expected lifetime, studying the IC under higher temperature and such kind of tests, document it so the customer can see it.

Now in the 6th semester I am writing a thesis (in the 6th semester for 5 months, different from the final graduation thesis which will be fulltime for 6 months in the 10th semester) my thesis is about creating the Floorplaning for chips and ICs which will be something like the company where I am doing the internship.

After graduation I would like to work in designing, manufacturing/finishing, and this kind of job orientation.

Do this internship sound good for my future goal? I mean if I went to work for a company and the see that I spent 5-6 months internship in that position, would be considered positive or more than a negative thing for me?

Thanks !"

She isn't the only one who acts like this. Most of the other CS student also treat me like this. Kind of like a asset then a friend.

I’m having such a hard time even finding other jobs, I have been applying like crazy since April. I either get interviews and then nothing after (a couple I’ve moved on to second and third rounds) or I just never hear back. I don’t know why I’m having such an hard time as I’m not applying for anything out of my experience levels.

I have been working at an ad agency for 2 years. I was fresh out of college (bachelors in marketing with 2 internships completed, decent grades, good school, etc for reference)

I got one raise (pre-covid) from $30k to $33k. I was told in august OF LAST YEAR that I was on the list for another but they couldn’t give it to me until things were more normal with Covid. I waited until January to even ask about the status (hiring levels were normal, revenue was normal) and each time My boss would barely acknowledge the raise question, I got like a “oh I’ll check on that” every time. I know it did need escalated to the higher level boss to approve, but any time I brought it up I got brushed off. It was incredibly frustrating.

Finally May 2021, I get an email stating they are granting me a raise. From $33k to $36k, I still feel like this is rather low. The glassdoor salaries for my company (even the junior level roles, I started at junior but now I’m just regular) are showing $35k and up, most being 40+ for same level roles (very entry level type company). It just took effect 7/1 after waiting 2 months even after it was granted. I also couldn’t even negotiate as my boss just sent it via email. 

I’m just incredibly frustrated mainly because if glassdoor is correct (and I think it should be at least close, mid sized company, same cost of living area, etc) I would be the lowest paid essentially. And I’ve been there two years, got bumped up from the junior level, have tackled more work than I did prior, etc) and I’m assuming the new hires get the same at a lower level than me.

My plan is to eventually leave, but would it be unreasonable to bring to the table kind of all I just said with the glassdoor/the fact I do more work/responsibilities/etc. and ask for at least 40k? Even though my raise just hit July 1? I would ask this in my August review. I mean the worst they can say is no, but I don’t want to seem unreasonable."

ogfn7b,3,2021-07-08,PhD in AI/ML with not much CS background: How can I become more employable?,vandelay_inds,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ogfn7b/phd_in_aiml_with_not_much_cs_background_how_can_i/,"I asked [this question](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ogdqss/what_can_i_do_after_my_phd_focused_on_aiml_that/) earlier, but I thought I'd also ask this new, less complain-y question, that might attract more constructive advice. 

I just completed my first year of a PhD program. I have a MS in CS in which I focused on ML. My problem is that my undergraduate degree was in the humanities, so I don't have a mastery over core CS concepts. Additionally, I haven't done any internships so I don't have any real SWE skills or other real-world experience. The first year of my MS I applied to maybe \~30 internships, but didn't get any interviews. Consequently, I got kind of turned off and haven't spent time applying the last two years--I just kept feeling like I still wasn't a good enough applicant for it to be worth it to apply. So this coming fall I'd like to start trying again for internships.

I have taken an introductory course in DS and Algorithms, as well as a few C &amp; C++ programming courses in community college a few years ago, so I wouldn't say I have zero knowledge of these topics but I've definitely forgotten most of it by now.

So how can I get more employable? One question I don't really understand the answer to is, *how much* of Leetcode (or whatever) do I really need? What is a feasible time commitment that can ensure relative success, an hour a day? Two hours a day? I was also thinking about going through *Cracking the Coding Interview*. I'm having a hard time developing a roadmap for this over the next few months since in addition to practicing, I also need to relearn a lot of the algorithms themselves.

My advisor has mentioned that he thinks I wouldn't be appropriate for a SWE role and that I should look for something ""Data Science and modeling oriented."" What are the concrete skills I need for these kinds of internships and how can I showcase them? So my second question is, is Python programming enough for these kinds of positions, or do I need to focus on getting really good at C++ or Java?"

My question is: Does that fact that I have been impressive in my short internship with this company, so impressive that they offered me a job 2 months before they said they would, increase my leverage in negotiating what will be my first engineering job out of school?

Last week I hit my mental and physical breakdown point. I couldn't make myself work. I was sick physically but also max stressed out mentally. Stressed out because of primarily missing out and not being able to work to my best ability in the internship.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a point in trying to keep working and working mediocrely (with my body weakness) or is it okay to quit?

If I keep going,  I am pretty sure that I won't be able to work to the best of my ability as my body isn't healthy. The added stress of missing out is not helping either.

&amp;#x200B;

But if I do quit, I feel like a failure.

This internship is very sought after and before I got it I could never have imagined that I could even get it. For privacy reasons not naming the firm.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: (1) The sickness is not that bad. I just keep getting a fever. If I don't rest enough. Plus I am exhausted all the time.

(2) Only 3 weeks of the internship are left. And out of the first 8 weeks, I took collectively \~ 3 weeks off.

(3) Till now, the intern managers have been very nice and have allowed me to take all the rest I needed."
ogm1t0,175,2021-07-08,An honest review of App Academy,Dramatic_Claim6484,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ogm1t0/an_honest_review_of_app_academy/,"Throwaway account. 

I attended the online bootcamp, the 24 week program. I am currently working in the tech field and got my job in about 5 months after graduation.

Let me start by dispelling some myths. No, graduates do not make on average 6 figures after graduation. That number is attributed mainly the the SF NY area, where the buying power of 100k is about 60-70k anywhere else (which happens to be what grads outside of those areas end up making). So if you think you'll be rich after graduation, get that thought out of your head. Of course there is the rare breed that gets into FAANG, but lets keep it real and assume you're average, which is perfectly fine. They also like to say they have a 3% acceptance rate, but I get the suspicion that figure probably includes people who applied and then changed their minds. If they were talking about the rate of people who were accepted after the first soft interview, its probably higher than 30%, but im just spitballing here. 

Now that that's out of the way, lets talk about the actual program. It is TOUGH, and they are not lying when they say you need at least 60-80 hours a week of studying to follow along. Of course if you come from a CS background it might be less, but the majority of people who attend these bootcamps do not know anything about coding. It truly is a college degree equivalent, and I can say that with certainty since I came into my job with more knowledge than some of these fresh CS degrees. The thing about college is that while you get more time to study the concepts and go more in depth on certain topics, you end up not coding often enough to actually know what you're supposed to do at your first job, whereas aA is 100% of the time coding and simulates a development environment rather well. On the flipside, college grads had more knowledge on the non coding aspects of the job while I had to learn it as I went. 

They focus entirely on web development since web development jobs are the easiest to get, and also the most popular kind of development job. You'll learn all the latest and greatest languages and frameworks, Python and JavaScript being the two biggest since they're the most common in web development. The first 2 months or so are dedicated to learning the basics of development such as data types, booleans, APIs, class and OOP, etc. The next 4 months are focused on learning frameworks and actual development. Their curriculum is constantly evolving which is something I commend them for, but they also have some massive flaws such as waiting until 2/3rds of the way into the course before teaching Python. The logic is that Python is a lot easier to grasp the core concepts of than the trashpile language that is JS and I can understand that, but Python is more popular and is more often used in actual code so take that as you will. 

You will be coding 3-4 websites to add to your portfolio in order to use on the job hunt, but it's not going to be enough. You're competing with thousands of other people who will have a similar amount of projects, and an advantage of having internships which is something you wont have. A lot of these projects are kind of amazing though if you consider that we had a week to do it. People seem to like to use the Google Maps API and AWS to give their features that extra oomph, and MaterialUi and Bootstrap for the frontend. Attend some hackathons or make more projects after grad to stand out. 

The rate of people who fail out of the camp isn't that high, at least not when I took it. People need to pass an assessment every week. If they get below an 80% they get sent back 4 weeks to repeat, and you get 3 chances to do this. The assessments are usually not that hard, although there are some extreme difficulty spikes such as the React assessment that took about 3 hours, but we had about 3 days to learn about useState, useEffect, useContext, and Redux for good measure. And you'll also see the occasional idiot who is obviously cheating through their assessments until they hit one where they can't cheat on since its all coding and no multiple choice/ short answer. Those kinds of people are dumb as hell, since they're just wasting their or their parent's money. But I digress. 


Speaking of money, lets talk money. You have two options, pay upfront for about 22k, or pay after you get a job and pay them 15% of your salary every year for 3 years, capped at certain brackets, so you'll pay 12-15% depending on where you are. Is it worth the money? Thats hard to say. It depends on what you are willing to pay for college. If you're willing to pay more, take this program. If you dont think college is worth that much, dont take this program. Because it really is a college degree equivalent in terms of practical knowledge, so price it as such. You're also paying for their extensive alumni network, which is a real boon when you're job hunting. 

In summary, this program is not going to get you rich quick. It's essentially shoving 4 years of college experience into your head in about 1/8th of the time. And like any other college grad you'll need to hustle to get that first job. All this program does is prepare you to start your career in development. The pros and cons of aA vs a traditional college is that you'll get more hands on coding experience, but have less time to understand it all. But thats the nature of development, you'll constantly be learning new technologies and what you know now will be obsolete in 2 years, and a bootcamp experience isnt all that different. aA is a perfectly valid way to get your career started in tech, but at the end of the day its all up to you to get your dream job."

I am a senior student studying CS and will be graduating this Fall. I applied to over 300 companies for a Summer internship and only had 5 or 6 interviews but didn't get any offer. I have no internship experience in a tech company at this point. I admit that I was lacking LC practice. But, what got me frustrated is the fact that I only got 6 interviews out of 300 jobs that I applied to. I barely have any connection who works in big tech companies since I was a transfer and Covid. I thought it would be easier to get an interview offer if I transferred to a competitive University in the bay area, but it doesn't seem like it. I wonder how people are getting interview opportunities in top companies. Should I really go out to LinkedIn and ask for referrals to alumni? or is it my Resume has a problem? Even though I don't have a tech internship I had some individual projects regarding web development and full-stack web development experience.  What is the smart way to apply for the jobs? 

Thank you in advance and have a nice evening!"

I’m a rising senior. My math training is not very related to CS. However, I’m interested in machine learning/AI/cryptography and am considering graduating a semester late so I can double major in CS instead. This would allow me to get a master’s degree in CS from my school too (adding on another year and a half on top of the extra semester). I attend a top 5, which is amazing for CS and I’m sort of regretting not spending more time exploring our resources. Right now, I don’t have the GPA or research experience to get into anywhere like a top 5 for a CS PhD, so I think this might be my only chance to explore these opportunities. 

But that takes me out of the job market for another semester at least and my parents don’t think it’s worth it. If I were going to just do software engineering, I’d agree, but I suspect I might be interested in something more research-based or that requires more advanced coursework. Thoughts?"

ogp4o7,40,2021-07-09,Don't fret so much about undergrad acceptances rates - it gets way easier for grad school (master's)!,glutton2000,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ogp4o7/dont_fret_so_much_about_undergrad_acceptances/,"Just wanted to chime in here and show an example. If you wanted to go to a T20 undergrad for a liberal arts degree like say, Urban Studies, you'd be looking at 10-20% acceptance rates (depending on the regular factors like ED vs Reg, hooks, ability to pay, etc).

Now pretend you are Joe Shmoe and went to a regular cheap state school like University of Kansas or Florida State or Texas A&amp;M (or whatever), and reserved your T20 applications for a grad/professional master's degree in Urban Planning. The difference is STARK and weirdly some of the public schools have lower acceptances than Ivy's.

Case in point:

* Michigan - 90%
* Columbia - 85%
* NYU - high 70s
* Cornell, Penn - 60s
* Rutgers, UIUC, UNC, UW - 50-60%

There are a few outliers like Berkeley, MIT, and Harvard, who all have rates in the 20-30% range, but even those are higher than their respective undergrad rates. Note that numbers above are from pre-pandemic (2016, 2017 - earliest available).

Now obviously I chose a very niche field but I think the general fact of getting into a master's program being way easier than the same program at undergrad still applies across a lot of fields. Why? Because whether for good or for bad, master's programs are cash generators for universities (separate topic for another day).

That being said, a few great things come out of this approach:

* You get to keep your mental sanity in high school/college and actually slow down to enjoy it
* You may save a lot of money for undergrad, depending on your financial aid package
* You get the brand name as your terminal degree, which is the one most people care about anyway
* You are paying for only \~2 years instead of 4. You do the math.

I was Joe Shmoe and this is my story of how I saved money in my educational career. Doesn't mean I wasn't a good student in high school (quite the opposite, I was a pretty good, well-rounded student from a large, well-regarded suburban public school with ECs, volunteering, some APs and some local awards). But I was far from being stellar/valedictorian level. So for people like me who didn't even bother applying in undergrad, this path offered a great solution. For people like my friend who got rejected for undergrad, he came right back around and was accepted for master's. So he still graduated from his dream school, having saved a ton of money and having had cool/fun experiences in college and post college. Does it really matter when or at what level he graduated (except I guess, if you care about the freshman dorm experience, but you can get that in many colleges)?

***Caveats:***

* Note that this doesn't apply to PhDs, funded research master's or other super competitive professional degrees like MBA, Medicine, Law, etc. And it obviously doesn't apply for people who don't ever get a grad degree. But based on who's on this sub and based on what many liberal arts majors at T20s eventually do, seems like most people will go on to get grad degrees of some kind (with a major exception being all the CS folks, but even some of them will go on to get M.Engg's).
* Grad school admissions is not as wildly random as undergrad. You need to show exactly why you are choosing that department, that degree, that school. You need to apply to each school separately, there is no Common App. You need to show related experience through coursework, internships, and/or volunteer or life experience and how that made a logical progression to you choosing that program for your Master's Degree and what you hope to do with it. So some of the high acceptance rates are likely self-selecting. But they're still way higher than undergrad.
* These numbers can and will likely change 4-6 years from now when you are considering applying to master's programs. But that's more a reflection of the current state of the economy than applicant strength (grad admissions get more competitive during recessions since there are fewer jobs out there, rates increase when the economy is doing well). So to an extent, my 2016, 2017 numbers above are reflective of admissions cycles during a strong economy. I can't yet compare to current times in a recession because those numbers aren't released (they will take years). But I doubt they would take like a giant nosedive."

as someone who's been here forever, holy shit. the college grind started in 7th grade. people have already been paying (literally) hundreds of thousands of dollars for college counselors, padded EC's, lab work &amp; internships, and extremely expensive niche classes; all while still going on 6 expensive vacations a year and demanding the school give us more breaks. we're not even in 10th grade yet.

my senior friend (and someone i've looked up to for years) has made millions of dollars in investing, and provides a service for it that also has made thousands of dollars. my middle school crush (whom i briefly went on dates with lmao) is poised to be a big shot tennis player. she's one of the smartest, kindest and most ambitious people i've ever met. one of the tiktok trio girls (charli/madi/avani) went to my school for a couple of years, and still visits some of my friend's houses from time to time. 

my former friend (in my grade) regularly gets featured in local papers for her charity work. (it's because her parents are good friends with many of the people involved, but of course college admissions people won't know that. she's a double stanford legacy). there are more people with ivy/stanford/MIT legacy than there are people without. i could go on and on about this.

sure, i'm smart, but compared to applicants from my school, i look *lazy.* the 1300 SAT that i got as a freshie means nothing, because a 1500+ as a sophomore is normal. the 8-9APs i plan on self studying (because i'm genuinely interested in them) by the end of senior year mean nothing, because everyone else is spending a quarter of the time and doing 3x more APs just by hiring tutors. i can't do any extremely impressive ECs, or most ECs in general, because my parents literally don't have the time or money for it. they've given up everything for me to go to this school.

one girl in my grade (on the national youth soccer team for our age) flat out told me that i have no chance at college admissions, and that i'm probably gonna go to CC. sorry that i was born to 2 immigrants with a very low salary while you were born to harvard and vandy grads with over $700k+ of income a year :/ this girl is touted as one of the ""poorer"" kids, too. in quarantine, during PE zoom class 2 schoolyears ago, we were playing some game where you had to run around your house and show items to the camera. the teacher joked that this girl would win, because ""her house is SOOOO tiny compared to everyone else's house!!!"". this girl's room is half the size of my house.

there's another girl in my grade who is very similar to me (same drive, ambition, goals, work ethic, and clothing style lmao), except her parents are rich as fuck, so she can get away with anything she wants. her parents literally threaten teachers if they give her anything below an A average.

i really like coming to A2C (and i do my best not to come here *too* often) because even though people emphasize how much other people on this sub (and mostly chanceme) are fluffing up their applications just to look impressive, it seems way more tame than my school environment does. the whole helping-each-other-out-because-howthehelldoyougetintocollegeanyways vibe is so much nicer than the blatant misuse of resources and elitism i see every day.

\- a rising 10th grader who is watching all my classmates be on expensive vacations a quarter of my parents' salary worth while i alternate between exercising and studying. my school has given me so much and i am eternally grateful, but god it's a mindfuck to watch completely undeserving people get everything and realize that this is how it's going to go for the rest of my life"

Although it's very likely I won't get both, I'm still stressing about what to do if I did get offers from both, and would appreciate any advice. 

Company A is a well known international company. I've interacted with their products since I was a kid, so it would be an awesome experience to work for them. Because they are so well known, I feel like it would give me an advantage in future jobs. 
The downsides are that it is not located on my city, so I would have to relocate (which they would support) to a city far from home where I have no friends or family. The other downside is that it is a software engineer in test position, and I've heard it can sometimes be hard to transition from test to actual development, which is what I would prefer. 

Company B is also international, but definitely not as well known. I hadn't heard of them before. They don't necessarily work on something I'm passionate about, but I just love to code and it's for the experience anyway. 
The advantage is that it's based in my city, and is just a software engineering role, not SDET. 

So I have a few questions.
1. Is it ready that hard to transition out of SDET?
2. How much would future employers value me working in a well known company?
3. How hard is it relocating for work (even though it's temporary)?
4. Overall, which one would you pick personally?

I'm also thinking that if I got offered a graduate job at company A at the end of the internship, I would really wouldn't want to relocate permanently for my first job.

I know that get\_cert =/= get\_job, but I am simultaneously working on certifications, firstly, because I like the additional knowledge I gain while studying for them. Secondly, I feel that certs could give me an edge (to at least get an interview if nothing else) over others graduating with the same degree...especially if they don't have the fancy-sounding tag at the end of their degree (i.e. ""BS in Computer Science with a concentration in Cyber Security"")

It is probably worth noting that I am an older student, so when I graduate I will be 31. If that matters for anything. Also, I spend much of my free time doing Tryhackme for now, but I am working my way to the bigger simulators. I do this for fun, not out of obligation.

With at least one good internship and the rest of what I said,  I would like to land a DevSecOps job right out of college. If not that, then maybe spend a year or so as a SOC Analyst, and then DevSecOps.

I actually do both ERP and CRM  consulting - to a degree - which is a rarity in the industry. My  employer is a single-owner shop, family-business type of deal. We have 2  types of resources: functional and technical consultants. While  functional consultants mostly do the same, there's two of us that stand  out and project lead, me and our household engineer. Fairly flat  structure. There's the boss, and everyone else is flat underneath.  There's a few resources lower than that, but we're talking interns and  the occasional junior resource we put on trial. Interns, which I'm also  officially-unofficially in charge of.

**2020**

When  the pandemic went into full lockdown, we went into full overtime. While  some projects were pushed forward a few months, some other customers  went into overdrive. Since my major delivery for 2020 was pushed from  march to september, I was reassigned a perpetual improvement and support  customer to offload a colleague. That customer turned out to be our  largest customer (in customer revenue) to date, and 2nd largest project  (in billables hours/amounts) in the history of the company. Close to  $1Bn in revenue with a world-wide presence. In contrast, we're a shop of  20-ish guys breaking the $1m revenues for the first time in 3 years. I  had the presence of mind to push questioning and opened up major work on  their system, including R&amp;D on our own Intellectual Property (IP).

Parallel  to that, when my initially postponed project came back to life, it went  sour. Go live was a mess, and the customer put every effort on hold  while challenging about 100k worth of invoice. Totally killed my  confidence in myself and almost sent me on a burn out, as I had wored  8AM-3AM shifts about a dozen nights in a row to get them live on time.

When  they came back with the challenge, I was waiting for them with the  receipts. Destroyed every single arguments about project control and  finances they came up with. Fast forward to today, they're now a  reference customer and bringing us references. So, I must have done  something right.

**2021**

This is when this gets complicated.

While  dealing with the previously mentioned challenge, my major customer went   into full production. Had 3 projects running parallel, plus daily  support. Had anywhere from 2 to 6 devs working with me at any given  time, and it was rarely enough.

We  had a situation during most of the first half of 2021 where we had  technical resource shortage, mixed with poor global production planning.  This lead us to have multiple issues simultaneously where projects were  due at the same time, with not enough work time on the calendar to  deliver it all. Remember my colleague I took workload off from, well  he's my  engineer. Well, his projects always appeared more important  than mine, even if they were clearly smaller than mine, and my dev time  always passed second to the point I would regularly do multiple tasks on  multiple projects simultaneously with a dedicated dev. Not an ideal  situation, but it got shit done. Late, but done.

**Now.**

Now, I'm on parental leave.

Before  leaving, we had another little mess with workload. Again, I was not  able to get my workload properly into the devgroup's calendar. All the  time was allocated to my engineer friend. Moreover, my last work week, I  was stuck doing support instead of working on passing knowledge to  assume transition. Meaning the last week I had prior the baby's arrival,  instead of focusing on getting things ready, I winded up working 60-ish  hours. Worst - out of professionalism and respect toward my major  customer, I accepted to make myself available a few times a week for  schedules calls. Turns out, instead of 1-2 hours a week, I'm doing more  8-9 hours because I was not allocated enough time to document and pass  knowledge to my team.

I'm going back to the office in a few of weeks, and my annual revue is within weeks of my return.

**Redefining my position**

This is where I need your help.

My title right now is some half ass bullshit that means nothing.

I've  been spending time thinking on how to best define my position/role, in  case I have to move on. Here a more or less exhaustive list of what I  do: (order is meaningless)

* Business analysis
* Functional design
* User training/support
* Project management
* Area  of knowledge: accounting (advanced), project accounting/management  (advanced), warehousing (not perfect), discreet manufacturing (not  perfect), process manufacturing (basic understanding)
* Presale proposal writting
* Presale discovery/presentation
* Change request production
* Mentorship/coaching
* Workload management (individual, team and global)
* Team lead/management
* Technical jargon

I've  been talking with contacts in the corporate/institutional IT scene, and  was told I might be becoming ""too versatile"" for that part of the  industry.

Here's what I know I'm not.

While  I'm good at presale, I dislike it. But, I'm able to adjust my lingo and  presence for any audience from C-Suite down to the ground floor worker.  (for project delivery as well - btw)

While  I'm a great solution designer and BA, I'm not technical enough to  warrant the solution architect label. I produce great designs that are  simple enough for end user to understand, decision makers to approve and  dev to work from, but I know the requirements of a architecture label  and I'm not it.

I know I'm not a true PM. I've read the PMBOK, but I'm not certified and have no intention of focusing only on this.

I  want to move away from pure, executing, functional consulting. I'm good  at it, not the best, but top tier. But it sometimes bore me.

While  I do know how to code, I haven't done it in years. Parts due to  laziness, parts due to the fact that I have people that are far better  developers than I am. So I focus on other parts. On the other hand, I'm  far more technical than most functional consultants.

**So what am I?**

I've  heard the term ""Project Delivery Manager"", which could be fitting, but  the problem with a small organization is that manager labels cause  problem. We have a few guys, including myself, lining up for management  role. I regularly bring up the role versus position versus tasks  conversation.

**What should I do?**

While  things have been rough lately, my job is like an old pair of shoes.  Comfortable, accommodating, and while there's better-nicer shoes, I  don't want to toss them away. I plan on staying, but the last 6 months  have challenged my long term faith.

For  sure, I'll be asking for a considerable raise during my upcoming  evaluation. Traditionally, I don't even have to ask as my boss knows our  value and is quite forthcoming. On the other hand, a small business as  limited potential.

I know for a  fact I'm not corp material. While not unruly, I know my way can get shit  done better and faster than waiting on corp to act. So public sector,  banks, major establishments are out of the question. My career goal  would be IT Director. I don't think considering CTO or VP IT would be  reasonable considering my current path and education. Also, got kids at  home with a career driven SO. I have the potential to slow down my  career at some point too to stay home.

I'm  actually on the fence about accelerating or slowing down my career. The  work/life balance for me is quite critical. Which I had before 2020.  Had a good beat, maybe too slow. But 2020 was an absolute insanity, and  the compensation didn't feel appropriate.

I would in no way change for another ERP vendor. No point in changing four quarters for a dollar.

Thank you for bearing with me."

I've been hating my internship. It is at a fortune 500 company, but there's just a lot of things that really frustrate me about it.

* Different timezones. Since its a remote position, its understandable I would have to get up a little earlier. However, because the team also works with people in India, the mandatory meetings are always at 4:15 &amp; 4:30 AM in my timezone. Obviously, the solution is just to sleep earlier, but as someone who struggles to sleep early due to both noisy neighbors &amp; body issues, its really hard to consistently wake up at that time. Bosses have been wishy-washy about it, saying ""oh yeah, that's 100% way too early. Its ok if you skip some"" and the next day they'd email me berating me for missing a meeting.
* The work. Haha, I know. Internships are meant to be your introduction to the working world and is meant to be difficult. But I really haven't gotten anything done within the past week. Mostly because everytime I have a question, my code-pair partner would somewhat dodge it by saying ask another person, or to try to research it. I know she means well, but her explanations / guidance is as vague as I've made it appear. I feel so lost working, meanwhile my fellow intern is already merging onto the test branch. I feel a little hopeless in comparison.
* Business ""speak"". I can carry a normal conversation easily. The second it becomes business professional, I just freeze up. I've already been told by my bosses to ""be more bold"" but a lot of the time I just cannot think of anything to speak. My code pair partner told me that's one negative thing that the manager/boss has discussed with them. Its not even that the company has an oppressive feel to it, its just so fake its hard to keep interested within the conversations.
* Burnout. The previous semester was HORRIBLE in terms of burnout. By the end of the semester I did not want to code at all. ~~got straight A's though~~ So when it came time to start the internship I was just not feeling good about having to create code again and admittedly was dreading it.
* Work part 2 - Its web development. Having been exposed to a little bit of the work, I tried web development and it was absolutely not for me. It is hard to explain, but I do not find it fun at all. Adding onto it, the project I am on is about **adding on** to legacy code, which is absolutely the most abhorrent code I have ever seen. There is no concern for documentation, many pages have little to no documentation, the most I'll see is a Ticket number which it belongs to. So when my partners / coworkers just tell me to ""read other source files to get it"" it becomes difficult pairing that with the lack of knowledge about web dev. It is not fun. And to finally wrap this part up, I **have** been asking my coworkers for help, but a lot of them are busy getting their own tickets done (they're due next week) and don't really have the time to properly support me. Which makes me feel worse at the job 
* Am I just being too childish? I'm halfway through the internship, there's five weeks left. But I really haven't been enjoying the past two in which I've been doing the actual programming.   


I'd really like to know everyone's feedback and or advice."

I would appreciate a list of schools/programs to look into!

I'm wrapping up my CS undergrad this year at a top Canandian uni with a 3.98/4.00 and I'm hoping to do a part time (probably course based) master's alongside an industry job.

I've had 2 Fortune 100 internships &amp; 1 at a Unicorn. I have two conference research papers, but generally my experience is more oriented towards tech projects/design teams. 

Seeking advice on programs where I can take cool courses at a well-recognized school. I feel like I'm not a bad candidate, but maybe not the strongest. E.g. I'm afraid of only applying to top schools to get only receive rejections.

P.S. I love InfoSec, CompBio, and Quantum, but I'm open to any specialization.

Thank you so much!!!"
ogy3de,201,2021-07-09,SpaceX-mania- does standing out in aerospace necessitate bad work-life balance?,AnAngryBirdMan,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/ogy3de/spacexmania_does_standing_out_in_aerospace/,"I am a sophomore mechanical engineering student basically afraid of what my future in the aerospace industry might entail. This fall I landed a propulsion engineering internship with a great small-medium well established startup, which I'm looking forward to and has me thinking about what my career after it might be. 

Which brings me to SpaceX. I don't know if I can bear to read ""you just have to enjoy the work!"" or ""if you want to do boring things go work at a defense company for 40 hrs/wk!"" one more  time. I do not understand in the slightest how people can really think those things and it has me questioning myself. Is it crazy to not want to contribute your whole life and being to a company? I'm pretty sure it's not, but there are hordes of people ready to do it for SX, which is what enables their terrible work conditions in the first place. I see a lot of people say they ""couldn't be happier to help with such a great mission!"" which somehow lets them forget about being treated like a subhuman slave who shouldn't do anything but work..?? I also see a lot of people say they're in it for the resume boost after leaving SX and that it opens up all the doors you could ever want, but I've seen almost the same amount of people say it is a net zero or even negative compared to other aerospace companies where your job duties are the same.

More generally, I'm worried that the only way people get prestigious positions or promoted in aerospace is by working more, which I'm not interested in. I'm not opposed to up to ~50hr/wk consistently (of course there will be crunch sometimes) but anything beyond that is a hard no. And just to be clear- I'm SUPER into aerospace! A majority of things I do in my free time is aerospace-related, even. But it's my free time. 

Two questions:

How true is it that working at SpaceX opens up all the doors you could ever need, relative to a similar position at another aerospace company (where you're not working 100hrs/wk)?

Does truly standing out in the aerospace field require some level of sacrificing work-life balance?"

ogzfrm,23,2021-07-09,My experience job hunting with 2 YOE and takeaways,zed654321,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ogzfrm/my_experience_job_hunting_with_2_yoe_and_takeaways/,"I am currently a Software Engineer with 2 years of experience. I studied at my midwest city’s college and graduated with a 3.4 GPA/5 internships which means it took 5 years to graduate. 


I’ve always read that 2-3 years of experience is the ideal time to look to job swap/get a raise. So in 2021 I finally decided to update my resume and build side projects. Overall, it took a few weeks to get a resume I was comfortable with and ~2 months to build a few projects I was comfortable with putting on the resume. Honestly the easiest part of the side projects was building them. The documentation, testing, releasing the software, writing READMEs, responding to user feedback, and setting up advertising took longer than the coding. I really think that part was more valuable to the software than my coding itself. 


After this, I very casually started looking for jobs. I’d apply to 2-3 places a week. I mainly used LinkedIn to find open positions. Overall I applied to ~20 places before I got my first interview. Upon interviewing with this company, I decided to no longer apply to new places. Looking back, that was not ideal. The entire interview process took over 6 weeks, 7 interviews. Overall I was pleased with the company and would happily accept an offer. 


They sent me an offer which was a 22% raise. I negotiated for more PTO, but they declined. They then agreed to a 28% increase instead. I accepted the offer. Leaving hard number numbers out.


This past week, I quit my current job. They countered with an 11% increase and full-time work from home. I’ve read you should never accept a counter offer for a plethora of reasons. Even if they matched the other companies offer, it still wouldn't have been worth it. I've read ~80% of people who take the counter offer leave within 1 year anyways due to finding another opportunity or getting fired. 


TLDR/Takeways if you don’t care about my story:

* Job swapping is the main way to get more money
* Not happy about your current job? It might be easier than you think to find a new one now that you have experience
* Getting your second job is infinitely easier than your first
* You get all the power at your current company by threatening/choosing to leave. Use it wisely. They could also fire you on the spot. 
* Use indeed articles/YouTube to learn about each step of the interview process, negotiating salary, and much more about your career. As I’m still in the early stages of my career, these resources were invaluable to understand how to have these conversations. 
* Be professional the entire time and never bad mouth anyone
* Soft skills and preparation for conversations along the entire interview process are much more important than your technical skills - assuming you have solid tech skills already
* Interview everywhere you can"

Sometimes I feel like going a-back to school to get my masters in design, but I can’t quit my job, I have car payments, credit cards and more and it would be expensive to go to school. There are people in my graduating class who got amazing jobs before even graduating and my design work is just as good as their. I just don’t understand what is going on. There are even people 3 years younger than me from the same college I went to, who are now getting design firm and art director positions. So I just feel like shit and idk what to do anymore. Do I keep trying? i applied to two places this past 3 weeks ago and I haven’t heard back at all. I have been working on my Portfolio and even complately re-doing some of my projects, including my capstone project.

any advice would be very appreciated."

I currently work in a really basic IT job, my goal is to be a software developer, and the company I do the IT job at outsources all the development of their software. My question is as follows: Is it worth my time to work at this job or should I spend the time I work at this job learning more CS fundamentals and work on side projects to secure an internship? I don't need the money from this IT job and it's not paying that well anyways.  I'm just now taking DSA this summer. 

I have school projects in java and c++ but they are like super basic programs. I feel I need to work on more elaborate side projects and to practice interview challenges but between school and working I don't have that much free time to do these side projects."

Would love to gather your take. I finished a diploma program from locally well known technical institute. After finishing the program, I'm eligible to pursue a Bachelor in CS. The program is very part-time friendly and it allows me to take the majority of my required courses in the evening time. Which would allow me to work on the daytime.

After months of being on the hunt, I was able to secure a job at a startup with $67.5k annual salary as a fresh new grad (This is probably low for reddit standard but I'm pretty happy with it).

I've decided that I wanted to pursue the bachelor part time and it would take me roughly 2-3 years depending on how heavy of a course load I'm willing to take per semester.  Being a student, I would be eligible to pursue internships.  I've never had an internship when I was enrolling in my diploma program and was one of the things I wish I did. It definitely would've helped my initial job hunt a lot easier. With that being said, now that I've landed a role would you guys suggest that I try to go get an internship at a medium-big name companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Shopify etc.) or should I just stay and progress my career through work experience."

oh9e1r,5,2021-07-09,How do I salvage my internship?,flare2000x,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/oh9e1r/how_do_i_salvage_my_internship/,"Background:

Finished 3rd year studying mech eng in Canada. Signed up to do a 12 month long internship. Had good grades, design team, worked hard on cover letters/resume, etc. Ended up not having that much luck - one company (small particle accelerator component company) had a position for me but covid meant they didn't have the budget at the time. Another offer from an aerospace startup ended up in my junk mail - lesson learned there! I ended up with two offers, one in a bad location, seemed like the work would be pretty mundane - they told me in the interview it would be very repetitive. It was for the national parks working on canal rehabilitation. I would have also needed to buy a car. My other offer which I accepted was in a much better location, seemed similarly mundane, working for a mechanical contractor. The title was Project Coordinator, but I was recruited at the engineering career fair and in the interview I was told I'd be working on drawings, frequently working in the field, and the company seemed like a good one to work for.

Turns out I screwed up. The company doesn't do any engineering whatsoever and I feel like I got scammed a bit. When they talked to me about drawings I assumed I would be assisting with actually making the designs, at most all I do is upload pdfs and send emails. The rest of my job is compiling pdf files for O&amp;M manuals, copying and pasting stuff in financial spreadsheets, and doing mundane tasks for project managers. I haven't been to a single site visit and there's no sign of that changing. I feel very mislead about how technical the position would be - I desparately just want to do a single calculation or make a CAD file or write a line of code! I've asked my supervisor (not an engineer) if there's anything more technical I can get involved in and he just told me he can get me more work on the administrative and budget side of things which is totally the opposite way I want to go.

Basically, this job is not giving me the experience I was expecting and hoping to get out of a 12-month internship. While all my friends and peers are working for defense contractors, power companies, tech industry, aerospace, doing interesting design work or at least actual engineering (and all making at least 4$/hr more than I am from the people I've asked), I'm rotting away twiddling my thumbs in a cubicle waiting for someone to send me another shop drawing to upload....

**I know I can't go back and change my mistake - I need to figure out how to go forward from here.** My goals for my internship were to gain experience doing actual engineering, preferably in the aerospace or marine industry as that is where I want to end up after I graduate. However, if I leave my current job, I will have to leave the formal internship program at my school (won't be considered a full-time student, won't get course credits, might have a bunch of other issues, etc.)

I have started looking for a new job anyway. I hope to quit at the end of the summer and start a new job in the fall, even if just a 4 month term - I can look for another one for the winter or go back to school. I can't go back to school in september as I have nowhere to live at uni at the moment. I reccently had an interview that went well with an engineering firm that is mostly geotech/civil related, but I would be working in the mechanical division working on hydroelectric dam construction/refurbishment design - gates, pumps, CFD of penstocks and intakes, etc. It's not my preferred field but it's a start, and I would at least be working under engineers and doing design/analysis work rather than moving pdf files around. I also sent out applications to a few other places.

While I'm here, I'm trying to make the most of the situation - I was on the rocketry team at my uni and I've managed to join the team of the university in the city where I'm now living so at least I get a little bit of satisfying work and fun.

Mainly I want to ask for any general advice - what should or should I not be doing in this case, anything important I should know? Anything I've done right so far, or anything I've mentioned that seems like a horrible idea?

My last question is how important is it to have an internship in the field that I want to work in after I graduate? I feel very behind the curve in this respect since most of my close friends landed amazing internships and it is a bit depresseing seeing them all enjoying their work, getting paid well (up to 50% more than I am), and learning a ton while I am in the situation I'm in, and even if I can land a new job it probably won't be in the area I want to be in.

Thanks to anyone who's read this far and I would be really grateful for any advice you may have!


TL:DR

Got roped into a completely administrative non-technical internship - what can I do to salvage my situation?"

So I’m almost getting my degree and I’m already looking at job opportunities and some courses that may be interesting to take. But i wanted to ask you what kind of skills do you think are the best to develop in order to stand out from other IEs. 

For example: during my studies so far I’ve only learned how to program in python, but they didn’t really teach me how to use it for real things, same with R. So I asume that would be a good start.

Also I’m really interested in getting into a Supply Chain internship, what do you think about that and what do you think may help me in that field?

Thank you so much for reading!"

My hs isn't really that competitive but every year there are a few students that do a lot of stuff - many through connections. Some of my friends are research assistents and interns at companies through their parent's connections. I can't help but feel bad about myself for not being able to do as many things. They are all very talented and smart individuals - i'm not trying to sell them short.

I just don't know how to deal with it as my ECs are not very impressive nor do I have same level of connections (most of their parents are professors at the top uni in my state or high officers). By no means is thier position solely obtained through connections, but those do help when searching - especially when most programs are closed.

Compared to them, I feel like a wet raddish freshly pulled out of soil in a large jungle. I know ECs aren't everything but i'm confident in their essay writing skills and stats. How do I deal with myself and these weird feelings of incompetence and envy? **I don't want to feel this way to friends** and would like to stop being salty."

Most of my knowledge comes from my personal projects and the work I did in my previous internships. However, my background has not proven 'enough' to allow me to find work in the ML field as of yet.

A professor of mine, which I have worked with in the past doing ML research has offered me a PhD position in his lab, and I'm interested. My issue is that the idea of staying in the same university for five more years when I could be working is a little daunting.

I currently have the opportunity to work an unrelated industry that will not allow me to use my data science or machine learning skills (meaning I will likely have to do all the work and learning in my own time.)

My end goal is to work in machine learning, be it doing applied research or just  being a machine learning engineer. My software fundamentals aren't particularly great either: I better versed in data science than CS in my current background.

What should I take into consideration while making my decision: should I work or continue my studies for 5 more years in order to get a PhD?"

Can someone help me with the timeline of when FAANG and other big companies start their hiring process? Also, how can I get referrals and when would be the right time to ask for them?

I would love some advice about preparing for the interviews. I am aware of LeetCode and am trying to solve 5-6 questions per day. Something you wish someone had told you when you were at this stage?

I was very self conscious in feeling the way that I did. I have never come across a more caring community that has been willing to be firm with honesty while maintaining empathy. Hopefully I can use the things I have learned to pay it forward on to anyone struggling with similar issues. 

I’m currently an intern for IT at a company. I started a few months ago, and have been working around 30 hours a week while maintains full time at a university and raising a child. I bust my ass at this company every day. IT has been insane with the pandemic. I successfully imaged and tested over 400 devices for our work from home employees within the first 3 weeks with little to no IT experience. 

My manager has not been in office until the past week where he has been at his desk consistently. One of of my coworkers that I do not get a long with made a comment to my manager about how i will take on multiple tasks and never complete them. There is some truth to this, but I know the truth and that is that I make high priority tasks my priority. If she asks me to throw some cardboard out, and an executive needs a laptop imaged, I will prioritize the laptop. This rubs her the wrong way and takes offense in thinking I’m ignoring her. She told my boss this and I had a meeting for the first time in person. I asked him about jobs opening up.  


My dream job is within System Administration and there are a couple of jobs opening up. I was absolutely grilled because of the comments that my coworker gave him. He stated that he doesn’t think he could recommend me if a position in infrastructure opened up. This is now his only impression of me. He has not been in office to see the constant work that I have been doing the past 4 months. I was unable to defend myself because I was so thrown off. There were no compliments on my work performance over the past 4 months. Only comments on the things I have been doing wrong. I want to tell him that his perception is wrong,and that I am busting my ass but I don’t know how to say it professionally. Should I just drop it, or is this the time to defend myself?"

ohm9h8,3,2021-07-10,Ethics in Journalism Dilemma,RememberRossetti,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ohm9h8/ethics_in_journalism_dilemma/,"
I’m having a real ethical issue. I’m not a journalism student, but I have a real interest in pursuing journalism as a career. Because of this, I’ve pursued a number of internships with nonprofit organizations having to do with foreign affairs for which I’ve written several articles.

My most recent one is driving me wild. It is about an Afghan militia leader who is currently trying to reverse Taliban advances. I wrote the piece after my internship manager conducted an interview with said militia leader. He gave me a transcript of the interview and I used it when writing.

I wrote a fair piece, one that acknowledged the bravery and progress of said militia leader while also recognizing the failures and potential long-term problems that could result from a militia-led resistance.

The piece was published and I thought it was done. Then, my boss edited it and republished it today without consulting me. Frankly, the piece reads more like propaganda now. Some of the more annoying changes include: 

-opinions on how Biden’s withdrawal was “brutal” for the Afghan government and that it furnished a “psychological morale” for the Taliban, heavily suggesting that the withdrawal was a bad decision

-claiming that said militia leader has “thousands” of fighters (unverifiable)

-removing any reference to the fact that the main district retaken by this militia leader was retaken by the Taliban 24 hours later

Perhaps these issues seem small, but they fundamentally alter the nature of the piece. What was once a balanced report of one militia leader’s actions now feels like a sympathetic propaganda piece for a leader who could prove quite harmful. Thankfully, I’m barely credited for the article. My internship manager put their name as the primary author and mine is barely visible.

My internship manager is a very nice guy and has been a great mentor, but on this point I’m frustrated and don’t have the rapport with him to bring this up in a comfortable way.

I’d love advice on what to do. I feel conflicted, frustrated, and a bit betrayed. I wouldn’t like to reveal my identity or else I’d share the article, but does anyone have advice? Am I making a mountain out of a molehill?"

On the Monday that just past, most primary and secondary school students, as well as students from junior college, ended their June holidays and went back to school. They began home-based learning (HBL) since 19 May, and had four weeks of holidays, hence stayed away from school for 1.5 months.

Having experienced HBL during last year’s Circuit Breaker (CB) period, both students and parents were better able to adapt. To be able to return to school according to plan, under the backdrop of a pandemic, looks to be a sign of things under control and a return to ‘normal’ life.

Students go to school not just to acquire knowledge. The interaction with teachers and fellow students, the intellectual stimulation and emotional maturation through group activities – these cannot be replaced by HBL. But all these experiences of on-campus student life had to take a step back, in the face of strict safe distancing guidelines. As such, the so-called ‘normal’ return to school life, is anything but normal.

From primary, secondary, post-secondary till university, although we would not like to label these students as the ‘coronavirus generation’, coronavirus has undeniably affected their activities and scholastic plans, even changing the path of their life goals.

In the face of a pandemic, certain interactions and experiences that would have belonged to students and their peers, have been compromised, simplified or even digitalised.

Co-curricular activities (CCA), an important component of one’s schooling days, have been forced to constantly adjust due to the pandemic. Course and campus open days have become virtual tours. Orientation programmes for incoming students have also been brought online. Furthermore, exchange and overseas immersion programmes across schools and faculties have been made to go online or even cancelled; their experience discounted or virtualised. Although students live in reality, they are unable to enjoy the satisfaction and benefits of actual physical interaction.

Many of our previous schooling memories that we hold dear till today – CCA rehearsals, performing on-stage in front of an audience, staying back after school to revise and chat with friends – these are no longer a given for current students. Even if the newly graduated were lucky enough to find a job, they can only stay at home despite joining the workplace, traversing within a virtual office space set up online, talking with colleagues who are strangers.

These people are adept with operating computers, and use social media to communicate online, but they might not agree to learning and interacting online in the long-term.

A third-year university student shared that the pandemic has plagued her for two academic years; she feels that her entire university experience has been ‘buried’. Without interaction with people across different faculties, she has made very few friends in university. Although she was staying in university halls, her interaction with other students were similarly curtailed, hence she decided to end her halls life early. She now hopes to be able to put on a gown and attend a physical graduation ceremony, when she graduates next year.

Furthermore, for JC 2 students, almost all of their two short years in JC have been ‘kidnapped’ by the pandemic. They entered JC last year and barely had any chance to experience the college’s culture and activities. Now, they are left with their final few months to prepare for the upcoming A levels.

Thinking back, many of the friendships we gained and connections we made were established in post-secondary and university. If this crucial social circle is compressed by the pandemic, what sort of regret will this bring about for the students’ future?

Since last year, the government has launched a series of initiatives to help graduating cohorts look for jobs and gain internship experiences. From the angle of the economy and encouraging employment, these initiatives have – as the government says – ‘prevented the emergence of a coronavirus generation’, to a certain extent. However, whilst the country remains focused on battling the pandemic, we should not neglect the long-term effects towards our children and teenagers.

Often, students have to rely on their individual adaptability, resilience and the positive redirection of adults around them, to walk out of the shadow of this pandemic. The history of this pandemic is still being written by us; we should be aware that our actions today, the policies we enact, will have a long-lasting impact on the future of today’s youth.

Moving ahead, when we learn to live with the virus and live life normally, as the ministry formulates relevant plans and policies, it should not merely ensure students accomplish their academic goals. They should strike a balance between safe management and providing a comprehensive schooling experience, to help students regain that which was kidnapped by the pandemic – CCAs, group activities, overseas exchanges, human connections as well as shared memories.

　　剛過去的星期一，中小學大部分的學生和初級學院及高中生，結束了6月假期回校上課。他們之前從5月19日就開始居家學習，繼而放了四個星期的學校假期，離開學校有約一個半月的時間。

　　經歷了去年病毒阻斷措施期間近一個月的居家學習，學生和家長對於學校的關閉與重開也更能適應和配合。能夠在疫情下，按原定開學日期重返校園上課，看似一種疫情受控、回歸「正常」生活的象徵。

　　學生上學讀書，不只為了求取知識，和教師、同學之間的互動交流，參與群體活動帶來的腦力激盪與情感培養，都不是居家學習上網課所能取代的。但這些校園學習生活所帶給學生的意義與體驗，在遵守抗疫安全措施的前提下，都得讓步。因此，所謂回到正常的校園生活，其實早已不「如常」。

　　從小學、中學、高中到大專學府，我們雖然不願意將這批學生稱為「冠病一代」，但無可否認的，冠病對他們的活動和求學規劃都有一定的影響，甚至改變人生目標的發展軌道。

　　一些本來屬於他們與同屆學生應該擁有的接觸和體驗，面對疫情，不得不屈就、簡化，再不然就「數碼化」。

　　求學生涯中佔重要部分的課程輔助活動，為因應疫情，不時調整活動方式；向學生推介課程和活動的校園開放日變成虛擬之旅；幫助新生融入學校文化與環境的迎新會也轉為線上。再者，原有的跨院校跨學系的交流和海外浸濡活動，有的取消，有的上網舉行，一切的體驗不是打折，就是虛擬化。學生雖然活在現實中，卻無法體會實際互動所帶來的滿足與收穫。

　　不少我們至今擁有的珍貴校園回憶，如群聚投入課外活動的排練、站在有觀眾的舞台表演、放學後和學習小組成員留下來溫書、聊天，對如今學生來說，都不是理所當然的。即使剛畢業很幸運地找到工作，投入職場後卻只能待在家裡，遊走於網絡搭建的虛擬辦公空間，與陌生的同事線上交談。

　　他們是善於操作電腦，使用網上社媒溝通的一代，但未必認同長期的網絡學習與交流方式。

　　一個大學三年級生反映，疫情已佔據她近兩個學年，她感覺整個大學的體驗都被「埋沒」。少了跨系之間的交流，她在大學結交的朋友不多，原本住宿舍，也因為和其他學生的交流受限而認為沒有意思，提早結束了寄宿生活。她現在的希望是明年畢業時，能夠穿上畢業袍，參加實體畢業禮。

　　此外，那些初院二年級的學生，高中生活只有短短兩年，就幾乎被疫情「綁架」了。他們去年入學，還沒有太多機會領會學校的文化與活動，如今剩下最後幾個月，只能用來應付A水準會考。

　　回想起來，我們現今保持來往的朋友、結交的人脈，很多是在高中和大學時期建立的，如果這樣重要的社交圈子因為冠病被壓縮了，對學生的將來會造成怎樣的缺憾？

　　政府自去年推出了系列措施，幫助應屆高等學府畢業生找工作和取得實習機會，從促進就業、經濟的層面上看，這些措施或在一定的程度上，如政府所說的，能「避免冠病一代出現」。但是，當國家聚焦應對疫情的同時，也不能忽視這個非常時期對兒童和青少年的長遠影響。

　　很多時候，學生能否走出冠病的陰影，還是要靠自己的適應能力、韌性和周圍成人的正向引導。人們還在書寫這場大流行病的歷史，須意識到現在所做的一切，所製定和遵循的決策，對於塑造年輕人的未來，以及如何定義冠病一代，都起到深刻影響。

　　下來，我們將邁入與冠病共存，如常生活的階段，教育部與學校在製定與冠病共處的計劃時，不應該止於確保學生完成課業上的目標，也要設法在安全管理和提供完整的校園體驗方面求取平衡，幫學生贖回那些被冠病綁架的課外活動、群體學習、海外交流、人脈情誼，以及共同記憶。

ohp7xt,657,2021-07-10,I have something to confess. I did NOT amputate my own leg.,simulatislacrimis,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ohp7xt/i_have_something_to_confess_i_did_not_amputate_my/,"Usually when I tell people my story, they ask why I haven’t been in the media. They ask me if I’ve heard about Aron Ralston. “He wrote a book about it!” they say.  Yes, I could have be the female version of Aron Ralston. I could have been in the media, telling the amazing story about how I barely survived, how I only made it out because of my mental strength. But that’s Ralston’s story, not mine. Because the story I tell people is a lie. 

I was never that fond of the outdoors. The closest I’ve even been to actually camping is sleeping in a tent at a festival. But in the story I usually tell people, I’d just turned 18 and discovered how much I loved hiking, camping, nature - I suddenly lived and breathed for the great outdoors. I tell people that’s how I ended up in those woods, because I just couldn’t resist exploring, and like Ralston, I’d made a mistake. I forgot to tell anyone where I was going. 

That part is true, though. Nobody knew where I was. But I wasn’t in those woods because I wanted to be close to mother nature, I was there because I’d been invited to a rave by a close friend of mine. Let’s call her Mira. 

Mira and I had met our first year as sixth formers, which is the UK equivalent of high school. Like me, she loved partying. And MDMA. I’m not telling you this because I want you to try MDMA or something, I just want you to know that my passion in life was more sex, drugs and techno than it was hiking, nature and healthy living. But people change all the time. Everybody must have assumed I’d just gotten tired of partying, and just as I discovered a new hobby, I was struck by bad luck. If people didn’t believe me, they at least never let me know.

All of this happened 10 years ago. It’s a bit hard to remember what actually happened, because I’ve lied for so long. Have you ever told a lie so many times you started doubting which version was the truth? I have. Especially because a part of me like the way people look at me when they think I have more in common with Aron Ralston than just being a fellow amputee. It’s better than the way the paramedics looked at me when I told them about the people that took my leg. My entire fucking right leg.

In the story I tell people, the first three days were uneventful. In reality, fucked up things started happening the moment I crossed the threshold between the rest of the world and the woods. I’d been there before. For raves and stuff. I’d maybe been there four or five times before, and the raves hadn’t even been close to the road. But I’d have still have cell service even when I was further in the woods. That day, I couldn’t get reception from the moment I went into the woods, but I just thought it was my phone acting shitty. 

The raves were hidden enough that outsiders wouldn’t just stumble upon them randomly, but there’d still be stuff like coloured lanterns or neon paint on the trees. It wasn’t usually this well-hidden, is what I’m saying. But I wasn’t worried, because I’d been there before. 

I was half an hour late because I had a huge zit on my nose that needed to be dealt with, and then covered up with makeup. So the only thing I was worried about was Mira giving to much of our Molly away to randos. The fact that I hadn’t seen anybody else or that there wasn’t any lanterns or other points of orientation wasn’t that weird. Maybe the police had been at the latest rave and this one was more hush-hush.

I just kept walking, like the fucking moron I was back then. I knew I should have seen or heard the rave by then, but I just kept walking. Then I saw it. It was a mason jar with a tealight in it. A few meters away was another, and then another. I thought I’d finally found the rave. Sure, the mason jars had more of a middle-class white couple getting married vibe than the usual stuff that showed I was heading in the right direction, but they worked out fine. Like a landing strip towards a fun Friday night.

I did think it was weird that I couldn’t hear any music, but sometimes there was problems with the speakers that whoever hosted the raves had brought. I know it sounds like I was a fucking idiot that just kept ignoring every possible red flag, but you gotta understand that these raves were a bit sketchy. I wasn’t like the girl in horror movies that just had to check out the creepy basement. Seriously, if you ever been to the kind of illegal drugs everywhere kinda rave I’m talking about, you know they’re in some real sketchy locations. A few hundred meters into the woods weren’t weird.

I could see what all the mason jars were leading me towards. It was an old building. Or more like a mix between a cabin and a shed, but still. The building had been decorated with fairy lights. Was I interrupting some preparations for a rustic wedding?

I wasn’t. And the barefoot girl that came out from the house, the girl that screamed my name in joy and ran over to hug me, she wasn’t Mira. Had I seen her before? She hugged me like we were either childhood friends or she was high as fuck. I guessed it was the latter, but then I saw her eyes. I’ve never seen anyone on drugs look that sober. And people on MDMA sure as hell don’t look sober.

I asked her where Mira was. Just inside, she said. Come, we were waiting for you, she cooed into my ear. I thought she must have done too many drugs. None of my friends had talked about going to this rave, it was Mira that had sent me a last moment invite, that she herself had just gotten. At least that’s what she said in her text. Who were waiting for me then? I was a bit irritated if all of those waiting were already rolling on me and Mira’s drugs. I know it wasn’t all mine, but I sure as hell didn’t want some barefooted mental case taking all my drugs. My half was mine to give out, you know.

There were even more fairy lights inside. And those oriental-looking pillows that works as chairs that hippies like to decorate their houses with. And a small table with like 20 water bottles. Maybe this wasn’t a rave, but some psychedelic event. Not that I minded. I preferred MDMA, but I didn’t say no to other kinds of drugs.

Just as I was getting ready to ask Mira what was going on, I realized she wasn’t there. That was weird. There was, of course, the barefooted girl, who was now holding hands with me, slowly interlocking her fingers with mine. I wanted to rip my hand away from hers, but it seemed rude. There was also another girl and two guys, I’d never seen any of them before. But Mira wasn’t there.

The barefooted girl for sure looked like the psychedelic hippie type, but the three others didn’t. One of the guys looked like he was a law student on his way to his first internship. He was wearing shiny wingtips and all. The second guy looked average. Sweatshirt and black pants, sneakers, all of it average. The girl was goth. Black hair, black clothes, black piercings, black smuggled eyeliner and black lipstick as the cherry on top. This looked like a casting for some teenage series where it focused on a bunch of very different people being the bestest-of-best friends even though they had nothing in common.

But this wasn’t a TV series. And it freaked me out. The look-a-like lawyer, the average guy and the goth girl didn’t even look at me or the hippie chick. It was weird. The hippie chick then guided me by hand towards one of the floor pillows. She called the other three her friends, and said they weren’t ready to talk. Later, she said, later they’ll be ready.

She offered me a bottle of water. I hesitated, wondering if it was drugged. She noticed and said that it was just water, nothing special. As I turned the bottle, it made that click sound, the one that means it hasn’t been opened before. So I was calm, I thought they were a bit weird, sure, but the water tasted fine. 

If you’re thinking “Oh no, don’t drink the fucking water” you’re wrong. The water tasted fine, it looked fine and it was fine. The goth girl and the average dude came and sat down and while I don’t think I got their names, they seemed pretty normal. I asked if they’d taken something and the hippie chick just laughed. I took that as a yes, but I don’t actually think it was a yes. I also thought that was why they’d just been completely still when me and the hippie chick entered. They were high, and the lawyer-look-a-like was probably peaking right now. They told me they knew Mira from secondary school, and that they didn’t know why she wasn’t there yet. Mira was a bit flaky, and we laughed a bit about that. I thought the hippie chick had said Mira was inside, but hey, she did seem like she had lost touch with reality, or maybe I’d just misheard her.

They said they all went to the same sixth form. It made sense. There was a sixth form closer to where Mira lived, but she still went to the same one as I did. Ours wasn’t that far away from where she lived, though. And it had a better reputation.

I relaxed completely. Mira had thought it was a rave, but her friends from secondary school had actually planned a different kind of party. Now she was late, as she sometimes were, and that was fine. When I asked if their friend, the look-a-like lawyer, was alright, they just said yeah and yes, he’s just in his own space right now and so on.

They seemed nice. A bit weird, but I guess Mira and I were a bit weird too. They told me about Mira, what she was like when she was younger and stuff. I was starting to wonder why Mira hadn’t introduced us earlier, when the look-a-like lawyer moved over towards us. He moved like he was still high as fuck, which made sense. He couldn’t walk straight, and I thought he was about to fall, when he kinda tipped towards me. He hadn’t lost his balance, though. I know this now, but I didn’t back then. 

It felt like he had pinched me, like he’d pinched my neck. I moved my hand up to touch the place he’d pinched me when I felt something hard on my neck. Thin and hard. A syringe, a small fucking syringe was sticking out of my neck. I felt warm and comfortable and my entire body went limp, but it felt nice. The lawyer look-a-like didn’t look worried, but that didn’t upset me the slightest. I was floating on my own pool of happiness. Then I passed out.

What happened next is like seeing pieces of a puzzle or maybe a few pictures from a party. I remember enough to understand a bit of what happened, but I never got to see the full picture. Either I’ve just forgotten, or I faded in and out of consciousness. Who knows?

I saw the hippie chick, she was close to my face, stroking my hair and my cheek.

Then I saw the treetops, it was night.

Then it wasn’t night anymore.

Then someone had moved me, or I’d turned over myself, but I saw the four people sit in a circle, preparing something. I looked like they were making dinner.

Then they were all standing, and the lawyer look-a-like wasn’t wearing any trousers. 

I didn’t think about this at the moment, but the reason why he couldn’t walk straight wasn’t drugs. And it wasn’t an act either. Because I saw his legs. One was completely average, like it was a normal leg and all. The other was this shrivelled grey thing, thinner and smaller than his other leg. It wasn’t really a leg, but I guess he used it as a leg?

Then I saw the treetops again. It was either dawn or dusk. It looked beautiful. I even saw a bird.

Then I was turned again. Maybe they wanted me to see, but I saw them throw whatever his second “leg” was, into a bonfire. It burned in the same way paper would.

Then I saw them standing again. He had a new leg. It wasn’t hairy like his other leg, it looked smooth, like he’d just shaven it. Because I had just shaven it. He touched it in the same way you would touch someone you love. Like when you wake up next to someone you fancy, that fancy you too, and they caress your face? That’s how he touched the leg.

Then they were all sitting in front of me, smiling. The lawyer look-a-like spoke for the first time, he said thank you. But it sounded metallic, uncanny, the way he pronounced the two words were weird. And I’m not talking about the way a foreigner might struggle with pronunciation, it was something else. I don’t know how to describe it. It was like he’d never tried speaking before.

And then I woke up in a hospital bed.

I’m going to tell you what the doctors, nurses, the police and everybody else told me happen. The story that I ended up making my own.

I was hiking when a tree fell over me. An old and huge tree. It was at the end of the third day of my trip and I was a few miles into the woods, and not close to any normal hiking trails. My tent, sleeping bag, food and all my other hiking stuff wasn’t close, but I had a rubber mallet, those you use on tent pegs, and a small outdoor knife. That was the two things I used to do a DIY amputation and free myself from the tree. Without my right leg, I then crawled several miles and was found by a trucker who just happened to drive by and notice me.

I was rambling, saying someone had stolen my leg. Then I was picked up by an ambulance, and I continued to say someone had stolen my leg. They said it was just the trauma making me believe that. I was out in those woods for 8 days, apparently, and can you Imagine what that kind of horrible experience must do to the human mind? Being trapped for 5 days under a tree, slowly dying? 

I can’t imagine. Because I wasn’t trapped under any tree.

Mira hadn’t texted me. At least that’s what she said. She didn’t know anyone like the people I met in the woods. 

I talked to a psychiatrist and all. But nobody believed me, not even the psychiatrist. And that’s when I stopped telling people what really happened and started telling the story of how I survived a freak accident while I was hiking in the woods.

Because guess what, the police found my camp. And my dead leg rotting under the tree. And my bloody knife. It was all my stuff, my blood, my fingerprints, no sign of anyone else. I had even bought all those things a month earlier. 

Except I fucking hadn’t. I don’t know how they pulled it off, but I never went out hiking. I never bought a tent and all that. I was even wearing ugly hiking clothes when they found me. I’m not saying all hiking clothes are ugly, but it’s not my style, and it wasn’t my style ten years ago either. And all of it was this brownish-green colour? I would never buy clothes that was brownish-green.

But I started saying I would. And I started saying that even though I knew how amazing and strong I’d been out in those woods, I didn’t want any media attention, I just wanted to put all this past me. I pushed Mira away, and everyone assumed it was because I’d quit drugs. I hadn’t really, I just didn’t take drugs with other people anymore. And then I stopped during drugs all together. And then I went to uni, found a prosthetic that didn’t hurt too bad, started lying and then my nightmares faded and I graduated and moved abroad and well, suddenly ten years has passed.

That’s why I’m sharing this today. My Aron Ralston-story is a lie. I don’t know who’s rotting leg was under that tree, but it wasn’t mine. My right leg isn’t gone, it’s attached to some creepy guy that wore a suit in the woods 10 years ago. 

I’m not a survivor. I’m just someone who’s leg was stolen by some fucked up people in the woods, 10 years ago."
ohptyo,7,2021-07-10,Career Advice - Choosing next role,careeradvicee21,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/ohptyo/career_advice_choosing_next_role/,"  

Hi! I was looking for some career advice in terms of what I should be doing next.

**Background:** 

\- 23M.

\- Graduated Accounting &amp; Finance Major at a Non-Target State School (3.95/4.0 GPA).

\- Big 4 Audit Internship - had a FT offer but didn't enjoy public accounting. 

\- Around a year experience working compliance at a Big Bank.

\- Proficient in Excel (conditional statements, Pivot Tables, VLookUp, IndexMatch, Macros), Access, and Word.

\- Learning Python through online courses. 

**Situation:** 

I’ve currently got three options to choose from and I’m not sure which would be best long-term career outlook wise; I’m interested in pursuing corporate finance, FP&amp;A, M&amp;A, or consulting for the future which is a pretty wide selection but I don’t really have a preference yet and could see myself doing them all. 

1. Compliance Analyst at a PE firm – I like the firm and the people I’ve talked to a lot, I’m hesitant on the role because it sounds quite administrative initially. My main concern is future advancement in terms of being able to lateral to another part of the firm or exit opps from Compliance. 

2. Operations Analyst for Big Pharma firm – F100 company, working on improving margins &amp; reducing costs as well as supply chain processes. 

3. Operations Analyst for a Law Firm – One of the largest firms in the US, tasks include financial reporting, budget prep, and pricing support. Best compensation of the 3 however I am unsure on the progression.

Just wanted to hear some thoughts – I’m leaning towards the PE opportunity as I really do like the firm, and it would be a foot in the door. However, I think the other roles are more along the lines of the work I want to be doing.

Thanks everyone!"
ohpuyt,3,2021-07-10,Advice on my situation at my current job,gh0stchim3ra,AskProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/ohpuyt/advice_on_my_situation_at_my_current_job/," 

First time posting here. I'm posting this because I'm a bit upset at the small developer agency I'm working at.

I have 3 bosses, they started the company around 3 years ago. They also have their own separate jobs and they also sell computers/electronics, security services at the company, they also have a custom ERP software which they sell licenses to their customers in the area, which are other businesses. They have little to no knowledge about web development.

So they go into the custom software development business last year and landed their first project. So they hired a web developer on October I think, and he has been working on this job portal site for the client, which is the project they landed. That developer built the website/webapp in PHP using an HTML/PHP template my bosses bought on [WordPress Themes &amp; Website Templates from ThemeForest](https://themeforest.net/) (side note: I personally **hate** using HTML templates), he finished the web app and the client released it, as well as an Android/iOS app. So they landed another project on December I think, which is a web app for managing customers, payment plans, insurance plans/policies for a client that resells insurance plans. They hired another guy as a freelancer but he wasn't able to complete it, as he had another job. That's when I come in, the posted a job position on Facebook, I had an interview with them and they liked my profile. It's important to note that I'm still not graduated, only had 3 months of real job experience, basically an internship though, and had been mostly working on hobby projects, while also learning advanced stuff as JWT authentication, Azure web app services, Nextjs production optimizations, and so on. Also, they needed to deliver the app ASAP as they were now losing money because the project was taking too long, so I said I could complete the project (based on the requirements they gave me) on 2 months top, that was the last week of February, I started working on March 1st.

The other guy had started the project using a Bootstrap template with Nextjs + Redux, and Expressjs as the backend. I honestly think it was a mess and didn't want to work on top of it. So I decided to start the project from scratch using the stack I had experience with, Nextjs + Tailwindcss + React Query for the front-end, and Ts.ED Expressjs framework. They didn't like the idea at the beginning because of the deadlines but I embraced my decision.

Come today and I still haven't delivered anything, not the webapp, nor the Android nor the iOS app (ReactNative with Expo). The web app wasn't that simple in my opinion, coding wise speaking.

My boss today told me that he could to the whole app in an Excel macro in a day and that hurt me. Another thing is that due to the fact that the app needs to be PCI compliant because it has a payment gateway using the Payeezy API, it raised concerned in him that I used a lot of open source libraries/components to build the webapp. He compared the project of the other guy that he didn't use any external libraries or 3rd party services. So I'm a bit sad, I've put long hour days into this project, on top of having my last courses at college, and I feel my work is worthless and they have to stick to it because it's what they have.

I don't know what to feel, and it would be great to hear your opinions/experiences on this matter. Also, I'm not sure if this is the correct subreddit to post to, but anyway... thanks!"

However, from 10\^6 and after, my Python code bottle necks and takes a long time to finish. My professor suggested that I port the code over to C, but when I try doing that there are a lot of small things that make it difficult to port. For example, I need to be able to randomize an array size for a structure that's in a header file, but you can't do this in C (well, I don't need to do this exactly, but other methods will be a bit harder to code and look sloppier). I was wondering if the bottleneck I mentioned above will be reduced drastically if I switch over to C, especially for inputs of 10\^8. I know this depends on the complexity time of the algorithm, but I was wondering if porting the code will be worth the headache because I'm pretty sure that my python code is the same time complexity as my professors pseudocode. I thought of using pypy and Numba, but they only speed up 2x to 4x, which is still slow, especially when inputs will be 10\^8 or 10\^9.

Physical therapist had multiple patients at once and did not watch daughter do exercise she’d never done before and should not have been doing in the first place… resulting in a secondary injury which required additional surgery, months of recovery, additional expenses and mental health issues including suicidal thoughts and additional mental health treatment.  Does this qualify for a consultation with a medical malpractice lawyer?

- Location: Alabama
- Child was 16 at time of injury
- Surgeries were performed in TN
- PT was done locally in AL

Full question:
In Nov. 2019 my daughter (now 17yo) was experiencing strange pains in her hip. Several doctor visits, x-rays, and MRIs later she was diagnosed with a type of benign bone tumor called an Aneurysmal Bone Cyst and referred to a specialist in TN (we live in Alabama).  Surgery was done and went better than expected. Her recovery was going amazingly well and she was sent for physical therapy locally. She aspired to go to law school and had an internship lined up for the fall. It looked like she was still on track for the internship and we were very pleasantly surprised and relieved.

Due to the bone tumor’s location the PT instructions specifically stated that she was not to do any “weighted hamstring”exercises. Therapist admitted she had never worked a case like this. 

Skip ahead a few weeks and my daughter is doing so well she isn’t even limping. She goes to PT and is one of 3 patients the therapist is working with that day. Two at a time was normal but three was not unheard of during our time there. The therapist gives my daughter a new exercise to do then turns her back to work with another patient while daughter does them.  Therapist does not even watch her do the first one.  The exercise is a single leg bridge defined here from a simple Google search:

“The single leg bridge exercise is a great way to isolate and strengthen the gluteus (butt) muscles and hamstrings (back of the upper leg).”  

We have heard many times since then that this is an exercise they should NOT have had her doing because the entire body weight is held up by the hamstring and gluteus muscles (which makes it a weighted exercise according to a fitness trainer we spoke with) during the exercise …both of which had been manipulated during  surgery.

My daughter does one lift and feels pain so she calls the Therapist’s name but the therapist doesn’t hear her (the therapist also happens to literally be hard of hearing and has a cochlear implant). Not wanting to yell or make a big deal about it my daughter makes the regretful decision to do one more and quit if it still hurts. Unfortunately during the second lift she hears an audible popping noise, feels major sharp shooting pain, and literally collapses on the table. We know now that she suffered a hamstring avulsion. However; due to her unique situation it did not present itself in a typical way so it is not unexpected that they would not know this for sure. The therapist iced it, gave her instructions to continue icing it for the rest of the day, and sent her home. Half way home she almost wrecked because her leg started spasming. When she got home she could barely walk. For the next couple of weeks the therapy clinic did palliative treatment only and kept assessing her injury, but they never reported it to the doctor. I finally insisted they do so and was surprised when they came back with instructions to keep doing the same thing. I contacted the specialist’s office myself to verify and the nurse who called me said the PT office did not disclose that there had been an audible popping noise or that she had collapsed. The specialist immediately ordered an MRI which showed the avulsion.

The next months had other details back and forth but I don’t think they are necessary to share for the purpose of this question so I will summarize. We ended up having to go back out of state for surgery to move the hamstring away from the six inches of sciatic nerve sheath it had adhered to during the time that it began self healing. They also moved the attachment point where it connects to the ischium bone over to healthy bone away from the tumor site. This surgery involved both our original specialist and an orthopedic surgeon who specializes in sports injuries.  Needless to say, she met the insurance policy out of pocket max for 2020.

The orthopedic surgeon said this surgery is the hardest recovery of all the surgeries he does….we believe him. The 2nd surgery was in September 2020. This time she was on crutches for months and it was a long time until she was finally walking with a limp for short distances…never without pain. PT this time was done at our local hospital’s PT clinic and the difference in professionalism was very obvious. They had an experienced head therapist assess her and create an action plan periodically then she would be seen by the staff therapists who never had more than one patient at a time. It really made us realize the difference in quality of service and wish we had left the other place but we had never done PT before so we had no comparison. She was finally released from PT and approved to drive in February 2021.

Miraculously she managed to still have good grades in her AP classes and a 4.6 GPA while dealing with all of this. Her goal was to graduate top 20 in her Senior class next year and she was sitting around 23rd.  Our HS is ranked one of the top 100 in the country and top 20 is very highly regarded. She knows I cannot afford to pay for her college and was working hard to be scholarship eligible.

In March 2021 she was driving for about the 3rd time and had to slam on her brakes to avoid a wreck. This caused what we now know was a hematoma and inflammation around the surgery site. Because insurance would not pay for another MRI due to a recent checkup which had required one, she was sent back to PT for a third time. She was completely freaked out that she’d re-injured herself and PT made it worse instead of better each time. We were told she had to do six weeks but after week three and my daughter having a total meltdown I again called and insisted she be seen.  Every visit to the doctors involves a two hour drive each way for us. She was finally seen and reassured that the surgery site is not injured, told it was inflammation and a hematoma which will eventually go away on their own. She was referred to a pain management specialist because she’s been on major drugs and anti inflammatory meds for so long now she is having reflux and having to see a gastroenterologist next week. 

During this time she started having panic attacks and major depression and struggling with school. This resulted in being at risk of failing her classes (which is a BIG deal for my perfectionist daughter). During a visit about stomach issues her pediatrician suggested prescribing an antidepressant to help get her through this rough period. Before they can prescribe teens antidepressants they are required to ask the “black box” questions: Do you ever have thoughts of suicide? Do you have a plan for how you would commit suicide? Have you ever started to act out your plan?   To my horror, the answer my daughter gave to all three questions was YES.

39 hours in the ER on suicide watch, six days in a cognitive behavioral therapy facility, weeks of follow up therapy and multiple prescriptions for antidepressant and anti anxiety medications later we are finally in a better place mentally and the leg pain is beginning to be bearable enough for her to live a normal teenager lifestyle. 

She had to drop two courses (which the school made stressful) and ended the year with a C and D in the other two. She is no longer aspiring to be a lawyer because she says that this is burnout and lawyers have a high burnout rate. If she can’t hack this then it must not be a good career choice for her. She does still have a 3.6 GPA and 4.3 weighted GPA so getting into college for her new career choice of computer science or business analytics shouldn’t be a problem but I feel this is just another blow caused by this whole clusterfuck of a 2nd surgery caused by this injury THEY CAUSED.

I owe thousands of dollars in medical bills now and have been paying the car payment and insurance on a car I bought so she could do the internship which she could not drive during all of this. 

At this point I have to ask, is the first PT office liable in any way for the months and months of chronic pain, the potential loss of career, additional expenses we incurred, and the mental impact this had resulting in my daughter literally being suicidal?   

I feel this was all the result of this PT office having their staff seeing more patients at a time than they can safely handle and the therapist literally turning her back while having a patient perform an exercise she should not have even had her doing in the first place and not even watching her do it for the first time to gauge the effects of the exercise on her.

Does this qualify for setting up a  consultation with a medical malpractice lawyer?"

oi0jmj,4,2021-07-11,Is it normal feeling this?,DniGaytan,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/oi0jmj/is_it_normal_feeling_this/,"I did not find a subreddit to post this. If you know a sub, in which my question can fit, please tag it in the comments.

Recently I graduated from school and Ill start working on a company in a few months. However, I feel nervous and with the fear of not being enough during the job; To get this job I had to get through an internship and it was pretty cool, but while doing it I had a lot of doubts while solving my tasks and project which led me to make several researches about 'how x works', 'why x works', 'how do you do x', 'examples on doing', etc. Which gave me a big turn off because I thought this is not the way how other software engineers learn about new language or functionalities (probably this is a bad thinking about myself). 

On the other hand, when I pause programming or CS related projects and then I go back to them I need to re learn stuff I thought I learned very well, and I think this should not happen(again, probably I am wrong).

Anyways, I feel that I am not good compared to other software engineers that I know. Also, I think most SE do know a lot of advanced concepts which they do not forget, while I need to re learn them every time I go back and work on a project that involves them.

What can I do about stuff I keep forgetting every time I pause programming? Is it normal to forget these concepts?

Should I take the cs career path slowly? 

And lastly, Am I doing wrong by comparing myself to others?"
oi0sjp,42,2021-07-11,[Uni] Some things learnt studying CS,Jareltey8,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/oi0sjp/uni_some_things_learnt_studying_cs/," Since it’s been a year since my last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/d9d2m3/uni_us_application/) and I’ve been getting occasional questions about US applications, thought I wanted to share some things I found helpful studying CS at CMU for the past year. Some are applicable in a broader sense.

1. Don’t compare yourself with others. Cannot stress this enough. You’ll see people around you who know all these technologies you’ve never heard of, but do yourself a favour and focus on your own learning rather than be intimidated.  It’s normal to have people coming in with a range of experiences (even within School of Computer Science here), and starting later doesn’t mean you cannot catch up. I myself was only exposed to coding towards the end of JC.
2. Be comfortable with unstructured learning. This is something I really stand for as in the past, I wanted all my learning to be structured, perhaps due to coming out of JC where there’s a set number of topics to learn for each subject and you don’t have to know beyond that to do well. But structured learning (university courses, online courses) can only get you so far in my opinion. Read articles online, watch YouTube videos where people explain things, ask questions during internships, and Google things you don’t understand. I’ve had some of my best learning doing these and working on real projects.
3. Used to be unsure about what some of these meant before I encountered them, and I’m sure some people are in this boat so maybe this helps.

* Data structures &amp; Algorithms - if you know what are linked lists, hash tables, binary trees, heaps, stacks &amp; queues you know what are data structures. Not to be confused with data types (int, bool etc). Algorithms is just another word for instructions you give to a computer.
* Machine learning - umbrella term for computer learning to predict/classify something. Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, deep learning all fall under here.
* Computer networking - so much more than just wifi networks, relates to how computers transfer data using http, tcp/ip, encryption etc. Read about OSI model if interested (see? Unstructured learning)

Many more terms that Google will probably do a better job answering than me. Hope this is helpful and feel free to comment / pm me any questions about US applications (might be slightly outdated) or my experiences!"

Would it be worth taking a 1-year Cyber Security sandwich placement for £20K?,double-happiness,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/oi1e4v/middleaged_cs_degree_student_with_one_year_to_go/,"As per the post title, I'm a middle-aged CS degree student with one year to go. I live in Scotland, I have a previous degree (sociology) and postgrad (teaching), and I am itching to get earning as I have never had a permanent full-time job, no pension other than state pension, have never had an office job, and the last job I had was in care work at pretty much minimum wage.

I just finished year 3 of 4 and passed all modules including 4 As, though I had to resit the assessment for Windows Server Administration, which I really struggled to get to grips with, actually. Funnily enough before I started all this I would have been the least confident with programming, but seeing how much I seem to struggle with everything network- and domain-related, it's now getting to the point that coding may actually be my strongest suit.

Anyway, I saw an opportunity came up for a sandwich year placement for a Cyber Security Assistant with a local council, so I sent in a cover letter and CV. I see it says ""GRE - £20,294"" - not at all sure what that means, gross remuneration maybe?

I can see according to [this search](https://www.cwjobs.co.uk/jobs/in-ka24?radius=30&amp;s=header) 94% of local IT jobs pay at least £30K, which makes £20K seem pretty measly, but of course many of those will be senior jobs. I think I would really miss going through 4th year with the people I've gotten to know on my degree, but OTOH having a sandwich year, internship, or something else you've worked on is viewed highly favourably by employers, isn't it?

Not at all sure what I would like to go into long-term, by the way, but I suspect I might not be in a position to be too choosy. I could well consider moving house after I graduate though, at least in Southern Scotland. Any other tips for any ageing wannabe IT worker would be appreciated. I have been using GitHub though I'm reluctant to put my one personal project up as I don't really want anyone copying my code just yet."

* NLP based web solution helping companies aggregate user feedback (playstore + appstore + email), analysing them and providing actionable insights.
* Had a few funded startups using it but ultimately failed.

Maybe more. Yesterday we went out for coffee, lovely time as usual. All the usual stuff such as being physically affectionate and having a laugh and a joke. Then she said ""I think this should be our last date"". 

I thought it was a joke at first as often we'd say ""you're getting to see through me too easily, it's not gonna work out"" but just being silly. But this time it was real. She is doing a master's, and works and has been offered an internship too so she'll be busy, which I understand.

Thing is she said she is worried she won't be able to give me the time that I deserve and it's better to do it now before she gets even more emotionally invested. From the way it's going she basically said we'd be official in awhile more at that rate. But afterwards we stayed and talked about it for like an hour, still as physical and comfortable as before. She kept saying how she usually didn't do it in person, how she never hangs around afterwards and that she really couldn't make herself leave. All of this makes me think that she really does still like me and is forcing herself to. 

I've never been this upset over a girl because it absolutely flattened me yesterday. Spent several hours crying and I just feel so apathetic and hollow towards everything today. We've said we're going to stay friends as we really like each other and I hope that we do. It's just that based on how I feel, and how she seems to feel I don't want to give her up. I know you can't force people into it and I don't want to risk pushing her away. But I really feel as if I need to fight for this because I really, really like her. 

I know this is a very rambly post, but I'm quite all over the place still to be honest. I'm just very conflicted about what to do, especially as I might be falling for her and we both seem to really like each other still. It just feels all the more difficult because it doesn't have to end.

I feel like I’m mentally decomposing. I don’t have the energy to do anything I’d like and I’ve struggled more with eating recently. I’ve had long term issues with sleeping and eating, but it feels like it’s gotten worse recently. 

I couldn’t sleep last night, so I ended up going to bed at 5 am and I woke up at 4 pm. I’m super upset about that because Sunday was my one day off and I’m going to have to sleep early for work tomorrow morning. I work in the morning and then get an hour break before my afternoon internship. I can’t drop either because the internship is required for my major and I’m actually getting paid at my morning office job.

Maybe my worsening mental state is being caused by going through the process of getting an apartment for the first time? Management hasn’t been communicating with my roommate and I very well about our move in and I got renters insurance on Friday, only to mess it up and accidentally get homeowners insurance. Luckily, my agent called me a few hours later and figured this out, but the process is now longer because of my mistake. It’s been rough because I have to do this by myself. I’m trying to move out of a very bad home environment because I can’t make myself stay until school is over anymore. I’m figuring this all out as I go along because this move is a survival thing and I obviously have no prior experience with getting an apartment.

Right when I woke up today, I had another thing to worry about in the form of an email from the school talking about my required exit counseling. I’m incredibly confused as none of the situations listed (graduating, changing schools, enrolling at below half time, etc.) apply to me, but I’m going to have to wait because the phones are closed on the weekend.

## Sankey Diagram

https://i.imgur.com/a8gWIcP.png

It’s slightly hard to tell, but interestingly, I only received offers from companies that either reached out to me through Discord, or that I reached out to (directly to CEO) through Twitter.

Now you’re probably thinking, “Discord? WTF.”

You see, the first thing I did when I started my job hunt, was make a short post in this Discord server about my qualifications.

The server in question is [Gen Z Mafia](https://genzmafia.com), basically a community of young people building stuff in the general tech-y/startup-y space. They've been featured in the [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/15/style/gen-z-tech-mafia.html), and have interviewed people like Ryan Hoover from [Product Hunt](https://producthunt.com), Michael Siebel from [Y Combinator](https://ycombinator.com), etc. I joined around November 2020 when it was much smaller.

The next thing you’re probably thinking is: “The offers are pretty much only from startups.”

Yep, that was a core part of my “strategy.” You see, the reason why I dropped out was to pursue my own startup, [Disco](https://disco.so), back in Fall 2020.

I built a quick MVP to validate the idea, found an awesome co-founder, built a full-fledged mobile app, grew to 1.5K+ users in \~2 months, but ultimately was not able to receive funding or generate significant revenue before my internship at Amazon—or my co-founder's summer classes—started (early June 2021).

I had anticipated this happening when I dropped out, however, and concluded that if it were to happen (which it did), I’d probably be able to find a decent job **at another startup** with all the experience I gained (which I did).

I knew it would be hard to even get interviews at big tech companies due to my lack of degree, but I didn't care. After my previous internship with Amazon last year, I realized the big tech life was not for me, and that I much preferred the fast pace of startup-like environments, while not minding the higher risk.

[This](https://imgur.com/a/yWs8eLm) was the resume I used throughout the process. A large chunk of it is my own projects which were pretty much all I talked about in my interviews, especially Disco. No one really cared about Amazon, one company even slightly questioning my choice to work there haha.

## Takeaways

### Calculated risks can pay off nicely.

I was super passionate about Disco (it’s still running!), but the timing was off and my savings were running out. I knew going in I would most likely fail, but that “failure” wouldn’t be so bad as I’d be able to leverage this unique experience for so many other opportunities (job interviews, content, a cool story to tell, etc.).

The cost was of course my degree. I knew I’d have a tough time getting past ATS systems, but that was offset by the fact that I didn’t want to work for companies that had a strict degree-requirement in the first place.

### Practical experience matters more than almost anything

There’s a reason why personal projects are emphasized so much. If you go a step further and really try to *pursue* a project to its end, that can be even more beneficial imo, but you’ll have to think of the time-benefit trade-offs for that particular project.

### Startups are a whole different game

Probably the biggest takeaway. Only 1 technical interview out of my 4 involved Leetcode questions. The rest were a mix of take-home projects, practical problem solving, and paid contract work as a trial period.

Beyond the technicals, however, it was clear that every startup was looking for *culture fit* above anything else. It's critical for startups to find the right people, aka people passionate about and invested in the larger vision while also being able to vibe with the team.

### Negotiate, negotiate, negotiate

This obviously applies if you have multiple offers, but even if you only have 1 offer, you can still negotiate, provided the offer’s not from somewhere like Amazon.

The best resource I found and that I constantly referred back to was [this post](https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/) by Haseeb Qureshi.

Here are the 10 rules of salary negotiation that he lays out:

1. Get everything in writing
2. Always keep the door open
3. Information is power
4. Always be positive
5. Don’t be the decision maker
6. Have alternatives
7. Proclaim reasons for everything
8. Be motivated by more than just money
9. Understand what they value
10. Be winnable

Obviously more info’s in the post. Definitely worth a read.

## Conclusion

So does this mean you should drop out and pursue your own startup in the hopes of landing similar offers?

Fuck no. If you’re going to start a startup, do it because you genuinely want to. You’ll most likely fail, but you’ll learn a *ton*.

As for dropping out, I admit, I was deep in the whole “degree-doesn’t-matter-at-all” stage for quite some time. I’d now say there’s a nugget of truth to it, *if* you're someone that loves the startup life and hates the big tech/corporate life *and* you've actually built something significant and put it out there. Things are changing, for sure, but degrees are still a *basic* *requirement* for most companies with a HR department.

I’m super glad to be done with the job hunt, though admittedly mine was much less stressful than most other people’s. The team I joined is awesome imo and I really vibed with them and the overall product vision. Super pumped.

Now it’s time for me to wrap up my Amazon internship (sending in my 2-week notice tomorrow). Which reminds me, I forgot to mention that due to me dropping out, I won’t be eligible for a full-time return offer through the internship program. I’ll have to apply through their regular portal if I want to work there full-time (which I obviously don’t).

Anyway, I’ll be happy to answer any questions! either here or through DMs (Twitter preferred [@itsmnjn](https://twitter.com/itsmnjn))."

How feasible is this for someone that doesn't have a US visa, are these companies willing to sponsor? Are my chances of getting in very low compared to Americans ?

My resume is pretty standard for my age, no work experience but good grades and I can do leet code style questions very well.

I am an Intern at a small doctors office and I have to fix a problem with the RemoteDesktop connection. After updating windows last Friday we are no longer able to use the RemoteDesktop Connection to Connect to other Devices in our Network when using one specific client. In total we updated about 25 clients but only one of them started having this problem. When trying to connect via Remotedesktop it shows the loading bar and says ""connecting to \[IP-Adress\]"". It seems like the process freezed but the bar moves and no error Message comes up. Even after waiting for about 20 Minutes nothing changed. I disabled the Firewall and checked for Group Policies that may prevent this client from Connecting to other devices. Also the client can be reached via RemoteDesktop from another client without problems. 

It would be nice if anyone could help me with this.

I already feel left behind because most of my other friends already have their full-time jobs or finished applying to med schools and I just feel so stagnant. I'm trying to get my life back together by giving me a deadline of 6 months to be job-ready as a SWE.

For some background, I finished undergrad in 2020 with a Biology degree along with a majority of the CS pre-reqs (DS&amp;A, OOP, Discrete, Calculus) and I'm trying to find a way to get a job as a SWE in the Bay Area. It seems like full-stack is the easiest domain to break into and I've heard about all these great free resources like Full Stack Open but I'm not sure if I'm optimizing my time and energy.

On a side note, I was able to get accepted into OMSCS for Fall 2021 so I am trying to leverage that to get an internship in the case that I am not able to find a FT position through self-teaching.

After reading a bunch of posts on this sub I've come down to creating a self-teaching plan for myself:

1. Review Python using [https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html) (have previously  been coding in C++) --&gt; Read CTCI and do respective problems --&gt; try to Leetcode daily to prepare for coding interviews
2. Go through the Odin Project or Full Stack Open --&gt; build a personal website so that employers can see my side projects
3. Post my projects on Github and create clean READMEs for recruiters
4. Reach out to whoever I know that currently works in tech and try my best to get as many referrals as possible along with applying to jobs using LinkedIn

I would really appreciate it if you guys could critique my plan or point me in the right direction if you feel like I might be missing something or if I am simply being too naive.

**TLDR: I'm a Biology grad who wants to get a job as a SWE. Is using the Odin Project and Full Stack Open the best use of my time to learn full-stack? Also, is going through Runestone Academy (Python) and doing Leetcode the best way to prepare for interviews?**"

As a part of my internship I'm going to be doing a bunch  of this stuff, and have a fair amount of freedom to do so.

After doing some internships, and taking some classes, I have decided I do not want to be a mechanical engineer, I want to be a software engineer. This summer, I have been learning about the different areas of software engineering, learning some different coding languages, and I have really been enjoying it. 

Unfortunately, one cannot become a SWE with a mechanical degree, so I am endeavoring to become employable. Before me lie two paths: the coding bootcamp and the master's degree in CS.

I talked to a family friend who took a very similar path to me (got a mechanical degree and went into swe with a coding bootcamp), who swears by bootcamps. He says that academia has a big disconnect from the skills you need as an actual engineer, and that the best way to qualify yourself for work and for the whiteboaring interviews is a reputable bootcamp. 

On the other hand, I really enjoy being a student. College so far has been a really good time, even with the difficulty of an engineering degree to keep me from some of the more fun aspects of life. I wouldn't mind the actual getting of the master's degree; however, it is much more of a time commitment (and probably a money commitment) than a bootcamp would be. 

It just seems too good to be true that with a 10-12 week bootcamp course, I can make the average software engineering salary ($100k/year) without having to get any kind of degree in the field. Does that actually happen? Will the bootcamp hold me back from higher level positions that a master's would get me into? If you have any advice, I would love to hear it."

(*Skip to the italics if you just want to hear what my AO said*)

Okay, so I posted about this a while ago, but I didn't do enough to protect everyone's privacy. I also wanted CO 22 students going into the application process to know that not all AOs are heartless.

During my senior year, I applied to a T5 LAC ED1. I loved absolutely everything about the school, and when I visited I got the best vibes. But I knew I didn't have much of a chance of being admitted. So, when I got my rejection letter from this school, I was sad, but not surprised.

I thought that would be the end of it, but I was wrong. I was rejected from almost all of my schools, and the ones that accepted me didn't give me enough FA to attend. So, I took a gap year.

I worked my butt off, getting an internship, job, and fellowship in my major, completing multiple online certifications, and raising my score to a perfect composite on the ACT. I kept on dreaming of college, but I didn't want to get my hopes up.

When I opened my application portal and saw the confetti, I was shocked. I sent quick thank you emails to the teachers who wrote my letters of rec, my school counsellor, and my AO. The next day, I got a response that floored me (made more vague for privacy).

""*OP!*

*So glad you reached out! it was wonderful to see you on the Early Admit Zoom party…. And showing off your merch on social media! (I run the Instagram, so it makes me happy to see \[our city\] representation on the feed).""*

I was pretty happy that he noticed that I showed up to the Zoom party and remembered me from IG at all. I know AOs are super busy, so I was impressed. But I thought that's where it would end.

*""First off… I am SO thrilled you are coming to \[college\]. I remember meeting you at the \[my high school\] visit two falls ago, and there was a sense of anxiety and defeat among the group. You were the most vocal, participatory, and honest, and it has always stuck with me.""*

I'm sorry, what!?! I was CO 20 and **he specifically remembered me from a college meet and greet** (one of at least dozens, I'm sure) **when I was a junior**? I don't think he was just being generic here, it was truly a depressing event and I was almost the only one who said anything.

*Also, \[interviewer name\], had the most superlative write up I’ve read in a long time.*

I didn't get an interview this year. That interview was from **the application he rejected** a year ago. My mind is blown.

*You left a lasting impression, and I am so glad you reapplied after your transformative gap year. Your new experiences, honest reflections, and evident curiosity – from everything from \[specific interest related to media studies\] to philosophy to \[thing I did for one of my gap year jobs\] – were a joy to read about. Again, I am thrilled you are a \[mascot\].*

*John""*

Specific interested related to media studies? That was also from the app he rejected. **How???** Even if he reviewed my old app with my new one, that attention to detail and kindness was so incredibly unexpected.

So, yes, this is a small LAC, so that probably helps. But I wanted to show y'all this to prove that AOs are actually human beings and could even care about you. I'm sure some of them are terrible, but I imagine that a decent number want to help bring kids up rather than push them down. ""John"" (not his real name) changed jobs at the end of this year, but for 4 admissions cycles he made applicants feel seen, and seemingly cared about those he rejected.

I want to give you some hope: **the people who read your apps are not (always) heartless.**

If anyone else has stories of nice AOs, please share them below.

I, like many of you, am a visually-impaired ADHD gal. It isn't anything too bad; I wear my glasses when driving and doing schoolwork/lounging, but can go to work or run errands without them on. Still, I have to strain my eyes more than usual, and don't like wearing glasses with my mask on as it's all too frustrating. I'd like to be able to see 100% of the time, whether it's at my internship or just at a night out with friends.

So I've recently been considering contact lenses. However, a few concerns pop up for me: the biggest one, of course, is the routine. Loads of my NT friends with contact lenses already express frustration at the daily routine of changing them; my sister always accidentally falls asleep with them on. I'm worried that contact lenses will just get too tedious/frustrating to deal with, and that I'll be too lazy to put them in/take them out or forget to change them. Not to mention that I already have no sense of time, so I'll have to get used to waking up earlier to save time to put my contacts in.

Theoretically I could just wear glasses on days that I'm running late/too lazy, but if I just end up doing that half of the time then what even is the point in spending money on lenses?

So I guess my question to all of you is how do you deal with it? Is it more pain than it's worth? Or is the struggle worth it? Also, can the lenses be a (physical) sensitivity overload sometimes? Thanks in advance!"

I'm on pace for a First Classification but have absolutely no idea what I want to do once I graduate (In one years time). I have no placements or internships either and have no idea where to start to look for one and am afraid of graduating without any experience due to the fear of nobody hiring me. I have some school projects for my resume but they aren't too advanced.   


My biggest problem I think is that I don't know whether I want to venture into Cyber Security, Software Dev/Engineering, or something different with my degree. I think if I knew where to start with these pathways it would help me a lot in getting some confidence and figuring out the direction I want to go in.   


Any advice?"

Which point of my CS journey would I be ready for an internship? 

I interviewed with two companies recently. One large company &amp; a smaller company. While reception was well imo with the smaller company when it came down to the larger company I felt I couldn’t even answer the basics.

&amp;#x200B;

The position, to me, is basically saying ""hey we need a full stack software developer, who can also do mobile, and who is also an embedded hardware design engineer."" Now i love working with hardware. I studied it in school and had a previous job doing firmware. I also love software. So this position would seem amazing except talking to their ""technology team"", it consists of 1 SWE, 1 mixed swe/hardware, 1 hardware engineer, 1 database engineer, 2 interns, and 1 manager. Any significant work seems to be outsourced, i.e. their mobile app used by the sales team was outsourced. They plan out outsourced the redesign of the public website. To make it worse, they dont follow any agile methodologies, dont really do code reviews, dont really unit test (except for main features which basically means no tests), and the work i'd be doing seems to be entirely internally focused. I.e. no significant amount of users will be using it so building something to scale to hundreds of thousands of users does not apply here. 

A few other general red flags are :

* I feel like i asked more technical questions to their ""technology"" team during the interview.
* I was asked general questions about my experience, background, and why i want to interview with them about the position.
* No technical questions to test if i know how to code which makes me question their coding standards and quality.
* when i mentioned to uniqueness of the position, i've not been able to get a straight answer as to why the they are mixing the role as software and hardware.
* No stock since it's a private company. 
* I was given a half-assed answer regarding bonuses. 
* They really tried to emphasis the ""start-up-like culture"" by dropping terms like ""high performing"", ""fun-loving"", ""game-playing"", and ""geeking out"".

Now  some potential positives are:

* Possibly more overall TC. I make around \~80k TC at my current company doing purely backend java development. I told this company i'd be looking for 110k-130k and they said they are flexible if they find the right candidate. An extra 30-50k would be a good chunk of money and possibly the easiest boost in salary given the interview i had.
* Possibility to work on some cool stuff and exposure to other technologies (embedded, mobile, web) other than just backend java. I already asked them what the ramp up would be and they said the main focus initially would be on helping design automated carts to traverse their warehouse floor with the workers when orders come in and then move onto their mobile app which is a vuejs front-end and swift backend. I'm always excited to learn and work on new shit.
* Still retain most of my WFH status (new position might require 10-20% travel to nearby office).
* Possibility that because it's a small team, it actually is like a startup environment or mentality and the engineers enjoy the work and actually geeking out.

One of the 3 i talked too seemed pretty cool and we had some common interests like mma. The other two seemed ""alright"". Like i'd get along with them as coworkers but wouldnt see myself hanging out with them after work persay.

I have a followup interview this thursday with their head of talent acquisition and head of IT (no clue why head of IT....) but basically wanted to see what other's opinions are. If, hypothetically, i am given an offer of 120k which is \~40k increase, is it worth jumping ship and potentially finding out it's an absolute shit show or stay where i am, continue to get some pretty decent SWE experience with a place that follows agile methodologies, does code reviews, has proper practices and continue to grind leetcode while applying to other companies?"
oj0sux,2,2021-07-12,Recently made redundant by a company where I was overworked. Now I don’t know if I should take this opportunity that’s coming my way.,poreo2k19,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/oj0sux/recently_made_redundant_by_a_company_where_i_was/,"I joined the hotel industry as a Trainee Data Analyst just 2 days after my last university exam. In my fourth month of internship, I got a permanent job offer as Business Analyst in one of the largest MNCs in the world – opportunity which I seized. The first 6 months were great and enriching, I was good at my job and at the same time, still learning new things. However, things started to change when we got a new manager. She was young and cold-blooded, didn’t really value people and was micro-managing. The atmosphere in the office had changed, people were scared and there was no peace of mind, up to the point that 2 senior team leaders resigned. 

As for me, the plan was that as we take on more processes, I would be assigned a partner. However, even after we had taken on additional processes; more than thrice what I was handling in the first 6 months, no other Business Analyst was onboarded. Even though I was on the same paygrade as my colleagues, I was working a lot more than them (including unpaid overtime). Because of my workload, I could hardly take day offs and on some days a leave was out of question because of reports that I had to prepare for the weekly meetings. 

Things got really bad for me last year when we started working from home due to COVID-19. My manager would call me any time she wanted; early morning or late night to ask me to prepare specific reports for her. It got even worse after we resumed office because we had an additional 9 meetings to prepare for in a month and I was the only one responsible to prepare the reports for all. It had become nearly impossible for me to take a day off in the first 3 weeks of the month, sometimes even in the whole month. 

As the work was arduous, exhausting and my life was becoming unbearably hectic, with my manager having no concern for me, I had contemplated resigning this year. However, what I call a “Blessing in disguise”, in mid-January this year, it was announced that the company is restructuring and many departments (including mine) were being phased out. We finished last month and the company paid us a Severance Package equivalent to almost a year’s salary. 

Since the announcement, I knew that I wanted to take at least 3 months off to work on an investment plan which I was occasionally working on as well as prepare myself for an upcoming exam in September. I also wanted to use this time to blow some steam because I never really got to relax since finishing university. However, even though I haven’t applied to this particular company, the HR called me today for a Business Analyst position after some of my ex-colleagues who have joined there, recommended me. They have scheduled an interview for Friday and I know I have a strong chance of getting it but I’m at a loss now. The salary is slightly more than what I was previously earning but I’m indecisive. I want to allocate more time to my investment plan which I know can be and can make myself very successful but also, at a time where people are being laid-off or cannot find a job, I don’t know if it’s wise to blow such an opportunity.

Hopefully someone can guide me. 

Thanks"

I would like to know what type of programs I should target with my background and experience. I'm a rising 5th year and I would like some advice on my schools.

Rutgers: 3.85 GPA
Georgia Tech(School I am going to graduate from): 3.25 GPA (Major GPA: 3.2)
Combined GPA: ~3.5

GRE: Don't really plan on taking it unless you guys have conflicting advice.

Research experience: 3 internships at silicon valley tech companies. I'm now interning as a research engineer alongside other Ph.D. interns. I have also been researching at Emory University Hospital since the fall of 2019 and plan on joining a new lab group this fall.

Universities I’m considering, I really don't want to go below Georgia Tech at this point which narrows my school down considerably.

Georgia Tech (Much easier for me to get in due to me going there)

UC Berkeley

UIUC

Stanford(Extreme reach)

I feel like my GPA is a bit low for the schools and since I can have Georgia Tech nearly guaranteed, I don't think I should go anywhere else. I would really like to settle down in California with my GF so any school in that region is a plus for me. I would also like to explain the downturn in my GPA which is mainly due to COVID and me being unable to keep up with both my family and the online class system. I straight up became uncompetitive and people just started to get unusually high scores in their classes out of nowhere. My GPA has gone up this semester but I am hoping to reach my full stride Fall semester which might be a bit too late at this point."

First I know that the future is ever changing and we don’t know what will happen. With that said my local chipotle is paying their employees $15 - $16 an hour, now searching for internships and jr web dev positions and they are between $20 - $30 an hour. Maybe I am being greedy but let’s say you ask for a raise of 3 to 5% a year would be really low. Now meet level to sr positions suffer too from inflation. Maybe I am just greedy but I thought software devs should get paid more. 

TL;DR I feel that the current market for software devs is to low hourly and it’s going to eventually be the same as a working a fast food job (not that there is anything wrong with that)"

The galactic war had been raging for millenia. A constant near equilibrium of the Starborn Conglomerate, fighting the Vestian monarchy, in a war of total annihilation. The Vestians were a long bodied, insectoid species with many legs, whose sole goal in the war was turning every species into cattle, and raising them in herds to be consumed by their ever growing populace. The Conglomerate wanted just the opposite, being made up of over a hundred sentient species, and controlling nearly a quarter of the galaxy. The Vest had more territory, and more manpower, but the Conglomerate was fighting for survival, and was fighting with an unmatched vigor. Only recently, did the tide of the war change, with the discovery of a new species for the Conglomerate. Humanity hadn't even colonized its first planet when they had been thrust into the conflict, finding their home world as a frontline warzone, when a Vestian fleet attempted to flank the Conglomerates battle line. The Vest had thrown a fleet meant to conquer a hundred worlds into that maneuver, so the subjugation of Earth would simply be an added bonus that was earned along the way. When the Conglomerate’s listening posts detected the large movement of Vestian ships, a fleet was sent to counter the enemy, and deny them their flanking advantage. When they arrived, ready to make combat with the arch enemy, they were amazed to find the gargantuan fleet in full retreat, and wounded badly. Humanity had won the day against impossible odds. When the leaders of Earth were brought before the galactic council, and asked about their naval capabilities, the council was shocked to hear that the human navy consisted only of vessels that floated on the planet’s ocean. It was a concept so outdated, that many council members assumed at first that the Human leaders were making a joke. Regardless of their primitive nature, they were inducted into the Conglomerate with open arms, and hailed as friends. As it turned out, the humans were one of the rare species of tool users that were predatory. Out of all one hundred and thirty four species in the Conglomerate, (not counting the eight that had been rendered extinct by the war), only six were predatory, and only Humanity and the Kthuul were omnivorous. Of course, as a result, the tactics used in the war were downright insulting to the Humans, who of all the predators, were the only ones well versed in war. The Conglomerate, being faced with an enemy that attacked in great swarms, would arrange their men into battle lines, in order to simply present as many guns as possible, to blast away at the enemy. In the horrible event that the enemy overwhelmed them, They would organize a rear guard, and the remaining majority would flee to a rally point, and begin the fight anew. The concept of “artillery” or automatic weapons didn't even exist. Heavy guns were only ever used to crack the hulls of enemy ships, and even space combat was up close and personal, with fights from barely a few kilometers away. It seemed that, universally, non-predatory species' entire understanding of territorial conflict was based around overt displays of manpower and force, rather than surgical strikes, and area denial. Humanity had attempted to offer insight into a better method of combat, but were denied, as although their fledgling species may have achieved an incredible feat, they still had not been in enough interstellar combat to be trusted with any sort of real strategy. After only two years of war, Humanity gained a reputation as monsters. Described as dumb, brutish thugs, who would kill anyone who even gave them an odd look. Word quickly spread about humans, and how they bared their teeth at anyone who looked their way. Such aggression, and with a murderous mindset, was Considered to be why they excelled so much in war, with only one battle lost, out of hundreds fought. The humans were average in height, despite being from an incredibly high gravity world. It was said that they could bash you to death with their bare hands, or squeeze the life out of you with their ten manipulator digits. It quickly became consensus on many forums throughout the intergalactic community, that the humans were best weaponized, then kept as far away from the galaxy’s main inhabitants as possible.

As much as most beings would have liked to keep humans out of their hair, many still found their way into alien colony fleets, acting as a labor force. Humans tended to keep to themselves in these cases, and often formed small packs, which could almost always be found together, seeking comradery amongst their own kind. This was the case on the soon to be infamous freighter vessel 'CSO-928-C', which was bound for a Krtik colony carrying important fabrication supplies. The Captain of the vessel had a hard time finding a good batch of crew, as the colony they were to be supplying was far too close to the galactic frontline, and as such, brought the risk of being eaten alive. He managed to fill half of the needed positions out of eighty, and he was not willing to fly on a dangerous mission with what was barely more than a skeleton crew. He had, up until that point, been avoiding a few species for crew selection, on the grounds that some were simply not able to be accommodated for, and others would stir up trouble. With a groan, audible from even outside of his quarters, he turned off the species selection filter, and perused the options. He was horrified. Almost three quarters of the selection was human. He remembered just how close he was to their homeworld he was, and realised that this was only natural. Annoyed, he selected man after man, all of whom had no experience on a starship, but industrial skills that would allegedly transfer over. Pipefitters, electricians, mechanics, and computer specialists were, one by one, contracted to a 2.5 standard cycle employment, or about six months in Earth time. The crew was assigned roles in their contracts, and were each assigned special equipment along with it. Additionally, since the mission would be potentially dangerous, the crew were allowed to bring armaments approved by the head of security, or armaments would be provided at the cost of the vessel. The captain finally had all the crew he needed, and decided to review the contracts. 

Already confirmed was himself, obviously, who needed a special set of quarters filled with dihydrogen monoxide, along with a channel from there to the bridge. He would be paid in whatever funds remained after all other contracts were filled, with which he would use to maintain his craft, and spend a little on leisure. Next was his Bosun, and second in command. Both were Ichtri, a tall insectoid species with viscous pincers on their head, and a terrifying natural spike on a protruding abdomen. Both were paid a requested wage, and needed no special accommodation. Ichtri were a species that were known for excellent teamwork, so putting them in command positions generally resulted in impressive crew cohesion. There was one incident with them however, that had contributed to humanity going on the “last resort” list for potential crew. The first contracted humans, upon seeing the Ichtri, all visibly recoiled in a fear most expressed towards them. One crewman had fled, and pleaded for the termination of his contract, stating “I cant work with giant fuckin wasps. I don't care if they aint got wings, and they're more upright, they still look like wasps.” Captain Gush still laughed to himself about it, seeing something as unnerving as a human terrified like a child. The incident had led him to ask the other humans just how many races in the galaxy reminded them of species on their homeworld. He was shocked to hear that more than half had at least a slight resemblance to an animal from Earth, and even more shocked to hear that about a third seemed to have a strong resemblance to Earth fauna, himself included, resembling what they called “a squid, with eyestalks”. Research had led him to discover that the vast diversity of the human homeworld’s climates had given rise to quite literally millions of species, as opposed to the more common sets of dozens, or a hundred at most. With each environment evolving a species perfectly tailored to it, many resembled an alien species who evolved in a similar environment. It was not uncommon for such similarities to exist, but earth presented the most by far. He shook the thoughts away, and returned to the contract. Security officer was a Gug, which was a sort of tall hairy dome, and was notably impervious to any sort of armament without immense penetration. It was one of the few species the humans had no equivalent to, saying it looked like something in a bizarre children's book. The Gug needed a lower temperature room, and was given a standard wage. Of the main body of crew, Ten were Krtik, and for accommodation, needed some sort of treadmill for exercise. They would be paid in meat. Next were another ten Ichtri, being paid the standard wage. Then ten Gimni, standard wage, and lastly, ten Herlum, again, standard wage. Then, the dreaded part of the roster lay before captain Gush. The forty humans made up half of the crew, and needed for accommodation, a gravity three times as high as the standard. Fortunately, there were two saving graces: Firstly, every single human had decided to bring their own armaments, and all had been approved by the security officer. Second, Human negotiators, when asked what sort of wages the general workforce required, had given a number so low that it was at first believed they had miscalculated the currency exchange rate. Once they confirmed that they did indeed have the rate, the Conglomerate labor negotiator told them to ask for more, as five credits a work day, or in a common Earth currency, three hundred dollars, for a ten hour shift, was downright outrageous, and only a third of the galactic standard wage! The human negotiator had responded with a headline making the remark of “I was starting the wage high, and was planning on working it down from there.”. After the session, humanity agreed for its workforce to work for only three quarters of the standard wage, and the human populace seemed to trip over each other rushing to the nearest starports. Captain Gush was glad to be saving so much money, even if it meant he had to contract a hoard of lunatics, and amateurs. After a week of waiting for the crew to arrive, quarters to be arranged, and the cargo to be stowed, the 'CSO-928-C’ cargo freighter was ready to depart for what was to be a mission that held a significance that none present understood.

“Human Alex!”

The voice was harsh, and gravelly, making Alex turn his translation/communication headset down. 

“Yes sir?” Responded Alex, looking up from his work to see just what the Bosun wanted.

“The lighting in the recreation area failed again. YOU were the one who repaired it.” Said the angry Ichtri.

“I told you not to turn the brightness all the way up! All I did was replace the fuse, I told you that! It will be fixed when I'm finished with the lighting in the friggin bathroom!” He said, waving a screwdriver angrily. “What absolutely braindead engineer thought it was a good idea to-”

The bosun cut him off before he could go on his usual rant. “You aren't being paid to complain about the ship's design. You are being paid to maintain the ship, operate the machinery, and maintain the cargo.”

“That's another thing! Life support and gravity are on the same circuit! Why are we taxing that power by maintaining lighting and gravity in the cargo bay? The damn cargo is already mag locked to the floor and…”

Bosun Niktich tuned out the rant he had failed to contain. He had worked with humans once before, and the constant complaining about engineering was expected at this point. It seemed their technicians and their engineers had been at war with each other in every field, since the invention of their sciences. Now, it was not uncommon for the technicians to be heard complaining about design down one hallway, and an engineer complaining about jury rigging and incompetant work down the next. Niktich let the human cool down, before continuing his order.

“I'm sure if you lodge a complaint with the ship’s manufacturer, they will accommodate you.” he said, his voice attempting very strongly to communicate what most species referred to as ‘sarcasm’, a trait his people had very little use for. “But until that happens, I want the recreation lighting fixed with priority above what you're doing now. Get on it!”

Alex grumbled and walked off towards the recreation area, and Niktich sighed deeply. Humans were intimidating, but once you learned when they were actually angry, and when they were just making a fuss, they were surprisingly easy to handle. He made his way toward the engine room, tapping into the internship communication with his own headset.

“Engines, this is Niktich. Everything is running smoothly?”

A smaller voice, one of the Krtik answered. “Yes Bosun, all is well.”

“Thank you technician. The captain says that a course adjustment responded four seconds too slow. Look into that, if you please.” Said Niktich.

“Just got started on that a few minutes ago, bosun. We noticed the delay, and believe it was some ice forming on the main propulsion swivel. The gas cloud we passed through yesterday may have heated some particles to fluid with our friction. We are lowering the coolant levels to see if melting it off works.” Said the Krtik technician.

“Excellent news technician. Carry on.” Said Niktich, still walking to the engine room to do a visual inspection. It was business as usual. 

Alex grumbled to himself as he walked down the short hallway. Although the cargo ship was massive, being nearly a mile long, most of the space was used for cargo, while the area containing the operational systems and crew was barely larger than a highschool football field, albeit taller, and with a few decks. This allowed the eighty crewman to work in four, four hour shifts, and maintain a vessel this size from almost entirely one area. Of course, the humans were freakish, and volunteered to work in shifts twice that long, which was permitted, but they often found little to do, as most tasks were taken by others, so the humans wound up running a seperate schedule: six hours on, twelve hours off. The Bosun had a nightmarish time scheduling this, but he made it work. It was just the start of Alex's shift, and as an electrician, he found himself on a constant stream of menial tasks. Lights going out, doors responding sluggish, etcetera, etcetera. Making his way to the recreational room, he knew he would find the same thing. He brought up the circuit diagram on his data tablet as he walked, mentally preparing himself for an hour of removing panels, and thirty seconds of fixing the problem. He arrived to find the recreation area surprisingly empty, save for a Krtik and a Herlum. The Krtiks were sort of cute in Alex's opinion, looking much like little velociraptors, covered in feathers, and a bit more upright. The Herlum, were the opposite on the visually appealing scale, resembling a slimy beetle. Naturally, Alex was friendlier towards the Krtik, and was glad to see the one in the room was one he knew by name. He had worked on a few ship projects with the little lizard, and enjoyed its company. 

""Hey Scriivi."" Sighed Alex.

""Hey, you…"" Scriivi paused, and looked down at her data slate, reading something. ""...good for nothing shithead!""

Alex stopped walking, arms still extended comically, and he pivoted to face the lizard who was half his height. 

""I'm sorry, but what did you just say?"" He asked.

""Oh uh, Human Peter was telling me about what he called, what was the word… oh, banter! I don't really understand why insulting someone would be a friendly gesture, but he does it alot. Since there are so many of you humans here, I wanted to try to practice some of your culture."" Responded Scriivi.

Alex started to laugh a little louder than was appropriate. ""Peter Halfson? The Australian guy, I assume?"" He asked. 

""I don't know what group of yours he belongs to, but yes, the human Peter Halfson."" Said Scriivi.

""Well, ill tell you, banter is something most people do, but it needs to flow nicely. Practice with Peter before you try it with any others. If you said that to someone like Eric, he'd probably cave your snout in!"" Laughed Alex.

Scriivi shrank back in fear of the thought, before agreeing timidly, and returning to her meal. Alex rolled his eyes. He had told her a hundred times that sayings like that weren't literal, but the stigma around humanity would not be broken with only a few words of assurance, and especially not when they talked like that. With mild amusement, he opened the main electrical box for the room, and pulled out the lighting fuse, which was blown, just as expected. The room was still well lit, as someone had rigged up a pair of floodlights, and aimed them at the ceiling, providing similar lighting to the room's normal illumination. Alex popped in a new fuse, and turned up the lighting slightly, careful to avoid blowing the fuse he had just put in. Once the light was satisfactory, he began testing the circuit. The Herlum in the room sauntered over, and turned off the floodlights, before sliding its meal tray into a receptacle, and leaving. Alex was midway through removing a section of paneling, when Scriivi broke the silence.

""So what do you think the problem is?"" She asked.

""With the lights? I don't know, my guess is the wire is shorting to ground for God knows what reason. I know damn well that I'm going to go down the whole line, and it's going to be in the absolute last place I check."" He replied.

""Well if you know that's where the problem is, why wouldn't that be the first place you checked?"" She asked.

""Oh very simple!"" Responded Alex. ""If I check there first, the problem will be somewhere else!""

Scriivi looked at him with utter incredulity. Was he succumbing to some sort of mental sickness? Electrical problems don't just move around based on where you looked for them!

""Oh, actually…"" he continued ""I know you're eating, but could you check that last panel over there? It would save me some time, since the problem would be closer to me then.""

Scriivi slowly finished her meal, and made a mental note to report human Alex to the medical staff for a mental checkup later. Once she finished, she placed her tray in the receptacle, and aided Alex in his little project. Just as Alex had said, everything was fine under the last panel. She had a moment of concern before she remembered there were twelve access panels, and a one in twelve chance is nothing to worry about. The worry returned stronger when Alex reached the second to last panel, removed it, and almost instantly spotted the issue: a small piece of wire insulation was cracked and torn, and had shorted out.

Alex laughed to himself bitterly, and Scriivi simply stared as Alex fixed the wire, wondering if this was all some sort of odd joke.

Security head Gmgmgun stood upright, completely asleep. He looked as though someone had taken the furriest carpet ever made, and tried to pitch a seven foot tall tent with it. The only thing that denoted that he was a life form were the ten barely visible crab legs beneath him, and the four large eyes on one side. He of course, had other exterior details, such as nightmare inducing teeth on his underside, and a pair of very small manipulators, invisible under his fur, and located slightly under his eyes. He slept upright at the edge of the narrow room, but he was not alone. Human security Powel was teaching Ichtri security Kznit the rules to a game he called ""blackjack"". Once Kznit had the rules down, they began to play casually to pass the time. Of course, the game itself was not enough to break the utter boredom, so the pair had taken to talking.

""Damn, should have stuck with what I had. Said Powel.

""Well I doubt a fifteen would have been substantial against whatever I am to be dealt."" Snickered Kznit.

Powel rolled his eyes, and made an obscene hand gesture that did not translate, before looking over to the sleeping guard. ""Is he ever NOT asleep?"" Asked Powel.

""He is a Gug. What did you expect? This heat forces him to hibernate excessively."" Responded Kznit.

""I dont know… Im still getting used to the whole alien thing. Do you know how fucking surreal it is, sitting here talking to a giant bug? Er- no offense."" Said Powel, rolling up his sleeves.

""No offense taken, unless me calling you a mammal makes you upset. But as for your question, I'm afraid I don't know what you feel. My people have been among the Starborne Conglomerate for nineteen of your centuries. Considering that my lifespan is half of yours, I never knew the feeling of believing you are alone in the universe."" Said Kznit.

""It was a hypothetical question, but alright."" Chuckled Powel. ""Speaking of your people, I read somewhere that you commit like… almost no crime. So how did you end up as a security guard? I mean, the qualifications needed were like, what, three years of experience?"" Asked Powel.

""Oh, I worked as a flag cutter for most of my life."" Responded Kznit, who upon seeing Powel's confused look, began to elaborate. ""A flag cutter is one of the most dangerous jobs my people have. My people tend to work in groups very well, but on occasion, a rebellious little devil will show their face among the crowd. They will seek personal gain through the use of others, and sway others to their cause quite fervently. Eventually, they will have a following of dozens of loyalists, and they will break away from society. This is all well and good, and happens quite often, forming companies, and colonies and such, but sometimes the group acts out of control, and begins to wreak havoc, robbing and killing as they go. That's when they call flag cutters. We find them, and exterminate them to the last member. More often than not, it's an indoor affair, and ranged weapons are useless. It was a fight of claw and mandible, ripping and tearing away at each other. Only the strongest, or best trained survived. I myself have seen nine raids."" 

He gestures to his cybernetic forearm, and the terrible scar down the center of his face. ""It takes a toll even on the best of us.""

Powel nodded, looking quite impressed as he shuffled the cards. 

""Damn, I think you got seniority on me for combat experience then."" Said Powel, looking at Kznit. The bug stood several feet taller than him, and he had always considered himself a taller guy, standing at six feet. Images of the insectoid giant clashing with others in a gruesome melee gave him genuine respect for the alien.

""Oh? I thought with the warrior culture of earth, you would have seen far more engagements than I."" Said Kznit

Powel laughed. ""I dont think you guys have the right idea of earth. You arent the first one ive heard say that were some ancient clan of warriors or some other dumb shit.""

""Then tell me, what gave you the qualifications to be here?"" Asked Kznit.

Powel put the deck of cards down before responding. ""I was in a VBSS team. We-""

Before he could go on, the intercomm came to life, with the familiar aquatic voice of the captain. ""Security to the bridge at once!"" He cried.

""Story for another time."" Said Powel, jumping to his feet. The pair left the room in a rush, without even waking the sleeping Gug in the corner.

**Forecasted Education and Background:**

*Each of these here would be tailored on the pathway I decide on.*

* Location: Anywhere in the US (I'm flexible on location)
* Education: Masters degree that most relates to the field above with an internship prior to applying.
* Personal Projects: 3-5 projects of moderate size
* Prior Work History: 5 years in healthcare with minor projects relating to automation and ML (vision + NLP) each using a tech stack related to the above for a hospital.

**My questions for each would be the following:**
1. What does job security look like both now and in the future?
2. Difficulty of breaking into the field given the above background.
3. Whats the worst case salary both breaking into the field and in the later stages?
4. How feasible is a second job/freelancing/contract work for someone who wants to work 60 to 100 hours per week?

**How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**

No need for 2 in 1, build quality and weight is priority. Then performance. Battery life just needs to be about 3-4 hours of hard work at most, and the rest just browsing/word processing

I am a Computer Science student, so I will be using it for some software development and also normal word processing use, but I don't expect the projects to be overly large or complex. I've done internships with a company laptop (Dell XPS 15, i7 6820HQ, 32GB RAM), which even for their large code base was more than powerful enough for me. 

For best bang for buck, I'm eyeing laptops with an i5 or AMD equivalent (no preference) and 16GB of RAM. I'm just leaning towards getting a new XPS 15 or 13 for myself since I really like this one, but I know they have overheating issues which leads to battery inflating. That's why I'm here looking for other recommendations that might be cheaper or just alternatives to an XPS.

EDIT: I've been doing some more research and I keep seeing the new Macbook air m1 show up as a good recommendation. With a student discount, that would put the price just around my budget with 16gb of ram. Can any developers weigh in on if they find all the software they need on mac? Obviously I would be able to play any games on it, but if that's not super important to me, is this a good choice?

Thanks!"

Here is the seventy-second installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

I’m from the Caribbean and worked at a small offshore bank for 2 years where I got transferred from the filing department immediately after graduation and landed my first gig as a junior network tech/help-desk.

The company has maybe 70 persons and I felt right at home. Wasn’t making much but I was happy and had access to everything for learning purposes. Passed my A+ and N+ but I always wanted to work abroad.

Fast forward to 2018 – applied for a 40k scholarship award and got a golden opportunity to study in Canada all expenses paid. 

Sadly, It’s been brutal. Frustration, homesick but I graduated with honors from a network tech program and even completed my CCNA and two L2 desktop support internships. My family is telling me to be patient but during this pandemic the stress has been magnified and I'm now questioning my career choice. I love configuring network devices and enjoyed my hands-on Cisco academy labs. I do packet tracer labs at night just to stay sharp because I have no access to networking on this job. 

This is the first time ever learning about recruiters and MSPs so I naively took the first job offer I got.

I am extremely unhappy to say the least, calls are giving me anxiety and working for a law firm with nasty impatient users is making my life miserable. I’m great with end users but I’ve never had to deal with this magnitude of stress and micromanagement in my life. The pay is also terrible and its my fault because I was just happy to get a gig fresh out of college as a foreigner. 

On top of that I’ve been working remotely and locked down in my apartment. (Thank God my fianceé is with me). The manager analyzes all of my tickets and nit picks on the most bogus details and it's always something new that I was never trained on.

As I mentioned , I passed my CCNA last year and I’m studying nightly and applying to jobs just to get out of this position.

My contract ends in August and I’d rather be unemployed for a bit than to go through this again.  I'm working on my resume and appying to NOC, junior network roles and even Engineering positions. 

What can I do to make sure that I’m ready to land at least an NOC job in hopes of becoming a network admin/engineer one day?

I can’t take it anymore"

My previous semester GPA were respectively 8.6/8.25 respectively. I didn't cheat for the first sem and during the second, I learnt that I didn't know how to even cheat.The other classmates took help from even seniors and other branch batches, who maybe they met during online gaming and I don't game(my desktop is quite old, 45 nm AMD processor of 2009, can't upgrade freely since even education is on loan).

It's not that I didn't tried to self study. I learnt from NPTEL videos but when you have to find diagonalized matrix for nearly half of your paper of 8 questions , or to solve 30 K-Map questions in 30 mins in quizes, and it's simply not enough and a lot time consuming .


I don't even understand if Its due to Corona lockdown or I am simply not even good enough(I had high hopes after getting 96. 2% in 12(18-19),95.34%(19-20) in Jee, regional gov. college except NIT weren't that good in my state) .

If so, what are some other, maybe easier ways to make my resume stand out and get an interview?

* Learn C++ and the STL (had to put Rust on hold despite liking it more, due to the job prospects)
* Build a complete project I can showcase 
* Get really good at using the Unix terminal 
* Learn the basics of Unix system programming 
* Build a project that demonstrates my Unix knowledge (any ideas?)
* Grind Leetcode

oj93ir,0,2021-07-13,In here I explain one overlooked unrealistic expectation that a lot of the industry places on less experienced engineers,Elven_Ba11er,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/oj93ir/in_here_i_explain_one_overlooked_unrealistic/,"This could be a taken as a warning to those with little to no experience but I am looking at this with a ""hindsight is 20/20"" point of view with more experience. 

A large part of the industry puts this one unrealistic expectation about junior workers, before they begin working. And even before they get their first job offer. It's not *directly* related to tech skills, although it still connects to that. And many times, failing to meet this expectation can do long-term damage to careers the longer it is left uncorrected. 

So what unrealistic expectation am I talking about? Stuff like, having 5+ years of Java experience for new grads? Or asking you to hold up the backbone to their entire product line? 

No, not those. We've all seen our share of those but that's not what I'm talking about here. It's actually worse in that it's hidden from plain sight, and it's implicitly created from the general apathy of numerous companies taken as a whole.

And that expectation is, *that engineers with little to no experience would know what good software development practices look like.*

This might also assume the following: They all took an internship, and at a good company. If they have that then they're in better shape and have at least *some* idea of what good, marketable skills could be.

But if they did not, if they had no internships or took only a half-baked internship where they barely learned anything, god speed to them. This goes extra if they were self-taught or going to boot camps instead of college. They'll stand less of a chance to go into big tech companies so now they'll enter more unpredictable territory. Here be dragons (not to harm you today, but to curse you later)

Because, if you don't know what's bad for you, how does one prepare for it? For at least their first 1 or 2 jobs, juniors will likely give their employers the benefit of the doubt, because ""if it works for them, and everyone is okay with it, it must be a good enough practice in the industry."" That's how most people who lack much career experience and wisdom would think, anyway.

That innocent mistake will grow insidiously if you stay in those places too long, or if you continuously get into jobs that do things much in the way your first job did. It's real easy to get caught up in garbage companies. Time flies and before you know it, you become an ""expert beginner"". You never learned to do better things. All you know is using the same crappy methods from the beginning, only faster. And all because you were misguided from the beginning. 

And that's one of the shitty sides to this industry. Nobody is required to tell you what good industry practices are, but companies seem to assume you will always be on the right path, especially when you start applying for the intermediate jobs. If it doesn't work out, it will feel like you've wasted your time in your jobs.

Most juniors don't know what a minefield the market for jobs is. They assume that after the grueling job search is done and they got an offer, the worst is over. But that is greatly depending on where you got the offer."

I'm personally looking to apply for CS and got a machine learning externship at AT&amp;T, so would that be as reputable or even close to an internship at the same or a similar company? Also, the externship also gives ML certification under the company so I'm assuming that would be some pretty good job/work experience although we most likely won't be taking on any projects. Let me know if any of you have any idea at all regarding this, thanks!"

Maybe the r/antiwork in me is showing, but given the way peole are expected to be on call while having no work-life balance, I just can't. Sure the salaries are great, but at what cost?

They fuck up your mental health and you are disposable to them anyway.

I'd much rather work for a decent company with decent pay and a really good work-life balance where bosses know I have a life and am not just a drone.

I've heard too many people ""brag"" about how productive they are cause they get like 5 hours of sleep every night.

My last boss at my internship was annoyed I didn't do office related tasks for 60-70 hours a week. FOR AN UNPAID INTERNSHIP.

Friends that had to leave birthdays at 12:30 AM cause they got a call from office. On a fucking Saturday.

Are there any other Jim Halpert's and Stanley Hudson's that just want to clock in and clock out and be producitve before they can return to their personal life?

And realistically, is that even possible?"

I moved into a WG at the start of this month but now I received an internship in a different city from August onwards. I will have to move out from here and stay near my place of work. However my contract started on 1st July and I am aware of the 3 month notice period policy. I am confident that I will find someone to replace me but I am worried about my kaution(deposit) and other fines. I was suggested by people that I should sublet it for 4 to 6 months and then leave legally or else the landlord will deduct kaution and can even impose a fine if he wants to. I have 2 options now:

1) Ask the landlord to terminate my contract and allow the next tenant to form a new contract.

2) Sublet it for a few months and then leave either by serving my 3 month notice period or finding a replacement in the 4th or 5th month.

What would be the better choice and is there an alternative to this situation?"
oje94m,16,2021-07-13,I have an ability that allows me to see other people's visions. [Pt.2],MagicLobsterTickle,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/oje94m/i_have_an_ability_that_allows_me_to_see_other/,"It’s been some days since my initial post, and to my sheer surprise, one of you actually got in touch with me. Thank you and I appreciate the support. I think at this moment in time, having another Venator on the case is about the best I can hope for in solving such a dilemma.

I sighted poor Lucy’s life a few more times since my initial bout, and as far as I’m aware, she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, with absolutely no connection to me. However, no matter how many times I’ve gone over the moment of Lucy at the party, Lucy leaving the party with friends, Lucy parting ways to go to the bus stop, and Lucy getting on the bus, I noticed nothing out of the ordinary, nor have I been able to understand how she went from being passed out on the bus, to being dragged through the woods. Someone, likely the killer, must have gotten to her while she was passed out on the bus and injected her with a paralysis agent, then carried her off the bus and into the woods without alerting anyone.

If this was the case, I assumed the whole thing was planned. The killer knew Lucy would be drunk or somewhat incapacitated on that bus, and they knew when and where to take her. This meant that it was all concocted so I would be the Venator to look into it. They set it all up for me. And it was very personal. They said they wanted me to enjoy her suffering…

I had gotten in touch with Girl A, the contact who had gotten me this case, and asked for more details about how she had gotten her hands on this case. At this time, I thought it best to have a one to one live conversation rather than emails or letters. I booted my VPN and went online at 9pm, knowing that the UK would be noon so Girl A would likely be available from whatever work she did in her life. At 9.14pm, she logged on.

“Sorry for reaching out like this. Bit of an emergency.” I typed.

“Yeah, you don’t do chat usually. Whatsup?”

“I need to know how you got this Whitehall case.”

“Why? Did something happen?”

I waited a moment before responding. I thought it best not to alert her or give her any cause for concern. If the killer murdered an innocent just to send a grotesque message to me, then very likely they know all about me. Plus, that meant they knew about soul sight and Venators, which was shocking enough in and of itself.

“Nothing in particular. Curiosity got peaked though. Interesting case.”

“Do I want to know?”

“Not really.”

“Kk.”

I waited a moment for Girl A to respond, and when she didn’t, I reminded her.

“So how did you get the case?”

The type bubble appeared, then went grey, then showed typing again.

“A girl called Clytie Innes, friend of Lucy Whitehall, was posting missing persons posters outside my office. I asked her about it and she told me what happened. I said I may be of assistance and she gave me Whitehall's number to get in touch.”

“Gottit. How did you get the wisdom tooth?”

The message was seen and there was a pause before the type bubble appeared again.

“I spoke to the Whitehall’s and told them I knew a PI that could be of help. They asked me what they could do and I requested Lucy’s DNA. They happened to have a tooth.”

“Gottit.”

“Yeah, I guess I got lucky. Just so happens this whole thing happened in Cambridge.”

I sat back and stared at the screen. Probably was no coincidence this was all in Cambridge. The killer likely knew about Girl A’s ties to me already. The next thing would be to request something from the parents and that friend, Clytie Innes. If I could sight these three people, I could possibly learn more of what has happened and build from there, because as things were, I had no leads to go on.

The type bubble appeared again.

“Hold on.”

I responded with “Sure.”

There was a long pause. I waited for a minute, then two. Five minutes passed and I went to make myself a cup of herbal tea. When I returned, there was still nothing new, so I typed “You alright?”

After a couple more minutes, the type bubble popped up.

“Sorry, my bad. Have you learnt anything new?”

“Not much tbh.”

I considered how much info I should let on at the moment.

“Lucy was definitely murdered. Perp was possibly a woman, I’m guessing average height and build. Sounded young. Whole thing went down in a forest or woods. Very wet ground, so recent rain. Possibly close to the bus’ route, but can’t be sure. A car could have been used to take her.”

Girl A saw the message and there was a long pause before she typed again.

“You sure it was a woman?”

“Pretty sure. Voice was young and female. She used a kitchen knife. Wore a black hoodie and some creepy red, home-made mask.”

There was another pause.

“You mean this mask?”

And before I could even start to type, an image filled the chat window.

A portrait photo of a woman sitting sprawled on a desk swivel chair. Her arms fell limp over the armrests and her head tilted to one side, almost pulling her whole body over. Her throat was cut deeply and the blood had poured from the dark red gash down her front, soaking through her turquoise shirt, turning the colour to a deathly black. There was a little pool of blood forming around the wheels of the chair as blood dripped off the seat, and down the woman’s bare legs. To top it all off, her face was hidden by a red mask; two black holes for eyes and a lopsided crag of a wicked death smile. The killer’s mask.

I recoiled and felt the blood drain from my face. A numbing sensation gripped my whole body and I felt my skin prickle as my eyes scanned over this shocking photo. All of a sudden, I didn’t know what to say or do as I was gripped with a chilling wave of fear. The photo was taken from a point so that you could see the whole body and the surrounding area. There was even some blood splatters on the surrounding walls...what the fuck??

The type bubble appeared again.

“I present for your pleasure, Jennifer.”

Jennifer. Girl A. There was a pause before another picture was sent.

It was largely the same, except this time, Jennifer’s legs were spread open and a knife was stuck deeply into her lower abdomen.

“You like it?” Said a new message.

I gulped and closed my laptop. My mind raced through thoughts so fast, I couldn’t even understand them myself. My heart was racing and my hands trembled against the cold metal of the laptop. I looked around the room, half expecting a shadowy figure to come leaping at me. Calm! Calm down. Breathe. Think.

I pushed away from my desk and hung my head, slowing my breathing and focusing on a particular speck of dirt on my wooden flooring. Once I felt myself back under control, I pulled up to the desk again and opened up the laptop. The second macabre image was still on screen, but with new messages below.

“She was so surprised when I cut her throat.”

“You’re not as observant as I thought, Grey.”

“Do you like it though?”

“Do you like it?”

“Do you like it?”

As my eyes looked over the image again, I felt my fear starting to ebb, being replaced with pure rage. Rage for Jennifer. Rage against this piece of shit psycho. My blood raced and I could sense tunnel vision starting to set in as my tense fingers typed on the keys.

“I’m going to find you. I’m going to make you pay.”

The message was seen and there was a long pause before one last line.

“Not if I find you first. ;)”

With that, Jennifer’s account went offline.

I wasted no time. I went straight to the kitchen, took a swig of tequila from the fridge, and marched into my bedroom. Lucy’s wisdom tooth was still on my nightstand, but this time I didn’t need it, nor bother prepping the atmosphere with candles or dimming lights. I looked under my bed and pulled out a metal combination box, from which I retrieved a little non-static bag with a couple strands of blonde hair inside, and an envelope of photos. I placed both on my bed and stared at them for a moment, my breathing intense. I hadn’t touched these things in so long, nor did I want to touch them now, but I had a hunch, and I needed to be sure.

I took one of the hairs out from the plastic bag and sat on the edge of my bed, sandwiching the strand between my two palms in my lap. I drew in a long, deep breath, and let it all out slowly. Closing my eyes, I let my mind go.

I felt the dark emptiness surrounding me, and I welcomed it. I focused on the stars. So many stars. The hair called to me and I pressed my palms together harder. There! That’s the star. I could see it. I could see…

*I cursed as the traffic barely moved. The car in front was an old, dirty white Ford, and that just ticked me off even more. I’ve been stuck for near an hour in this fucking traffic jam, and all the while I had to stare at that ugly piece of scrap. That, and my goddamn wife losing her shit next to me.*

*“So are we going to agree on this, Nick?” My wife asked for the Nth fucking time!*

*I gripped the steering wheel harder, my fingertips digging into the leather. “For fuck sake, we’re not going. I’ve got the board to fucking please, and the new project’s getting cold cus the PM is a lazy little shit. I don’t have time to entertain your fucking parents as well!”*

*“Nick, my parents want to see you!” She whined. God, woman, shut the fuck up! “They’re worried about me, about the baby! You said you would take time-”*

*“Gods, I don’t give a shit, Mary!” I half shouted. “I don’t have the fucking time!”*

(My goodness...how I regret all this…)

*Mary folded her arms over her baby bump, and looked out the passenger window. “Why are you being such a dick, Nick?” She grumbled. “You can spend ‘business’ trip after ‘business’ trip with that intern girl, but can’t travel with your pregnant wife?”*

*That really pissed me off. I smacked the steering wheel and raised my voice. “Fucking hell, Mary, I didn’t do anything! How many fucking times!” I turned to her but couldn’t hold in my anger. “I didn’t fuck her, alright? I DIDN’T!”*

I jerked back to myself and found my hands had clenched into fists. My heart raced and I could feel the adrenaline pumping, the sheer anger coursing through me. I gritted my teeth and breathed through to avoid throwing something. My god, I wanted to throw something bad.

Once the residue emotions ebbed, I endeavored to retry. I needed to focus. There was a specific thing I needed to see. A specific face I needed to see. So I calmed down and sandwiched the hair again, this time focusing hard. The stars came, the images came, and there...it...was…

*God this girl was good! Stupid, but good. There are definitely perks to being the boss to something so fine as her, I thought, as I pounded this young brunette from behind, over my mahogany desk. Her hiked up skirt, her wrinkled shirt, her hair in my fist, and her beautiful little moans each time I bucked into her. I’ve had her for how many times now? But damn, if I couldn’t get enough!*

*“You behave real good, Kelly.” I cooed, stroking down her back with my free hand and giving her hair an extra hard tug, eliciting a whimper from the girl. “I think you deserve something nicer.”*

(Oh yeah. This is the one.)

*A faint knock resounded on my office door and I looked up sharply. Fucking god damn it! I thought I told Sophie I was not to be disturbed! That woman can’t do a goddamn thing right. This intern on my dick can do more with her tight little cunt than that bitch can do with her whole life!*

*I gave one last good thrust into heaven, then quickly pulled out, stuffing myself back into my pants and zipping and belting up. Kelly tried to stand up, but I quickly gripped her shoulder and shoved her down to hide under my desk. I sat into my chair and switched my monitor screen back on.*

*“Come in.” I called, trying to keep annoyance out of my voice.*

(Annnnnnd, here I come.)

*A girl I’ve never seen slowly opened the door and stepped in. She was dressed nicely. Very nicely. Her blonde hair tied back in a cute ponytail. Good makeup. A tidy white dress shirt and grey pencil skirt. Stylish strappy heels. Not bad, but who the fuck was she, and what the fuck was she doing here?*

(God, I was stupid back then. I should never have met this guy.)

*“I told Sophie I was occupied.” I said, looking back to my monitor whilst typing some words into an email.*

*The girl took a few steps into the room. She seemed relatively confident, her face gentle yet determined. She looked as if she was on a mission. Bold of her.*

*“Mister Gibson, apologies for disturbing you.” The girl said with a soft voice. Cute. Maybe I should forgive her. “My name is Eden Hainsworth. I believe you were looking for a private investigator?”*

*A PI? Her? Don’t be ridiculous. This young girl looked like she could be in high school still. “Yeah, I see why Sophie let you in. Thank you, but I’m looking for someone with a little more experience.” I said in a blunt tone. Get out of here, girl, I have unfinished business!*

*“Actually, Mister Gibson, what I may lack in experience, I assure you, I make up for in ability.” The girl said, and she took another step towards my desk. Ha! This one had spunk. I would appreciate it, if I wasn’t dying to get off inside Kelly.*

*I stopped typing and faced her. “Miss Hainsworth, was it? Thank you, but you really don’t seem like the type for the job.”*

*The girl stepped closer, now on the other side of the desk. She smiled at me and said, “Mister Gibson, just from your business, your secretary, and your office, I can already surmise that you drive a Mercedes M-class ML500 which is currently parked in the parking lot across the street, because you probably don’t want an employee accidently scratching it. You are married with a daughter I believe, and you and your wife are currently having a marital dispute. You believe she is having an affair behind your back, and, being someone in your standing, you would like to find out who it is.”*

(I was so silly back then. My first and only client I faced in person. If only I wasn’t so greedy for money.)

*I stared at her with a raised eyebrow. Was that for real? Has Sophie been telling her about me? No, even Sophie couldn’t be that stupid.*

*“Oh, and of course, discretion is of the utmost importance here, Mister Gibson.” The girl continued. I imagine she felt emboldened by my stunned look. “That’s why I think if we were to discuss further how I could help you, the girl under your desk should probably leave.”*

(I’m kinda proud of that one. I honestly didn’t sight him to know of the girl at the time. It was an educated guess. I was so much more confident back then.)

*What the fuck? This little brat walks in here all headstrong and thinks she can dig up info on me, and know my secrets? Brazen, but impressive none-the-less. I closed my mouth that had opened up in surprise and cleared my throat, gesturing for this newcomer to sit. Maybe I’ll entertain her.*

*“I see. Impressive.” Fine, this girl wants to tango with me, then we tango. Maybe I can get a little more out of her than she expects anyway. That would be fun. I shifted my chair back and looked down. “Kelly, would you mind giving us a little privacy. We can finish later.”*

(Ok, come on. I need to see your face…)

*Kelly nodded then crawled out and stood, straightening her clothes and shooting me a glance of disapproval, then a look of absolute disdain at the new girl. Her cheeks were still flushed and her lips pouty. Such a beautiful looking slut she was, even with such a bitchy look upon her. Especially with her sexy heterochromatic eyes.*

(There! Got you.)

I twitched back to reality and had to take a few breaths. The animalistic urge I felt in my gut was still strong and I was really horny. I stood up from my bed and shook myself on the spot a little bit. Once I felt like myself again, I took out the photos from the envelope and started going through them. They were of the man I just sighted in a variety of locales and situations. His name was Nick Gibson, my first ever client whom I stupidly met in person and who I eventually had an intimate relationship with, much to my current regret. As I said before though, something bad happened and I had to leave the UK. It was about him. I had thought I left it all behind, but now…

I stopped at a photo of Nick and a group of people from his company, at some kind of convention. Sitting down and throwing up the peace sign in the front row was the same girl from the last sight. A brunette with one blue eye and one green eye.

Kelly. I left my country because of this Kelly. Nick had told me how she had wanted me dead. How she apparently blamed ME for her own downfall. I now know your face. I now know your name. It was hard to imagine that doe-eyed intern who Nick had fooled around with would be capable of actual murder, but knowing my history with Nick, it wasn’t too much of a stretch that they could be the ones responsible for what was happening now."

I’m an intern working on a bot that uses 8 x 18650 batteries to power itself. They’re set up as 4 in series in a custom casing we made, parallel with the other 4 in series in another one of those casings.

When we turn the bot on, it seems like it’s only draining power from one of the casings, so I thought the other one wasn’t connected, but when I removed the 4 batteries from the first casing, it started draining power from the second one, which only happened after removing those first set of batteries.

Any explanation for this? How should I approach getting it to use power from both sets simultaneously?

Thanks!!"

For context, my student teaching experience was absolutely rough. My last post can provide more detailed context, but needless to say the internship absolutely destroyed every ounce of confidence I have, to the point where anything school-related sends me into a panicked frenzy. I recently graduate college, and despite applying to as many schools as I can, I still have no job offers yet. As if that isn't nerve-wrecking enough, I have terrible imposter syndrome and am doubting if I should accept any position at all. 

That being said, of course I need a job. However, I feel I should be planning the for the school year even if I do not know if I'll be teaching elementary or middle school. However, every time I attempt to plan, I get anxiety and freak out, remembering all the things that went wrong in student teaching.  I am terrified of being a horrible teacher, of being scared to come in everyday like I was during student teaching. 

Even with the curriculum laid out, I feel I have absolutely no idea what to do, or what I'm doing. I'm panicking, trying to get a job, and also trying to create hypothetical curriculums in preparation for whatever grade I end up teaching, if I get a teaching job at all. 

I don't know where to begin. I don't know what the right way to introduce procedures, concepts, is.  I pushed aside planning because I'm terrified and it's already nearly the middle of July. 

If I end up getting a job confirmation now, I barely have any material to work with. I hate my anxiety, I hate how it's caused me to procrastinate and the thought of teaching sometimes makes me terrified and want to throw up. I swear its not because I'm lazy, I've always worked extremely hard in whatever I do, but gosh student teaching really wrecked me!  But again, I need a job, but at the same time, I'm scared I'll trap myself again in a scary/extremely terrifying environment. I'm trying so hard to plan, but without knowing what specific job I'll be in, it's hard to motivate myself to plan when I'm not even certain where I'll be, or if I'll have a teaching job at all!

Am I terrible for not having things for the year planned even though I don't have a job yet? How does one gain confidence? How do I even plan things to begin with? How long should I spend on rules and procedures? What are things that can calm me down? Just a panicking mess! I feel like maybe I shouldn't even accept a job if I feel this scared, but I don't know where else I'd go to get a job that maybe would leave me fulfilled!"

I'm a BI intern and I'm stuck with a headache on this project at work and I was wondering if you guys could point me towards the solution. 

I have a MySQL database which tracks our orders, and I wrote a SQL query which gathers all the data I need per order.  

Once I have this data, I want to use this data per row and run calculations to obtain a final field that will be my output.

My questions are the following: 

* I'm currently building a python app that performs these calculations (built on Tkinter), with test data stored in my code directly, but how do I tell my code to run these calculations for every single row from the database
* Once I have this output field, how do I store my output? Is my new calculation a new field that I need to append as a new column to the dataframe ?

   
Note: I wish I could ask this question to the engineer above me but she's too busy to answer any of my questions. Sorry if it's not very educated.

Note 2: Im not expecting anyone to do the project for me, I just want some indications on how I could do this/where to find the info to do this.  

i.e. this is what my data looks like.

|Order ID|potatoes per bag|number of bags|desired output: x\*y|

I just finished my 4th year and I'm on track to graduate in the fall (doing 4.5 years).

Undergrad in Data Science and Mathematics at a top 50 school in the US (I'm a US citizen). 5 grad courses in ML/Stat Learning Theory (math), Numerical Analysis 1 and 2 (math), Graph Theory (math), Computer Graphics (CS), Computer Systems (CS), Applied Linear Algebra and Matrix Analysis (math)

The last two I'm taking this fall, and the other ones are all A's. 3.97 Math GPA, 3.66 CS/Math GPA, and 3.51 overall GPA (did a business minor and didn't really care for it so it sunk my GPA). I was a little overconfident when I started college, so my freshman/sophomore years include much more B's and C's than A's, but since then I've only gotten A's and one A- since I started considering grad school more.

I don't have any research experience since I focused on CS internships (nabbed Apple and a couple startups) so my recs are going to be from profs of the grad courses mentioned above since the class size was small and I frequented office hours and got A's.

I have job offers already, and I'm only applying for grad programs out of personal interest, so I'm only aiming for top programs with no safeties, since my safety is just a job. These programs include Columbia APAM, Stanford ICME, NYU Courant, MIT CSE, Harvard CSE, CMU MSCV, and Penn AMCS.

I haven't spent any time studying for the GRE, and I'm a little worried since I was banking on it being cancelled just like last year, but that doesn't seem to be the case. I've heard that a high GRE doesn't help you, but a low one will close a lot of doors.

With this information, what GRE score should I be targeting just so doors don't close? I'm obviously going to focus on getting a near-perfect math score, but what's a ""good"" baseline score for these programs?"

I pay my own bills besides rent, utilities, etc (living at home). I have a car and my boyfriend doesn’t. I am by no means a wealthy person, but I always make sure my bills and things are taken care of. I try my hardest not to depend on anyone and it has worked thus far. We have been dating for a year and I’m always the one who has to come see him. We compromise and he pays for food and activities most of the time since we have to use my car for everything. 

Throughout the entire relationship he’s been asking me for favors that include him borrowing money from me. Sometimes he pays me back if he thinks it’s warranted. For example, if it’s a large amount of money. Or instead of paying me back the actual money, he’ll buy me food or something I really didn’t need. Or he’ll ask to use my car to run errands. Usually, it’s donating plasma so he can get paid $200-300, going to the store, etc. 

I was never comfortable with this from the beginning, but any time I try to say I’m uncomfortable loaning money or loaning my car he gets upset. I was always taught you shouldn’t lend anything you’re not willing to lose. I can’t afford to lose money or my car. He doesn’t get it though, he just starts rattling off all the gifts and dinners and things he’s paid for. He starts acting like I’m ungrateful for everything he does and that I should never ask for my money back. Then he tries to guilt me bu saying things like “My grandma taught me you do everything you can for people you love.” Things to make me feel bad about standing up for myself. It’s not like I don’t do other things for him, so I don’t understand why he acts like lending money and my car are the only nice things I do for him. 

This past weekend I was at his house, he asked me on the spot if I had $20 to pay his lawn guy. I couldn’t say no in front of the old lawn guy, so I just gave it to him. He got me back in gas, but then we burned half the tank running around all weekend. Then later he asks me to buy him something and he’ll pay me back. Cost about $30 and he never paid me back. The next day he asks to borrow my car to run an errand. I didn’t let him, I went home. The same day he’s asking me to borrow $140 to pay his WIFI because his roommate isn’t pulling his weight this month. 

My boyfriend says he has the money, but he ran out of bank transfers for this month so he can’t use it. He always has some stupid situation that could have been prevented, but somehow I get dragged into it. Part of the problem is that his roommate/friend is a bum and hardly helps with anything around their house, work-wise or monetarily. My boyfriend says he ends up taking care of most things like getting the lawn cut or maintenance issues. I believe him because I’ve seen it personally, his friend doesn’t help much. 

This has happened multiple times and I’m just sick of it. I’m not a task rabbit, I’m not a Bank of America, and I’m not a f******* rental car service. I don’t mind helping out with some things. For example, he asked if we could go see his grandma and bring a present for her. I’m all down for that. But when you start asking for my car and my money, it’s just too much for me. He doesn’t feel like he has to respect my boundaries because he does nice things for me. How do I get this through his thick skull that this isn’t how it works? Or is it a lost cause? 

TLDR- My boyfriend asks to borrow money and my car consistently. I tell him it crosses my boundaries, but he gets upset. How do I put an end to this without ruining my relationship?"
ojj9gz,10,2021-07-13,How tf do you get internships!?,[deleted],india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ojj9gz/how_tf_do_you_get_internships/,"I have been trying for months! Constantly left on 'application reviewed'. I went for a few internships and either we have to pay to be an intern or it is related to front end work which I am totally not interested in. Not everyone is from IIT or has impeccable programming skills. 

I just want to join an internship for experience and a little bit of play (no way in hell am I going to work for free. They have to pay!). 

Today I went for another interview at a startup. Since I had exams, I requested to postpone the interview and went at 4 pm. After giving my resume, they told me to wait for 5 min which turned into 1 hour. So I ran out of patience and called them. They told me to come tomorrow and I told them that it is not possible. So they agreed and they started interviewing me. They asked me about my interests, my projects and my skills. 

I don't know Java. I can barely write hello world in it but I know Python, C, C++. It is better to concentrate on few languages rather than to know multiple languages with a little bit of knowledge. That is my mantra. So after talking to them for more than 45 min, they told me that they were ready to give me a position in digital marketing or graphic design or video editing which I am not interested in. I said no. I was fed up. This was not in the job description. I told them I want to do something related to coding. 

After 15 more minutes of negotiating, here comes the hammer. They said I mean that mofo told me that I have to ***pay 15k rupees so that I can learn to program which I already know and build applications which I also know.*** I didn't know what to do. I felt like slapping him. I was fed up and I told him bluntly that I am not interested in this type of internship. After telling me this, he told me that he will talk to the management and they will let me know if they can offer me a proper internship here. 

I am not a great programmer or come from IIT or BITS. I am from a normal engineering college. But people in these colleges need internships too. I tried many websites, applied to 300+ internships (literally). I attended some interviews and I was either not selected, or not suitable or had a low stipend or the ones I mentioned above.

If you have any advice on getting internships, please let me know. I can't stress this enough."

ojkju1,0,2021-07-13,Buying Property Outside of the Country from Grandmother as Investment,TheWeb1000,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/ojkju1/buying_property_outside_of_the_country_from/,"Hey r/PersonalFinanceCanada, I’m a 20-year-old looking for some help from the community.

My grandma bought a 2-bedroom apartment in a smallish (\~300k) city in Brazil earlier this year. I spoke with her, and she would be willing to sell it to me for the same price she paid: 150k reais, which is about 36-38k CAD, and continue to live there and pay rent, somewhere around 900 reais, or 200-220 CAD per month. I still have to research more on the market rent before coming up with the actual amount. In Brazil, maintenance and condo fees are paid by the tenant, so I would not have to worry about them. I haven’t been there yet due to COVID, but from pictures and talking to family members the apartment is in great shape as it was renovated before she moved in. I'm a Brazilian citizen

Since I live at home, I was able to save up most of the money I made from my internship (it will be ending at the end of August, netting me another 7k before it's over), and from my job before COVID, as well as a couple of months of CERB. I have maxed my TFSA, have another 20k in stocks, and 7k in saving (that will be put into stocks if I don’t buy the apartment).  I would have to sell my stocks and take around 5k from my TFSA to purchase this property.

In terms of costs, I live at home with my parents, so my costs are minimal and can be anywhere from 400-500/month (helping around the house with some bills, going out, and online shopping) I can decrease it if I really have to around 300. I still got around 2 years of university left, so I would need to pay around 12k in the next 2 years. I plan on getting another internship before I graduate, so I should be able to pay for the rest of my education.

The reason why I’m thinking of buying the property is that I believe the Brazilian market will rebound from its current recession in the next couple of years, and also believe the Brazilian real will also increase in value. For reference, in 2017 one Canadian Dollar was around 2.4 reais, and now is sitting at 4.2. I’m betting on both the property value and currency strength increasing in the next few years. 

Grandma is retired with a government pension and living by herself. She is 82 and in great condition, going out for walks every day, and also has family living close by that visit her regularly. I plan on keeping the property at least until she passes away, and not sure what will happen after that.

So my question is, would this be a good idea? I'm still going through the idea and details, so nothing is finalized yet. Grandma wouldn't sell the apartment anytime soon to any other person, so I have no rush to get this done"

ojp21d,1,2021-07-13,Concerned about portfolio and degree relevance - Advice?,DannyOdd,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ojp21d/concerned_about_portfolio_and_degree_relevance/,"Background: I'm 27 and going into my senior year of a double major in Informatics (with a minor in Human-Computer Interaction) and Media Arts &amp; Sciences (with a web development specialization).

My goal is to find work as a programmer, ideally in building educational and training tools. When I started out, my advisors assured me that this program would give me a broad set of skills and a robust portfolio that would make me a very attractive hire, but I've been having doubts that I picked the right program.

The vast majority of my coursework has been a scattered mix of tech support, cybersecurity, data science, internet infrastructure, graphic design and creative writing. Aside from a small amount of ""baby's first HTML"" projects, a few javascript interactives, and a PHP project where we were expected to just copy and repurpose code the professor had already written, I have nothing in my portfolio that is relevant to the work I intend to do.

Along the way I've been assured that more relevant coursework will come later, but looking at my academic plan it's just more visual design work and data science theory. I feel like it's too late to change course, switching majors would set me back a year or more, but I'm growing increasingly concerned that I'll have neither the skills nor the portfolio of work that I need to get an internship/job in what I want to do. Some friends I have in the field say not to worry about it, that the degree is pretty much irrelevant, but I feel like this has all been a colossal waste of time and money.

I'm at a loss for what to do, and I'm wide open to any advice from anyone who is familiar with this kind of situation. Should I change majors, delaying the start of my career by a year (or more)? Should I just go ahead and start trying for internships I'm not prepared for? Do I need to just self-teach the skills I thought my education was supposed to cover?

Any input would be appreciated, thank you!"

I have been working as a full-stack software engineering internship since February. 

I only speak English and I know alot of the countries would require me to learn their language to A1. I've recently been learning German so I'm not sure how long it would take to get to A1. But jobs in Berlin seem to require B1 or fluent English. 

Another place I am looking at is the Netherlands. Learning Dutch shouldn't be as hard as German because we learn Afrikaans in school and Afrikaans becomes from Dutch. I haven't researched it much so I'm not sure how popular IT jobs are.

Other places I am looking at is the UK and Ireland because they don't have a language requirement other than English. And have pretty big demand in the IT industry.

Also how strict are Scandinavian countries when it comes to learning their language ? Is it 100% necessary, or varies per country ? Though I think learning the language isn't going to take very long because it is rated as quite easy to learn as an English native speaker.

I understand these are a very wide range of countries but I'm truly desperate to leave my country. I know I would stand a better chance with more years of work experience but it's worth a shot now.

Any advice or useless resources will be greatly appreciated."

My exam is in two weeks and I have been a lot overwhelmed... 

I have been studying since February on and off and a lot more the last couple of weeks using the Objectives, Messer practice exams and videos (mostly the subtitles because I can't use audio where I am studying), Dion practice exams and the Gibson book (especially recording and listening to the end of chapter reviews) as well as google and some amazing flashcards from this guy - [https://quizlet.com/theautom8er/folders/comptia-security-sy0-501/sets](https://quizlet.com/theautom8er/folders/comptia-security-sy0-501/sets) \- I also did NCL and did a cybersecurity internship that I thought prepared me in some of the actual things. 

However, I keep doing incredibly sucky on practice exams, Dion ones I got 67% and 69% (so far), Gibson end of book I got a 72% and I just did the final Messer practice exam today and got a 73%. 

A lot of the problems that get wrong are application based - problems that tell you to decide what is a better cipher suite for a specific thing - lot of comparison and such. I'm ok at the memorization but the actual compare and contrasting, scenarios, applications, differentiation and installation questions are killing me.  I'm fairly discouraged - Is there some kind of study angle I am missing? Or should I just continue as is and hope it gets better?

ojsf3z,8,2021-07-13,Should I apply without LC experience or a complete resume?,spencejax21,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ojsf3z/should_i_apply_without_lc_experience_or_a/,"So internship apps are starting to open up, and I'm unsure of when I should start applying. My resume is in a decent spot save for a major project that I'm currently working on and won't be done finished for a few weeks; and I haven't even started the leetcode grind yet. Should I just apply now and wrap the project up/prepare with LC while I wait for responses, or wait until I finish the project/LC prep to apply?"
ojsweo,1,2021-07-13,How to get internships/prepare going into a four year from community college?,clinical27,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ojsweo/how_to_get_internshipsprepare_going_into_a_four/,"One of the biggest things I see around here as an incoming college freshman (1st semester this Fall) who has ""chosen"" to go to CC for financial stability, internships scare me a bit.

My community college is fine. The counselors are moderately helpful though I've been making sure I do all my own research as well as far as transferring credits and ensuring I have the ability to get into a four year that I'd like. But besides simply getting into a four year school after I've finished my associates, I'm unsure how to get internships.

I've heard generally freshman/sophomore year is quite difficult for internships, and that junior year is the most common year to get one. So this is slightly relieving, but I still wonder if coming from a two year will have complications? And what about freshman/sophomore year? Should I attempt to somehow get an internship, or just get a basic summer job or continue my studies independently on CS to ensure I keep good grades at my four year?

Just curious to know if there's any plans people suggest, I'm pretty prepared for my studies but my summers are where I'm a little lost on purpose still.

Thanks."

I came into this internship with only the knowledge of C++ and the back end group that I just got assigned to decided to use node.js/express and typescript as the language(s?). I have absolutely no experience with Javascript let alone whatever Typescript is. The project lead told us to start getting familiar with this stuff. I’m getting super intimidated and worried that with the small time frame I’m afraid that I won’t learn fast enough to contribute anything substantial to the project.

Is this on the fly learning normal for a software development job? Am I overreacting?"
ojtef9,0,2021-07-13,"Considering switching to CS major at UChicago in junior year to go into software engineering and have some questions about internships, career path, timelines, fit, etc.",SnooDoughnuts1364,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ojtef9/considering_switching_to_cs_major_at_uchicago_in/,"Some context on my situation: I'm going into my third year at UChicago as a Math/Econ double major. I've loved my classes so far in college but I've been thinking about my post-college plans and I don't really feel like typical Econ jobs (consulting, finance, etc.) are a good fit for me, in terms of lifestyle (hours + stress) and personal interests (consulting has sounded somewhat interesting given its problem solving but doing business research/making powerpoints isn't really appealing to me, and I'm not too interested in finance). I liked the logic and problem solving of my math classes (e.g. Real analysis) but since they're pure math classes they haven't taught me any practical skills used in industry (the courses I've taken are a great fit for going to grad school for Econ/math, but I'm not interested in doing a PhD right now - not super interested in research and would like some income in my 20s). I felt like CS and software engineering might be a good fit for the kind of work I enjoy, in terms of using skills like logical thinking, problem-solving, and having projects based around concrete goals - at least from what I've heard so far based on talking to my friends from high school, many of whom are in CS at top CS schools (Mudd, Caltech, MIT) and interning at FAANG or comparable companies. The work-life balance (I'm hearing 40 hrs/week from my friends) and compensation it provides are also really appealing for me, since I have a lot of non-work hobbies that I'm very passionate about and are expensive (mountain biking, motorcycles, cars, international travel, backpacking) and require time. I haven't taken any CS classes in college, but I took 1 semester of Python and 2 semesters of Java in high school and liked them - I wasn't as talented as some of my friends but it wasn't too difficult for me either. I didn't do CS at UChicago mostly because UChicago is much stronger at Math and Econ and I'm interested in those subjects academically as well (and I can't say I really regret the classes I picked, they have been great). 

With that said, given I feel like software engineering might be a good career for me, I've been thinking about switching to a CS major. I'd be starting the major from scratch, although I can still graduate on time if I switch. My main questions are what job opportunities would look like since I'm switching so late:

* Is the CS major necessary/worth it to switch this late into college, or can I do Math/Econ and still go into software engineering?
* Would it be possible to get a CS internship next summer (summer after junior year) given I currently have no CS on my resume or relevant classes right now? Anything that would help me build skills and experience for a full-time position would be great. I'd be willing to self-study over the summer and for classes I would be taking the intro sequence + 1 theory class (discrete, algorithms, graph theory) each quarter my third year.
   * What should I do outside of classes? I know about things like hackathons but would love to hear any ideas.
* Would I be competitive for full-time positions once I graduate if I don't have an internship next summer? What types of companies/roles could I be competitive for - could I make it to FAANG or similar?
* Is my impression that many jobs are around 40 hours a week and have a pretty good work culture correct?
* Since UChicago isn't a target CS school will I be less competitive for positions?
* Are there any skills/subjects/languages I should develop and learn in particular?
* If I want to work abroad eventually (within the next 5-10 years, I would love to see the world and immerse myself in different cultures) are there opportunities to do so within software engineering/other CS careers? I wouldn't mind taking a pay cut.

I'm also going to talk to career advancement and the CS department later this week and ask about these questions but just wanted to get some more opinions. Sorry if some of the questions are a little silly - I'm just starting to learn about the field. Thanks!"

I've had a rough go at school, in spite of education being important to me I'm terrible with grades. Since being a scholar is my dream, I've not been deterred by my many setbacks (took me 10 years to get a 2 year degree in general studies). My main interest is in insects and entomology, but since that's largely a field focused on pest control, I'm not sure I'd wanna dedicate my life to killing bugs. In the last few years I've gotten fairly interested in math, which has lead me to develop a strong interest in statistics, particularly probability. Overall I think I'd be most interested in doing research on evolutionary biology, working with fossils, cladistics, genomic maps, phylogenies, and so on for various plants and animals. While that is my main interest, I really like working with statistics, and in terms of actual skills I'd like to learn and master I do lean more towards statistics (might also be better for the job market). I think it'd be interesting to apply principals of probability and stats to understanding evolutionary biology better. During a summer program I participated in recently, I learned that in addition to working on a degree it's important to take internships to develop skills and work experience. Mainly in the field you're interested in, but also to branch out a bit and try differing subjects.

My main question is what would be my best choice for a degree program? should I just stick with biology since that's what I'm interested in and work my way up in that? or should I pursue a statistics degree and take as many biology internships as I can get? build robust statistical skills and biology experience that leads to research opportunities, having the best of both worlds with a broad skill set. Or would that just be dumb and I should just get the degree in the actual field I most like.

On small thing I also wonder about is actually using the college, since it seems like if I wanna learn stats most lessons on them can be done at home and on very easy to download software, while bio stuff usually needs labs and high end equipment. Both of which have pros and cons.

Thoughts on these degree paths? as well as working in research in general, careers involving insects, getting a long term degree in my 30s, the role getting a minor could play in this (zoology if I major in stats, stats if I major in biology).

Any advice at all in anyway even if it's not directly would be greatly appreciated, thank you."
ojtkgg,7,2021-07-13,Thoughts on this plan? 2-2.25 years,TackoFallSympathizer,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/ojtkgg/thoughts_on_this_plan_2225_years/,"I had to drop 290 this summer while taking 261. I was a bit burnt out to be honest and I underestimated the workload, fell behind early and decided to take the 50% refund before it was too late. I figured I'd take the summer to focus on Data Structures and maintain a strong GPA. I'm a bit stuck on planning for upcoming terms, would really appreciate some advice! So far I have:

&amp;#x200B;

Summer 2021 - 261 Data Structures (in progress)

Fall 2021 - 290 Web Development + 361 SE I

Winter 2022 - 325 Algorithms + 340 Databases

Spring 2022 - 344 Operating Systems + 475 Parallel

Summer 2022 - 372 Networks + Internship (ideally)

Fall 2022 - 493 Cloud + 362 SE II

Winter 2023 - 467 Capstone

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anywhere that sticks out where I might be able to fit in a third class? I've read that 362 is one of the easiest courses and wondering if it would be wise to fit that into the summer with 372, so that I could bump up Capstone and graduate 3 months earlier. Or, I could bump Capstone up regardless and finish out with 3 courses in the fall of 2022.

Also open to changing electives. I was originally planning on doing mobile instead of parallel, but 344 + parallel sounds like a more manageable option than 344 + 372 with mobile in the summer. I also feel mobile would be easier to self-teach in my free time.

I figured it would be great to hear some anecdotes on top of meeting with my advisor. Thanks ahead!"

ojtuqr,8,2021-07-13,[IWantOut] 20M Student USA -&gt;Thailand / Singapore,curiouspigeon24,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/ojtuqr/iwantout_20m_student_usa_thailand_singapore/,"**Background**

Hi everybody, I'm a 20 year old student staying in the USA (also a US citizen) looking to move to somewhere such as Thailand or Singapore for pursuing part-time work or an internship to get some job experience before I graduate.

I am pursuing an undergrad degree in Economics &amp; trade in a university in China and am halfway through my degree, but I only have work experience in the food industry - which is not going to be recognized when I go into the workforce- this means I should seek an internship. Since the start of COVID, I have been stuck inside the US because of Chinese border closures, and by the way things look, China seems to be leaning towards being closed until mid-late 2022.

**Why do I want to leave the US?**

I really have enjoyed my time in the USA seeing friends and family and making memories, but the past three semesters online with a 15-16 hour time difference has made life much more difficult, and I would rather avoid having classes from 5pm-5am with work at 9am during the week, along with this, I don't feel very hesitant to move abroad given I have already done it for university.

**Why Thailand or Singapore?**

Singapore could be a good fit as there is a sizable English and Chinese-speaking population, in addition, it is a hub for employment and could overall prove to be an interesting place to live while also satisfying the needs of being in a similar timezone to Beijing so I can check into my online lessons for school. The current hurdles facing Singapore is their border closures, making this more difficult.

While it will be more difficult to find a Chinese-speaking crowd, Thailand fits the needs of having a similar timezone to China and also is currently allowing US citizens in - which is something that very few countries are doing, and also seems to be somewhere that has a living expense that is more in tune with what a student like myself can afford, along with the fact that I love Thai food and want to study it a bit if possible.

**Why not other places?**

While it would be super cool if I could go to another place that speaks Chinese such as Taiwan, if I did so, then this would create a bad situation for when I return to China to get my degree and could even get me kicked out of my school due to a bad and complicated political situation, and could bar me from working or studying in China in the future.

Japan currently has tight border controls and Korea is a bit too far out of my price range- maybe it would have been possible if I was a generation older, but living costs there have increased where the jobs are.

I could also be open to other countries in Asia or SE Asia, but due to COVID restrictions, this doesn't look possible right now...

**Budget?**

I don't really need spectacular or super sanitary living conditions to get by; I have lived in cramped residencies sharing bathrooms and dorms with 6 families at a time, and don't have problems with doing so again if it helps cut costs. I'm a student and because of that have a fixed income, however, having an internship could help offset this and allow me a higher budget.

I can cook myself and that alone can possibly offset costs of eating out all the time, and I managed to survive off of $150USD/month for food in China, which is equivalent to 5000baht. For housing, I was able to find housing in a residency in a decent city for just under $100/month in China, but I imagine that this won't be easy to find in Singapore or Thailand, and I would be fine with doubling that or going as high as $300/month if there isn't anything cheaper available and I can land some sort of internship or employment.

If I get into a bind or need to supplement extra cash for living expenses, it isn't a problem as I have enough capital to get me by for about 2.5 years, however this may be much less after moving expenses and quarantine costs, and it would be optimal to not do that, as these are my savings to open a business when I graduate.

**Employment**

I would be fine with any type of internship or part-time job, albeit related to my major or not, and would even be willing to get TEFL certified if needed.

&amp;#x200B;

First off, I am extremely grateful that I have the opportunity to intern this summer and have learned a good bit. 

This is my first internship (rising junior) so I have no other benchmark to compare to.

Thing is, it is extremely isolating due to remote work and team size. This summer, I am an SWE intern for a well-known Industrial Test Products company from the west coast, whereas I am based remotely on the east coast. The team I am on consists of only me and my manager and most of my day is usually just me coding and testing with a meeting or 2 every day and a few text conversations with other engineers to get some information I need to do my job. 

I usually finish up my work early so to keep myself busy I work on adding additional features/optimizing code or keep moving through the backlog after consulting with my manager. 

Is this really the norm for engineering roles (my end goal is in hardware design but this was my best opportunity this summer) or is there usually some level of social interaction/team camaraderie that occurs in engineering roles? Also curious if anyone has had similar/different experiences and has some advice? Thanks!"
ojud4r,10,2021-07-13,Tips for PAID Tech Internships,fremra,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ojud4r/tips_for_paid_tech_internships/,"I was browsing Reddit and came across another post giving some tips on CS/tech internships for high schoolers, so I thought I would hop on the bandwagon. For a bit of background, I've been working as a software engineer at a startup for a little over a year and get paid a couple grand a month. There's little to no resources on this area so I hope this post will be helpful to those interested.

I'll be focusing on how to get PAID internships- imo, unpaid internships aren't really worth it as you are essentially free labor. With that being said, my advice is as follows.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Be competent at CP and programming in general**. The first step of getting a paid tech internship is being competent with coding. Keep in mind you're pretty much competing against people already in college, so be prepared to go above and beyond. Competitive programming is the way to start. I would say to poke around at USACO and CodeForces and try to solve some of those problems. These should be fun exercises! If you don't like those types of problems, chances are you won't enjoy the thinking process when it comes to working in tech. Aiming for around USACO Gold or CodeForces Specialist is great.
2. **Have a wow factor.** It's really helpful to have something big, nice, and juicy that you've already accomplished when applying. For example, this can be winning a big programming competition or hackathon. Bonus points if it was organized by recognizable organizations (FAANG, U.S. Government, or equivalent). I don't really think this is required though. If you don't have one, just apply to more companies and you should be fine.
3. **Make a resume.** This should be pretty self explanatory. General tips follow. Include only CS related experience. Wow factor (if you have one) goes at the top. Education (high school GPA, maybe one sentence on courseload) goes at the bottom. 
4. **Focus on startups.** There are indeed some big companies that give some degree of high school internships, but the pay is often minimum wage and you won't be touching significant parts of the infrastructure. That being said, if you're interested in research (e.g. US DOD, Air Force, Army) there are some nice opportunities there, just keep in mind they don't pay as much. In contrast, when working for startups you typically get super deep in the codebase, learn a lot more about the flow of working in tech, and the pay is great (if the startup is well-funded). 
5. **Ignore education requirements.** I would recommend just going to startup job sites such as AngelList or doing some Google search for ""startup tech internships"" to get started. It's OK if these are geared towards Bachelor degree candidates or likewise, just shoot your application and see where it gets you. Don't apply to companies who are lowballing you with salary ranges. A good tip is to scout out startups funded by top VCs, for example: a16z, Sequoia, Bessemer, First Round, etc.
6. **Ace the interview.** If your resume passes to the next round, there WILL be technical interview(s). However, if you're already good at CP, these questions shouldn't be too bad. However, definitely don't underestimate the interview process as it's the most important part of your application. Make sure to think out loud, explain everything you code, and best of luck! Some interviews are through a video/voice call and others are take-home programming assignments. I don't really have any other tips on this part other than to get good at CP and thinking out loud.

And that's pretty much it! Just apply to as many startups as you can, and hopefully you can land a couple of interviews, and perhaps even a job offer.

Wishing you all the best of luck!"

How do I decide?,Reddit_Account_C-137,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ojurzy/does_a_career_switch_make_sense_for_me_or_will/,"Currently a mechanical engineer considering the switch to data science and I'd love some input on whether or not my reasoning for switching makes sense.

Firstly, between all my past jobs and internships the work I have enjoyed most was data/programming related. Filtering sensor data to correlate it with how close the product is to failing, automating SAP updates with Python, etc.

Secondly, I feel like my interests/skills align better with data science than engineering. I'm not the type of person to tinker or care how mechanical things work. I don't like building things and hated the loud environment of a manufacturing floor during my internship. As a kid I was interested in space which lead me to aerospace engineering but looking back I always was naturally drawn to programming and understanding patterns (NBA advanced stats, comparing different running/training routines and their outcomes, etc.)

In my current job I don't like the extensive documentation which might also exist in data science but I think I will be more interested in growing my skillset in data science and getting stuck on a problem won't be as frustrating.

Are these good reasons to start learning data science and maybe make the switch."

Yet she's brought onto meetings with management to help make decisions. It's dysfunctional but that's a story for another day.

A few months ago, her workplace hired 4 new employees (all guys btw), all junior entry level staff with varying degrees of experience (from ""fresh out of college with internships"" to ""2 years in the workforce"".) But it seems like they don't like her and it looks like they're trying to push her out. Their antipathy towards her seems to be mostly founded on the premise that she's not receptive to their ideas.

Management wants her to train them and ""manage"" them but they don't listen to her. They're so set on implementing their own ideas despite having little experience at their jobs that they regularly go over my wife to speak directly with the director of their department or just outright ignore her. The actual manager seems spineless and doesn't actually do anything to resolve the amount of insubordination that goes on. If anything, from what I hear, this manager coddles them in fear of being disliked...

The worst part happened last month when 2 of them filed complaints to HR that my wife was creating a ""hostile work environment"" for not actively making sure their ideas and input are being implemented... And because she was being a ""cold and umempathetic person that makes them feel uncomfortable at work"" (this was all in the actual HR report I saw... Like what the fuck is this bullshit, right?)

Apparently two complaints was enough for HR to intervene and so, she's being placed on leave to attend ""communications"" training...

The 4 of them also make the work environment toxic for my wife.

My wife wants to work through this (despite my encouragments towards her to quit this god awful job alas, to no avail). So here I am, asking y'all on some advice on how my wife can deal with all this bullshit. I mean, I've experienced some bullshit at my current job but this sure takes the cake.

TLDR - Wife is being constantly undermined by 4 newly hired junior colleagues and had HR complaints filed against her for ""creating a hostile work environment"" because she's not coddling them and ensuring their egos are being inflated."

Recently, some events have lead me to think that I have been in total delusion and because of that I am in a state of hopelessness (to a point where i dont even know if I deserve to live or not).

Recently there has been an internship drive in my college where companies take a test, interview and then offer us internship opportunities. My CG isnt great but still is above the threshold require to sit in companies and my seniors told me that it's alright to have that. But later i realized no matter how good my paper goes, I am not selected to any of these companies just because of my low CG and since I am a male and General Caste guy (in India), I am not one of those people who are priveldged with policies (neither i want to be as a matter of fact). And now seeing all of my friends getting internship offers from big MNCs like microsoft or very high packages, I am in a state where I feel till now whatever I have been doing is entirely incorrect.

I have been so irresponsible and reckless with the process, highly delusional that it has hit me like an atom bomb at a point where wasting time is not an option. I always used to game thinking that I am smart enough to handle situations then and there, didnt study a lot coz i thought i am smart enough to attempt paper and get grades, always talked like i am one of those extra ordinary students and overall just a fucking stupid young adult. I am so ashamed of this that I no longer know myself.

It's like i have had such a great reputation of being one of the best students and yet getting low CG and no company offers, I feel like i have just made a fool of myself in believing that I am among the smartest students. And worst of all, I again could not keep up my promises. It's like whatever I do, I end up giving it up. I had started so many things like Exercising, guitar, working for start ups and just telling people about my future goals and responsibilities and there is not a single objective where i could look back and be proud of what I did because I just end up leaving it. I can't keep up with my commitments and promises and it has piled up to become such a burden on me that I dont know what to do. Irrespective of the person, I have disappointed each and every expectation and worst of all my own expectation. I have hit rock bottom.

  
In addition to it, I found a lovely girl and I have strong affection for her. She loves me and I love her back and she is one of the best girls ever to exist. We have spent so much intimate and sexual time that it feels like we are one soul and I can't think of losing her. But all these events in my life and my failure of commiting to my promises, will I be able to commit her? Will I be able to deliver those promises which I have broken infinite times before? I am so scared and afraid of my failures that I dont know what to do. I feel like leaving everything and even her because I ll end up becoming another disappointment which will add up to my list. I have fucked myself. 

I just wanna know how I could reset things and start commiting those promises and expectations I have with myself and with the people I care for. I no longer want to be a useless piece of shit for ends up being scared from every situation. I want to face the hardest challenges and not run away like a coward. I want to utilize my whole potential and not be a disappointment. I have had enough of my failures but I dont know where to start when I m so low. I just dont."

ojzd1q,5,2021-07-14,How to deal with outperforming your teammates ??,ginofft,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/ojzd1q/how_to_deal_with_outperforming_your_teammates/,"I feel like I am alienating my teammate by outperforming them, one senior engineer told me off about it, how should I approach this issue ?

Backstory: I'm currently in a Data Science internship in an outsourcing company. This is my fourth week here, I got assigned a project 2 weeks ago alongside 3 other teammates (ill be calling them A, B and C). Out first interaction went well, we got talking, organized and divide the project among our-self.

Long story short, :

\- I would take care of getting use to the model, implementing it on sample data set

\- A would dive into theoretical background, pointing out the ideal of the model, as well as potential weakness when implementing.

\- B would install labeling tool, and teach us how to use it.

\- C would communicate with senior engineer and talk about other alternative or features we can integrate inside out model. 

After one week:

\- I have already implemented the model - even go as far as labeling some data and train the model myself - so the project is kind of done already.

\- when I asked A about the theoretical stuff, it painfully clear that A do not understand math or the ideal behind the model, i pointed A into some research paper i read and moved on.

\- B haven't even get the codebase to work, its seem like this is the first time B installed Pycharm - maybe he used to work on Jupyter notebook or sth - so i kinda throw them the link to the github of labelling tool and the tutorial video.

\- C have nothing to report, it seem like C ask around but his theoretical background is not great, so we cant make sense of anything he said.

At that point, I divided the dataset onto my teammate so they can help me label it, while giving them some tasks that basically pointing to them implementing my scripts on their local machine.

Which bring us to today, they haven't take the initiative to contact or ask me anything, so i just  do my own things - basically some minor data augmentation and parameters tuning - to get the most out of my dataset. I discussed the model with a senior engineer, at the end of our discussion, he said ""leave some work for your teammates"".

Basically, I want to ask: Am I the asshole here ?

Cause I do feel a little bad, but I also want to get the job done asap. Currently, I'm scheduling a meeting to bring them up to date to what I've been doing and ask for their input (I don't have much expectation tbh). Any other subjection on what I should do will be appreciated.

Thanks!!"

This is my first student job (20hrs/week) and since I have to complete a compulsory internship in order to graduate, my boss is happy to offer me the full time internship of 40hrs a week.

I am currently paid due to the hours I work. However my boss told me that there will be a fixed payment for the internship, which means I will be paid 3/4 of the amount I’m supposed to get hourly (400€ less).

The internship salary is the average amount in my country and for a startup company like this, I should be thankful. However my partner reminded me not to have the people pleaser mindset like I always do and ask to be paid for the hours I will work. This is because even though it’s internship on papers, I will basically do the amount of a full time job during it, if not more because the workload is quite heavy.

I am conflicted about this because this is my first job and I have been paid well, my bosses are always nice to me and respect me. I don’t want to seem like I’m asking for too much. Besides, there might be a complication due to taxes if I get paid fully.

Should I negotiate for more or be satisfied with what I’m offered?

Thank you and I’m sorry for any mistakes as I’m not a native speaker."
ok4o2u,6,2021-07-14,Not sure what's best for me at this point. Having difficulties in current courses in junior year in college.,hyperjump02,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/ok4o2u/not_sure_whats_best_for_me_at_this_point_having/,"**TL;DR:** Only made it up to this point (3rd Year College) because of luck and getting carried in school projects. It's now my last semester before senior year and I don't know complex shit about my majors. Been breaking down almost daily ever since this month. I can't understand shit anymore. Might waste my final year in college (time and tuition fee) if I ever lucked out again but I'm not motivated to continue this anymore. I don't know what's best for me at this point.

I apologize for grammar mistakes as I can't also think clearly for the past few days. I kind of want to be short about this but basically I've been just getting lucky with my grades due to reasons such as getting decent scores, getting carried on group projects, professors being generous with their gradings. I'll be starting my final year after this semester.

I'm a 3rd Year Computer Science student currently having a required summer classes (due to curriculum) and the deadlines are so terrible that I personally find it difficult to keep going on. Like I said, I KNOW that I'm here mainly due to luck. And I'm sure that current freshmen students in my school are way better than me. As far as the current project (group of 5) we're having, only 2 are able to handle the backends, the other 2 handles the documentation (but they don't help with the coding stuff), and here I am just giving out ideas on what to do. I don't even know if we'll be able to finish the project given the time we have left. I feel like I'm the most incompetent in the group.

I just want to quit already as I know I'm won't be capable like my other classmates. I should've shifted before my sophomore years but I decided to still try going but luck seems to be running out already for me. I'm also considering of dropping out if I fail my courses this semester as the other one is needed for the Thesis course. 

Tuition fee has become expensive and my mother would be retiring next year, my father also today was diagnosed with a kidney problem which needs expensive medication. I'm really worrying about the money getting wasted on me.

Almost everyday I've been breaking down due to the fact that I'm incapable and the fact that I'm a disappointment in my family. Eating schedule and sleep schedule been getting ruined as well. Playing the games I used to play doesn't seem to entertain me at all anymore. I tried studying but I can't understand shit even if I tried to.  I contacted the school physician and they only gave me advice for doing exercise and telling me to just keep pushing through but I got no time for exercise plus I'm sleep deprived. I was also planning to consult a therapist because my friends recommended me to get consulted but it's expensive per session.

I don't think I could keep pushing through anymore after this. In senior year, we need to make a Thesis Paper and also undergo Internship. The company that would hire me would definitely find out I can't do complex stuff with programming. I also don't have any ideas on how to write a thesis paper and even if I did, I don't know what topic write in there.

I want to do something else in my life. I'm feeling lost, I don't know what's the best next step to take after this if I manage to survive this semester. I can't push myself whatever I do. I think this is it for me."

I'm 28, and have spent the last four years teaching ESL in Asia. I got accepted to a fairly good program directly out of university. I treated my first two years here like a study abroad program. I travelled all over the continent, made a bunch of friends, had amazing adventures etc. Had the time of my life.

However, the last two years have made me realize that the best course of action for me is to move back home to the States and shape my career there. Besides that, the pandemic made me realize how much I miss my close friends and family. In conclusion, I'm planning on moving back home in the first half of next year (probably Spring 2022).

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Some background info:**

I received my bachelor's degree in Business Administration in 2016. For whatever it's worth, my university has a pretty competitive undergraduate business program. I did an internship for a tech startup during my senior year up until my graduation, but 2016 was ages ago. I was also the first person in my family to graduate from college. Still, my hardworking parents are both successful and have really good jobs that they both admit they wouldn't be able to get without a college degree today.

I'm originally from Silicon Valley, so I'm at the age now where I'm seeing a lot of people I grew up with working in tech. This is more or less what I want to do, and not just because I'm seeing them do it. I was planning on going down this path prior to being accepted to the ESL program. I love working with computers and don't mind staring at a screen all day. Being able to work from home, tech work culture, and of course competitive pay are some of the side benefits that would obviously mean the world to me.

Like I mentioned before: I studied business in university. I did HTML and other basic coding as part of my undergraduate program. Other than that I admittingly know jackshit about coding. But I'd like to be a full-stack engineer? Could I learn enough in 9 months to realistically apply/get an entry-level engineering position? To my own fault, I haven't devoted as much time here to self-teaching as I should have. I've done research and have found all these (relatively) pricey engineering boot camps that claim to get you ready for engineering positions in x amount of weeks. I'd prefer to do self-teaching, but how would you market this about yourself on a resume? Would companies just take your word for it on a resume/in an interview then test you further into the process?

Honestly, whenever I try to start trying to figure out a path, I get anxious and dejected. I'm not diagnosed with anxiety or anything, but thinking about the future lately has been stressful as hell. It's a blessing that we have so many resources to learn from in this day and age, but at the same time all these choices makes it hard to circumnavigate. I don't an old family member that could point me in the right direction either, even though I'm from Silicon Valley. Everyone is working in some other field. I don't really have a professional network of tech friends either. I don't want to lean on these excuses, but where do I go from here? Is there a common path/guide self-taught coders follow?

I'm also a newlywed. Probably the best thing about my time abroad was that it allowed me to meet the love of my life. My wife will be following me back home after the long visa process is finished. She is educated (even studied abroad at Oxford), master of her mother tongue, fluent in English (nearly perfect test scores), and has lived abroad before both in the U.S. and U.K. She has a good paying job here that she wants to leave due to the long hours and stress from coworkers. She also prefers the work culture in the U.S. to that of her home country. With her work ethic, language ability, resume, and skills I don't doubt that she can find a similar if not better job in the States. She's already met my family several times and they adore her. She's excited to move.

I feel a lot of pressure. I want to succeed. I was always a good student and got straight A's, participated in extracurriculars, etc. because I had a clear path and end goal (graduating). Now things are a little less clear and it... scares me?

What would you recommend I do?

P.S. Math is my worst subject."

ok5pzn,6,2021-07-14,I can't face being alone anymore,thisfoxboy,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ok5pzn/i_cant_face_being_alone_anymore/,"I'm alone. I don't mean ""I don't feel close to anyone"", I mean, I am literally alone.

And I can't do it any longer. If I could figure out a way to end it that would definitely work and not just leave me with too high a risk of just suffering any more, I would do it right now. But I don't even have the energy to work out anything that I could do that I haven't failed to do before.

I'm a student. I've just finished the first year of my degree. Results are published in a couple days and I think I've done enough to continue to next year but there is at least one module that I am going to have to resit in August. I don't particularly care about any of that, it's just context. I'm supposed to be doing a 6 week research internship, but I've got 2.5 weeks left of it and I've not even started writing the paper I'm supposed to be working on. I care about it so much - but that's the problem. I don't have the emotional capacity to deal with aiming for a career that I \*care\* about. It's too personal, something completely unrelated can happen and trigger me and I switch off completely. I'm never going to be able to hold down a job like this. 

I've got flatmates, but I've just moved in here and I have yet to meet anyone. I keep moving in with groups of strangers. I'm living in other people's space. It sounds so stupid but all I want is to live somewhere where I've got my own space in a kitchen cupboard, a shelf in the fridge. Not just treading on other people's toes all of the time. 

Most undergraduate students go ""home"" for the summer. I'm not allowed to call halls ""home"", even though this is the only home I have. I don't have any family, I don't have friends to go and see. 

This isn't the most lonely I have ever been. I spent March 2020 - September 2020 living in 1 bed flat, completely alone. I became entirely nocturnal, blew all my savings on a Nintendo Switch so that I could play Animal Crossing, listened to Discworld audiobooks back to back and walked miles every day (so much so that I have irreperably damaged my hip). In that time, I had 5 face to face conversations. And then I left my hometown and moved away to the city I'm in now, where I have zero friends, to study. 

I've gone 512 days without being hugged. I got a hug a couple weeks ago, but it was just a brief thing. Nowhere near enough. I think about it every day. I want someone to hold me. Properly hold me. Tightly. Rub my back and hold my hand. I can't even remember the last time I had physical human contact that was at all satisfying. I pet every cat I meet, I put damp towels in the drier and then stuff them in a hoodie and hold that because the warmth is comforting. But it's nowhere near enough. 

I have nobody that I can tell that I'm struggling, nevermind that I'm actively suicidal - again. I'm nearly 21, I've been trying to end myself since I was 12. I've had people that I could rely on, trust, feel safe with, but for reasons that are rarely anyone's fault, I always end up being left eventually. It's just circumstance. But I miss people so bad. There are 2 groups of people, people I love dearly and who love me equally but being close isn't possible; and people who are so much more special to me than I have ever been or ever could be to them. 

My childhood wasn't horrific. But it did suck. My birthgivers had too many of their own issues. I didn't feel safe at home, ever. There was a lot of bad stuff that happened. So I left when I was 18. I've never looked back, never missed them. But from being a teenager I have had to deal with desperately wanting someone to take care of me. I've had to do so much alone. I was left to deal with my own illnesses because no one around me was well enough to. I was bullied everywhere I went and I had to hide it from ""home"" because it was too much for anyone to deal with, and my \~problems\~ caused too much stress and too much stress caused danger for me. 

I make up stories in my head. Of lying on the floor having hurt myself, badly - that bits real - but then someone walks in and scoops me up and takes me away to a safe place and takes care of me. And I mean that in the most literal way, yeah I want the emotional care, love even, but I would have done anything at 15 for someone to clean my injuries, make me a hot meal, give me a quiet place to rest. 

I get nightmares. Often about things that have happened to me or around me. I wake up on the edge of screaming, often sobbing. Right now it's almost every night. Sometimes a few times a night. That moment waking up is the most vulnerable I feel these days. Everything I want in that moment is impossible. I want to throw myself into someone else's arms. I want protecting. But even if I had a person close by, I know I could never do that. I can't expect anyone to ever do that for me, it's not fair to do that to anyone. If someone else asked me to do the same, I couldn't do it. 

I know I have to fix myself on my own. I have to be able to be kind enough to myself to give myself everything no one else could. But everyone who repeats the ""the only person you can rely on is yourself"" thing, always seems to have \*someone\*. Or at least, has had someone. And yeah, I have had good people. But I always had to go home alone at the end of the day. When I ended up in hospital, I went alone. When I move flats, I have always done that alone. When other people get to ask for help, I have never had that. 

So now I'm just done. I can do everything ""right"", but I can't do enough for myself. I can't fix myself. I can't even fix myself enough that I could ever have a healthy relationship with someone else. I have so much to give, but too much baggage. I wish I could love someone. So this is it forever, until I can make it end."

This is from a much bigger corporation. we are talking hundreds of locations, and thousands of employees. They want to interview me for the position if  I am interested. I was recommend by some of my former interns that now work there, and my resume has been on file for a while as well. So things I thought about:

* Pay would likely by significantly higher starting out. Guessing at least 20-25%. This would be pretty amazing
* I'd have a lot more Managers, now I solely report to the CEO. There I would probably have the CTO, CIO, VP of IT blah blah.  I am pretty neutral to this idea though
* Since it a huge corp, I would likely lose (some) of my flexibility - this might make or break it because I need this for my family.
* Not sure about the insurance
* I would be challenged a lot more. This is one of the most positive things and scary things too. My current infrastructure is small-ish as you could imagine. It excites me to think about it.
* I have several family members that work there. This doesn't bother me as I would never work directly with them or likely even the same location.
* Commute would be about 20-25min with possible travel to other locations for issues that arise.

I haven't taken the interview yet, but I am thinking of doing it just to see what they have to say.

ok6hgm,37,2021-07-14,TIFU by having the same name as a manager,TIFUsamename,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ok6hgm/tifu_by_having_the_same_name_as_a_manager/,"This happened yesterday and I’ve finally recovered enough to consider posting a cathartic TIFU about it. Using a throwaway because this is a specific enough situation to potentially be identifying.

Preface: I have a relatively common name with a more unusual spelling - let’s say Karoline. This will come up later.

I’m a college student currently doing an internship at a company. Yesterday we had a regular weekly update meeting for the department (online because COVID) which the interns aren’t required to attend, but I went to anyway because I’m a suck-up. Because I’m not important and the meeting is mostly managers giving updates on what they and their teams have been working on, I’ve been turning off my camera and my mic and just enjoying a snack for the most part during these meetings. That’s what I was doing today as the senior manager called on all the managers in turn to give their updates.

Which is why I had a literal heart attack when I heard, “Karoline, do you want to give your update?”

Here’s the thing: previously, I’d learned that there’s another Karoline working at the company, except unlike me she’s actually important, as she’s the team lead for a very important team. I know this because every time I’ve been in a meeting with her I’ve done awkward double-takes whenever I hear my name mentioned, and the spelling is unique enough that when I see it written somewhere I panic about why someone important is writing emails about me before I realize they mean the other Karoline.

In this situation, my first thought was, “Oh, he must mean the other Karoline, because why would the senior manager be asking an intern for her update, especially when my supervisor already gave his update about what we’re doing?” Except then I checked the meeting participants and realized that, oh wait, the other Karoline *isn’t here.* I immediately unmuted myself in a panic and apologized for having had a delayed reaction, because I thought he’d meant the other Karoline, not me. I then tried to kind of panic babble my way through an update, despite having *immediately forgotten literally everything I was working on.* Highlights include:

- Having to stop talking and pause so I could try to actually remember what the hell I’d been doing for the past month
- Stuttering. I don’t have a stutter
- “I’m so sorry, I’ve never given an update like this before, this was very sudden”
- Forgetting the word “details” and having to verbally fumble until I finally said an adjacent word that still wasn’t “details”
- The ten seconds of awkward silence after I finished that felt like an hour

When I was finally done, my manager broke the awkward silence by saying, “That was a pretty good update,” I think in an attempt to comfort me, because it was not at *all* a good or coherent update. My automatic response was, “Thank you, I’m panicking.” By the way, the rest of the meeting, as actual important people, all had their cameras turned on, so I could see them laughing the whole time (not in a mean-spirited way, to be clear - my response to stress is to try and be funny, so it was an appropriate response, but it also just added to the “oh god” of the whole situation).

Afterwards, after he’d called on the next person to give his update, the senior manager messaged me saying that I did a great job, I think again in an attempt to comfort me. I responded saying, “Thank you, hopefully I’ll be more coherent next time!” which felt appropriate at the time.

Here’s the thing: it didn’t occur to me then, but once the meeting ended, I started wondering, why the hell didn’t he call on any of the other interns to give an update? Granted, we’re all working on the same thing, but he doesn’t know any of us, so it didn’t make sense that he’d call on me in particular because it’s not like I’ve stood out in any way. So that got me thinking, what is it that I have that the other interns don’t? *The same first name as an actual important person in the company.* I checked the invite status for this meeting and lo and behold, the other Karoline had accepted the invite but never showed up.

So what I had initially thought was going on was that, in some attempt to give the new interns experience or whatever, the senior manager had called on me to give an update. Except in reality, he must’ve thought, “Oh, that’s Karoline, who is here exactly as she said she would be, as she is an important team lead I should get her update, there is no way it’s not her because how many Karolines are at this company anyway?” He then got a horrible, anxiety-ridden update from a panicking intern that was unintentionally *tailor-made* to guilt-trip him for mixing us up. And because I’m stupid, I literally figured out what had happened immediately - that I’d been mistaken for the other Karoline - but it did not consciously register and instead I just *barreled on without giving him a chance to backtrack.* Afterwards, said senior manager likely messaged me a compliment because he felt bad for having accidentally called on me, and then I presumptuously said I’d do better next time, except there will be no next time, because I am a lowly intern whose work no one cares about and there is absolutely no reason for me to waste all the managers’ time on a shitty update like the one I gave.

TL;DR: I, an intern, was mistaken for a team lead with the same name and was asked to give an update to a department-wide meeting full of managers with better things to do with their time. I gave a long, rambling, profoundly shitty update that barely communicated anything, and what it did communicate had already been covered by my supervisor’s update. When the senior manager messaged me a compliment by way of apology, I said I’d do better next time, except there will be no next time because I’m an intern and there is absolutely no reason to care about my update and I’m an idiot who didn’t put two and two together in time."

I  am also searching someone that would speak with me in english langauge  at the same time rather than my national language. This would allow me  to learn it as well as programming language.

WARNING:  I am disabled. I have problem with hearing. It is not like that you  must speak louder just I have problem with understaning what did have  you said.

Mostly negative things that were said about me, and a couple positives.

My manager has stated that I’m awful at communicating with people in general about my project or just stuff in general. I’ve been trying to work on it. Another thing she said was that I had messed up an official report (accidentally, and honestly I don’t even remember what it was that I’d messed up on). Also, it was stated that I was not performing up to par. An example is that I wasn’t making a diagram the way my manager wanted it to be. B/c of that she has had to give me more direct instructions and meet with me more, causing the project deadlines to be delayed.

Some of the positives was that I was maintaining my professionalism, taking initiative to meet with people outside the dept (gain exposure to various aspects of the company), and great improvement in my technical skills (coding).

Overall, I’ve been **performing lower than a new hire** (especially work product-wise) according to the review and I just feel absolutely terrible and depressed, especially since this is my second internship at this company…. Like I shouldn’t even be performing THIS badly.

Anyone have any advice on what I can do the remaining three/four weeks? I’ll work hard to try to not make any more rookie mistakes, ask more questions if I’m confused, and prepare what I’m going to say ahead of time instead of fumbling in my words.

Ig what feels most awful is that I was hoping to get a FT offer out of this internship…. but that’s clearly out of the window. As I’m graduating this fall semester, I’m lowkey terrified of the future and that somehow I’ve ruined my prospects before I really even got to start."

Basically my story so far, this is likely a biased highlight of the low points of my life since I'm not in the best mood atm:

Not sure why but I naïvely thought procuring a crazy Cali coop at a Big N company would turn my life upside-down and I'll finally feel happy. Couldn't be further from reality ahaha

Since high school, I've never made many genuine friends partially due to introversion and partially due to seeing negative traits in the people I've interacted with. That being said, I wouldn't call myself antisocial and I actually love talking to people and expressing my feelings when I can. I recently learned though - the Golden Rule of making friends is making them feel good, which I definitely had minimal success with in my highschool's atmosphere. As a result, I've been denied opportunities (by my high school peers) to participate in school events due to my personality and lack of presence/popularity. A girl presiding over an event didn't let me join because she ""didn't like me"" (her exact words). I'll be honest, I'm fairly petty too so at one point when things got to me, I collected screenshots and evidence proving I'm being wrongly excluded from school events and complain to the principal but it involved too many students and was during senior year which led to the teachers not addressing the situation while lying to my face that they would.

Life moves on and I head to university where I thought I made friends but turns out they're just acquaintances. I realize this when the people I've interacted with in class never messaged me over coop terms or during the pandemic (but message one another) unless it was school-related or I message first. I've never been part of any squad group chats within my cohort either despite hanging out with people in them irl before. I guess I'm kinda shy but also have too much of an ego to ask to join a squad. There's a fear of being denied which I've felt throughout high school.

This is now on some incel shit but I get close with this girl right before the pandemic (can't lie, I hope she reads this but whatever). We're texting everyday but there's covid, we're far away, the indian parents I lived with wouldn't approve of me calling any girl so I hardly took it beyond messaging. Still, I think I've shared more things with her over the almost 2 years I've known her than 99% of people in my life. At one point though, I become a bit too needy talking to her (as I didn't have many other friends and felt lonely) which pushed her away. She had her flaws too but I'll refrain from pointing them out. We stop talking, she gets her first boyfriend during that time (which I never expect), I still try to stay friends again after a while but we stop vibing and she blocks me on all social media.

It hurt but I get motivated for a month to get an insane internship to prove to her and the rest of my high school haters that I can actually achieve stuff. I'm hyped when I do and post on my Instagram story. Surprisingly only 5/400 people that saw it congratulate me while others that landed the same position as me get 3k likes on their LinkedIn posts. What's worse is that I actually went around liking every single linkedin update from my cohort's peers but only 5% reacted to mine when I added one. I'm unsure if people feel uncomfortable engaging with me or are jealous/envious. To be fair, I have an amazing memory when it comes to names and faces which others might not so maybe people forgot who I was? I didn't attend much class the last term prior to the pandemic as I prioritized optimizing my coop success. Still though, my profile views skyrocketed after adding my job update and I'm on public mode so literally saw classmates stalking me but not interacting.

Idk why but I expected people I knew to ask for coop help or apologize for their past wrongdoings towards me. Nevertheless, I've still had tons of strangers reach out for advice on Linkedin and those interactions probably helped prevent me from going insane but I wish people that I met irl could talk to me or hang out sometimes.

I guess I never got the satisfaction I wanted by proving people wrong and seeing their reactions. I have no idea whether that girl even found out from someone that I got a Cali Faang job as I'm still blocked. I crave attention but it's because I've never had much of it.

I think I'm a nice person and like helping people when I can, partially just to experience some interaction with others. Sadly I've been turning to porn to get these feelings of loneliness and dislike from others out of my mind and it's visibly making me more awkward. I'm afraid I'm getting further and further away from making and maintaining friendships.

What's the point of getting a great job that pays well if I have no one to share that money with? What's the point of achieving things when I have no one to cherish them with?

Not sure why I posted this or what I expect. Maybe someone can tell me what they think could be wrong with me? Actionable steps I can take to improve?

_______________

Edit: guess I'm keeping this up, hoping no one identifies me. Truly astonished by the number of people that reached out saying they empathized and related with a lot of my experiences though. I thought my state of mind was off the playing field. I hope people going through earlier stages of my spiraling story can learn from this and I'm grateful for everyone that provided advice to move forward from this difficult situation."

1. How much time does lectures/tutorials take up a week and how much time do you spend on your own studying?

2. Will I have the time to work on personal projects while balancing school work + working the minimum 40hours every 2 weeks(when the borders open)

3. Do you think UNSW CS really reflects well on the reputation it has built? (Aka if it’s worth the money as I’ll be taking on a loan to study here :’) )

4. Is it hard for an intentional student to find internships in Australia?

If any CS students are here and seeing this, I’d be more than grateful to have a chat to find out more!"

How are different spiritual beliefs/values/lifestyles received in the MBA environment?,triforce_gannondorf,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/okmzvh/booth_or_michigan_half_work_sponsorship_how_are/,"TLDR: I practice Scientology (judge not lest he be judged) and don’t want to become an isolated pariah at my MBA program, wherever I go. Should I try to keep it to myself? I am worried that because I don’t party all out and have limits for myself, that may put me on an ice float before long, whether they know about my beliefs or not. I would appreciate some pointers on how to navigate the judgy social/educational environment as someone not conforming to mainstream pop culture’s mold. Given this concern, does Booth or Michigan seem better for me?


Hi everyone,

As background, I am 33/male/single and work for a prominent family office(manage some rental properties and other investments) in central Florida (Tampa/Clearwater)

I have had a few different office jobs over the years, about 100 months of work experience total. 3.8 in Poli Sci at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. 700 GMAT (46Q, 40V, 8IR, 6AWA). 

My search for advancement led me to apply to an MBA program in this most difficult year. 

Post-MBA I hope to continue working for the same family office and receive greater responsibility. I don’t expect to need an internship, so I plan to use the summer to return to Clearwater and continue my usual work and continue to support my local faith organization.

After playing the summer waiting game, I have a short window (this week) to evaluate two rather different opportunities. 

I have been offered admission from the waitlist to Booth. I am also sitting on Michigan with $ and have a deposit down. That said, the family I work for is putting up half my tuition so the difference is mitigated. I am planning to deposit at Booth, but now that I have a choice, I want to validate that the student atmosphere is right for healthy learning and growth.

These are a bit far from my current setup in central Florida but I beggars can’t be choosers and I feel honored to have been admitted to such prestigious institutions.

What I am curious about is, how well do MBA students get to know each other? I am concerned that differences are not always celebrated and I might have to go along to get along with a wide circle of less-than-intimate friends, fitting in and keeping a straight face to “maximize the networking.”

I know that off-the-bat, some are wondering about my particular faith and what sort of whacko I might be. I promise, I’m not trying to be secretive, I just don’t want to broadcast or be welcomed into the peer group as “that guy” and be associated with any negative propaganda. I want to be judged for my own conduct and receive a fair shake, but I don’t want to be hyper secretive for two years with folks who should be my friends. I also know there are some who will shy away from me due to stigma and I don’t really care to let them poison my experience/

1) To what extent are your peers open about their beliefs?

2) If the school administration learns about my beliefs, will that change the level of learning support I receive?

3) What social activities can I install myself into in order to be at the center of the action? I am reluctant to build my reputation solely dependent on peer groups/cliques. This subreddit has had a few posts about how the social scene can be punishing for those who are different. I would love to patiently solidify my status so that I don’t become an object of gossip or fun.

Very excited but also a bit nervous about not knowing how to adapt to the situation.

**A REALLY BAD way to ask for an engineering internship . . . and how he could've improved**

I received the following message: ""Good morning Sir, is there any Mechanical engineering internship opportunity"". That's it. Nothing more. Let's break it down and see where he could've improved:

1. It's vague. Is he asking if I have an internship available or about it in general?

2. We've had no prior interaction and he gives no background

3. Is he asking because I have connections or because he wants an energy engineering internship?

4. His question can be answered with a yes/no which should be avoided as that limits the conversation.

So here's what I would have recommended instead to get the ball rolling:

""Hi, I'm an engineering student and have found your material on internships to be very interesting. My interests lie in energy engineering and I have been having a tough time trying to find an internship for this summer.

Do you have any guidance on how I can find a position? I'm willing to go pretty much anywhere in the Northeast US.""

This letter let's me know how they found me, where they are in life, and more specifically what they are looking to land.  Remember, you are the one asking for help here so you want to lay it all out for this person and not make them dig for details.

Also, it's important to ask for GUIDANCE in landing an internship and not ask if they have a specific role.  I say this for two reasons.  First, even if they have no role to offer, the conversation continues and you can still get some great tips for them or perhaps have them give you a name of someone to contact.  Second, even if they have a job, people don't like to be put on the spot, so this gives them a little breathing room.  

Remember, the key is to open up a dialogue and not walk into a situations where they can simply answer ""No"" and then close the conversation.

...

*Btw, I share more material geared towards younger engineers and helping them along their engineering journey on my LinkedIn profile.  I'm an open networker, so if you are on that platform, feel free to reach out and connect, https://www.linkedin.com/in/solrosenbaum/*"
oks9t2,1,2021-07-15,Entry Level Data Analytics Job Advice,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/oks9t2/entry_level_data_analytics_job_advice/,"Hello!

Just a quick background about my education and experience. I graduated with a degree in Engineering this year and while there are some jobs related to my field, they're quite competitive or require a really good GPA. So I decided to move into the area of Data Analytics. I'm currently taking a Certificate program for this field and it covers analysis with Python, R and database software such as SQL. 

**Job Experience**

On the experience side, I mainly have customer service experience, a short job at a warehouse and an engineering internship. The internship (along with my engineering education) really helped me to improve my skills with MATLAB. 

**Skills**

I'm pretty good with MATLAB and using MS Excel for a variety of statistical analysis. I'm constantly trying to improve my skills with Python, R and SQL seeing as a lot of job requirements either state knowledge of Python or SQL. Besides technical skills, I'm pretty organized, detail-oriented, customer service helped me improve my people skills, etc.

Based on the job descriptions for entry level data analytics, most jobs require a minimum of at least 1 year worth of experience (or 3+ which I've seen also) and require you to know loads of analytics skills. I've been applying to most entry level jobs I see, whether they're full-time, part-time, contract or internships. The most experience I have with data analysis would probably be the assignments/projects that I complete for the certificate and statistical analysis with Excel that I've used before. As mentioned earlier, I'm pretty good at MATLAB but not sure if MATLAB is used for data analysis. I've started freelancing for data analysis (nothing complicated, just statistical analysis) and data entry and hoping that this will also give me projects and experience that I can put on my resume.

So I just have a couple questions about this field and what I can do to get an entry level job. 

1. Are there any other ways to gain experience with this field besides attempting to freelance?
2. What are hiring managers for entry level data analytics positions looking for?

Any general advice or advice on how to get an entry level job in this field would be appreciative!"

In one of my rejection emails, the interviewer said they liked my personality, talents, and experience and that puzzled me.  That was one of the interviews that went to a second round.  

I’m currently in an internship that pays crappy and I’m trying to get a full-time job with a salary.  I’ve been at the internship for six months btw.  This is my first internship since graduating from college with a degree in Mass Comm. back in 2019.

What am I doing wrong for me to not get any offers?  Do I need another internship for more experience?  Do they just interview just to say they did then hire internally?  What could be the issue?

I wasn't expecting all the support, thank you it really means a lot. I've never discussed any of this with anyone so just hearing any kind of feedback is much appreciated. Reading the replies has raised my mood, especially from those on a similar path. I'm glad some can relate, I guess it's always nice to know there are others out there who've felt the same way.

I'm searching for remote jobs in my field (digital marketing etc..), yeah the unpaid internships sucked but at the time I was worried about gaps in my resume, although now there's a nice 1+ year gap that I'll have fun explaining haha.

I'm definitely not giving up anytime soon, this is what I see myself doing 100%. Just have to adopt a long term mindset. I wish everyone who goes down a similar path good luck, hope you also felt some encouragement from this.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So I (23,f), graduated a while ago and fumbled around in unpaid internships and volunteering positions since I just couldn't get a full time job. Towards the start of Covid I started an online business, specifically in ecommerce. I realised this is something that I truly love and would like to continue doing for my career. I value the autonomy and have a strong passion for the niche I'm in.

The business was going well but for a few reasons it reached a point where I felt the need to either re-brand, or take what i'd learned and start again. At the start of 2021 I opened my new store, but this time round with my low budget it's growing very slowly. I'm reaching a point where it's getting quite difficult to keep things going, but this is what I'm genuinely passionate about and know it can become quite profitable down the line.

I know I've reached the point where I need to get a job, at least just temporarily, but with my limited experience working for others + social anxiety it's been really tough. I've almost isolated myself completely (partially because of my fear of judgement), and the few friends I do keep up with all have normal 9-5 jobs and are pushing me towards that route.

I'm just alone in my own head all the time. Some days i'm completely fine and can concentrate on my goals, but then I see one post from a friend at a work event and i'm down a spiral of ""darn, i should've just forced myself to get an office job sooner"" ""i've wasted all this time"" ""i'm a failure"".

I guess I've found my path but it feels impossible making it work rn and I feel like I have 0 support."

I got an internship basically in an IT department at a big company. I do a lot of busy work, but my mentor who is also an intern but a year older than me, gets to work on other things like writing scripts and programs. I’ve asked him about what he does quite a bit and he just responds very casually and says “if you see something here that you can make more efficient, feel free to create it”. But all the stuff that he works on pretty much goes over my head, simply because I don’t have enough knowledge on a lot of programming languages, git, and just other cs related topics. I’m solid in Java and a couple other languages, but that’s pretty much the extent of my cs knowledge. 

So basically, at my job, I have the freedom to work on whatever I want to work on, but I don’t know what to do or how to do really anything. I’ll be a junior in college so I understand the basics of cs and I’m a decent programmer in some languages, but creating apps and scripts that have real life uses is not something I know how to do. 

So I guess I was wondering how other people learn about how computers operate, and how to create and implement useful scripts and apps. Because my knowledge is very basic, and I asked my mentor how he learned and he never gave me a straightforward answer. Any advice would be appreciated."

I'm not going to go into details as I'd dox myself, but basically it's based in the Bay Area, and it's a small intimate company setting. Everyone here is really intelligent, and fun to hang around. I feel like I can learn so much from them.

  
I started remotely and then, somehow, the opportunity to come to the US and start working there came up. I've learnt so much and had so much fun while I was here (did full-stack dev). The comp is super good as well for an intern, and I bet for a full-timer too. I especially loved working with my manager and my other colleagues (who work remotely).

However, I did not get a return offer. My manager let me know, citing lack of independence in problem solving, as well as lack of senior engineers to give me the mentorship I need to perform at the level that *they* need.

I also do know that my company is actively hiring (for my position) and every single intern before me has gotten a return offer, so I'm quite sure it's a personal failing on my part, either a failure to deliver enough well-written / thoughtful programs, or just a failure to communicate.

I'm really discouraged because of this. I'd like to rally and redouble my efforts, but I just feel so tired right now.

I got stuck at times, sure, but I was told to ask when stuck...

**ONE HOUR AMA SERIES:** Periodically, we get requests for AMAs or we invite people who are well-versed in college admissions, to do One Hour AMAs with us. We are excited to announce two in the next couple of weeks! Please mark your calendars for these if you’d like to take part.

* **On TUESDAY, JULY 27 from 5 PM - 6 PM CST, The University of Pennsylvania Admissions** team will be doing an AMA. We are honored that they are taking the time to join us!

**ONE EASY HINT FOR PERSONAL ESSAYS:** One great way to check and see if your essay is personal enough is to try to incorporate these words into your essay. If they don’t fit in the content and context, that might be a clue your essay isn’t personal enough: I think, I believe, I wonder, I feel, to me

**ABOUT ECs AND ACTIVITIES:**   I'm seeing lots of questions about ECs and activities. Keep in mind that basically anything that you do outside of class work, homework, and test prep is considered an activity. That includes jobs, family and home responsibilities, elderly or child care, personal projects, interests, and hobbies, and independent research, in addition to the more typical research, internships, and in and out of school community service, clubs, and sports.  The most important thing is to be involved in a few things that interest and speak to you. 

Here’s what MIT Admissions says **about extracurricular activities:** Some students feel so much pressure to get into the “right” college that they want to make sure they do everything right—down to their extracurricular activities. Fortunately, the only right answer is to do what’s right for you—not what you think is right for us. Choose your activities because they delight, intrigue, and challenge you, not because you think they’ll look impressive on your application. Go out of your way to find projects, activities, and experiences that stimulate your creativity and leadership, that connect you with peers and adults who bring out your best, and that please you so much that you don’t mind the work involved. Some students find room for many activities; others prefer to concentrate on just a few. Either way, the test for any extracurricular should be whether it makes you happy—whether it feels right for you. **College is not a costume party; you’re not supposed to come dressed as someone else. College is an intense, irreplaceable four-year opportunity to become more yourself than you’ve ever been. What you need to show us is that you’re ready to try.”**

**ADMISSIONS BLOG PROFILE:** I love Georgia Tech’s Blog, and in the most recent post, Rick Clark, Dean of Admissions talks about the importance of understanding the mission of a college and making sure that mission matches your mission -- and you match their mission. This should be an essential part of your research when you’re making your college list.  Be sure to check it out[ here](https://sites.gatech.edu/admission-blog/).

**COLLEGES THAT CHANGE LIVES COLLEGE FAIRS:** Even if you don't think you want to attend a liberal arts college, I encourage you to go to one of their college fairs. It can help you to figure out what you do and don't want as you chat with the admissions officers and learn more about their offerings. And I encourage you not to make the same mistake we see year after year of not considering potential merit aid you might need and the possibility that that long list of highly highly selective colleges you're applying to just might not work out. Also, be sure to chat with them about meaningful research for all you pre-med students out there (and others!). [Find a CTCL fair near you here.](https://ctcl.org/info-sessions/)

**JUNIOR/SENIOR TIMELINE:** Here’s a[ link to my Admissions Journey Timeline](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/nxi29t/hey_rising_juniors_and_seniors_this_admissions/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). I know many of you are still looking for basic advice about what to do when, so be sure to read through this. Don’t allow yourself to get overwhelmed by it; it’s just a guide to let you know what you might need to be doing.

**A HELPFUL HINT:** **Make an admissions-only email account.** I suggest [firstname.lastname.college@whateveremailyoulikebest](mailto:firstname.lastname.college@whateveremailyoulikebest). You will get overwhelmed by piles of info from colleges and you will need to be able to easily access it. And it’s helpful if that info is coming from colleges you’re actually interested in rather than the ones College Board or ACT sold your name to. Use that email address for your applications. This summer, one thing for sure you can do is “request info” from all the schools you’re interested in with your admissions-only email address -- that way they can start counting your interest (if they consider it) and you can start gathering the info you need about the colleges you care about.

**SHARE YOUR ADVICE:** Do you have some advice or a helpful hint you’d like to share here for others to learn from? Please do!

**ASK QUESTIONS:** While Google (and our search bar) should be your friend, don’t hesitate to reach out and ask questions. You can ask here and I’ll try to answer (and maybe some others will too!) or ask on the subreddit, but also be sure you ask your high school counselor (when you get back to school) and the colleges themselves!

**KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING:** Keep supporting each other, advising each other, and sharing your thoughts, worries, concerns, excitement, words of encouragement, and advice! Don't forget to take time to breathe and recharge your batteries every once in a while :) -- ☀️😎It is summer after all!

Take care,

&amp;#x200B;

* Do I have too many relevant courses from my high school section? Should I reduce it to only the computer science ones?
* Are my verbs varied enough? I use ""design"" and ""develop"" frequently, but never in the same project/extracurricular. Would that be ok?
* Should I change ""RELEVANT EXPERIENCE"" to ""EXTRACURRICULARS""?
* Before, I ordered my skills based on proficiency. Is my current section better?

Anything else?"

I’m currently in an internship that pays crappy and I’m trying to get a full-time job with a salary.  I’ve been at the internship for six months btw.  This is my first internship since graduating from college with a degree in Mass Comm. back in 2019.

What am I doing wrong for me to not get any offers?  Do I need another internship for more experience?  Do they just interview just to say they did then hire internally?  What could be the issue?

ol19lq,1,2021-07-15,How to help my sister,Ok_Distribution2361,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ol19lq/how_to_help_my_sister/,"Because we're twins, we entered and graduated in May from college at the same time. I've been interning at my current company in my final semester of college, so I just transitioned to full-time in June. My sister have had terrible luck with both work and job-hunting in the past, and it's really affecting her mentally and emotionally, and unfortunately, our emotionally abusive family/home is not helping with that. For the record, I got a degree in civil engineering and my sister got hers in studio art.

&amp;#x200B;

In college, my sister didn't really work except during the summer (retail stint, summer camp) and in her final 2 years of college (gallery assistant and teacher assistant for her department, and unpaid internships in art in her senior year). About a month before our graduation, she got hired as a production artist for a small business (something about dog merchandise I don't know) for full-time after graduation, and was doing training part-time while going to classes. Again, our family basically suck and just drain our energy, especially for my sister since she still lives at home (I live with a distant relative because I was having serious academic issues and my family made it impossible for me to continue my studies in engineering). Anyways, that troubled my sister for a long while and it stopped her from being completely mentally present both in classes, her unpaid internship, and this gig that she was training for at the time. Her boss basically fired her for incompetence, saying her business couldn't sustain my sister's wage since she was costing a lot of money with her mistakes and long time in finishing tasks correctly. Being fired really wrecked my sister's self esteem, especially because she was counting on it for after graduation (she got fired like a week or 2 right before graduation), and the pressure to work and earn on money for us is real because our family is low-income and immigrants.

&amp;#x200B;

After graduating, my sister applied for a bunch of jobs that she thought she could do, and finally, in mid-June, got 2 part-time jobs that she was actually interested in (teaching art to kids, and admin for some small art business). She started the latter job because it had an immediate start date and did it for a week, because she then got hired for a salary job elsewhere, so she had to call it quits. However, this is when the issue starts. A week into the job, she texted me that she felt really bad about her job, and the second week (now), she told me she's getting a lot of anxiety because of her boss and the phone calls she has to take. She says her boss gets frustrated with her a lot and shows it in her body language and language because of miscommunication, and her boss says that my sister overcomplicates the job. It's hard for me to understand but I try to, and i'm also trying to figure out how to comfort my sister and be there for her because the family and economic pressure is still there, and we have a terrible relationship with our mom (single parent household).

&amp;#x200B;

I have 3 projects , using stacks and queues, other two are using Bootstrap and JS , and node.JS and express.JS. But that’s much it.

I was also a TA last semester and will be incoming TA next semester also for the same CS class. 

I’m going to start reviewing DS Algo concepts again before going to career fairs because it works better for me.

Some background info about myself: 24y/o F, with a Bachelor of Arts from NTU. Bilingualism (Mandarin) is one of my strength.

My internship/ work experience is pretty eclectic, but mostly writing in the media/communications industry (PR/ advertising) and in an agency setting.

I am definitely still looking at corporate roles but am not sure if I would like to work as a writer in the media anymore. I am quite interested to work in a business development now.

TESL seem to be a popular way for fresh undergraduates like me to get a work visa in China but I think it’s hard for me.


I am intending to live in Chengdu for 2/3 years. The reason I am choosing Chengdu over other tier 1 cities is for its underground music scene and other subcultures.

I don’t have any family/ friends there and want to move purely to step out of my comfort zone by experiencing living overseas. I  might want to move to another city after spending some time there or move back to Singapore but I think it’s too early to determine.

I'm new here so apologies if this is a re-post, I didn't see anything that matches my situation in my googling. Basically, I'm looking to apply to PhD programs in the US/Canada in CS/ML (I'm focused on ML).

I typically hear that it's important to make a connection with advisors first, and some university sites even say it's important to reach out. 

I've reached out to about 12 advisors in the past couple of months (after reading up on their labs and work and stuff) and it's either been negative responses (not planning to take in new students) or no response. In my emails, I try to politely ask if they might be accepting new students to their lab during the next admission period. Followed by some more info about myself as well as a cv.

It has me wondering if to still apply to those respective schools, where I'd likely need to write statements specifying that advisor and their work or if it would just be a waste of time. The advisors are from a range of schools, some top tier and some not so popular, I know I'm not cream of the crop but I don't think I'm an awful candidate so I'm trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong or misunderstanding about this process.

ol6qrr,4,2021-07-15,Smart tablet design project,fastworld555,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/ol6qrr/smart_tablet_design_project/,"I'm currently trying to think of a project for my final year project. I'm thinking of building a simple smart tablet that can run embedded linux and connect to wifi but I'm not sure if this project would be achievable. 

Background: I'm an electrical engineering major interested in embedded systems. I have only a bit of experience in PCB design, but I understand how simple circuits are designed. I have experience with Pi, Arduino, ESP, and basic stm32. 

From my understanding, building a smart tablet is somewhat similar to building a smart watch. (It's just a scaled up version of a smart watch). Ideally, I'd like to build the system from scratch, where I'll mainly be focusing on PCB design. For my design, I plan on using an stm32mp MPU which requires external RAM. I'll also need to design a circuit for power management and the WIFI chip (esp8266).  I should note that I have not designed a smart watch before, but I have studied the design of one in my previous internship. But that uses an MCU instead of an mpu so I'm not sure if it's as simple as connecting the RAM to the right pinouts for it to work.

No.

How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?

Performance -&gt; battery life -&gt; display. Do not really have much info on what is an ultrabook and 2 in 1. I always assume the sleek design laptops are ultrabooks, haha.

Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.

N/A

Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.

I am not sure if I will have photo/video editing for upcoming months/years. But I will be doing web design. I would also like to do light Gaming.  I am currently enrolled in marketing management.

If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?

CS:GO and League of Legends mostly. Medium-high with good fps. No stutter and all clear if possible.

ol7bqs,72,2021-07-15,How do you figure out what schools you can get into?,AspiringDiplomat,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/ol7bqs/how_do_you_figure_out_what_schools_you_can_get/,"I’m currently having a really hard time deciding which programs to apply to as I have no idea where I stand vs their accepted applicants. With undergraduate programs, it is quite easy to figure out where you can probably get into as you can easily find average GPAs, SATs, acceptance rates, etc. Graduate programs seem to be much more cryptic about their accepted student statistics. Most post nothing online, and the admissions counselors at the schools I’ve talk to have completely dodged the question when I've asked about student demographics, all just saying they “receive a wide range of applicants and look at each application holistically”. 

For reference, I have been looking at data science masters mainly in the Boston area. I had a 3.89 cum. GPA and 3.96 math GPA from a \~50th ranked school, 168Q 160V on the GRE, 1 relevant internship, 1 year of not very relevant full time experience, no published papers, and will likely have average at best LORs. I am trying to figure out if I can get into very good but not top tier schools like Northeastern/Tufts/etc, but have absolutely no idea if these types of schools would be considered safety, target, or reach for me.

How did you research and decide which programs you could likely get into?"

ol9tek,3,2021-07-16,I Just Graduated College but I’m Considering moving back for a year. Is this a bad idea?,ice_jj,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ol9tek/i_just_graduated_college_but_im_considering/,"I just graduated from a four year university and I’m very depressed and disappointed with my life back home. I regret not applying to grad school as I would’ve gotten to finish another year there. I also wish I had gotten a minor as I’m not very satisfied with my major. I also had Covid ruin the last year.

I just feel lost and worst of all I left some close friends and a girl I was getting to know/liked a lot. My one friend and I just started getting close this year. We met our first year but we didn’t talk much until the last couple. This last semester was another level, we were always going out together and it was really fun. I had always wanted a reliable friend to hangout with and I finally found one but it was too late.

We made good friends with my random roommates, so we were always having little pregames at our apartment. We got to know them pretty well which was nice, as I’d always been disadvantage with random roommates who kept to themselves. It was so fun that it all just flew by instantly.

This girl I met off tinder, started as a fwb but turned into a weekly fling. It started off as sex but we got pretty close in the process. She’s from another state so I can’t see her much this summer. She is also a sophomore   so she still has some time left. I know I couldn’t stay that long but it would be nice to get to spend time with her for one last year. 

It is also the vibe of campus town that I miss. I miss seeing people my age everywhere I go and having bars in walking distance. I miss having plans every weekend and a social life right outside my door. I miss those opportunities to join clubs and be apart of the academic system.

I regret not taking advantage of these things earlier. I spent too much time going to frat parties or chasing friends, that I failed to enjoy the college experience in its fullest. I also spent time in a toxic relationship.

So I’m torn here, my friend still has another year left and part of me wishes I could enjoy it with him. He’s from another state so I may not see him after. I’d only stay a year or 6 months tops and would likely work a job to afford it. I’d think also finding an internship would be best as it’d help my resume. I’d get to see this girl more instead of letting her go which makes me sad to think. I could only do a year too because that’s all I could take of the campus.

But I’ve been getting comfortable at home, having my dogs and family around. It’s nice to see them after this school year. I’ve been out at college for 4 years so it would feel bad to leave them again. I haven’t been getting in trouble back home as I’m not going out as much. I’m also able to save money and feel for the future.

But Im so lonely back home that its
not even worth it. Everyone is so cliquey back home that I rarely spend  time with friends or meet new people. I’m stuck in an endless loop of work that I’m losing hope for life. I rarely talk to girls or hangout with people back home and it’s gotten to me. My parents don’t understand and expect me to be happy anyways.

Part of me thinks that it’s pointless to move back to campus after graduation. A lot of people move out after they graduate and I’d kind feel like a loser if I was still there after I graduated. I don’t want to be that guy  who is stuck in college. I also think I won’t be able to grow up until i leave college behind, as I’ll waste a year there instead of facing reality.

But I feel like a year wouldn’t be too bad as long as I’m working. I could maybe get into grad school in the spring but I’m not sure. I wouldn’t care as much if all my friends graduated but the fact that my friends have a year left makes me want to enjoy it with them. I won’t care as much once they graduate. I also wouldn’t want to just visit I don’t think , as it’s a two hour drive, so id only go a few times.

It all seems unlikely as my parents are against me going back. They dont see the point and don’t want me to get in trouble. I’ve yet to save up enough to even afford my own place or my own car, so I’d need to do that first ."

I've been sitting at home for the past two month doing nothing towards looking for a job and I'm wondering if I made a mistake what I studied.

I feel like at this point I need to continue with it though since I spent my money on the degree and don't have anything else I particularly want to do (at least, anything that would provide a viable career). 

However, every time I get into looking at job listings, I get really turned away from the prospect of a lot of them. For instance, there are so many postings filled with vocab or acronyms I didn't understand before having to look them up. I also feel like I do not have the knowledge required for these jobs. For example, I barely if at all know how AWS works, I don't really know Javascript, and even after working with SQL in two classes I don't think I understand that either (I I even remember the difference between SQL, NoSQL, and whatever else there is).

I truly feel like I got lucky during my whole college career which allowed me to graduate. But in the end I have no confidence in anything I learned. I feel like I only know Java, C, and a bit of Python and a lot of surface knowledge in other random subejcts but not how any of it works in a real world sense.

I'd appreciate if anyone who has experienced what I am now is willing to talk to me more about what they went through. PMs welcomed.

TL;DR has anyone else dedicated their studies fully to cs only to realize they don't like it?"

Turns out, the old job I interned at packed up their HQ and decided to relocate the entire company to my new town!

I put in applications for a part time and a full time position there, as well as reached out to my contact/boss from the company. He gave me a friendly catch up interview, told me he was going to get me an interview with the CEO, and said he knew I could do the job. Followed up a few days later as discussed and he assured me he was working on it.

Fast forward three weeks, and he has all but ghosted me. Followed up twice more over the weeks and he left me on read, untill finally this morning he replies with 

""Hey (name), CEO filled the part time position but as more opportunities show up I'll throw your name in"".

Didn't discuss the full time position we discussed, didnt mention not getting back to me for so long, and honestly I'm beginning to expect this might be a dead end.

This is a company I'm passionate about, my inter ship before went well and In my new city without a job is starting to take it's toll.

Is this a dead end? Should I continue to actively pursue this? I'm applying elsewhere as well, but have been for months, and not getting a job where I have contacts and experience is very demoralizing."

I'm going to be starting my first job in CS a few weeks from now, and I'm getting serious imposter syndrome since I've only ever had one internship (and it was more of a small webdev position for a university rather than working for any serious company) so I'm wondering if there are any last minute technologies, practices, etc. I can learn in the next few weeks to appear semi-competent for my first job (e.g. git). For what it's worth, I think I will be working with C/C++, OpenGL, and maybe a little bit of java.

Thanks!"

So about me, I'm 22 years old and I am from India. I have completed  3 internships and 1 part-time job during my college and now I'm in Paris, France about to be graduated with a first-class honors degree. 

To complete my course, I need to do a three-month internship relating to marketing and stuff, and if you all didn't know about this, France is a high stickler for their language that they don't hire anyone who speaks English. I got rejected so many times so I tried outside France and finally, I have found an internship in Belgium that REQUIRED English (You'll see why I capped the word Required) 

In the middle of the internship, the CEO of the company changed the official language of posts in social media and stuff from English to French and he started to notice that I wasn't that good at French (Although I have an A2 Level) 

So now they dumped me to jobs like collecting contacts and adding them in an Excel filé type of job and the CEO is doing the social media posts and stuff.

It feels so demeaning to be pushed down just because of a language factor when the majority of the targeted people already speak excellent English and idk whether should I stay on this internship or even look for the possibility of finding another one. 

What do you think I have to do? Please help."

I am a design intern at a VC, wrapping up my 7th week in the program. I am the only design intern on the team, working with very type-A people, which isn't bad, but I have struggled to get meaningful feedback since week 1. That being said, I've actively tried to accommodate my boss and her hectic schedule, but she is genuinely a very unapproachable person. Quite terrifying. I go into the office 3 times a week while balancing the hours I have available to complete deadlines for my internship (25hrs a week) and the OL class I am taking (which is 10 hrs of work a week). I started my internship before my class; with this in mind, I had to alter the amount of time I stayed in the office because I have to work on my OL class or be behind by the time Wednesday rolls around.

I have terrible ADHD, and I have been medicated since I was 7 (I'm 22 now). The way the office space works is quite distracting and hard for me to work in. Everyone who comes into the office sits at these tables put together into a U shape, So I would slide into one of the conference rooms for a couple of hours to focus because I actually can't do anything with conversations going on around me. My boss asked me to stop and reserve it for those who have actual conferences; I complied and shortened the time I spent in the office since my class started anyway, and I quickly realized how big my workload was.

Last Friday, I went into a zoom call with my boss and was hit with personal attack after personal attack. Keep in mind, this woman doesn't make herself the most available for me to get feedback, and when I do- I almost always start back at square 1. I am a design intern, I cannot concoct an entire design system in a day, but she goes off on how long it took me to do this 3 pg PDF. A 3 pg pdf that was full of designs... I did that while attending multiple doctor appointments and meeting class deadlines. I've used the conference room maybe twice since she asked me not to, on days there were only 3 interns in the office. She used this as ammunition, saying I did it despite her asking me not to. I have an auditory processing disorder, she used that against me, saying, ""You act like you understand and comprehend everything in our meetings, but when I see the product, it seems you don't. Idk if you are capable of doing this."" She has never provided written notes of feedback or meeting details (which I am used to people forgetting to do, but if she is the only person I answer to, and I can't clarify, that really slows me down). In the circumstances like these, I would normally ask for clarification. Still, she doesn't like clarifying (she has actually gone off on me for trying to get clarification once), and I don't hear back on Slack at a quick rate either.  She threatens to fire me, but I beg her to give me a week, and she says ok, but if I don't get it together, it will be without pay (if I don't finish, my graduation gets pushed from 16 to 60 weeks away). She poked at my learning disabilities, weaponized them as a weakness, and got mad when I couldn't get in contact with her b/c she was unavailable July 4th weekend and Wednesday &amp; Thursday of that same week. THAT FRIDAY was the first time I had heard from her since before July 4th. I tried to develop accommodations for myself. She is aware of my disabilities, and I come to find out from an intern who happened to be in the office on Friday that he heard everything that was said because she didn't wear headphones. I feel **humiliated** that he heard that, but I am glad there is at least a witness. I had a meeting with her yesterday, and she was acting like she didn't make me cry for 45 minutes in a Zoom call. She didn't even clear if I'd continue to be paid or not but at the same time acknowledged that I'd made some recovery because she really liked what I did in between the meetings.

Another thing, we don't have an HR, but we have someone who is essentially the person. From what I was able to find out, the few HR issues they've had were handled by this one super sweet lady I feel comfortable approaching about this. I don't know how to relay these events to her or the exact accommodations I am entitled to as a 10- week Intern. I can continue without pay; I really don't care b/c I only have 2 weeks left. But, she is recruiting interns from my art school. She HAS to understand she can't just violate those accommodations we have developed to work productively. Idk what advice I need, JUST GIVE ME ALL THE GUIDANCE YOU ADULTS CAN!!! I want to stand up for myself and future interns who need adequate places to work without it being shamed or used against them. Thanks guys, sorry for the essay!"

I ended up going through college only getting a degree, not getting connections or even having a job or internship. I think the only upside is that my college was affordable enough for me to not end up in debt. I live in NYC, where there's supposed to be more job opportunities though that also means more competition. 

I've tried looking into obtaining certifications, but those seem to require experience beforehand.

Nearly all the job listings, even entry-level ones require years of experience and the few that didn't I've applied to turned out to be an MLM scheme or no reply. The only applicable skills I do have is proficiency with using Microsoft Office and the G-Suite from all those assignments in college. 

Also, not to mention I feel like the whole staying indoors all the time thing has really taken a toll on my social skills. 

I'm posting here wondering if anyone's been in a similar situation before and know what to do."

Been lurking for awhile just reading posts and what not. This may get a little long so please bare with me.

I’ve been programming for quite a few years now, started when I was a Junior in high school (going into my senior year of college). I had managed to place myself in a 3 hour program everyday for the last semester of my Junior year and first of my Senior (of high school). It all came pretty naturally to me, we started super basic using Scratch, moving to Python and then Java. I had a lot of fun with Java, my senior project was a text-based adventure RPG with two separate endings, had working inventory and combat as well. I was extremely proud of it, and had a blast too.

Fast forward to college. School has pretty much killed any enjoyment I got out of programming. During my 2021 spring semester, I averaged 4 hours of sleep a night trying to meet deadlines, but hey I was pretty proud to get a 100% on my Linux device driver. 

I want to be clear, i’m not boasting here, in case that’s how it’s coming across. In order to well, have a place to live, i’ve had to maintain a work schedule of roughly 30 hrs a week during semesters and 50 when not. Because of this, any free time I manage to find, i’m exhausted and have no desire to program. I’ve got no personal projects,  nothing on the side, no internships, nothing. It’s starting to worry me, and I keep stressing over how i’ll manage to find a job after school. I guess you could say i’m looking for advice on what to do. I apologize if this doesn’t fit the kind of posts on the sub."
ololx4,402,2021-07-16,Medical practice operating like well-oiled machine,Myantra,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/ololx4/medical_practice_operating_like_welloiled_machine/,"Inspired by u/Arbitrary_Pseudonym and IT guy ran off to Malaysia, I decided to share my experience onboarding a large medical practice.  I support a large medical practice that is part of a multi-state network of standardized practices.  They have no in-state IT resources, so I often go onboard practices that have joined.  Most of the time, these are simple jobs that can be done in a day.  This is even true with most large practices, as they tend to have internal IT managing an organized environment.

I get the briefing from the project manager on this clinic.  Large, established practice, 200-250 workstations, and they have internal IT.  I am thinking ""cool, the usual cakewalk...""  Since they close at noon on Fridays, we schedule the job.

A few days before the job, I reach out to their IT guy, just to ask a few questions and see if he will go ahead and roll out the RMM software that makes my onboarding life easier.  When I ask him to create a GPO to deploy the .msi that I will share, he responds ""sure"".  However, it was ""sure"" in that way that actually means ""sure, I do not know what you are talking about, but I will Google it until I do.""

Then I get onsite.

Turns out they are replacing 100+ workstations, so there are a few pallets of Dell desktops currently sitting in the conference room.  The IT guy has not rolled out RMM, and is genuinely perplexed by the concept of group policy.  It turns out that IT guy at this practice, for the past several, were interns that were students at the local university.  The current IT guy had actually been hired from that intern pool.  He spends so much time doing break/fix that he has no time to address any of the core issues, and he asks for some guidance.  Already knowing that this is beyond a one day job, I tell the project manager that we need to reschedule, and I need some of my colleagues that do the same thing in other areas of the state.  I plan to spend the day doing the site survey, that should have already been done.

We start with the domain controller.  There is no OU structure, all 200+ users are just sitting in the default Users OU.  None of them actually login to Windows with those accounts though, they exist only for Exchange.  Everyone logs in to Windows with the user/password of med/med.  Turns out Med is also a domain admin.

All file shares (also on domain controller), are everyone has full control.

I do not even want to get into the annoyance of seeing Exchange 2003, in 2017.

Those replacement desktops?  They are replacing desktops running XP, including the entire billing department.  Every desktop is also being upgraded to dual monitors.  The new Dells only have DP and HDMI ports.  There is not a single monitor in the building with a DP, including the brand new ones they ordered.

Now I am ready to pull out my laptop and start looking at the network.  I see an available jack, and ask him if it is active.  He says ""give me a minute"", and leaves the room.  I thought he was going to enable the port, or maybe patch it to the switch.  No.  He returns, says ""I unplugged the workstation in the next office, you should be good.""  Why did he unplug a workstation to activate that jack?  ""We are out of IPs"".

I start looking at the firewall/switches and discover a nightmare.  It looks like several people have clearly been practicing for their CCNP with a production network.

Servers are on 10.10.1.x, but it is broken up into a bunch of /28-30.  Workstations are on a range of 192.168.1-10, all also broken up into a bunch of /28-30.  DHCP is only serving one /28, and almost all workstations are static.  That all of this was a problem he did not need to have, had not dawned on him.  He just said a networking guy set it all up, and he thought everything was normal.  He did say he frequently encountered issues with sharing where a workstations could see the servers, and had internet access, but they could not see half of the other workstations, or the printer on the desk next to them.

I decided the network was where we needed to start.  I stepped out to call the project manager, to tell him what I found, and get approval for all this out of scope work.  When he finally stops laughing, he tells me to take as long as I need, help is on the way, and everything is on multi-state network's dime.

I stayed the weekend, since it was a fun town, and the next week.  Help showed up, and we turned it into what a network of that size should like.  IT guy ultimately proved useful for running around switching workstations from static to DHCP, or anything else that required running around.  That was about all he could be trusted with."

2018 - Graduate Harvard Law School (age 24)

2018 - 2021 - Work @ Wilson Sonsini

2021 - Other ventures

&amp;#x200B;

But let me tell you another story.

&amp;#x200B;

2011 - Junior year of high school; stomach aches induced by the stress of SAT and AP courses

2012 - Freshman year @ Berkeley, so anxious that I cry in the dorm showers often. I stick to what I know &amp; shelter myself

2013 - I spend 90% of my free time alone, unable to feel like I could connect to others

2014 - My best friend, my grandmother, passes away while I'm working full time &amp; studying for the LSAT. Panic attacks &amp; hyperventilating begin

2015 - Begin feeling nauseous/gagging uncontrollably - in conversation, while I eat, etc. Gagging takes control of my life &amp; I receive GI procedures (including endoscopy) to resolve. Nothing found - assumed stomach acid and take anti-acid meds

Fall 2015 - First semester @ NYU Law, go two months before making my first real friend as I am so anxious about the state of my body

2016 - Choke on water b/c of my gagging in one of my on-campus interviews

2016 - 2019 - Manage the gagging/nausea; still take the anti-acid meds

2019 - As stress picks up and gagging/nausea worsens, I accept that stress/my own mind may be inducing my stomach issues. Once I do, the stomach issues disappear

2020 - During #covid my anxiety spirals - try to control everything in my life, from my job, to my apartment, to my relationship, and finally, to my own state of mind

Fall 2020 - Become mildly depressed

December 2020 - Lost control on managing my life and way of thinking. Seek help; diagnosed w/ severe anxiety and mild depression

January 2021 onwards - Improve my cognitive, behavioral, and emotional state of mind. Learn the tools to manage anxiety and implement them

February 2021 - Fleeting suicidal ideation enters my mind

June 2021 - Feel self love for the first time

July 2021 - Leave my job to focus on my mental health journey

&amp;#x200B;

There are many lessons from my story, but just a few:

&amp;#x200B;

1. NEVER judge a book by its cover

&amp;#x200B;

2. #mentalhealth is real, even if you may not understand it. If you are suffering, if you are struggling, or if you aren't sure - seek out resources

&amp;#x200B;

3. Progress is not straight - I had fleeting suicidal ideation after I began treatment. Do not doubt the path if the big picture shows progress - trust the process. Be patient

&amp;#x200B;

4. You are NEVER alone. If you need help, resource sharing, etc., my inbox is ALWAYS open. You are NOT alone in this battle!

&amp;#x200B;

Please take care of yourselves - your struggle and pain is real. It’s not imagined. Seek out #resources and trust the process - my go-to strategies are in the comments below."""

Anyways I've been totally bluffing all day that the monitor is set-up because my intern ass doesn't want to make a scene. If i don't figure it out this weekend, I'll forfeit and try to get the older staff to help (which I don't think they can- no offence they just aren't techy)"

Recently I applied for a Java programmer internship where I had to do some programming task to check my skills (some classes + tests to complete) and I failed completely. I realised that I don't really know much. 

So far during studies I did several projects and I have basics of C++, C#, Java (that was the main language) and SQL. Just some contact with CSS and HTML. The projects were done in teams or pairs and I completed everything successfully, but I did just some parts of each project and I don't really feel comfortable with coding, especially without googling. I need to look up literally everything. To repeat those projects now, I would need to have really clear instructions about what to do, and then search the net a lot.

What projects I did? For example, simple sudoku game for PC with GUI in Java, Android app with cloud database for connecting volunteers with people seeking help or a simple app to manage store inventory with C#, WPF and MVVM patern. 

However when I think that I would have to redo some project on my own, I don't really know where to start, although I understood all the code and what was done before.

What could you recommend me to do? Java courses on YouTube don't help, since they cover basics and I know how classes work, inheritance etc. But apart from that I'm at a loss :(

I'm originally a CS student from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and I applied to U of I as a transfer student and got accepted to CS Eng a few months ago. I applied here because I was spending most of my quarantine in Chicago, and I thought it would be nice to continue my studies in the state of Illinois. It will be cheaper than Cal Poly only due to the more reasonable rent prices in CU. I am in-state at both institutions.

I wasn't able to make a completely informed decision prior to accepting the offer at U of I because it took until late June for all of my prior coursework to be evaluated. I now know that I would have to retake similar courses at U of I, and I would need to stay in school a bit longer as result. At Cal Poly I would graduate in March 2023, and at U of I it would be December 2023. Staying at Cal Poly would allow me to take an algorithms course and a computer networking course this coming quarter, but I would have to wait another year to take these courses at U of I. I think taking these courses as early as possible would be beneficial to my internship search, which is why I am conflicted. I know that U of I is a great name in CS and I would love to take courses and earn my degree here, but I am not quite sure if it is worth delaying the courses that could assist in my internship hunt. I would greatly appreciate any advice!

TL;DR: Not sure if transferring to U of I for CS Eng is a good idea after finding I will need to stay in school for several more months and delay taking a few interesting courses."

I am getting a BS in Computer Science, graduating May 2023. I have had multiple internships in my field, and am currently in a paying one until the next semester begins. I am taking basic online classes to learn German hoping to be advanced by the time I could move.

I am posting here seeking advice on how I have the best chances of moving after completing my degree. I would not be able to study in Germany due to family. It is also possible that I will be married soon after graduating.

One thing I'm concerned about are taxes. Would I have to pay taxes in the USA after moving, even if I own nothing in the USA?

Any help is appreciated!"
olsniq,2,2021-07-16,Any advice for a recent cyber security grad?,ReindeerLegal5655,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/olsniq/any_advice_for_a_recent_cyber_security_grad/,"I recently graduated with a major in cyber security and minor in digital forensics on May 8th. Since I have no work experience I thought it would have been a good idea to get some certifications so on June 8th I passed the CompTIA Security+ and on June 24th I passed the CompTIA CySA+. With those two certs I was hopeful that it could get me a good entry level position. I’ve been applying for entry level positions such as sysadmin and SOC analyst and still no response from employers. I know for a fact that programming isn’t my specialty so I don’t look for any positions in that field even though thats what in demand right now. So my question now is what can I do to get some type of experience. 

I WISH I WOULD HAVE DONE INTERNSHIPS EARLY ON. I regret it 100%"

This company is making me do a coding challenge for a interview for a full time position with the company during the internship.  The challenge is due literally when I’m at my busiest for the company. So I’m asking you all  due you think the interviewer will understand that I will be busy so I can’t put a good result in for the challenge?
olu3cl,6,2021-07-16,ITS major help. How can I be more marketable?,MindlessClue,utdallas,https://www.reddit.com/r/utdallas/comments/olu3cl/its_major_help_how_can_i_be_more_marketable/,"Hello fellow comets, I hope everyone is enjoying their summer. 

So, I recently switched my major to ITS. I still have a couple of major core classes that I need to take but I will be starting some major-related courses this coming semester. At the rate I'm going, I might be able to graduate in Winter 22 (I was originally supposed to be a Spring 22 graduate). 

Anyways, this past semester I was searching for internships and managed to land some interviews but things never progressed from there. And one of the things I noticed from these interviews is how inexperienced I am and how lacking my resume is. I've only worked low-skilled jobs here and there to pay the bills and the only ""experience"" I have come from my classes. 

So, I wanted to ask my fellow ITS majors and grads what I can do to be more marketable. Is there anything specific that you guys have done that has helped you? I'd love to know."

Looking to apply for Fall22 MS CS programs. Had previously applied to Fall21 MS CS programs and got into only 1 of the 8 NA applications :/


Basically the title. I understand that covid really messed things up, but I have friends from my university who managed to get into great schools so it's much more likely got to do with my lackluster profile. I only got into one 'safe' school, and due to covid and some personal reasons, I have decided not to go this year. Unfortunately, the school isn't allowing me to defer my admission, and I need to move my application with no guarantee of admission.

I had no publications at the time of applying, but I managed to get one out of my final year undergraduate project. I also have a really great internship experience under my belt, and I'll be working as a dev at a very well known tech giant in a few weeks. 

Overall, my profile is definitely stronger, but I've heard stuff like ""it's harder to get in if you don't go immediately after graduation"" and things of that nature. In addition, I'll probably be applying to places that rejected me last year, with the some of the same LoR writers as well! Is this a bad idea or will they not bother looking at my previous application? I'm also concerned about not getting in at all this time, given how my success rate last year was so low. I'll be reapplying to the university I got into as well.

TLDR - got into 1 place for Fall21 and not going. Reapplying to places that rejected me as well as the one uni that gave me an admit with LoRs from the same writers + one new one. Looking for any advice on this and also ways on managing the stress associated with this :/"

I know I have never been a hands-on guy , and while I have never tried product design/manufacturing, I have a gut feeling I won't like them as I did a short internship with a very small SME manufacturer. 

So far, I realised I only enjoyed the calculations/analysis in my engineering work. 

So where can I go with my career? What roles in the Mech E space will be suitable for me?

I got even more excited to know that many people who do a decent job in CP tend to get into quite some good schools. I saw TopCoder Reds and Codechef reds and grandmasters of codeforces get into CMU, Stanford and all.

Recently I have lost my interest in CP due to well sucking at it. But I did realise it is a skill which would help me get into college. Its really been troubling me. I wanted to know if anyone here knows anyone or is anyone who got into a decent university without doing CP. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know the standard ""Applications is more than just one EC"" or ""They look at you more than just what you do"" and all that but really. I have a very good GRE Score.

Hey guys so I am doing a B.S in CS in US from a pretty decent university(not your MIT or Stanford but pretty good) I wanna look into doing a MSCS but I need some advice. I was always into competitive programming(CP) even though I am literal dogshit at it. Like I suck. I got even more excited to know that many people who do a decent job in CP tend to get into quite some good schools. I saw TopCoder Reds and Codechef reds and grandmasters of codeforces get into CMU, Stanford and all.

Recently I have lost my interest in CP due to well sucking at it. But I did realise it is a skill which would help me get into college. Its really been troubling me. I wanted to know if anyone here knows anyone or is anyone who got into a decent university without doing CP.

Now I know the standard ""Applications is more than just one EC"" or ""They look at you more than just what you do"" and all that but really. I have a very good GRE Score. I have had multiple internships and I even have some decent side projects done. Not to mention I also have 4.0 GPA and awesome LORs.

I am really concerned if something like CP makes a dent in my chances or not?

Any advice to make it more bearable?,Throwawayoftheday09,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/om4a7l/very_stressed_out_about_a_ton_of_issues_piling_up/,"So... I live in Europe and things are getting really stressful. Covid cases are rising violently because of government mistakes. My summer is looking to be lonelier than it already was because of that. That, and I'm worried that the vaccines and stuff won't be working well enough for the situation to become liveable again. Next, two friends of mine were supposed to come stay for a week, but because one of them suffered a concussion and still hasn't recovered enough, they called off two days ago. With that, my last hope of someone visiting is basically gone. 

At the same time, I'm also trying to apply for an internship. It takes a while lot of work and I got a lot done, but there's still a lot left to do. I've been procrastinating and suffering something like executive dysfunction over it for months. Since I wanna go abroad, I'm already late and it's made even worse by the covid problems and I have no idea if I can get the internship I want, let alone actually go to the office. I also have a few courses in college that I need to finish up. It's not required but it would be really dumb if I let go all the effort I've already put in go to waste.

Then there are there floods that happened just a stone's throw from where I'm currently living. They reawakened all my fears and despair about climate change... It's gotten me so down.

And the whole situation is just intensifying the loneliness I'm already experiencing. I hate that I have no one to talk to about it, especially not in real life. I have an online friend who isn't really taking much initiative to contact me anymore, and a few not very close friends who I can't really go to with this stuff. I'm so worried about never finding anyone because my current lifestyle just doesn't let me meet a whole lot of people, and other conditions make that I'm really bad at making friends and keeping them and being close with them... I tried to get psychological help but it didn't pan out after over two years and it's making me a little desperate.

I just really want to go on a little vacation with a close friend to a beautiful place and just enjoy the activities and each other's company and attention. That would really relieve a lot of my stress. But for all the reasons listed above that's not possible... No time, no friends, covid restrictions, ethical responsibilities and despair over all of them just getting worse instead of improving in the foreseeable future... Even if I'm doing something for myself, like doing a fun job around the house, or going for a hike I'm inevitably reminded of something I need to stress about... Could really use some advice calming down before I dive back head first into my internship prep work..."

I do know we're mainly supposed to focus on OOP, Data Structures, Algorithms and databases, but what resources do you guys recommend to study for them? Also, what kind of questions do they ask?

Lastly, any other tips? I haven't done any internships so far."
om83pv,2,2021-07-17,Confused between civil and mechanical,GuyFam783,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/om83pv/confused_between_civil_and_mechanical/,"Hey everyone, 

So I’ve been very stressed out for the last couple of weeks. I’m currently enrolled in industrial engineering but hate it. I thought I would be good at optimizing processes but i find it unfulfilling and boring. I want to do design work. I remember doing an engineering drafting class in community college and loved it. But when I was younger these guys like Matt Tran from engineered truth talked me out of it. Hate that guy. So I opted for industrial because even if engineering failed, it seemed that it was easy to get into other fields like business, supply chain, analytics, tech, etc. 

I realized now that I like math and science but I also love design. So I was thinking civil or mechanical.

Here’s my dilemma;

Mechanical seems to be much more difficult to get jobs. Many seem to be in manufacturing which I’m not interested in. I’m also not sure if I’d be interested in designing small components anyway. 

Civil is what I’m more inclined to. Designing buildings looks so cool and I’ve always been in love with skyscrapers since I was a kid. The long hours and negative things I’ve heard on Reddit kinda steered me away. But idk, maybe some of those just weren’t meant to do it. 

So if you’ve read this far, many of you are probably like ‘why is this even a question? Of course civil you moron.’ 

But here’s the problem after speaking to an advisor;

if I choose civil, there’s 2 classes I missed which are only offered in spring that are prerequisites for a lot of future civil classes. Which means I’ll be a year behind. Mechanical most classes are offered every semester. So I could still manage to finish by 2023 but that’s only if I skip internships and do summer classes. Civil would likely mean 2024 just cuz of those 2 stupid classes. But that also means a total 7 years of college which i feel embarrassed about and feel guilty for my dad (who’s super awesome for helping me pay for college) being upset about. 

My dads an immigrant business man and I guess a little more old school. His mindset is like just get a goddamn degree, and even if that fails I’ll help you get into business. He’s super supportive and I don’t want to be a shitty son. Oh and not only 7 years but I’ll be 26 when I graduate :(

I hope I can some input from any mechanical or civil guys and gals. Or really anyone tbf."

Even though I am a 3rd year CS student, I took programming seriously last year. Since then, I have done the following thing in order:

1. Learnt Python
2. Made projects in Python (Beginner)
3. Learnt C/C++ for interview questions
4. Started learning DSA
5. Failed miserably in solving questions in DSA
6. Took 3 months break from Python and DSA and did web / app dev (Did not like)
7. Started coding in Python again and made 1 project (intermediate) per week including a bot that joins my online classes and exits them automatically. I just have to run it in the morning and it will stop in the afternoon after my last class. I was almost suspended after my friends and many other students started using it.
8. Took 1-month break due to exams and GRE
9. Got a low score on GRE (307) and started coding again. Made 2 projects in C++ and Python
10. Did some miscellaneous stuff
11. Started applying for and attending interviews for internships. Read more about my post on [internships](https://www.reddit.com/r/indiasocial/comments/ojjhf8/how_tf_do_you_get_internships/)
12. Started cold calling companies but none gave me a chance since I don't know frontend or cloud. Seriously, there are many internship jobs for the front end. Like many!
13. Started preparing for AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (Will write at the end of August)
14. Attended more interviews but was rejected because most of the jobs are app/web dev related

I may have missed some points but the main idea is, I don't know which stream to pursue. I don't know what I am good at. I have to decide something fast as I have to attend related internship interviews and select colleges and courses based on the selected stream for grad studies. I have tried app/web dev (3 months) because there were many job postings for the front end. I hate the front end.

The point is, I suck at solving DSA, don't know what to do in the future, maybe programming is not for me. Maybe take up MBA and give up attending interviews."
om8uzv,2,2021-07-17,Looking to switch into CS: are front-end/back-end/full-stack only related to websites? Is the majority of the industry related to website development/maintenance?,Amun-Aion,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/om8uzv/looking_to_switch_into_cs_are/,"I'm a mechanical engineer looking to switch into a software engineering or at least more coding-heavy role.  I did a lot of coding in undergrad (did research in biosignal processing as well as biophysical simulations), and took a few CS courses (namely intro and Data Structures), but I was curious about what software engineers actually do.  As I was looking, front-end/back-end/full-stack kept turning up, but these all seem to be related to web/mobile application kind of things.  Is this correct, and is this what most people mean when they talk about software engineering? I'd be more interested in something applied in terms of working with the software side of hardware product applications.  Is coding for hardware typically only found in research / non-CS roles (i.e. if I want to work on a sensor that connects my gaze to my iPad or what have you, would this all be handled by the electrical/computer engineer working on it instead of having a dedicated software engineer)?

Following that, I hear a lot of securing an internship at FAANG/Microsoft/etc, but is everyone there mainly just working on website based applications? I've used AI/ML in work (albeit very topically), so I know that exists, I know a bit about data science and SQL, but I still don't know exactly what most software engineers do.  Would love to hear what everyone does in their day job!"

Anyways, this is my profile:

* Graduated in 3 years (not sure that matters, but just mentioning it here) with a 3.9+ GPA from Georgia Tech with a BSCS
* One CS internship at Amazon
* Now work full time at Amazon as an engineer

I have 0 research experience which I think will hurt me a lot of Stanford's program, and since I've graduated, I'm not sure who to get rec letters from? Anyways, Stanford's application closes in December, is that enough time to improve my apps? Any advice would be very helpful!"

I am currently a 3rd year uni student at decent uni in the US studying CS. While it's fairly well recognised in the states, it's not one of those top ranked CS school and when talking to ppl back home it seems most ppl doesn't really know it at all. I am also worried that foreign internships wouldn't really be considered in the best light (god knows this is true in the US, a lot of ppl doesn't care about anything that happened in Aus). 

Appreciate any thoughts, experiences etc.  Overall just seems like Aus would be a somewhat better place to live/work in."

I hope everyone is doing well. I'm in a bit of a sticky situation. I am a high school student, and a friend of mine came to me a couple of months ago with a business idea (I'm going to not really go into detail about this because of various reasons). And I was asked if I could go into business with him, this is due in part because I have a lot of experience in various programming languages and because this projects is 100% online he needed someone like me to basically do all of it. So, I've been working on this project a lot, I'd say over 400-500 hours in the span of 3-4 months. This was while I was in school and then while doing a separate internship. I am starting to get really scared that I will never get my stake in the company. As a ""Board Member"", I have been left in the dark about everything he has been doing to get us trademarked and getting us a license, even thought 95% percent of the company was created by me. As for my actual stake in the company, every time I bring it up to him, he makes another BS excuse to not talk about it. ""We will talk about it after the legal stuff is done"", ""Let's talk this weekend"" (makes another excuse that weekend). So on and so forth. I have told him I want a definite answer as to my stake in the company, I have even said I would take 20%. I really am scared that the project I have been working on will be completely taken, and I will be left with nothing. What do you suggest? Thank you so much!"

omp9j9,1,2021-07-18,Getting going again,nickvandrepol,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/omp9j9/getting_going_again/,"Hi everyone,

First a bit of a background: last year I graduated around June. From June to July I did some student work at the same start up I did my internship at. 

Around mid July I started to look for work, almost none stop except for 1 week of vacation in August. I managed to finally get a job around September (as a junior digital marketing consultant) in which I had to learn a lot of new things relatively quick to keep the job and be useful. The only things I knew were some bqsic digital marketing concepts because it didn't get a lot lf attention in my marketing bachelor. 

This jib unfortunately ended this year in February due to C. In this period I had a bit of vacation from 25th of December to 3th of January.

From February to around the end of April I was looking for a new job which I found in the beginning of May. I managed to convince them by telling them that I like to learn (which I really do) and they said that this convinced them to give me the job. They agreed to give me time to learn our CMS and some coding needed for my digital marketing job. 

Since then I was able to learn some things and show that I indeed have some things to offer to them aside from my limited experience.

Here comes the problem: I have a hard time learning new information about our CMS etc. It feels like I'm easily tired and distracted. This worries me cause I want to study and learn new things so that I can grow and keep my job. But I fear that I have maybe pushed myself to hard the past year and that I pay the price for it. 

Any advice on getting back in the saddle?"

omr9ra,121,2021-07-18,[GENERAL ADVICE] Big Fish in a Small Pond or Small Fish in a Big Pond?,mnist07,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/omr9ra/general_advice_big_fish_in_a_small_pond_or_small/,"**=== Story Time ===**

I always wanted to join a top-notch university for my undergrad. I had been dreaming about it since forever which soon turned into an unhealthy obsession. Being an Indian student, getting into one of the IITs meant everything. Amazing faculty, great environment and most importantly, the respect you get from everyone around you. I had done the hard work but unfortunately, like thousands of others, I couldn't make it. Anyhow, as things turned out, I joined a young and rather small university that nobody really knew about and for a very long time, I kept fantasizing how perfect life would have been in the IITs.

**=== End of Story ===**

Looking back, I thought about this question again - **was missing out on 'tier-1' institutes the worst thing ever or did it help me in getting where I wanted to be?** **Did attending a young, private university actually help me?**

**You see, all of us always keep obsessing over the big pond so much that we are okay being virtually non-existent in it and don't think the other way around.** 

Hence, in this post, I am sharing a few points about how staying in the small pond might actually benefit you. **If you didn't get into the college of your choice, this article is for you.**

&amp;#x200B;

* **Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish -** Being hungry can be one of the most influential factors in your journey. This can motivate you to do things you had never imagined. Going that extra mile for applying to internships, doing projects, approaching professors, etc can be game-changing and your hunger motivates you to do just that.
* **Not getting lost in the crowd** \- Bigger the university, the bigger the crowd and the easier it is to get lost in it. Many times, I used to be the first person from my university to do a certain thing (starting a club/ society, participating in a competition) and that used to give me a ton of motivation. Being part of a large crowd has its own benefits, but it can also make one feel like a nobody.
* ""***Everyone around me is so talented***"" - I have heard this phrase countless times from my friends going to big places. Top universities have this effect on students where almost all students feel that everyone except them is an overachiever. This feeling has prevented so many people from stepping out of their comfort zone. On the other hand, this won't be an inhibitor in the case of smaller universities.
* **Finding your own path** \- Being part of a small institution can force you to carve a path for yourself because of a lack of resources, networking opportunities, etc. This, in turn, can become one of the greatest learning experiences. For instance, starting the [Developers Student Club](https://developers.google.com/community/dsc) at my university taught me a lot about networking and the importance of the right mentorship.  
* **Stronger Relationships** \- Being part of a small community enabled me in developing better, stronger relationships with my professors. This not just helped in a better, more informed LoR but also provided the right guidance about so many things apart from just academics.

World-class institutions can offer you the best of opportunities and resources. If you get to attend them, that's amazing. But if you don't, that's not the end of the world.  Society constantly glamourizes certain aspects of life - getting a job in **FAANG companies** or the **Big 4**, getting into **IITs**, **Ivy-Leagues**, or the **Oxbridge**. But almost nobody talks about the fact that it is completely fine if you failed to do so.

Trust me, sometimes, being in a smaller pond is all you need.

I am a little sceptic about networking because most people I know who are from the industry doesn’t seem to help me idk why.

I know what I have to do, but because It also takes a while to get it right, I will procrastinate. 

This is just with my own project now. However, when doing an internship, school assignment or work in general I have to go longer. I can really get annoyed because I have to do it, but my brain says no, but I still have to do it. So the result is going all out in energy to meet their requirements while still having the feeling to get it over with as soon as possible.

 I wish I could just stop the feeling of wanting to do something else. But some things in coding are really tedious, especially because you know the solution already. You just have to do all the work to write it out."

This being late night, and full late night thoughts, I'd like to share about a girl (married now) who was so close to me, but unfortunately no sparks between us but we're still very, very close. 

Our story started in uni. We barely knew each other's existence during most of our uni years. But suddenly, came internship and both of us ended up in the same intern company, in the same department, and became work buddies. 

For some reason, we became very close during the internship. I didn't have luck with girls prior to that because girls find me creepy and weird, but not her -- okay, maybe she has her own quirkiness too. 

After internship, we went separate ways but kept in touch. Then my company has an opening, and she decided to join after I mentioned casually to her one day, so we became colleagues again. We became buddies at work again, but then went separate ways (again) after I moved on to a new job. 

How close are we? We went overseas together for a few times, we had lunch and dinner together almost daily before she got a boyfriend, we know each other's parents and siblings. Heck, she even brought me along when she went to shop for underwear…

Despite our closeness, we did had quite a number of arguments and ""cold wars"", mostly because of some silly things said or just because we sometimes lost patience on each other's weirdness. Fortunately, we were able to settle our differences. 

We also never had anything physical between us. We probably held hands once or twice in this so many years, but that's that, nothing else. We did crack dirty jokes every niw and then, but nothing more. 

While all these are going on, she was actually attached to someone else. And yeah, I admit that I was jealous because I have asked her if she'd want to be my gf a few times (during our first few years), but got rejected :( But even while she's attached, we're still close, but of course no more overseas trips / dinners, etc. 

After a few failed relationships, she saw me using Tinder (yah, still trying my luck -- I never got any successful matches) and decided to try out. She was successful matched to a guy, and they got married after two years. 

Her then-bf (now husband) knew about my existence, and he seemed to be okay with it (and we are friends because we happened to have common interests). After her marriage, I stepped back, and while we still meet every now and then, it is not as frequent as before. We still meet once in a while on birthdays, and for things like job promotions, increments where we treat the other for lunch or dinner. 

Now, she is happily married (I presume) and expecting her first child.  

I must admit that I was a bit sad when she showed me her BTO stuff, and did feel a bit lonely after she got married (I initially stayed away because I felt I need to maintain a respectable distance, but she said its okay, we can still meet for lunch/dinner). 

But I'm blessed that we're still good friends and still message each other once in a while just to check on each other, or ask for help/advices. 

That's basically my story. Do you have any stories to share?

Edit: 
To add-on a few things. She became that important person in my life because she's the first girl I met that can tolerate my weird shit. When I started working I went towards the ""dark"" side, spreading negativity at work and have very weird views on life. 

Any normal friend would have abandoned me and left me to my own devices. She didn't (despite having to hear all the complaints and bad words about me at work) and I was very thankful for that, because she knocked/talked some sense into me and took me back out of the dark side. 

Yes, I did ask her to be my gf a few times, but that was during the early days of internship and when we just started working. She did make it clear early on that we wouldn't last in a relationship, and after seeing her few failed relationships during those years… Heck, she's right! I slowly understood and made peace with this. 

If you ask me now, do I see her as a SO material, I'd say no after seeing and knowing her stories in her few relationships. There are some dealbreakers that I found out afterwards that I can't accept. 

As for now, I don't have any intention of going into a relationship and am quite content with the single life I'm living now -- less mental stress, have all the time (and money) to myself, less commitments to deal with, etc."

How do I make it happen?,pashaji,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/omufbb/21_f_and_desperately_want_to_buy_a_condo_within/,"-I currently make 52k/ year in my internship which will end April 2022. 
-I’ll be graduating in April 2022 with $25k in student loans
-Return offer is likely and I aim to negotiate or get a job that pays atleast 70k. I work in IT so it shouldn’t be that hard.
-I also live with my parents so no expenses besides  my mental peace and some subscriptions
-I have $20k saved up and am hoping to save atleast an additional $25k from this internship. 

I want to buy a condo in Mississauga. Is it correct to assume that I should have atleast $100k in down payment? I am trying to have as minimal interest as possible.

Should I be factoring in other costs like lawyers, fees, furniture, property tax etc? I mean is 100k enough or should I up my goal by $30-50k?

Is buying a condo a bad investment decision compared to buying houses(not that I’ll ever be able to afford them)? Do their prices appreciate like houses? 

Am I crazy to assume that if I work like crazy for the next two years (70-90k hopefully) salary and save up every dollar, then I should easily be able to put in a down payment? 

I’d just like some guidance towards this goal so I can start planning appropriately. My mom keeps trying to emotionally blackmail me into getting married, like I’m only 21 mom that’s basically a child bride geez. I’d really like to move out within the next two years. So before I embark on my journey to work my ass off and live off of canned food does anyone have any advice?"

At the time I did have one and so I answered yes. 

But it died a few weeks back and I'm struggling to find an alternative. 

Do I contact my workplace to inform them that I do not have a laptop now? What would be the best way to put it forward without sounding unprofessional?

Or should I come up with an alternative myself? I'm so worried, I'd appreciate any advice I can get on this. I'd hate to make a bad impression on my employers.

omvkoy,3,2021-07-18,Please Help Review my Applicability to Applying to Data Science Masters Program?,alchemicalchemist,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/omvkoy/please_help_review_my_applicability_to_applying/,"Hi all, 

I am writing this to get your input on trying to weigh my chances of being admitted to a Data Science masters program. For my undergraduate degree, I obtained it in Environmental Chemistry from a reputable  university-UofT-in Canada (although I’m not sure how much getting a degree a from big name university counts). 

During this time I’ve had some exposure to coding and data science, which really sparked my interest and got me very excited to pursue further studies in this field. Specifically, I was in a computational chemistry lab as an undergraduate RA, where I did a lot of work utilizing machine and deep learning as related to battery and solar cells research, which really got me hooked and made me seriously consider taking this further.

Additionally, I’m currently in the process of developing a multivariate regression model to predict certain physiochemical properties of pollutants in another lab. This second research project is in fact getting published; with the manuscript slated to get published in early September. This research that I am performing currently required me to apply a wide array of data science techniques, starting from obtaining data, populating and labelling the data in the data base, cleaning data, performing various exploratory data analysis, presenting the data, among a host of other things. It has also helped me sharpen my python and R coding skills as well.

I also held a one year internship at pharmaceutical company, involved in vaccine production - although I’m not too sure how this experience would translate as well to a Masters in DS (I did maintain and updated the chemicals inventory database and utilized the SAP software to some extent). 

I’m also well acquainted with some professors from my department, who I’m sure would provide me with good recommendations. 

My only drawback really is my cumulative GPA, which is a 2.94. I don’t claim to be an exceptional student but I’m neither a student my GPA makes me out to be. There were some rather challenging events that happened in my personal life during my second and third year, which detracted me from my academics. I know that GPA is not the make all or end all in the selection process but given that I’m applying to a program that’s not in line with what I’ve studied previously, I feel that the selection committees might give stronger attention to my GPA. I did however get stellar grades in my final year and my annual GPA is 3.75, which I’m hoping might sway the committees a little. 

I’m hoping that my data science focused research experiences and publication would allow to counter my GPA and allow me to get selected to a Data Science program. 

I would appreciate all of your inputs on my chances. If anyone else is also in the same boat (or want to just shoot the shit), please feel free to reach out to me. I’m starting to realize, applying to grad schools is a tough process and it would be a lot of helpful if we don’t have to do it all alone. 

Cheers!"

omx3pc,1115,2021-07-18,It's actually very difficult to get normal people into programming,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/omx3pc/its_actually_very_difficult_to_get_normal_people/,"See the meme often about how everyone is getting into coding, salaries won't stay this high, tech is a bubble, etc. Well, my experience is a bit different. I've had multiple people show interest in my work especially with my latest compensation level, work life balance, and great treatment by my employers. This is with people from different walks of life but my circle is generally younger (15-30). Some have careers they are unhappy with, some are younger folks still in school, some are actually even taking CS in school. It's incredibly difficult to get them motivated. 

Career switchers? Yeah, you take an afternoon to sit with some code with them or even just teach them the basics? They feel overwhelmed with even 4-5 lines of code. They get lost what is happening, start doubting if coding is for them and if they can do this. This is with them watching highly rated tutorials and me there 1 on 1 with them to ask questions or explain things. Unreal. These aren't even dumb people but smart people in their career for a few years or even just starting out their career. They'll then procrastinate the next lessons and well, that never gets anywhere. Like... am I just a bad teacher? But I've tried online tutorials to start with instead of me teaching too but the results are the same. We don't reach very far before it's over...

People in CS? Yeah, you tell them internships matter and if you can't get that, go do side projects to atleast keep your resume strong. Well, they'll get lazy and do other things instead. You just watch them burn away their time and become a weaker and weaker candidate. They don't seem to understand that getting an entry level job is probably the worst thing they'll ever go through in their career even if you emphasise it many times.


Younger kids still in school? Smart enough to know that most jobs nowadays do not pay a living wage. Aware enough to escape the whole ""follow your dreams and do something you love"" platitudes we had growing up. Not motivated at all to start some coding even if they want to go this career path as it's a bright future for them to pursue their hobbies or go for early retirement.


There's actually a bit of effort involved to learning and getting into tech but I can't seem to find anyone with that drive to do so. It's actually a bit demotivating and I don't know if I want to try helping anyone with advice or even teaching them in the future. You do need effort and drive but you honestly don't even need that much to succeed. I think going forward if more of these opportunities to help people come to me or I'm ever asked, I'll just smile and let it pass or say I am busy with other things."

I'm afraid to negotiate or seek more gainful employment, possibly because I don't want to lose again or risk too much.

 I have a mechanical engineering degree and it took me a year to find a gainful internship. During that year I worked for a professor at minimum wage and he acted as if he could fire me anytime. Then I worked in oilsands for 16 months but failed their internship review. Finished off my classes but due to some university policy they wouldn't sign my diploma for 8 months after classes ended. This made me ineligible for engineering jobs so I joined a friend's startup engineering firm. I was then at a tradeshow and got a job offer at a machine design firm. Since I was burned out and we lost a large client I took it. After two weeks the boss told me I was stupid and relegated me to night shift factory work. 5 months later I was fired. My friend gave my name to a company he was buying product from and they hired me as an applications support person.

They offered me a salary of 56k$ and told me they couldn't go higher because the job was entry level. I took it because I didn't know when the next opportunity would arrive and I was tired of job searching. 

I have 4-5 years of engineering experience yet I work an entry level job. Market research tells me I'm worth at least 70k but I've been mostly stuck on the lower end. 

I've contemplated switching jobs but don't want to end up in a bad situation and I don't know how much opportunity is out there. I want to ask for more at my performance review but don't want to set off alarm bells or become a cause for dismissal.

I have a new baby and wife with terminal cancer so I feel I can't risk much. 

I'm in Alberta (western Canada).

Tl;Dr I've had a poor history of gainful employment, and my current job greatly underpays me. I feel like I have too much to lose and fear another job search failure. How can I overcome this fear and is there opportunity for me?"

Background:

\- I am currently a data analyst, 2 years out of college with a degree in economics. 

Out of school, I worked for the company I was an intern for during college. It was a data analyst role and was my first introduction to data/analyics. I worked at that company for 10 months before moving to a new company. I moved because I was not getting paid fair market value for the skills I had developed, my commute was awful, and I was working more than 8 hours a day consistently. 

The new company I moved to (current company) I am doing similar things to my first role but I have dedicated the last year to upskilling to become a data engineer (outside of work). I have been at this current company for 1 year and 3 months. I am the most technically advanced on our team so I am not learning a lot during work time.

I was recently offered a great data engineering role. The pros are its what I want to be doing, new field to learn, new technologies to learn, significant pay increase, and two senior data engineers to learn from.

Is this switching too much two years out of school?

I would have had my first job for 8 months, the second job for 1 year 3 months, and then would already be on my third job.

This would be a job I would stay at for a long time (at least 3 years) as this is what I want to be doing and has new challenges.

Any thoughts would be helpful!"

I’m really nervous and excited about starting my internship at Amazon. I recently connected with my manager about my team and possible projects. It seems I’ll be working with customer engagement data, and providing visualizations and metrics to Amazon site sellers. It sounds pretty interesting and I’m excited to be able to learn and help out there. However, I’m pretty nervous about my technical skills (imposter syndrome probably ahah). My manager mentioned I would probably be working with SQL, Data warehouse, and AWS services like Redshift and QuickSight. I’ve just started researching those technologies, but if anyone could direct me to some resources that helped them with any of these concepts, it would be greatly appreciated. 

Honestly, end game, I am really hoping to work hard and showcase my skills at this position, so  I am able to get a return full-time offer. So if anyone has any tips on that end as well, in terms of things I should do to help me stand out and get a return offer, please let me know. 

I also wonder how the return offer process goes at Amazon. I heard that your manager will usually reach out to you like a week before your internship ends to let you know if you got a return offer or not. And I heard that to determine if you get a return offer or not, usually your manager and mentor meet with the bar raiser to see if you’re a good fit. But if anyone can shed light on that process as well, it would be very helpful. This is kinda a long winded post, but I guess I’m just really nervous and on the edge of wits for this internship, I really want to make sure I do well. Any advice is helpful, thanks!"

However, I do not really have any special projects or experiences from the last six months as you could imagine. I have a relatively solid understanding of python and c, and am working on java now. 

How feasible is it that I can get an internship for the summer of 2022 without a beefed up resume like so many of you have?"

Currently, I have an internship writing APIs for python which will be deployed on AWS (although I don't deal with the AWS part). Here's why I'm lost.


There's a lot of areas in software engineering, and I don't know where to start as my first job. Cloud computing engineer? Data analyst? Backend dev? I also don't know what's the current big trends that are likely to dominate for a while.


Here's my questions. How do I stay up to date with what the big trends are so I know if I should hop on to a new subfield in software engineering? And how can I know what options are available &amp; and gain the expertise to make the switch if needed in the middle of my career?


Also I don't know what I should be investing my time on. I mean, I'll practice leetcode no matter what, but there's so many fields and I don't know which ones I'll truly enjoy given my limited experience. Should I take courses &amp; do projects in data science so I can start with that? Continue taking my AWS solutions architect course to try landing something involving cloud computing? Each of these takes time and I don't want to invest a bunch of time on something only to find out it was pointless.


On top of all of that, I don't even know what opportunities I missed by not choosing a masters (e.g. parallel computing jobs require a masters).


I'd really appreciate anyone experienced who can lend some advice. Thanks!"

In college I took an internship a little bit out of my field of study. It’s a pretty analytical field that requires hard skills that aren’t associated with my degree, but I was hired regardless.

I ended up falling in love with the internship. Great manager/team, loved the work I was doing, and performed well. My company ended up hiring me part till I graduated, and offering a full time position upon graduation. 

I assumed in my full-time position I’d be doing something similar, or at least equally interesting, but that’s not the case. I should have asked more questions. I’ve been full-time for 6 months &amp; find my job incredibly boring. It doesn’t require any of the skills I picked up. 

I’m kind of itching to leave. I’m worried I’m losing the skills I gained, and this new position offers little room for growth/mobility, or even skills to put on my resume.

My hesitancy is that, this company is a great place to work. Fantastic benefits, positive work environment, and a great manager/team. Maybe I’m overthinking the skill level/boredom?

So my question, do you think my reason are valid to leave so soon? In total, I’ve worked here 13 months, but full time only 6. 

Thanks for your help!"
on496l,1,2021-07-18,Which of these two academic tracks fits my career goals better ?,Erilaz_Of_Heruli,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/on496l/which_of_these_two_academic_tracks_fits_my_career/,"So, this year my school offers two academic tracks, which I'll detail below. My current career goals are to break into AM or ER (my end goal currently being AM, but I have heard it's a tough industry to break into, therefore I'm hedging my bets by also looking for opportunities in ER, which I've read is a nice stepping stone for a career in investing.)

The two tracks are:


**Corporate Finance &amp; Innovation**

Core Courses

*     Financial structuring
*     Leverage finance
*     Fixed income
*     Corporate valuation
*     M&amp;A
*     Business Negotiation
*     Fundraising and market operations
*     IR and financial communication

Options

*     Innovation in finance &amp; venture capital
*     Advanced financial products
*     Governance and SRI
*     Advanced accounting

**Market &amp; Quantitative Finance**

Core Courses

*     Advanced fixed income
*     Advanced statistics
*     Alternative investments
*     Trading and pricing of derivatives
*     Risk Management
*     Portfolio management

 

Options

*     Programs and machine learning
*     Innovation in finance &amp; venture capital
*     Governance and SRI
*     Financial structuring
*     Leverage finance
*     Fundraising and market operations


At first I thought the quant track was the obvious choice since it seems to deal with investment topics a whole lot more than the corporate finance track. However, an alumni who managed to get into a summer internship at a BB recommended me corporate finance to get into ER, since according to him being able to analyze a company's financial statements and do valuations, as well as the investor relations course, are more relevant to that sector.

So I'm kinda split, still leaning towards quant finance but I'd like to hear the opinion of people on this board, any insight is appreciated."

I am a sophomore computer science student in the US. I am an international student here and I changed my major and my school which added more prerequisites on my curriculum. I completed an introduction and a data structures class + a C# class so far and I still need to complete more classes (which will cost like 3 more years to me). Even with this small course load, I completed 2 group projects (one in a game development club and another one with the bunch of students from my school which I was the lead). I also completed 6 hackhatons (4 of them were Windows 10 and 2 of them were web applications. I have also completed more than 10 personal projects. When I was building those projects I primarily used C# then Java then HTML/CSS and JavaScript skills. I am also learning C++ (and expecting to develop UWP applications with it). After completing more of this stuff I am planning to create myself a portfolio website and a nice resume with advices from people who are already working in the industry. However, I am a bit sceptical about finding an internship because I have three more years to graduate, haven’t completed 200 level CS classes and most importantly due to pandemic it was hard to network with people where I could have give my resume to them and they could have give to HR. I applied two internships and got rejected (one was due to my graduation year and the other one was due to my school’s internship policy). Under these circumstances what would you recommend to increase my likelihood of getting internship?"

I decided the next step I should take in my life would be to get an apartment, a job, and attend a university full time. Never had any opportunities for scholarships or grants, so I’ve had to take out student loans and pay everything else out of pocket. Working while attending school wasn’t something new to me, I had done it all throughout high school and through my associates degree. Once I had a job near my new university I also found a good apartment that charged $600/month, utilities and all, only catch was that I had to have 3 other roommates. So I sucked it up and went with it, everything was going smoothly with school and work. I was making A’s and B’s in all my classes for 3/4 of my first semester there. Then the corona virus outbreak occurred. The school went to strictly online. I do not do well with online classes, so my A’s and B’s literally drop to C’s and D’s the last month of the semester. This of course put a pause on me doing any internships the following summer, like I had planned. This also didn’t help motivate me to do well in class. The following semester I decided to retake a couple of the classes I failed and add in two more engineering classes (had to have 5 to remain full-time in order to take out student loans) hoping I could do better and bring my gpa closer to a 3.0. The school did allow hybrid classes to take place, so I had a bit of a mix of hybrid and online classes. The issues with the hybrid classes is that the professors still weren’t accustomed to doing hybrid classes and this only put more stress and complications on other students, including myself. It also didn’t help that I had to work full-time and school full-time. I was slowly losing motivation to do anything.  Even though I enjoy engineering and putting in the work, that type of environment wasn’t suitable for me. Needless to say I did fail most classes that semester. It has been almost 7 months since I’ve been out of college and I really want to continue my college career to become an engineer someday. So I’m turning to the U.S. military to hopefully give me a chance to catch up in life and to help me start college again. I will hopefully leave for BMT in the next few months and be able to pick college back up by next fall. In the mean time I’ve been teaching myself the classes I failed and going at a decent pace with it instead of being forced to rush through the books without learning the subjects for long term use. I hope the route I have chosen will lead me to were I need to be in life, I am currently 25 and will hopefully have my BA in mechanical engineering by the time I turn 30. What are some of y’all’s opinions on this subject? Not looking for pity or anything of the sort, just really wanted to kind of log my story so far."

Ever since the pandemic started, I (30M) have experienced a lot of ups and downs. In the first lockdown in my country, I was still excited about the possibilities that I could spend more time by myself and reinvigorate my book writing, painting, etc. Within the first two lockdowns, I also dated a ton, until I met my current sweet and wonderful GF (27F). I got to go out my administrative dead-end job for a while by doing a UX Internship at a different department. Life looked pretty good and I was really looking forward to what the future would hold.

Unfortunately, it's been a while since I felt super alive and enjoy what I am doing and experiencing. The UX internship ended 2 months early because they didn't think I was on level yet. I have been feeling stuck in my administrative job since I had to go back and I have been applying for jobs ever since. My GF is fantastic and I enjoy being with her and I can honestly say that I love her now that we know each other for a year. It's just that things have been feeling off and I am not on that pink cloud the entire time anymore. I spend so much time by myself at home that I sometimes honestly think that this is my destiny and I'll never get out of this situation.

I go to the gym at least 2-3 times per week, eat healthy and try to get enough walking and steps done every day. My parents are in good health and I love them, I have a great group of friends around me, I have a holiday to look forward to and I have ambition and am in a good financial position. I have therapy since 2 years. But it just doesn't feel that I'm progressing in life and it somehow hasn't since the internship ended. 

Somehow I always start my day browsing my phone, which is the worst habit that I've had for about a year now and I always tend to see things more grey and heavy than they actually are. I feel like some of the days where I pull myself out of bed are some of the heaviest days where I just don't want to do anything and I feel like I'm running on empty for the last couple of months.

I am really looking forward to spending the holiday with my GF and 2 of her best friends, but feel some dread for the period afterwards where I feel it won't change. My GF is also going to work abroad for half a year (which I am really, really happy and excited for her) which might give me some space and time to think as well.

I feel stuck and I don't really know how to get out of this situation and back to my old, happy, fulfilled, full of energy self. Looking for advice."

ongotc,7,2021-07-19,I don't want to go to med school anymore and I've been accepted to OMSCS for Fall 2021. Is this program right for me ?,iamthat1dude,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/ongotc/i_dont_want_to_go_to_med_school_anymore_and_ive/,"To give you some background, I'm a recent biology grad from the Bay Area who took most of the major CS lower division courses (OOP, DS&amp;A, discrete math, linear algebra, calculus). I used to be a bioengineering major so I have alot of the math coursework done as well as engineering physics.

**My main goal is to try to break into the industry in the least amount of time possible while still getting a strong foundation in CS and software engineering.**

I currently work as a part-time medical assistant so I have around 8 hours during the weekdays to focus on building my skills and portfolio. I've already been accepted to OMSCS for the fall but I am thinking of applying to some others that are on-campus since one of the issues it seems like with OMSCS is that I am limited to companies that don't have a restriction for part-time students. I'm not sure which companies have this requirement but I'm scared it will limit my job hunt.

I'm not sure if I am putting myself at disadvantage by not applying to others masters programs considering that they might possibly land me better opportunities (interviews at high growth startups or big tech companies) but these programs will probably be much more expensive. The main schools I am looking at right now are **Cornell, UPenn, UC Irvine, UCLA, UCSD, and USC.** 

I understand these programs are much more competitive but I believe I have a shot given the coursework I've already taken and the LORs I've been able to get. The one thing I do lack is experience in the actual industry.

Some of these programs are 1 or 2 years and the main issue is that I would be starting in Fall 2022 for a majority of them instead of enrolling in OMSCS for Fall 2021. I would essentially be waiting a year for my decision from these schools to come back. The other annoying obstacle I have to go through is taking the GRE but I've already been studying for the MCAT so the GRE shouldn't be that bad imo.

I would really appreciate any advice from you guys but the two options I am looking at right now are:

1. Enroll in OMSCS in Fall 2021 and work towards getting an internship or FT offer. I would **graduate Spring 2023**.
2. Apply to in-person masters program for Fall 2022. Work on side projects and try to get a job w/o a CS degree while I wait for schools to get back to me. Enroll in an in-person masters program in the case that I'm unable to get a job in tech. Graduate with a FT offer or internship by **Spring 2023 or Spring 2024.** 

**TLDR: Should I enroll in OMSCS Fall 2022 or apply to ""more prestigious"" on-campus masters programs for Fall 2023 and work on side-projects / interview prep while waiting for school decisions to get back to me?**"

Here is the seventy-third installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

onigb0,0,2021-07-19,Can you please review my profile for grad schools?,ashwin142k,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/onigb0/can_you_please_review_my_profile_for_grad_schools/," 

Hi, I'm currently in my 3rd year of UG and planning to give GRE in 10 days. Assuming that I will get 315 (at least 160 in quants), what are my chances to get into top universities like UCLA, UC San Diego, and universities alike for MS IN CS program? Here is my extracurricular profile and qualifications.

my\_qualifications :

* I worked as a summer intern in Zoho(Machine learning) and BSNL
* CGPA (as of the 6th semester) is 8.2
* Have won around 6 hackathons
* Have around 5 big projects, that literally qualify as final year project (ML, AI, smart systems based)
* Have worked in ML, AI, Fullstack and mobile computing
* Currently working on a Linux-based Operating system (like chrome OS and Steam OS) for my final year project (it is used for a very specific purpose).
* Have published a conference paper that is both IEEE Xplore and Scopus indexed
* Did several online courses on AI, ML, Matlab, etc.
* Attempted in creating a self-driving car using ROS, YOLO, etc. (failed because of lack of resources and covid)
* Vice-chairperson of IEEE Computer Society Student Branch Chapter
* Worked part-time in an IIM Startup."
onin84,1,2021-07-19,Wanting a career change before my career even starts,eassa189,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/onin84/wanting_a_career_change_before_my_career_even/,"TLDR - Soon to be masters graduate in mechanical engineering. But don't like this career path anymore and thinking of changing. Should I apply for grad schemes that are Mech Eng or not even if I don't think i want to be one anymore

I'm finishing my masters in mechanical engineering (no idea why i stayed this long lol) and since last year I've had this massive urge to just switch up career paths.

I just don't enjoy it anymore and I've already forgotten basic concepts that I don't care to learn unless they come up again and they are screwing with my success. I was an intern for a year and everything was fine until I was doing some actual Mech Eng stuff where I felt useless and couldn't give the same output as the other interns. To the point that my higher ups seemed annoyed with me and then gave me really easy jobs. During this time I'd get that sinking chest anxiety feeling and just hated coming into work.  I mean, I get that Mech Eng is a huge topic but I really don't know where I can fit in, unless I could specialise in something (which, in hindsight I realise I should've done during my studies)

Now, I understand that the grass is always greener on the other side but I don't even know what I would want to do career wise if not this. I'm an extremely passive person and I think that's my main problem and should be improving myself in that regard first.

I guess what I'm asking is should I change my career paths now i.e. focus on Grad schemes that are out with the Mech Eng industry such as Data analysis, or computing engineering?. Or, do a grad scheme in Mech Eng, if I don't enjoy it I can spend time finding out what job I really want, learn the skills for that job and networking my way to that job? (both these scenarios are assuming I even get a grad scheme in this dog s\*\*t economy in the first place)"
onirko,4,2021-07-19,Is IT Help Desk useless for an IT Business Analyst role? Did I make a mistake?,Solid-Change-1475,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/onirko/is_it_help_desk_useless_for_an_it_business/,"To preface, I have a Bachelor's in Computer's and Information Technology, however my university offered specialized tracks, and I chose the system analysis path. Basically, all throughout my education I learned the basics of SQL, use cases, UML diagrams, business requirements gathering, as well as some fundamental coding in JAVA and C. I assume these are business analyst/system analyst related topics. My resume is filled with class projects relating to BA/System Analysis too, and I did the ECBA (Entry Certificate in BA) while I was in school too.

However, I did not manage to procure an internship while I was in school. Probably mostly due to complacency/anxiety, bad interview skills, and perhaps some bad luck. I am now in a much better mental state regarding interviews. I realized most Business Analyst roles require 1-3 years of experience, which I did not have (I just recently found out that I shouldn't have been discouraged by this and should've applied anyway).

In order to gain experience, I thought the logical thing to do was to start from the ground up at an entry level Help Desk role. From what I gathered, this is the de-facto entry level job in the IT field, so I went with it. The next few months after graduating, I did my CompTIA A+, and managed to land a temporary Service Desk Technician role, lasting 1 year. I start this job pretty soon.

I am grateful for any experience I can get, but I then realized that this may not help me directly for a career as a Business Analyst. I don't want to be pigeon-holed into a technical role in the future as well, as this isn't really what I signed up for when I decided on my degree. But what else could I do with no professional experience? Would this IT Help Desk role even count as experience if I were to apply to a BA role? I'm hoping my degree will still help me somewhat in the future."

I am currently preparing to apply for graduate schools for the Fall 2022 cycle for a masters in CS; I will be taking the GRE mid July so my scores are TBD; I am definitely aiming for a full score in the quantitative section. The schools I am looking at applying are UT Austin, UIUC, CMU, USC and Stanford. I am currently attending Texas A&amp;M and have a 3.97 GPA: my major is in Computer Science with minors in Mathematics and Statistics. I have two internships, both from financial institutions, and am working on a research project. Do you think these schools would be too hard for me to get into? I am open to any advice and suggestions. Thank you in advance!"

I've been applying to internships for 2 years now and haven't gotten past an initial screening. Right now I have one place that's giving me a test on a technology that I haven't used before, and I'm not confident that I'll get it, or that if I do, it's not going to go well because I don't know the technology. It's also unpaid, and I need to support my wife so we can get into a new apartment. We ran out of money and are moving into my parent's place next month. I really want to get into software and actually get my degree and start my career, but I feel like I'm just not going to be taken by anyone. I feel like all of the jobs I've seen require workplace experience that I don't have, and I'm running out of time before I have to settle on some other job to pay the bills, and basically give up on the internship altogether. Has anyone experienced this? Does this eventually click? Am I getting unlucky with my applications?"

2.) If tryhackme is not a good learning platform what would be a good platform to learn?

3.) Is cyberstart America a good learning platform?

4.) Would learning C before C++ make learning C++ easier?

5.) What are some easy to obtain certs that are widely recognized?

6.) Is there any internships, apprenticeships, job shadowing programs, or fellowships for people at the age of 16 or younger?

7.) Do you think that the cybersec, or the intelligence &amp; national security summer programs by the NLSC are good?

8.) Are there any solo ctf or smth else competitions that employers would be looking for talent?

9.) Is it just because I am inexperienced that I think certain learning sites such as tryhackme and cyberstart America would not transfer into real life, because how it's all layed out unlike if you are trying to hack into a website or program?

10.) Could someone create a virtual machine using a spare computer or do you need a server? If you need a server what parts would someone need to create one a budget, or is it easier to buy a pre-made server if so what servers would you recommend?

11.) Is the ""C programming language for the absolute beginner, third edition"" a good book?

12.) Is ""the C++ programming language special edition by Bjarne Stroustrup"" the creator of C++ a good book?

I need to have my plans finalized by early August, so when should I expect more responses?"
onmbyn,1,2021-07-19,Seeking advice on my College path. I need to choose between a Computer engineering Diploma and then Degree or 11th and 12th and then degree. I'm confused and need some guidance.,Myth2156,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/onmbyn/seeking_advice_on_my_college_path_i_need_to/,"I passed 10th this year, and I'm debating if I should do a diploma or do 11th and 12th before I go for a Degree.

Im planning to become a Network engineer.

The Info I found online mostly says:-

Diploma pros:-

1)More practical knowledge 

2)More industry related knowledge

3)Won't have to study unrelated subjects like Chemistry, Physics, Biology and geography.

4) Will get admission directly in 2nd year for degree

5) can get internships early to get some experience and build up resume.

Diploma cons:-

1) Math syllabus is less compared to 11th and 12th, so may have problems in math when I start 2nd year of degree.

2) Apparently there are less admissions or 'seats' for diploma students when starting to study for a degree.

11th and 12th Pros:-

1) Better math syllabus so less likely to suffer in maths when starting for degree.

2)12th clear students have more admissions or 'seats' when starting for a degree.

11th and 12th Cons:-

1) I'll have to study unrelated subjects like Chem, Physics, Geograpy and etc.


Btw when I'm doing 11th and 12th OR a diploma in Computer engineering, I'm also planning to study for CCNA and clear it hopefully in around 6 months or a Year (from what I've read CCNA normally takes about 6 months but since I'll be studying for diploma or 11th/12th it will take more time)

If I choose to do 11th and 12th it will be harder to do CCNA.

Are there any things I'm missing? Would appreciate some advice"
onmznc,2,2021-07-19,Seeking Guidance - Breaking into the Cybersecurity Field,skylerwastaken,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/onmznc/seeking_guidance_breaking_into_the_cybersecurity/,"Hi Everyone,

This is my first time posting in here, but you all seem quite helpful, so I thought I’d give it a whirl.

I’m trying to break into IT (ideally Cybersecurity, but I realize I need to work my way up.)

Here’s what I’ve done to date:

Bachelors in Cybersecurity 
Sec+ SYO-601 Cert
Cybersecurity Analyst Internship
Mentoring from Cybersecurity Head at NIST regarding my path
Mentoring from LinkedIn IT Contacts regarding my path, my resume and my LI Profile

Here’s what I am currently working on:

Pentesting Workshop from Cover6 Solutions
Penetration Testing Student Course from INE
Red Team Training Scholarship from ICMCP/Google
Created profiles on Dice, LinkedIn, Glassdoor and ZipRecruiter.

Here’s my professional background:

Worked 16 years in accounting, left to take the  full time job I have now in software implementation and support (been here since 2016.) Job duties range from training and supporting clients to building an entire online university for our clients to use.

I also realized I needed to beef up my hands on experience, so I’ve been working part time after hours 9-3am for a university as IT Support. I was initially thinking that this job, paired with my Sec+ cert would open additional job opportunity doors for me, allowing me to leave the full time job and accept a full time IT position. However, the biggest activity I’ve seen thus far is Help Desk, which I already do part time - I wouldn’t be able to work the help desk full time and leave the part time job at the pay rates that are offered for help desk positions. 

I’m struggling with extreme burnout (no shock here) and I’ve been thinking about leaving the part time IT Support job. However, I worry that if I do so before I get an IT job, the experience will be rendered useless from my resume standpoint, because then there will be a break between my on the job IT experience.

Before I doing anything drastic like leaving the part time job, I wanted to reach out and see if anyone had ideas on something different I could try? I think I’m on the right track, but it always helps to get input from others who are actually working in IT.

Thanks!"

for reference, my company is 1000+ ppl dealing w/ heavy emphasis on content creation and advertising. not a huge name but good sized impact on the internet, but very heavy tech emphasis

things I've liked:

* fantastic team - very responsive to all my questions, very kind, always open to work, etc.
* great culture - very 9-5 job, every other Friday off, very open about feedback and reviews
* diversity - sticking point for some, but from what I can tell the company has put lots of effort into hiring diverse teams over the past few years which really makes a more comfortable environment for me

things I'm neutral about:

* not a huge fan of the tech stack - mostly Go, legacy C#, and AWS. AWS is fine, but I haven't used Go before this and I haven't loved learning it. it;

things I haven't liked:

* not a fan of what the team does - I am on a developer experience team (makes stuff for internal use like HR, maintains employee records and related apps, etc.). don't find the work engaging at either content or tech wise which is something I value
   * I was placed here, didn't have a say or know until right before starting
   * ""full stack work"" technically, but I have never done front end and made it clear during my interviews that I didn't like front end - but half of what the team does is front end lol
* feel like my team has struggled to find me work - only have done 3-4 things in the 6 weeks I've been here, constantly felt not challenged and bored outside of reading docs on something new
   * the team has mostly been on support for the past couple weeks for a major project launch so I feel like I've been sidelined a little bit 
   * my mentors are aware of this and I've consistently (but politely) let them know, but they still haven't done much :&lt;

this is mostly just a vent about stuff, so obviously I'm biased. my manager has been happy with my work so far though, so idk if my expectations are too high or what 

I just feel like haven't gotten what I want out of this internship (aside from the team and $$) - worried it'll hurt new grad chances for roles I actually want :\[

love to hear from you guys!"
onnf2g,1,2021-07-19,career path and language selection,momentumbuyer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/onnf2g/career_path_and_language_selection/,"hi there,

I'm a UK grad with a BA in an arts subject. After taking CS50 I realised I loved programming and would very much like to make a career out of it - I'm going to spend this year doing courses, learning a language and doing some personal projects. I am considering either just completely self-teaching or possibly enrolling into Launch School as their mastery-based system really appeals to me - however, my only reservation is their use of Ruby/JavaScript rather than a language like C++, Java etc.

I am not especially creative but enjoy problem solving, maths and logic so feel I'd prefer to work in backend/software dev/cyber security rather than becoming a frontend web dev (also I've heard the industry is saturated with recent web dev bootcamp grads). Working at a FAANG/Big-N type company or on a cybersecurity red team (as a penetration tester) is probably my ultimate goal, although these are obviously much easier said than done - I have no internships or experience or even a LinkedIn so my chances of getting any kind of job are clearly years away.

Can anyone offer their advice on whether learning JavaScript/Ruby first could hinder my future career chances, specifically for backend/cyber security jobs? What programming language would you recommend to start learning for these fields? If you have experience of Launch School, what did you think, and would you recommend it vs a masters? 

I know once I've learnt one language i can apply my skills more easily to others, but would like to spend a year or two getting very good at one or two before I branch out, so your advice would be very much appreciated. Any opinions on Launch School would also be great - pretty much everything I can find about it is positive, and I'm attracted by their mastery-based system, but outside opinions are always good. I had considered teaching myself this year then doing a Masters in CS, but I'd rather get a more practical education than one that focuses mainly on theory. Let me know what you think..

Thank you !"

I am already applying to everything i find online that I fit the admissions criteria and I am also planning on calling local software development firms and asking if I can intern or shadow a software engineer/developer?

Essays: Pretty solid writer so we’ll see, I’m nothing special though. I have some good experiences with physics when it came to building my accelerator, so I’ll probably talk about that in topics like “why our school”

Load that into some database like SQL. Then create some graphs to visualize the difference in the weather in a year. What the average temp was last year vs now.

ont42d,1,2021-07-19,"I'm stuck on a ""vacation"" for a week that makes me miserable.",Doctor_Pep,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/ont42d/im_stuck_on_a_vacation_for_a_week_that_makes_me/,"So I know your first thought it ""be grateful you're on vacation"", and I fully understand that, but just hear me out on this. 

So for much of my life I have been a competitive rifle shooter. Since middle school I was training to go D1 NCAA for rifle. So for every summer I would spent up to 3 weeks away from home shooting in the national matches or a development camp, often in Ohio or Indiana, so about 10-12 hours away from home. I eventually got into college and after my second year I realized I lost my passion for rifle entirely, and after a lot of fighting with my parents quit the NCAA team. There were many reasons for this, but loss of passion was one of if not the biggest reason. I continued shooting on the club team, which I enjoyed but not for the shooting but for the people on the team. 

I will be officially graduating in August, but for all intents and purposes I am graduated. So I really won't be shooting much anymore, if at all. And I'm totally fine with that. My dad however, still LOVES going to the national matches. But he was never a shooter, he would always bring my sister and I out for it and it would be his vacation while we did all the shooting in the matches and the training camps. 

A few years back, this was all well and good. Even if I hated waking up super early and the long days in the hot sun, or the pouring rain it was always worth it because I loved to compete, I had been a finalist a few times, and my states team actually beat one of the US army teams once (who are one of the top in the world). On top of that I would hang out with the other shooters around my age from my state team doing go karting and stuff. 

But now, I'm 22 years old, none of my college's club team are out here, the state team is made up of kids significantly younger than me, and I just don't have the drive to shoot anymore. 

The area we stay is actually a vacation town, but it's a vacation town in Ohio on Lake Erie. There are some things to do that I enjoy, stuff like go karts and mini golf, but like I said no one around my age is here. The rest of the town is just bars and music, not my scene really. The food is all the same everywhere you go, different things fried or grilled. If anyone's ever lived in a place like NYC, and then somewhere in the Midwest you'd understand what I mean by the lack of variety. Best way to put it is that it's an old peoples vacation town. Everyone knows each other, hell everyone knows my dad. My dad loves this place to no end, and that's why I'm here. I'm truly trying my best to enjoy the stuff that he's planning for us, but I'm just miserable. We went to a small island filled with bars and restaurants today and we got to fly in a helicopter which was AWESOME... but the rest of the day was spent driving around in a golf cart looking at the beach houses, or sitting at a bar drinking a 42oz margarita. The hotel has always been decent, and we get the special room that's closer to an apartment than anything else. 2 bedrooms, and a kitchen. It's run down, but it's nice and clean. The problem is the showers are horrible. They're the square stand up ones, which you never really get clean in, and it's doubly bad because the shower heads point at too high of an angle, so good luck cleaning anything below your neck.

I knew this wouldn't be great. I knew I didn't want to shoot, and that I would be bored out of my mind. I thought maybe I'd get some enjoyment out of it now that I can drink at the bars, but how much fun is it really to drink at a bar with your dad?

I appreciate all my dad is doing to make this a fun trip for me, but I just can't get into it at all. I've never been a drinker, or a beach goer. There's an amusement park nearby but A) Not really any time to do it B) We ARE going to Florida next month to visit my grandfather who I haven't seen in years because of covid, and that includes a stop at Disney. That, I am SUPREMELY excited for because I haven't been there since I was a little kid and I love star wars so I can't wait to do all that. But for now I'm stuck here in a meh hotel in an old person's vacation town for a week of doing something I don't want to do. 

TLDR; Pretty much, I got dragged out to a rifle match for a week, something I used to enjoy but grew to hate over YEARS of grinding and orienting my life around it. The town we stay in is an old person's vacation town. Everyone here is either too old, or too young for me. The thing that made this trip fun for all of those years, the kids around my age, is gone.

To start off I just recently graduated with a B.S in Computer Science and even got Magna Cum Laude for honors. I've been applying around since May and have had 8 technical interviews since then with one offer from a startup that would have paid close to minimum wage for a software developer position. 

During my senior year I had a capstone project with a startup that I've been using as internship experience since it was working directly with a team for another company when the class was merely there for credit. 

I've also done a few projects on the side that were more functional programming that I've been slowly making them more object oriented to better maintain.

Each interview I evaluate and figure out what I need to work on, flashcard study for oop concepts for java/c# interviews, leetcode, and just mock interviewing one leetcode or with a buddy. 

I guess I'm really looking for what I could be doing more or what I should be focusing on more. And if anyone was in a similar boat to me, what was what got them into their engineering position out of Uni."

We are just 4 employees currently and I’m the only person in DS, having set up everything data related which is crucial to their business. They also might get ~$20 million in funding in the next three months (have a term sheet with an investor if goals are achieved)

The founder asks me to drop of college and join his startup as the Data Science Lead (6 figure salary) after my internship.
I don’t know if I should leave college having made it so far ahead and putting so much work into my degree.

Since I have said no to him as of now, they are looking to hire someone to replace me as the Lead DS and another data scientist after my tenure ends.

I haven’t talked to him about doing part-time with him during my senior year or about an offer for next year (when I graduate). 

What should I do?

P.S. I’m an international student and dropping out of college means Ill lose my student visa and have to apply for H1B to work (which depends on luck)

Also I love working with the people, they're all super friendly and nice."

onwwcy,68,2021-07-20,Intern imposter syndrome,dmrudit,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/onwwcy/intern_imposter_syndrome/," Hello everyone! I apologize for the informal post in advance.i was wondering if I could ask for some advice. A little background, I am incoming senior at a university with a decent business program and have been fortunate enough to have had a couple of internship experiences. The problem is that I don't feel like I know anything. I always do the work that is asked of me and try to learn as much as I can during my internships but I feel like I know nothing and I'm not good enough. I see the way other people my age speak and the things they do and it makes me feel like I'm not doing enough or straight up stupid since I'm not doing similar things.

 At my first internship, I was working at a big 6 accounting firm during busy season. I was doing all the work assigned to me and trying to learn as I go ( it's hard since there's always deadline and everyone is trying to get thing done for clients ASAP). I didn't feel like I was learning anything. I was just looking at PY templates and trying to look for irregularities. Is that how it is in the real world? IsHow do I learn how they made those calculation? Why are we picking these specific accounts? I felt like everyone but me knows these things. These things weren't taught to me in school and I don't know where to go to ask. 

And now I'm at my second internship and  I'm doing something similar. I thought that since this is an internship within a company instead at a firm, things would be different. And I was right. That there was more room for me to learn and grow, which is true but not in the way that I thought. I am doing new work but it's still following templates. I don't feel like I've learned enough to be independent on my own. Like I understand all my assignments and do them on my own with minimal oversight. But I don't feel like someone can ask me to do an audit and I can make my own template and gather all the numbers and ask all the right questions on my own. 
 
   Is that normal for an intern? Do I have unrealistic expectations for myself? I'm starting to feel that I'm not ready to go out into the real world. I always do my best and ask questions. I never have complaints from my manager and have also been offered a full time positions, but I feel like I don't know any. There's a big difference between what I'm taught in school and what I do. And what I do feels like more general things that can be taught to anyone since it's just using templates from PY. Is that normal for accounting/finance jobs? Am I being hard on myself or am I right to feel this way?"

**Letters of Recommendation**

Idk how people rate these without having seen them lol. One from my geology/astrophysics/physics teacher who's the best and one from my fav english teacher. I'd bet they were good but i never saw them so i don't really know. Supplementary LOR from CTO of the startup I intern for. I actually saw it and i'd say it was pretty good but IDK really lol

**Interviews**

Barely remember my interviews tbh but ig the one takeaway is that they didn't seem to correlate w/ acceptances. My Princeton and MIT interviews were great and I got rejected whereas my Stanford interview was 20 minutes but that was the one that worked out?

**Essays**

I mean again no way to evaluate these for sure lol but I think they were pretty good. I spent a lot of times on the HYPSM ones and less on the others, but that might just be because they had fewer questions. My CC seemed to like my supplementary essays tho for the most part but got conflicting opinions on the personal statement. Personal statement focused on interdisciplinary connections and how that inspires me to not be complacent in my understanding, i.e. a project I did applying machine learning to music. Looking back on it it was a bit scattered tbh. It could just be coincidence but even before I got results back I always thought my Stanford supplements were the best.

**Decisions** 

*Acceptances:*

* *Stanford University (Deferred REA -&gt; Accepted RD)*
* *Williams College (RD)*
* *Amherst College (RD, legacy)*
* *Georgia Tech (EA)*
* *Middlebury (RD)*

*Waitlists:*

* *Swarthmore (RD)*
* *Harvard (RD)*
* *UChicago (RD)*
* *Case Western (RD)*
* *Wash U (RD)*

Ended up turning down my spot on all the waitlists

*Rejections:*

* *MIT (RD)*
* *Princeton (RD)*
* *Yale (RD)*
* \*UT Austin (Early) (\*In state, non auto admit cause private school. Technically got CAP but that's closest to a rejection IMO)
* *Tufts (RD)*
* *Harvey Mudd (RD)*

**Additional Information:**

Linked my Github which has all of my CS projects and a presentation I gave on a large CS project in the adtl info section.

Committed to Stanford! Getting deferred REA meant it was a super long wait lmao. It was my first and last college decision.... but sometimes I can get lucky IG :) Probably would have committed to Williams if Stanford hadn't worked out, the people there seem really great (admission office included) so shout out to them."

I went through an entire interview process for a company with my research interests but I was turned down at the last second when they realized I was no longer a student.

I'm stuck in a chicken and egg problem, I can't hope to apply to CS PhD programs (my ultimate goal with trying to get research experience/an internship) without well.. research experience. But I can't get any because I'm no longer a student. I couldn't get any while I was a student because of covid/graduating early.

I have heard of only a single ""post-bacc"" internship/fellowship at some AI company. I applied, but is that really all I can do? I must have searched through dozens and dozens of job openings but they're all for current students. I've contemplated joining an online masters program (even though I didn't think it would help me at all academically) just so I can get student status, to give you an idea of how ridiculous this situation is..."

I'm an undergraduate with bachelors in Mechanical Engineering (from another country) looking to transition into CS (in the US). I have no experience in CS, just a python course from Udemy, C and Data structures classes from UG (not really proficient).

One of the promising options for me is to get a masters degree from any University in the US, get an internship experience and try to land a full time job after graduating. I know it seems impossible but I'll have to make it work somehow. I have seen some people from this sub who went to MS programs like MCIT and were able to get decent jobs, which gives me hope. I'm ready to put in 10-12 hours of work for 4 months to learn the prerequisites and coding before the classes start in January.

My questions are:

a) Which of these two options will help me the most in finding an internship or job and cope with the course curriculum.

1. Learn basic programming courses like DS &amp;A in Java/c++, networking, OS, Databases etc. from Coursera. I am also ready to take any pre-req if asked by the Uni.
2. Join a Bootcamp and learn JS, HTML, CSS with MERN stack and do some projects.
3. If there's a better way to do things, please suggest.

b) If I was able to get a good understanding of some coding concepts, is it possible to manage coursework, do some projects of my own, learn new skills, practice Leetcode and apply to internships and jobs at the same time? (given my non-cs background)

Any other suggestions are appreciated.

Thanks!"

So I have recently graduated and got my Bachelor's Degree in CS, my ideal job would be in a videogame company as it seems a creative and pretty dynamic environment (other than videogames being my main hobby).

I started looking for videogame companies and well... almost all the positions I found REQUIRED years of experience in the industry or shipped AAA titles, even Junior positions and even for ""smaller"" companies! Some job postings had the ""work experience"" as a plus... and yet I didn't even get to the first interview even tho I quite matched the other requriements.

So a question arose: how am I supposed to get in the industry if prior working experience in said industry is required?! This is a deadlock situation! Are intern positions even a thing in videogame companies? Because it seems like I cannot find one...

Would love to hear your opinion, especially if you are lucky enough to be part of it."

I'm currently on 2 x 15 mg of Sandoz HCI Methylphenidate (Dutch offbrand). One in the morning and one in the early afternoon. Which is helping a bunch with my studying, writing my thesis and in general reading literature. Which is giving me a lot of hope that I'm might actually be able to pursue a career in my preferred profession. 

Now I enjoy drinking craft beer and going out for drinks with friends during the weekends. After talking with the medical assistant she advised me to either not take my medication during the days I would like to go out for drinks or only take the first dose in the morning.

I've been trying to do some research on it but I haven't found any conclusive answers.

So I was wondering, what are other peoples experience with this taking similar doses? If I only take the first dose, will I notice any strong effects if I'd drink a couple of craft beers in the evening?

I’ve based many of my career-related decisions on the advice given to others. Now I’m hoping those that are more experienced than myself can give me advice on a big decision I have to make.

I’m a recent graduate who is two months into my first job. I took a Controls Engineer  job I wasn’t interested in several months before graduation because I was afraid that something better wouldn’t come up due to the state of the economy. It’s ~45 minutes outside of a major midwestern city, which I moved to, in a very rural area and within a few hours of my hometown. My plan was always to stay a year and get a job 10+ hours away from home through contacts at companies I am fairly certain would hire me. 

After about a month, I was testing the project I’m assigned to in the shop with some of the electricians. One of the electricians did a bad job wiring a panel and when the head of field service saw it, he started chewing out the team leader in charge of the electricians. He called the team leader racial and anti-gay slurs multiple times during his rant. This is the same guy who told me “not to get stuck here like I did” during my first week. For reference, the head of field service has been with the company for 17 years since it was founded. I’m assuming this isn’t the first time something like this has happened and it won’t be the last. I left my job as an electrical technician at almost thirty years old to finish my degree so that I could avoid working in the middle of nowhere in an environment like this. 

I was angry so I went home that afternoon and applied for a very rare Embedded Systems Engineer job in the downtown area of the city I moved to. I felt like I was little under-qualified but I thought my experience might be a good match since I had multiple internships that involved testing electronics and writing code even though I have very little experience coding in C++ like they are asking for. I am very passionate about this kind of work and there aren’t many opportunities like this within driving distance of my hometown. I would like to stay as close to family as possible.

Well, they responded to my application and I interviewed with them yesterday. I haven’t gotten a formal offer yet but I have a very good feeling that I’m going to. If I’m offered the job then I think I’m going to take it. I realize this shouldn’t bother me but I hate to leave so soon because of my manager, who has gone above and beyond what he should do to train me. He’s new to management and I feel bad leaving him high and dry like this for a reason outside of his control. 

Should I be worried about potential backlash for leaving a job after such a short period of time? Should I tell my manager why I’m leaving? Are there any other problems that could arise that I haven’t considered?


TL;DR: Thinking about leaving my first job after recently graduating because I’m not interested in the work and I’ve witnessed others dealing with a toxic environment. Is this a bad decision? Should I explain to my manager that I’m leaving because of the reasons behind the toxic work environment?"

I am 27, female, a Med student. I see my old friends getting married and having children. Everyone seems so happy getting forward in life and I feel so stuck. 
I am not looking forward on becoming a doctor, I feel overwhelmed with the system and the crushing hours. Although I don’t have a problem finishing Med school, I will be done in two years. I am afraid of what comes after it. 
My relationship is falling apart, I feel constantly criticized by my boyfriend. The doubts in this relationship are killing me, although he loves me. I feel unable to have a household together with him. 
He does home office and is constantly at home. His comments are killing me. Don’t walk with socks around, don’t mop the floor like this, but like that, don’t unlock the door with one hand, there is something smelling in the fridge, the floor in the kitchen is dirty, the sink in the kitchen is clogged, you left a lemon out and now we have fruit flies. He never cooked or washed dishes, of course the kitchen gets dirty because of me. I have no motivation anymore to do anything in the household. The bathroom is dirty and I want to clean it, but he is at home and I know that he will comment on something if I start and we will end in a fight. So I stopped doing anything. 
He says he does other things like repairing the bikes or the car or vacuuming and I am lazy. 
After work he wants to spend time with me, the weekends he wants to spend time with me. I just want to go and visit a friend and walk with my socks on without him commenting. 
When we drive somewhere he comments about my feet not being on the mat in the car or not drinking and eating in the car.
I lost some documents of mine, which will cost me 50 bucks to replace. Now he is criticizing me every day how uncareful I am with my money. It is my money I work for, I am not happy paying money for my documents but stuff happens. I don’t constantly loose my documents, I tell him. No, but you lost your gloves before two years and you bought a new sweep although we didn’t need a new one. I almost never eat out, my clothes are second hand. He also looses stuff but it is fine with him, because he works full time and has enough money to afford it. 
I pay rent but I owe him some money. I am working on it. I really try. But I do make mistakes too.

He pays for me when we eat out together and buys me presents from time to time. He wants to borrow me money to support me with my university, but I don’t feel comfortable with it.

I am tired and depressed. Today I saw another post in Facebook of an old classmate having a baby daughter. I now cried for two hours.

My boyfriend wants to marry me and have children, I feel so overwhelmed living with him, I don’t want to have a child, I will get crazy. 

I don’t know If I am being too sensitive to critique. Is it always so hard living together?

There is nothing in my future I am looking forward to. I cry every day and have no energy for simple tasks.

I hate not having money, I hate being in my youth and hating my life so much.

Some people may tell enjoy your childfree life, no vomiting babies, holidays abroad and stuff. I have no money to go on a holiday. In my vacations I do unpaid internships. I don’t enjoy my life. I can’t buy new clothes or good food. And I am 27, my old friends are buying houses, getting married, having children.

I am afraid to leave the relationship because I am afraid of being alone. I am afraid not going to be able to get out of my place and withdrawing from society even more. 
I don’t know if leaving the relationship will help me or make things worse in the long run."

I started only two weeks ago and even though it has not been that long, I feel I'm already learning things.

Current problem is, I feel like I'm not going fast enough at doing the tasks given, not to mention I tend to ask the seniors a lot because I couldn't understand some stuff, or even because of the language barrier (I'm not a native speaker of the country I'm currently living in). A few days ago another employer and I started a project together, where we need to translate some legacy php code into java. The first few tasks were not that hard, but my current task does make me kind of doubt myself if I'm even good enough for CS. The home office situation also does not help, because I feel like being in office allows me to directly question the other person instead of waiting for his/her answer in Slack.

So question is, is it normal to feel that way during the early days of internship/new job? To be honest I just need to hear if it's going to be better going forward or will it stay the same. Thanks for reading my rant/essay!"

I have professional experience in the field as my college requires students to take part in an internship in order to graduate. I started my internship early this summer working from home and I didn't tell the employer about my condition.

If you don't know much about autism, the important points are that social interactions are a bit more difficult and it takes me a bit longer than average to adapt to change. However I have much stronger critical thinking abilities and much more passionate about things. This is a big part to why I went into computer science.

As this was my first proper experience in the field, this was a big change for me and it did take a while to adapt, perhaps longer than my supervisor was expecting. Combine that with remote work, being in the same room almost 24/7, I wasn't able to focus as much and be as productive as I could have, combine that with a missed meeting trying to get used to the schedule and this got me fired before I could explain anything.

Thankfully, office jobs should return to on-location work by the time I graduate which would eliminate one of the difficulties. Still, I wonder if I should have told the last employer about my condition and if I should do so going forward. On paper it can only help me, but I'm also worried employers will imagine some of the stronger cases often portrayed and be scared away while I'm actually on the lower end of the spectrum."

Been working as tech software support for 6+ years. Graduated with a bachelor’s in CS last year. No internships or outside-of-school personal projects so I feel like I’m in that limbo where no employees will give me the light of day.

This would be a big and scary decision but I was toying with the idea of committing myself to full time interview studying / job applying / personal projects to see if that might be better than feeling stuck in my current career and trying to scrounge time after work every day to do all of the above.

Could I spin this off to impress potential employers that I committed myself to CS or would it work against me?

To give a little bit of a background, I am originally from India and I did my bachelors from there and moved to Vancouver, Canada for masters. I don't have any major Job experience. I did an internship here in Canada for 4 months and I've been a Teaching Assistant for a course in my university (Which I hope recruiters take into account). I've been doing leetcode regularly and I'm fairly good at that.

My concern is my speaking ability. English is not my first language and while speaking I get stuck on some sentences and I get blacked out even though I have the stuff to stay. Although I will say I'm not lacking the knowledge of English because I can write, listen and read like it's my first language. My problem is speaking. I also fumble in my first language while talking.

So my question is How should I tackle this and Does this matter in interviews and getting a job?"

After 3+ years of being an undergrad and realizing that it’s quite impossible for me to get my foot in any of the companies that recruit at my university, I’ve decided to drop out. I have nothing on my resume that showcases any sort of experience and, according to my peers, that’s what internships are for. Because of my legal status in this country I am not even able to land an internship.  

I thought “maybe I stop wasting my time and money and learn some coding on my own.” I was quite enthusiastic about all things coding and actually went through a few tutorials on many languages just to explore what’s out there. I thought going through a bachelors degree would expose me to other languages more in depth and point me on the right direction. But this was me pre-university.  

Post dropping out, I realized that I would be in the same situation. If I become a badass self-thought programmer like many of you, where could I go if I cannot be hired? Any motivation that I had before going to university is now gone. University showed me that the future looks bleak at best.  

So, I wanted to ask here, are there any undocumented immigrants living in the US that had found some success after acquiring programming skills?"

I'm also interviewing at another company near where I live, but this time it's a company I care about- won't know until next week at the earliest. I most likely will be accepting that internship position if they offer it.

I have had some phone calls and a couple online interviews but haven't made it past the first stage of the interview process.

I have been with my current job for a couple years now and had a year-long internship before that, so effectively three years of combined experience. My problem is, I don't have a whole lot of experience in any single thing, but rather I have spent three years working on mostly small projects and tasks that utilize a multitude of technologies. So I can easily name 50 things that I've dabbled into, but I can't claim to have expertise or in-depth knowledge in any of them.

I've been falling short because generally corporations are looking for people who have strong experience with specific skills; they're not interested in hiring anybody who is ""well rounded"" or has ""potential"". In the couple of interviews I've had, I can clearly tell that they were disappointed to hear about my lack of experience with the particular skills they were looking for. I had a little experience with everything they were looking for and clearly understood what each technology does and what it's used for, but they weren't impressed.

Is there a way I can use varied work experience to my advantage? I haven't had any luck trying to present myself as ""well rounded"" or ""highly capable"" or anything like that.

**Schools:** UT Austin (auto-admit, but I rlly want to get into their business honors program), HYPSM (super-reach), Stanford (super-reach), UVA (reach), UNC (reach), UCLA/UC Berkley (reach), UMich Ross (super-reach), Stern (super-reach), Duke (reach)

As you can see, I have very little business-related ECs. This is because I didn't want to do business until like a couple months ago, so I have no DECA, FBLA, etc.

Should I apply for business or biology? Also, is it worth shotgunning these schools based on my stats/ECs. How important are olympiads if you're applying as a business major? Be brutally honest, and is it worth retaking the SAT (maybe y'all can convince my parents hehehe)"
oob4m9,0,2021-07-20,How to find a Front end position when all of my past experience are back end?,East_Abbreviations68,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/oob4m9/how_to_find_a_front_end_position_when_all_of_my/,"Since graduation, I have worked as a back end engineer for almost 2 years now. But now I want to convert to a front end engineer. I have tried to apply for a few companies but heard nothing back. I figure it might due to my resume filled with only back end experience (from my current job and 2 internships).  

I have taken a few Front end courses from Udemy and worked on some small personal projects. But all most all of the front end jobs require 2-5 years of fulltime experience. So my question is how should I prepare my resume and  what else should I do for me to look good as a Front end candidate? I live in the US btw if it make any difference."

The work has been fulfilling, and I'm a big fan of both my project leads. About three weeks ago, I experienced the death of a parent, and took two weeks off to attend the funeral/get his things in order/mope around with my siblings back home. My project leads were certainly understanding, and eventually, I started back the internship's weekly meetings and involving myself with the code-base. 

For the bad news - I'm now seriously considering quitting once again. I thought that I was in a place where I could work my way through any grief, but my executive function feels out of control and I can't seem to get my mind off the loss. I waste hours a day crying, something that is completely foreign to someone with my usual, seemingly apathetic temperament. I also don't want to burn any bridges by backing out a second time. Should I buck up and work my way through the situation for the sake of having decent connections and a great experience, or would quitting this opportunity be the right move?"

Stupid asf for doing it and I acknowledge that I made a mistake. I'm currently a junior computer science student at a T20 school and I really want to go to grad school bc I would like to go into the computer vision(CV) field and a lot of the jobs I am seeing require a master's or Ph.D. 

Currently, I have a 3.65 GPA(upward trend), 2 research experiences with one publication that involves CV, a data analyst/software engineer internship with no CV, and plan on taking grad courses about CV to learn more. 

How do I approach applying to grad school in my situation?"

However, so far, in my experience, I find it actually pretty difficult to remember solutions verbatim and find myself relying more on techniques I've learned over time, which in a way becomes instinct. 

What are others' thoughts on this? 

I know this is probably one of the more cliche questions these days, but when did you start to feel confident enough with Leetcode to land an internship or job? Like, the number of problems solved, or was it more down to the general feeling of proficiency? 

Thanks in advance!"

&amp;#x200B;

* **Why I want an MBA**: Interested in Project Management/Entrepreneurship and looking for a career change and pivot back into the US workforce. I have been working in various startups/grassroots abroad, ranging from small/mid size companies to corporate. I would like to take what I have learned through my work experience and find an ideal program to structure help me structure my work experience and take the next steps to advance my career. Short term goal post MBA is to go into project management/strategy/operations. Long term goal (even though it may be unrealistic, is to go into sports industry and/or global NGO for education reform) - I have a strong passion for sports and education and would love to work front office for a sports league/team and/or working in sports/education globally. I am a firm believer that sports/education is a great vehicle for cultural exchange and education, but the world works in a capitalistic fashion through business. I want to learn how to maneuver in this realm and I believe a MBA education will guide me.
* **Why I want one now:** I feel that I have maxed out on my potential at my current job and I am currently based in a city abroad that is changing drastically in terms of politics and economy. I would like to return to the US to continue my career and I believe an MBA would be a great opportunity to make the change back to the US.
* **Target Schools**: Target: Sloan, Stern, CBS Others/Reach: Darden, Johnson, Haas, Marshall, Foster, Ross

Background

&amp;#x200B;

* **Work experience**: I have 10 years working experience. I currently work abroad (2 years) for a top British private boarding school developing and building campuses across Asia/Mainland China as head of Marketing/Business Development for a specific region. The campus in my region was opened during political unrest followed by COVID, with many interruptions to the school year, but I was able to grow the school and increase enrollment by 400% since school opening. My position is pegged to a KPI of hitting enrollment numbers. My region became one of the fastest growing schools in our region and the brand is one of the fastest growing brands in Asia. Previously, I worked 4 years as the General Manager (2 Offices, 150+ employees) leading an international youth sports organization/training academy in Mainland China (the largest in the city), servicing over 5000 student/youth athletes. I was fortunate enough to work with many top sports international top sports organizations in their activations with youth engagement in my city (NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL, UEFA, FIFA, etc.). Prior to my GM stint, I worked with a partner leading the operations and backend to build another youth sports academy from its startup stage for 3 years, with the academy still currently in operations successfully. I have also worked as an Assistant General Manager at a well known music education center as my first job after undergrad, and I worked during college for an international student led NGO.
* **Extra curricular and other experience**: I am also currently the President of the American Football League in my country where I lead the league operations each year (although this past year has been affected by COVID). I am also a small business owner of a pet grooming service company and I also serve as an Advisor for a startup EduTech company (shifted from a Co-Founder role due to time commitment). I am also captain/coach of my adult basketball team (we have/had a few semi-pro athletes and have won a few championships) and I am also a member of my city’s softball league (we are reigning champions past 2 years) Previously, I served on several sports committees during my time as GM in my former role.
* I also volunteer for various service and humanitarian service projects/organizations, some examples such as international crusade/mission work with my parents in Mainland China. I've worked with charities dedicated to disabled (physical/mental) through the sports organizations I've led in recent years, and also as a summer camp counselor for the disabled during my college years. I’ve worked in Nepal one summer at a school for underprivileged children, and a local charity dedicated to assisting the homeless in my current city.
* Working abroad has allowed me to do extensive traveling, one of my passions. I’ve been to roughly 40 countries in the last 10 years for work/leisure.
* During undergrad, I worked for an international student-led NGO both serving at the regional and national level in various roles, which allowed me to help facilitate work internships and traineeships through universities around the world. I was also fortunate enough to also participate in these internships, which gave me an opportunity to travel around the world and work in countries such as Poland and Mainland China. This inspired me to continue to work abroad after completing my undergraduate degree. I moved abroad after completing my undergraduate degree and have been abroad since (10 years).
* My hobbies include traveling, food/cooking, and music (i play piano/drums/guitar and was in a band in college)
* **Undergraduate School/Major**: I attended a Top 20 University in the South and I majored in Communication Studies. 3.1 GPA (I know my major and gpa are not strong. Not an excuse but college was a tough time for me, my father passed away my senior of high school and my single mother was only working part time. I also worked part time during undergraduate to support my education, in addition to my stints working abroad during college). I was not as focused as I should've been on my academics. I was the first person in my family to attend college and I received a full scholarship for undergrad.
* **Other education/coursework**: I am currently a Level 1 Coaching Certification for Basketball (certification through the NBA/CBA, course led by Bruce Bayno), EduCare TES CPD Certification
* **Race/Nationality** \- I am a US citizen, but I was born in Hong Kong. Grew up in the US and I am a Chinese speaker. 
* **Sex**: M

Stats

&amp;#x200B;

* **GRE/GMAT Score**: I haven’t taken the GRE/GMAT yet as testing has been sensitive/difficult with various social distancing restrictions in my current country. My mock GRE was 158V/164Q. I am thinking of taking the EA instead because of my current work/time commitments for studying for the GRE
* **Undergrad GPA**: 3.1

Mr. Sigonis is a lime green Gekoi, and was extremely worried, he had the new student in less than 15 min and he had to control him. *‘ what if the first time he saw him in the medical decontamination room he was dope, and now that is clean, he will be a danger to everyone.* The gekoi thought to himself. To say Mr. Sigonis was panicking is, to put it mildly.

“It’s ok, I will be fine, he is just another student”. He tries to calm himself. “Another student that is a predator, can eat meat and hunt me down…” he is not the best at it.

“Profesor Sigonis, we are here, can we come in?” Said Chirps from the Krain’s shoulders.

Chirps were really happy to be on Krain’s shoulders, because of two (2) things, one being that he will not be stomp for others accidentally, and the other is because other people, mostly the females, try to pick him up a hug him, and because of Krain, he didn’t have that problem today.

Mr. Sigonis was confused and scared, but in a strange way, calmer because the big bad predator is more like a calm and playful graphical (some kind of alien puppy).

\--------------------------------------

Meanwhile in the school kitchen, the head chef and the other cooks were about to prepare the food lunch for the students.

“Ok, team. We have new students and with that, we have new and interesting ingredients to organize” Order the head chef.

People start to pick up the boxes to put them on the table so all the cooks can see them. Here the young Yahnol, an intern in the kitchen, was hoping to be of some use. You see Yahnol is technical a predator, but on the lower level, only eating small fish and bugs on his planet; Yahnol is a great cook, that's the reason for being an intern here, he can cook a variety of herbivore food, but due to his species other don’t trust him.

“Good, let's start opening the crates. Remember not to cross-contaminate the food, so the nearest person to a crate will open that crate only.”

“YES CHEF” the group answer.

“Oh this one is good.” call one of them, gaining the attention of the others. “We have Crpoj-glu leaves from Kurjtt, and frigate fruit, perfect for a stew.”

“uuuuUUUUH, I have several seeds and nuts from various planets from sector 453-c”.

In general, the new ingredients they recognized were also exquisite, so the cooks were really excited to work with them. Yahnol had one of the last crates, and with excitement, he opened it, by doing so, cool air exited the crate.

“Hey, guy? this one has a refrigeration system” Yahnol calls out, making for those rare moments that other people are willing to listen to him.

A crate with refrigeration systems only means a sensitive ingredient that can go to rot somewhat easily but in general are of high quality. So with words of jealousy for Yahnol to discover the exotic ingredient, he makes haste to fully open the crate.

For Yahnol, the smell is familiar, and slowly after gag noises from his comrades make him realize that the exotic ingredient has meat, not only that but there is a variety of red meat, white meat, bird meat, fish meat, crustacean meat.

The other quickly got away from the crate.

“Ma’am, what is the meaning of this, why is that crate here?” one ask preserved.

“Please be an error,” another almost crying added.

In desperation, the head chef checked the logs for something to clarify this situation. Yahnol closes the lid from the crate knowing this will be the best action until it sorts it out.

“No… is no error, one of the students eats meat on their diet.” They responded. “Someone has to work and cook the meat… not only that but also cook for the same student something with plant matter…”

No one wants to be the cook for the monster, no matter if they eat plants too. No one except Yahnol, who is ecstatic, could experiment with food if the one eating them is someone who can digest both plants and meat, he only dreams of someone like this.

“Head Chef, I will cook for them” Yahnol exclaimed with a happy expression. “No need to worry about the plant-based food, I can cook that too.”

The Others saw him in disgust, but if he can and will cook to pacify the monster so they don't try to hunt people down, they will let him do it.

“Do what you want Yahnol, just keep them away from the other stations”

“Yes Chef!!!!” Yahnol exclaimed, picking the crate to his first cooking station since he arrived.

I am from a decent Canadian university.

The title says it all. I applied to 200+ positions for Summer 2021, and got 2 interviews with no offer. Recently, I received an offer for Summer 2022 from an awesome company.

I am going to keep this post short, by writing my key takeaways from the gruesome job search I had for this Summer. It was extremely burning out, depressing, and anxiety invoking.

1. You are not the only one. It may seem like you are the only one getting rejected. It may seem like you're blacklisted, and that literally nobody wants you. This feeling is understandable, but do know that it is NOT true. You are one amongst 1000s of CS students applying for a job. Solution to this? Get out of your comfort zone and go to networking events. Mail recruiters and people you meet, and keep in touch with them. Ask questions in events, and participate. This will reduce the luck factor involved when applying to that company. This is the number 1 tip, because it greatly reduces the effort applications take.
2. Do not compare yourself. Your friend got it in a great company? It doesn't impact you. Someone else is making great strides in their internship? It's none of your business. Rather, focus this energy on making yourself better. Keep your head up, you have talent too, and your time will come.
3. DO. NOT. GIVE. UP. Your time will come. I promise it will. Never give up. Failed an interview? See where you can improve, and practice it. Failed a coding prompt? See the topic, study it, and master it. Resume isn't great? Ask people around you, shamelessly post your resume everywhere for critique, and better it. Still didn't get an internship (like me)? Ask a 100 professors in your uni for a research position? Still nothing? Make crazy good personal projects, practice LC and volunteer somewhere. Just don't give up. You are so close to getting it, just don't give up.
4. Be yourself in interviews. I do not mean be casual. Be yourself. Express yourself like how you actually are, talk about real takeaways of your life. 

Each and every one of y'all are awesome. Discover your interest, and improve on it. Always finish your day being a better person than you were. And yeah, don't give up. Best of luck!"
ook608,1,2021-07-21,Are 2 non-school programming projects good enough to land a remote internship?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ook608/are_2_nonschool_programming_projects_good_enough/,"I'm about to start my junior year as a CS major at a decent state school, and I have absolutely zero CS-related work experience. I'm worried that this will hinder me when trying to apply for internships this fall, and I understand that the only other way to shine besides having experience is to have projects on your resume that you can talk about in interviews.  

I plan to apply to remote-only internships starting this fall, and I cobbled together a rough draft for my resume, which I'll link at the bottom of this post.  I haven't worked on my 2 personal programming projects yet, which is why they aren't on my resume, but I will definitely include them when I finish them in the next couple months. My first project is a Blackjack card game made with Java + JavaFX, and my second project is a scientific calculator using python + Django (also CSS and HTML5). I decided to work on these 2 projects since they will showcase just about every programming language/framework I've learned, as well as provide proof that I didn't just coast through college and actually know what I'm doing.  I'm also saving these projects on GitHub and will provide a link to source code in my resume in due time.  

Do you think that these 2 projects will be enough to spruce up my resume and give me a good chance at landing an internship? Should I work on a third project? The only other programming language that I know that isn't covered by my 2 projects I'm working on is JavaScript, so maybe I could do a third project using Javascript to showcase my Javascript skills? Or is 2 enough? 

I'm really new to this whole applying to internships thing, so I would greatly appreciate any criticism and advice. I swear I don't know what I'm doing, haha!

Disregard the comment about the Roblox game I worked on. It was a complete and utter failure, and I will be removing it from my resume in the future."

This is because my girlfriend broke up with me. But there's more to it if you care to know.

We both met in university in Sweden. Now being done with school (she dropped out) i decided to do an internship in Austria (my home country) over the summer before eventually returning back to sweden. And then eventually having to go off to do my master's somewhere (i got into school in sweden, london and Amsterdam). She, ofc wouldn't join for any of that because she wanted to stay in Sweden, even though she didn't know what do do with her life. So I guess she wanted to figure out her life. She has had many issues that had crippled the relationship and my mental health for over a year. But she knew about it. Problems include her selfishness, lack of empathy, ignorance and miscommunication (stonewalling, criticism, constant fights about nothing, making herself the victim, trauma, etc.). 

Now as soon as i got to Austria, things started going downhill with the first call we had (only a couple hours after I arrived!!!) when she told me that she'd already found a new apartment. While it wasnt even certain if I was going to go to another country or to university in Sweden, meaning we could move in together. And even if i wanted to study in the same city again, she said she wouldn't wanna move back in together. The next days she started being angry frequently while talking, ignoring me (or prioritising to do millions of other things and hang out with mutual friends of ours) and talking to me only when and if she found the time to. She'd tell me that she cares about me and loves me, but that she just doesn't love me ""that way"" anymore. She fell out of love for a while now (but couldnt even tell me what love is for her at the time). She told me she wanted to work on herself and on her issues. Also the romance and passion just wasn't there anymore (which she told me alter was the differemce of loving a partner and love you have for a friend or family member) We had sex perhaps once a month or even less frequently and she didn't even wanna masturbate (the latter part seems like its clearly something that has to do with something outside of my sphere of influence and not even necessarily the relationship as i think it was affected by her overall mental health). This (lack of sex and mental problems) started happening last summer 2020 when she had troubles (kind of a mental breakdown) because she had to rely on me financially, corona happened, she dropped out of school and she didn't know what to do with her life anymore. She didn't even wanna hang out with our friends at all anymore.This came on top of all the issues she was already experiencing. But I was always there for her, gave her the love and care she needed. And even though we fought occasionally because of these problems we pulled through and things got better. At least i thought.

Apparently, without knowing she started to slowly fall out of love around christmas time or after. She says she doesn't know why but i think there are multiple reasons: her issues, living in a 25 square meter student apartment during a pandemic, and something called attachment theory (explained below).

So she ended up breaking up with me over the phone a week after i left Sweden, when i thought everything was fine (and after she had been ""trying to work it out"" or lie to herself for months). She said she didn't wanna feel bad for the way she treated me anymore, she didn't wanna feel bad for lying to herself or me. She didn't wanna feel guilty anymore for sometimes subconsciously or not purposefully hurting me (because of her issues) . She often said during the relationship (usually after fights when she had realized some of her behavior was not okay) that she knows about the issues, she knows she is a bad person and needs to change, and that I deserve better. She also used to ask why I'm still with her. And I used to say that it was because I love her. And that's also why i wanted to be with her through thick and thin, help her and support her. But i guess that wasn't enough or she just couldn't handle the guilt anymore. She never really communicated how she felt to me and so i thought everything was fine. But at that point when she broke uo with me it was already too late because she had made up her mind and pushed herself to go through all of that without talking to me and trying to work on it together. And i had to stay in austria because of my internship and couldn't just leave.

The day she broke up with me, I didn't wanna have it be true. I didn't realize what is happening to me and as soon as we hung up the phone I had my first panic attack. It haooened because the reason for brealing up was mainly because she fell out of love. But she couldn't give me a real reason for WHY she fell out of love. It happened because she said i didnt do anything and i was perfect. Because it was her that was the problem. Because she didn't love me anymore or couldnt even try to work on it even though i put all my heart, blood and sweat into the relationship. Because i was willing to risk being hurt from time to time by her for a little longer, while she was gonna work on herself, to stay together, but she still didn't want to try as she wanted to ""be by herself"" and ""work on it by herself"". Because I was willing to risk being together knowing that it ""might not work out"" or that the situation or her feelings ""might not change"", but she didnt want to. Because she made uo her mind without me and determined my destiny knowing how much it would hurt me. Because she made up her mind, taking on a pessimistic and negative outlook. 

But despite caring about me and still loving me, wanting me in her life (as best friend at least or maybe even more one day), despite her wanting to be by herself, working on her issues by herself she started ignoring me, hanging out with all our mutual friends all the time, and doing loads of other things. Again, she was doing things she would not have done with me. She was hanging out with OUR friends (even people that she wouldnt normally hang out with) more than ever. And she was generally not really working on herself actively. She was distracting herself while ignoring me and distracting herself from what she was doing to me and her guilt. She acknowledged that she was/is (once more) being selfish but reassured me that she cares about nothing but herself first and then maybe if she has fucks to spare she could care about others and what shes doing to them. She says she doesnt care what others might think or say about all of this as she wants to focus on herself and be happy. She said she wanted to enjoy her summer as people are also going to leave soon. But her seemingly being ""over it"" so quickly, seemingly happier than ever, and not wanting to be there for me when i needed her (she said because she couldn't/can't handle what she doing to me and see me this way. And she didn't wanna feel guilty because according to her shouldn't) made everything much worse.

So in a way she kinda gets what she wants... as usual she does not have to deal with consequences, feel guilty, work on her issues that hurt others and herself, and she can kinda keep on running away from every bit of problem she ultimately created or will create for herself and others already or in the future.

She seems to be happier than ever without me. Not caring at all how I am doing or what she is doing to me. She seems to not give a shit about anything but herself. She is selfish, ignorant, narcissistic and emotionless. And she manipulates everyone around her to see her as this great person or as a victim when in fact she is the one hurting others and being a horrible person. She makes others feel guilty for the way she behaves and (mis-)treats people. She is hypocritical and lying to others but mostly to herself. Saying she cares about me, loves me and wants me in her life. Saying that she wants to or is already working on herself so she can change and be a better person. Using this as a reason to break up. But then not acting accoringly at all. I can not fathom how apathetic a human being can be to be this hurtful, punishing others for the way they feel, for their needs and wants only because SHE made them feel that way and because she doesn't get what she wants. 

She has all this time to do all these things and no time or emotions left for me. All of this just seems unfair. All these people. And all of them having so much fun in our apartment that che claimed as hers while knowing that she is hurting me.

For once I want her to be alone. I want people ignoring her, her to have no phone, no contact to people, nothing to distract her. I want her to think about things, empathise and actually start caring about others (just a bit more). I want her to feel guilty because she should! I want her to feel lonely because she should! I want her to feel unloved because she should! At least for a little while (where is karma when you need it). I want her to truly understand (the situation, her actions and the consequences of those actions) and work on herself so she can stop going on about her life being happy while completely shattering the happiness of others. I want her to stop ignoring all of this. I want her to stop sucking out the happiness, acceptance and love of others and only taking everything she wants without never ever giving anything in return. This toxicity is something I do not want to be around. But i still love her so fucking much and DO NOT WANT TO LOSE HER. But unfortunately I am starting  to forget the nice person i knew and starting to think of her as this emotionless monster. I'm starting to try to forget everything that happened, even the nice things. I'm starting to hate here and my friends for ignoring how i feel and the fact that she is the cause of it.

There is a reason why people do not like her. There is a reason why people leave her all the time (she successfully pushed several people out of her life already and is constantly ""at war"" with people). They were just smart enough to stop giving her what she wants, breaking free from her enchantment and seeing that she does mot want to or can not be fixed!

I just want justice. For not being able to sleep, eat, having nightmares, for her breaking my heart, ruining my life and relationships with others, for making me feel like absolute shit as if I'm too worthless and unimportant to live (or care about).

I want her to feel consequences (by our friends ignoring her for at leat a week or so, in order for her to feel at least a fraction of what its like to be in my skin) or to at least have an actual intervention and a serious talk with her and my friends. But i dont think they'll want to because they dont see my feelings as significant enough. Or because people are selfish and always choose the easy way out because they'd rather have fun with her than deal with the problems and injustice she causes to me.

I even had to start talking to a therapist because of my panic attacks that happen every time i think about this situation, the abandonment, injustice and the pain she inflicted and still is inflicting on me.

So I dont kmow what to think about all of this or do anymore. I started to think more often that i don't wanna be here anymore. Because if my best is not good enough. If I'm nice and always giving everything for/to others, prioritising their needs over mine and I still get fucked over. Then I dont wanna do this anymore. How can people be so selfish, unaware or unwilling to help somone that is clearly struggling. This last month has been the worst month in my life and it felt like living hell. And there is no sign of it stopping unless things magically work out and she starts treating me nice and people (friends) are going to start to support me and be there for me. Or if she doesnt have any consequences, remorse, or guilt for her actions.
I want them in my life but not like that. I don't want to have to beg for love, support, or change. Because how real can care and love be if its forced. I just dont want to feel bad anymore....

The central theme of attachment theory is that primary caregivers who are available and responsive to an infant's needs allow the child to develop a sense of security.  When needs were not met this can lead to an insecure attachment style (at least half the population have an insecure attachment style). She has had childhood trauma and a lot of things going on so i think that might explain at least some of the reasons for her behaviors.
There are insecure 3 styles:

Avoidant:

The dismissing / avoidant type would often perceive themselves as ‘lone wolves’: strong, independent, and self-sufficient; not necessarily in terms of physical contact, but rather on an emotional level.

These people have high self-esteem and a positive view of themselves.

The dismissing / avoidant type tend to believe that they don’t have to be in a relationship to feel complete.

They do not want to depend on others, have others depend on them, or seek support and approval in social bonds.

Adults with this attachment style generally avoid emotional closeness. They also tend to hide or suppress their feelings when faced with a potentially emotion-dense situation.

1.You’re an independent person, content to care for yourself and don’t feel you need others.
The more someone tries to get close to you or the needier a partner becomes, the more you tend to withdraw.
2.You’re uncomfortable with your emotions and partners often accuse you of being distant and closed off, rigid and intolerant. In return, you accuse them of being too needy.
3.You’re prone to minimize or disregard your partner’s feelings, keep secrets from them, engage in affairs, and even end relationships in order to regain your sense of freedom.
4.You may prefer fleeting, casual relationships to long-term intimate ones, or you seek out partners who are equally independent, ones who’ll keep their distance emotionally.
5.While you may think you don’t need close relationships or intimacy, the truth is we all do. Humans are hardwired for connection and deep down, even someone with an avoidant-dismissive attachment style wants a close meaningful relationship—if only they could overcome their deep-seated fears of intimacy. 

May have problems with intimacy

Invest little emotion in social and romantic relationships

Unwilling or unable to share thoughts or feelings with others


Anxious:

For adults with an anxious attachment style, the partner is often the ‘better half.’

The thought of living without the partner (or being alone in general) causes high levels of anxiety. People with this type of attachment typically have a negative self-image, while having a positive view of others.

The anxious adult often seeks approval, support, and responsiveness from their partner.

People with this attachment style value their relationships highly, but are often anxious and worried that their loved one is not as invested in the relationship as they are.

A strong fear of abandonment is present, and safety is a priority. The attention, care, and responsiveness of the partner appears to be the ‘remedy’ for anxiety.

On the other hand, the absence of support and intimacy can lead the anxious / preoccupied type to become more clinging and demanding, preoccupied with the relationship, and desperate for love.

1.You want to be in a relationship and crave feelings of closeness and intimacy with a significant other, but you struggle to feel that you can trust or fully rely on your partner.
2.Being in an intimate relationship tends to take over your life and you become overly fixated on the other person.
3.You may find it difficult to observe boundaries, viewing space between you as a threat, something that can provoke panic, anger, or fear that your partner no longer wants you.
4.A lot of your sense of self-worth rests on how you feel you’re being treated in the relationship and you tend to overreact to any perceived threats to the relationship.
5.You feel anxious or jealous when away from your partner and may use guilt, controlling behavior, or other manipulative tactics to keep them close.
6.You need constant reassurance and lots of attention from your partner.
7.Others may criticize you for being too needy or clingy and you may struggle to maintain close relationships. 

Reluctant to become close to others

Worry that their partner does not love them

Become very distraught when relationships end


Disorganised:

Disorganized/disoriented attachment, also referred to as fearful-avoidant attachment, stems from intense fear, often as a result of childhood trauma, neglect, or abuse. Adults with this style of insecure attachment tend to feel they don’t deserve love or closeness in a relationship. 

___________________________________________________

Now i think i am an anxious attachment style while she is an avoidant (or maybe even disorganised).  The fucked up thing is that apparently often attachment styles look for the opposite. This is how anxious and avoidant attachment partnerships happen very often. And the reason for that is because you are subconsciously looking for ""the right"" partner. So it is a person that will make you remember, trigger or relive trauma or childhood experiences so you can expose yourself to that, heal from it and grow as a person."
ookpli,1,2021-07-21,Difficult Catch 22 Job Hunt,ajteitel,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ookpli/difficult_catch_22_job_hunt/,"Maybe someone with a bit more experience can give me a bit of insight into my awkward position and how they got though it.

I recently graduated from ASU with a BS in Technological Entrepreneurship and Management (+sociology minor). Don't worry if you haven't heard of it. Basically it's engineering management but less technical with a wider range of practiced disciplines. Or to call it by its true name, generalist leadership skills. After a product management internship in 2020, I'm looking to begin a career in or building up to it on the agile track (analyst, owner, scrum master, etc). I am also a certified Scrum master. Additionally lots of academic project management and other supervisory work experience, but that doesn't hold much weight.

Here is the trouble I am in. I am getting (relatively) lots of interviews for roles like assoc/junior PM, analyst, and a few consultant roles, but so far it has all been rejections. Disappointing, but to be expected. From what I have experienced, the main problem comes not just from a general lack of experience, but difficulty communicating from personal experience well enough how I can best fill the role. Half because three months isn't much time to gain true experience, half because the internship itself was rather unorganized (was their first PM intern) scattering my attention across many departments rather then giving me a good focus and a fully delivered product.

It feels like to get a product role at any level, you need to have been in that role before. The way I've seen to get one normally is to be part of a normal team and get promoted up. Problem is with my major, I was taught the soft skills first and less of the hard. Thus the position I am generally going for requires experience to get in, which I have enough to get interviews, but so far not enough to land a position. The more ""traditional"" way is less of an option unless I want to get another degree.

I'm not fretting too much. I am getting interviews and it has only been two, three months since graduation. Treating this like a summer vacation/job hunt before I find an interim job. But after two really good opportunities where I was past the final interview went down the drain, I'm feeling a bit stuck. My previous network connections who I could ask advice from has gone dark and I'm back to the beginning of my search.

If anyone has any experience getting out of this experience catch 22 either with product or another field, I'd love to hear any advice you can give. Also if there are any job titles that fit that may not be as well known, please share."

ooo1fo,2,2021-07-21,How to know what to want and what to need? Need Academic and life advice,_thisbemythrowaway_,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ooo1fo/how_to_know_what_to_want_and_what_to_need_need/,"I'm an engineering student from India. Ive had a good academic performance since my school days up until my engineering college. We people have an entrance exam called IITJEE and its a rat race. I gave up 2 years of my social life, going out and living in the moment, and mostly everything i enjoyed for this sake and i honestly i enjoyed studying for it. But during that time i had a huge fight with one of the closest friends i had. I would say i loved her a lot. I tried my best to not let that affect me but in the end i had lost control of my emotions sitting day in day out in front of books for 12-15 hours for 2 years. 

I took engineering because i enjoyed building things. Since childhood i had a knack for it and mostly it was electrical stuff. Tinkering around with circuits, and motors and stuff i could find my hand as a kid. 
Even though i had a good performance in my entrance exam, I couldn't get the branch of study i wanted and ended up compromising for the sake of a good college.

But that turned out to be a mistake. I never felt attached to what i studied. In my days of prep for JEE i had fallen in love with my studies. I'd go as far to say physics helped me be sane during those days. But i saw how horrible our college education is. I hated everything and everyone around me for the following year and a half until at my lowest point i decided stuff needs to change. I tried disciplining myself, studying what i wanted to and neglecting my curriculum, exercising, trying to find new friends. Just as things were getting better the pandemic struck and the entire world and balance i had created for myself was uprooted. We were sent back to our homes from hostels and for over a year and half I've not met them. 
I tried my best in these months. Studied harder, tried to get a better skill base and tried all things i could remotely. I ended up getting a research internship at a really prestigious college but it turned out to be a big waste of precious months. And in the end i got no recognition, or a certificate for it. I also could never get the discipline i had built for myself in hostel back at home. To summarise the last 2-3 months, i caught covid, my grandfather died and i had to write my exams while being burdened with assignments all at once. And then i started working an internship immediately after my sem got over and a month into it i had to travel away to my village because my grandmother fell sick and my entire work environment was disturbed(when granpa died I couldn't go becoz i had covid. Grandma fell ill a month after i recovered). I still could manage until my network gave way, and i could no longer remotely work. I couldn't really get work off my mind in those few days because at this point i didn't realise how stressed i was. After a week or do im back at home but my brain has just stopped working.

I just stare at my reading material on my laptop for hours and am not able to digest a word of it. The Code and math which was easy before doesnt make sense to me anymore. Because of this i also had a miscommunication with my place of internship and got scolded. 
I've been stuck in a limbo. I can't feel anything anymore. I got the first stipend of my life and felt nothing. I just feel empty, or extremely stressed. I get triggered at every smallest inconvenience. I sleep to avoid being awake. I feel like ive wasted my parent's money with my education as ive not confidently learnt anything out of my degree.

Being academically strong was heavily attached to my identity. I found purpose in learning what i wanted to. But now even that has been stripped off and I don't know what to even want. I see my peers putting in effort for stuff they want. I also am putting in a huge ton of effort but i never see purpose anymore. I dont know what i want. I dont have any alcohol, smoking or drug addictions, n never have i been in a relationship. I'd say im addicted to masturbating tho. I've tried a lot to follow no-fap but relapse each time. Maybe a part of the problem is in there but i just know that its not what the main factor is because i feel nothing with the orgasm. Its a 2 second emptiness in my mind, but that's all. I write poems sometimes, and have a diary, play mu guitar at times but never enjoy anything i do in life.

How do I understand what i want? Or even where is the problem and what do I do about it?

Honestly I'm not even sure of what i want to ask or what advice i need.

Sorry for ranting so much but i just needed to put this out there."

Need any advice from people in a similar situation.,throwaway38948912,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ooo5yp/adhd_is_chipping_away_my_motivation_and_career/,"I am a 19/M (turning 20 this year) and-throughout my life I've been struggling with ADHD, badly. I am the ultimate definition of being book smart and street dumb. 

I am currently in Uni, but my ADHD is permanently plaguing me and I frequently try to impulsively switch majors/uni. It started off with optometry when I'm 17, then it became Chemistry and now after self-studying a few months of programming I want to switch majors again to compSci. (Turns out path was closed since January, why can't my ADHD trigger 6 months ago?) This is inhibiting me in life, as I spend more time wondering 'if this path is valid' then ACTUALLY doing it. I need to FOCUS on one path but it has been an immense struggle so far. 

My parents, despite saying that they 'Support me in whatever I do', have ZERO faith in me whatsoever. I was discussing to them about dedicating the summer break to better myself physically, build up confidence and self-learn programming, but their body language and what they say told me that everything I do would be futile anyways, and I should follow their conventional path instead. They  frequently compare myself to their friends son/daughter that are more successful, that found all these crazy internships. I get it, I couldn't fucking hold a call center job for more than 3 days because I couldn't focus at all during the calls (It was in Chinese and my Chinese sucks) and couldn't handle being destroyed verbally through the phone. One day I just broke down because of their lack of faith and my fear of disappointing them, but the very next week they made me feel like a piece of shit again by downplaying my efforts during the summer. They also have zero respect for my ADHD and thinks it's just a bunch of words/excuse. I will permanently be thankful for them financially funding me but I would like to stop being treated like an investment.

I'm honestly at a point where I don't know what to do, and my motivation and confidence is being dried out. I can't stay focused down a career path for shit. I like programming a lot, CS concepts intrigue me and I've never felt this way academically. Should I continue down this path of Chemistry (Which I do not hate) and self-learn CS? I know this is a question that I need to answer myself but I just need anyone, someone to let me know it's the right choice."

I have had experiences with the public from my internships, so I know how to be in public (kinda), but I am dealing and always dealt with self esteem issues, my appearance sucks ass, I have huge glasses that make my eyes small and basically I'm a really negative and stressed person, I'm not an agreessive dude, the way I deal with stees is basically shitting on my self esteem.

Now, I applied to this job because I wanted to get more comfortable, confident and experienced with the public, I'm looking forward to all the negative responses because that's the only way to grow, by sucking and improving, but I don't want to turn this into a shit show and get absolutely fucked and made fun of, so I ask, how could I make of this a good experience?

I should add that I'm not working there yet, I was selected but I'm still gonna be teached and they are going to see if they want to make a contract with me, I'm absolutely ok with it, but I really wanted to be there for a long time, or maybe not (depending on how it really is) and I really wanted to get paid but they don't even get paid the minimum without commissions, basically if I want to get well paid i have to work for it and make people clients of the company, wich again, I'm totally okay with, you get what you deserve, but I know for a fact that I'm not gonna be able to make people clients, everyone hates salesman that go door to door, fucking annoying people and now I'm one of them.

Any advice would be cool, if you guys have an advice specially on how to be a great salesman then I would love that.

Anyways thanks!"

To give some quick background, I landed my dream internship with a publishing company a couple of months ago. During my time as an intern, I felt like I was doing a great job. I loved my team, I had the best projects, and I knew that this industry was right for me during my 8 weeks there. Somehow, I landed a full-time position with the same company and team right as my internship was coming to an end and now I feel COMPLETELY UNDERQUALIFIED. 

I've been full-time for about two months now and I still feel like I make the dumbest mistakes on a daily basis. My boss is very understanding, but I feel like every project I do is returned with a slew of notes and I can't help but feel guilty. They hired me because I was a great intern and now, I feel like I'm not living up to my supervisor's expectations. 

I work remotely, so the majority of our conversations are through email and I feel like my inbox is just filled with criticisms. Because we can't have regular face-to-face conversations, I get into my own head and convince myself that she must be so annoyed with me, or regretful that she hired the intern. I just think that 2 months in, I should be doing better and I feel very isolated and anxious about getting fired or something. 

This is my first 'big girl' job, this is my first position in the publishing industry, AND my first remote job as well so maybe I'm just overwhelmed. 

I've never felt this discouraged before and I just want to know if others have gone through something similar. If so, do you have any advice?"

I'm currently on the hunt for internships, and I find it annoying that I have no clue how my resume is being parsed by companies. Lever used to have a public api that people used to test their resumes, but it's been shut down for a while now. I found a hacky work-around to see how lever parses your resume. Simply install my [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lever-parser-extension/cjaebcdmenhepnpldppdeefjgbbpjjbc/related?hl=en), go to a lever application form (url should end with '/apply'), and click the parse button! You should get a json file containing the parsed output from your resume! If you like it, please consider leaving a star on [GitHub](https://github.com/KnlnKS/lever-parser-extension).

oovkrq,3,2021-07-21,Where do I take my career now?,__fauxdeveloper,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/oovkrq/where_do_i_take_my_career_now/,"I've been ruminating on this for a while - I enjoy my enterprise role. There's a good few benefits to it.

I'm the lead (sole) web developer. I get to direct how we built websites, technologies etc. I've got a team which consists entirely of interns. I get to mentor them and I've got my own report - an intern developer. 

I've got my own projects that I work on with that team and they drive a good deal of value to the company and they look great on those interns resumes. There's a lot of wiggle-room in my role, which means that I can realistically get involved in almost anything in tech at the company.

Any of our larger projects are contracted out because ""who would maintain them?"". Totally valid, but I want to work on more complex pieces of software. Generally, I can work with those teams but it's more as a 'technical architect'.

A lot of the time, I feel like the smartest in the room. It's great for my ego, but I want to work with smarter people and learn how to write better code and different types of applications. 

I don't know where my career is going to go from here. At this place, the end of the path is enterprise architecture. That sounds awful to me, at least short term. The pay is also less than market rate. Whilst I'm not chasing any kind of cash, it would make life a whole lot better! I've been in role for around 12 months now. 

I was offered a place at a proper software company with a 50% raise 5 months ago. A colleague of mine took a job there and he's loving life. I definitely have a pang of regret here and I'm worried that if I stay here, am I going to hurt my long-term prospects as a developer?


tl;dr underpaid and unable to develop code in a full capacity. do I move to a proper tech place?


---

Cons:

* Unable to work on anything complex with contract developers
* Below market-rate salary (compared to a base developer)
* Potential harm to hire-ability long-term (?)

Pros:

* Direct the company's technical direction (at the code level)
* Enjoy mentoring interns
* Get my own team (of intrens)

ooy5te,4,2021-07-21,"Can't find a job since graduation, applied to 500+ jobs.",SnowyGiraffe,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ooy5te/cant_find_a_job_since_graduation_applied_to_500/,"As the titles suggests, I've been struggling to find a job.

A little bit about me, I'm 26M from Canada, I graduated with a bachelors in computer engineering in May 2020 (right as the pandemic hit, lucky me). Unfortunately I was never able to do internships during my studies due to personal reasons, so my professional experience is lacking, I know this doesn't help my case. I've been working part-time at restaurant for the time being.

I primarily search for jobs in the IT field, such as software dev, systems admin, computer technician. I try to put a few hours into job hunting almost every day, and have applied to up to 30-ish jobs in a single day. I believe my resume is good, and formatted correctly. I personalize each cover letter with the skills that I have and that the employer searching for. I apply for jobs that I'm underqualified, qualified, and overqualified for. I've had help from friends and family members that refer me to their employers and get a good word in for me. I do some side projects in my free time, and have a portfolio that showcases my work (personal and school projects).

All that, and I've only had 5 interviews, two of which completely ghosted me after I tried to follow up multiple times. The other two responded after about a week with the bad news. And most recently, a job I was so confident for, where everything went right, and I still got the boot.

I'm trying to understand where I'm going wrong, could it really just be my lack of experience at this point? I'm looking for all the advice I can get, and/or words of encouragement.  I've read so many posts on this sub, I've been keeping my head up for the most part, but this is getting really really exhausting and I'm starting to lose hope."

**Academics**

* GPA (UW/W): 3.5 ish UW / 3.98 W (school doesn't do uw but it should be around that) - got a C in math sophomore + junior year, quite a few Bs. basically 2/3 of my grades were As

* AP/IB: Calc AB (4), Psych (4), World History (4), Stats (3), Lang (3), Physics 1 (3), APCSA (1- did not report lol). - honestly these were not too hot and didn't really help my app i think? the junior year online exams really hurt my scores, esp for psych and lang imo but i'm chilling

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

*List all extracurricular involvements, including leadership roles, time commitments, major achievements, etc.*

1. Shift leader and Advertisement Scriptwriter for a Congressional Campaign, 200+ hours, 3k+ constituents called (11-12)

*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*

1. National History Day State Level Award
2. Multiple regional awards in film/photography
3. TSA awards
4. National Merit Commended
5. listed the honor societies i am in
6. EXTRA: I won a few scholastic awards in mid-january, which I informed my ed2 school about through email and they were added to my file. Would've informed my rds if i hadn't gotten in ed2.

**Letters of Recommendation**

1. AP Lang Teacher (7-8/10)- I was one of the best students in the class and she liked me. The form she had us fill out for recs was also very comprehensive and she's an amazing writer, so I have no doubt that this rec was great. One of my fav teachers in hs.
2. History/Psych Teacher (7-8/10)- I had her for two classes junior year, and she is also one of my favorite teachers. Participated a lot in these classes, set the curve for tests, and won awards for a project I did etc. She told me to ask her for a rec if I needed one, and I did! I basically gave her no extra info to write the rec tho, but it was probably good!
3. Counselor - No rating, but she's an amazing, helpful person, and the form I filled out for her was pretty comprehensive, so pretty sure this was solid.

**Interviews**

Swarthmore (4/10)- My interviewer kind of pushed me to talk abt my political views, and even though we were on the same spectrum politically, it kind of caught me off guard and I fumbled a lot. Also, was one of those interviews you have to sign up for yourself, and those have like a 30 min time limit which feels pretty rushed.

**Essays**

Common App (6.5/10)- Honestly, could have been way better. Writing is one of my strong suits and I completely freaked myself out bc I felt like my common app had to be perfect. Most people who read it liked it, but a couple people didn't understand it at all. It was a pretty good idea, but I never had an actual admissions person read it, so no clue how it looked to aos.

Supps (average 8/10)- Genuinely was proud of all my supps, save a few of the early ones. They were well-written and unique, and people who read them liked them. By no means perfect, I could probably point out flaws in all of them rn, but I did the best I could do at the time and it shows.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* George Mason EA (Honors College)
* Virginia Commonwealth University Rolling (4k/yr merit)
* Hawaii Pacific University EA (18k/yr merit)
* UT Dallas rolling (3k/yr merit)
* University of Pittsburgh rolling
* College of William and Mary ED2 (Attending!)

*Waitlists: (did not stay on any bc i had been admitted ed2)*

* Virginia Tech EA (lol this one was a surprise but tech decisions this year were a shitshow)
* Fordham (got deferred EA and didn't fill out their deferral form bc i didn't care anymore but they still kept me in the pool?)
* Texas A&amp;M (again, a weird one. they just said they had no more space in their class so i could join the wl if i wanted. lesson to not apply on the last day of a rolling deadline LOL)

*Rejections:*

* University of Virginia ED

Withdrawn:

* Brown
* Cornell
* Scripps
* Swarthmore
* George Washington
* University of Maryland

**Additional Information:**

I submitted an art portfolio to my ED2 school and all my RD schools that accepted one. I chickened out of submitting one to my ED1 school because I didn't feel confident enough. After I got rejected from that school, I attended national portfolio review day and got to meet w a professor from WashU who told me my portfolio was unique, interesting, and worth submitting. Obviously, idk what impact it had on AOs bc i'm not one, but I truly believe it did help me get into my ED2 school, especially bc multiple pieces from it won Scholastic awards. Moral of the story is: Be confident!! and get feedback abt ur art! 

A2C helped me sm in my app process but most of the art stuff I had to figure out myself, so if u have any questions abt portfolio stuff pls comment on this or dm me!

I also didn't know I was gonna major in polisci till like summer of 2020 but it made perfect sense with my goals? I never knew what I wanted to major in until I actually got political experience so if ur a rising senior and still unsure don't worry! the clarity will come &lt;3"
ooz11t,5,2021-07-21,I'm killing myself tonight. I've been in constant pain and nausea for months now. I've lost 20kg in 3 months. I'm malnourished. No one knows what I have. I can't take this anymore.,GoodByeEvery1,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ooz11t/im_killing_myself_tonight_ive_been_in_constant/,"Life is fucking bullshit. Karma is fucking bullshit. ""Do good"" is fucking bullshit. ""Hard work"" is bullshit. It's all fucking bullshit, all of it.

I'm a CSA survivor. I'm poor, but I work hard. I got in one of the most prestigious public universities in my country, with a very high cutoff. I was a good student. I always work hard and do my best. I help others. I donate money. I donate so much fucking money. I donated over three minimum wages earlier this year to several different charities. I do my best to help people. I do. I fucking do. 

I'm only 20. I cannot fucking take this anymore. I'm too young to feel like this. I'm too young for my body to fucking break down like this.

I'm in constant pain and nausea. Constant. All the time. They alternate sometimes, but the ""breaks"" I get are brief, and they keep getting shorter. Most of the time, it's pain and nausea. Constantly.

Nothing helps my nausea. Nothing. I was prescribed ondansetron hydrochloride for the nausea, the same medication people prescribe to cancer patients going through chemotherapy, same dose. It. Did. Not. Fucking. Help. Me. Apparently my body resists the effect for some reason. It only cut my nausea by fucking half *on a good day.* It did not fucking help. And yet it still did better than *any other antiemetic I've tried,* with one exception (the one below).

Then I was prescribed domperidone. THAT helped my nausea a lot. It was so nice for a little while. But I had to stop, because apparently prolonged use of domperidone is dangerous. I was only supposed to take it for 1 week maximum. I took it for ten days, because of just how fucking good it felt to not be nauseous. But it didn't last.

It's so hard to eat. I no longer take any pleasure in fucking eating. I've been put in a bland diet for IBD (despite not having an IBD diagnosis) and it **HAS BARELY FUCKING HELPED.** It has only made me feel more miserable. I cannot eat anything that I like. And even when I try, the nausea and the fear of how I'm gonna feel after eating it make the experience absolutely fucking unpleasant. I cannot fucking enjoy any of it. 

I'm heavily malnourished and **NO MATTER WHAT I FUCKING EAT**, **REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH I TRY,** MY BODY DOES **NOT** ABSORB ANY OF IT.

According to my last blood tests I have vitamin C deficiency (scurvy), vitamin A deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency and vitamin D deficiency and I take pills for all of those. Most are daily. Doctor told me to take them just for a while. I ended up taking them for 2 months. Did not help.

I try my best to fucking eat a ""healthy"" fucking diet every single day. It makes no fucking difference. My body simply doesn't absorb anything. I don't fucking know why.

I was at 70kg months ago. I'm now at 50.9kg. And I'm 1.65m tall. I look like a skeleton. I'm so fucking ugly. I'm the ugliest fucking woman to ever fucking live. I look **terrible.** I look disgusting.

And those are not my only symptoms. They're only the ones I'm not embarrassed to tell other people about. That's not even the beginning of the fucking humiliation. There's so much more.

Diarrhea and constipation for me are routine. There are days where I'll HAVE to go to the bathroom several times a day with diarrhea until my bowels are fucking bleeding. It's literally impossible to fucking hold. It's like if I ate something bad every single hour of the day, except I wasn't really eating anything, it was my body alone. And then there are weeks where I'll be unable to go the bathroom at all, and the pain is so much worse when that happens. I was given a fuckton of laxatives for those days, and yet all they do is trigger the diarrhea instead. I'm fucking terrified of taking any of them.

And there are almost no good days in between those. You might have thought there are, but no, when it's not one thing, it's another. I cannot, I CANNOT, fucking enjoy anything anymore. **EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING I FUCKING DO IN MY LIFE** is interrupted by either me throwing up, trying not to throw up, shitting myself, *trying* not to shit myself, or being unable to focus at all due to how much pain I'm experiencing.

And after several lab tests including blood and stool samples, a CT scan and an MRI; nothing. All the lab tests showed was that my intestines are *absolutely* bleeding, and are *absolutely* inflamed as fuck. Imaging exams showed even less. Two hernias, and that's it. Literally nothing else.

And I had to wait **so long** for these. I don't wanna disclose my location but my country has a public health system, and it's literally the only fucking way I was able to afford all of those exams, which is AWESOME, but because of how underfunded it is, the waiting times between the appointments are long, the waiting times between expensive exams like a CT scan or MRI are **fucking massive.** I waited a full **six weeks** for this MRI. In pain. And it showed fucking nothing.

There are so many fucking days where I wish I could just be diagnosed with something like fucking cancer or something just so this would be fucking over. I just want to fucking die. I do not want to go through several examinations and lab tests and imaging and continue to be in fucking pain while I wait. I can't fucking do this anymore. I cannot. I fucking can't.

There are so many times when I wish I was diagnosed with cancer or something of the sort JUST so people would fucking stop acting as if I was fucking okay. I can't fucking study like this. I can't fucking work like this. I'm supposed to be getting an internship soon. How THE FUCK am I gonna do this? I cannot get out of bed. I'm so fucking fatigued. I feel fucking awful. I'm a fucking skeleton. I can't even walk all the way to the university, and online classes are gonna be over by end of the year. I'm gonna have to go there again, but how the fuck am I supposed to hold myself together there? I'm fucking pitiful.

And no one is understanding of it. No one gave a fuck until I got the fucking lab tests that showed I'm actually fucking bleeding inside and even then no one fucking gives that much of a fuck. I don't get calls. I don't get anything. People look at me like I'm blowing it out of proportion. They don't fucking believe me. I can't fucking take this anymore. I can't. I can't. I cant fucking do it. I cannot fucking take it anymore.

No one fucking gets it. I'm in constant. Fucking. Pain. I cannot fucking eat. Even if I do, it's useless. It's like I put myself through the physical burden of eating while nauseous and digesting food only to shit it all out with blood afterward and feel worse and repeat the fucking cycle. 

I can feel my body fucking breaking down. I'm so fatigued. I'm pretty sure I'll die soon anyway. I simply wanna speed up the process and go on my own terms.

I just wanted to write this to say goodbye before I do it. I wanted to at least feel like I left something in my depressing fucking departure. I'm not religious, I'm simply looking forward to the void now, because anything is better than this. Anything is better than being in constant fucking pain and nausea every day and still being expected to fucking work and somehow get through university.

Goodbye."

I've been kind of worried that I won't have a job lined up after I graduate and then I thought hey software internship pay isn't shabby and once the internship is done, I'll have something to put on my resume to increase the likelihood of getting a full time job.

op1wm2,2,2021-07-21,Do data analysts get tested for coding at interview ? Am i closer to 'data scientist' ?,OpinionPoop,dataanalysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/op1wm2/do_data_analysts_get_tested_for_coding_at/,"Hi. I'm actually a Physics Major concentrating in Applied Physics toward my undergrad and also getting a minor in Math. 

I've had to learn python in computational physics as well as both matlab and arduino in my advanced lab classes. In physics, we do a lot of data analysis because of the way scientific experimentation works. We often times collect thousands of data points, create graphical representations and create mathematical models to help describe what is 'going on'. Physics majors tend to get hired in various fields like research, engineering, construction, finance, marketing, analysis, etc. I'm starting my senior year this fall. 

I am also currently doing a summer internship as an analyst with the city. 

My question is, what is the interview process like?   
Do i need to get tested in python for hire as a data analyst ?   
Aside from studying 'machine learning', is there that big a difference between a data analyst and a data scientist?   
What suggestions would you offer to help me get hired as either role?

Thanks for taking the time to help."

Please help me fix this, any feedback or suggestions would be helpful",resumethr0waya,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/op1x3w/2020_grad_looking_for_entrylevel_software/,"[https://imgur.com/dXmkGHA](https://imgur.com/dXmkGHA)

Graduated in 2020 (just over a year ago). I have no internship experience. Left my GPA off cause it was only 3.1, and left off my GitHub because it only has some student projects on it. My Linkedin only has basic info(less than my resume) and very few connections, so I leave that off too. Please be very critical, I need as much advice as I can get.

What I'm thinking of doing:

\- I think I should remove my high school

\- I think I should dive further into how I self-taught myself(react native, REST, spring, Redis) and what I'm currently teaching myself(Elasticsearch, neo4j, Kafka, Kubernetes, etc) for the social media app, which is the main project I've been working on. (I think I should emphasize my willingness to learn since I have no experience). I'm not exactly sure what I should put in the bullet points for the social media app..

\- I keep the section titles blue because if I change them to black, there's no longer a clear delineation between sections

I don't want to publish the social media app to my GitHub, even though I know recruiters will want to see it to prove I can code well, because I plan on posting it to the app store once it's finished, and am concerned about exposing exploits and other security issues (also competitors). If I did post something for it, it would be a heavily redacted version of the backend only, along with some documents about the architecture, and I'm not sure how helpful that would be

Any thoughts? I'd be very grateful for any feedback"
op30ue,6,2021-07-21,Difficulty finding a new role (UK - London),9710899104101109121,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/op30ue/difficulty_finding_a_new_role_uk_london/,"Hello all, long time lurker here.

I am a Software Engineer (Front-end focused) with two and half years of experience, unfortunately, I haven't worked for the last 7 months due to major health problems and to focus on my third year of Computer Science degree.

Recently, I have started applying for new roles where I am having difficulty in reaching the offer stage, the feedback that I receive is usually ""you are technically very strong, but we went with someone with more experience"". This led me to question my overall working experience, which is weird to the say the least but allowed me to increase my salary overall immensely.

For context, I have only worked in two different companies under similar leadership. About the salary, I have gone from an intern at 15k to a Junior role at 22.5k, which raised to 35k after 6 months and the following year to 45k. After I was made redundant due to Covid last year, I moved to the new company at a high-level band which was 60k.

In my first role, I have not only filled up my role but I also worked with technologies outside of it, I have done a bit of backend work using Golang when my team needed, I have learnt to debug APEX and SOAP APIs on the Salesforce side and learnt Netsuite to temporarily replace a contractor and do minor or even extend the current work, and finally, but not least, I learnt a bit of Boomi to be able to debug and solve issues when necessary since this system was coupled to Netsuite and Salesforce and acted as a pump and drain for invoicing clients. I have also learnt SQL, which allowed me to debug issues when required. On the Front-end side, I have worked with JavaScript, TypeScript, ReactJs, Redux, Apollo Client, React Native, HTML5 and CSS3. On the Backend, besides some of the technologies above, I have worked with Nodejs and GraphQL.

I need to mention and emphasise that in this role for two-plus years I never had any kind of mentor or guidance besides when I needed to learn Netsuite and Boomi to replace the contractor at the time. No one in the company was keen to work with these systems, so I was very keen to learn and help because I am naturally curious about how all these systems work together. Which led me to put even more effort outside of work, which was detrimental for my learning ability because I ended up not learning anything well enough either academically or professionally, since for the first year or so I was studying and working full-time

I have to be honest and say I was very lucky to be in a team where we could from time to time do pair programming or whiteboarding sessions while going through the problems we were facing, it made my last year at that company bearable.

When I got hired at the new company I felt that I was a fish out of water abstract and knowledge-wise, especially for the project that we had to build.

As of lately, I have started to build some side projects with the technologies I have mentioned above, I am learning about Design Patterns which was something I didn't learn in-depth at University and I am polishing my DSA skills using LeetCode and AlgoMonster from time to time.

Finally, going back to my dilemma how do I nail the last bit of the interview process, how do I reach that offer stage? What should I expect salary range wise given my odd experience?

Ps: I have used the Student flair, but Mods feel free to change as you might deem fit."
op3d3o,164,2021-07-21,Y/N x Harvard,umuwunu,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/op3d3o/yn_x_harvard/,"THANK YOU TO i\_am\_me47 for giving me access to my fanfic again &lt;3! Here's a repost for better access.

&amp;#x200B;

Y/N has always been a stellar student. They were always focused on schoolwork, rarely having any free time. But Y/N couldn't stand the fact that they may graduate high school without ever attending a party. So they did. 

The atmosphere was... different. Formerly trapped in a world of studying and internships, they were not used to seeing high schoolers... relaxing. They hesitantly stepped into the kitchen. 

""Beer?"" Penn State offered. 

""I'm good."" Y/N responded wrinkling their nose. They were willing to go to a party but they drew the line at alcohol. 

Penn State shrugged and walked away. 

Y/N felt awkward. They didn't know who to talk to and what they were supposed to do. What do high schoolers do at parties other than drink? Had coming here been a waste of time? Maybe they should have worked more on their college essays. After all, they were due in three months! 

Anxiety began filling Y/N to the brim. Maybe they should head back home and work on their essays. They were wasting time. Maybe they should apply to an internship! There were so many things Y/N could be doing instead of being at this stupid party! Their thoughts were interrupted by a certain familiar figure. 

""What are you thinking so hard about?"" Harvard smirked. ""Your brain looks like it's about to explode."" 

Y/N's eyes narrowed. Harvard. A pretentious talented asshole. Y/N hated Harvard's guts but they had no choice but to admire him. After all, he was good at EVERYTHING. Sports? Harvard was quarterback of their football team. Academics? He was valedictorian, a title Y/N had lost to him. And of course, social life? He RAN the school. Objectively —because Y/N would never admit this themselves— Harvard was good looking and charismatic. Everyone clung to him like moths to a flame. All except Y/N. Y/N hated that Harvard got everything he wanted without trying. To make matters worse, he was from a rich family of CEOs. He had all anyone wanted in life. Everything Y/N had to work so hard to achieve. 

""None of your business."" Y/N curtly responded. 

""Who stuck a stick up YOUR ass?"" Harvard rolled his eyes. ""Never seen you at a party before, finally put the books to a rest?"" 

Y/N glared at him. ""I am NOT always studying for your information. I do many things like interning at a research lab, volunteering in third world countries, running my own 501(c) nonprofit and WRITING my essays."" 

Harvard snorted. ""You've never learned to live! Well, I'm glad you're finally out of your own little narrowminded world for once."" 

""This is such a waste of time. I don't get why people love parties so much. "" Y/N crossed their arms. 

Harvard looked at Y/N and the corners of his mouth turned upwards. He started slowly walking towards Y/N, backing them into the wall. ""Well, if you're not much of an alcohol or party person, I could show you another way to have a good time."" He commented. 

Y/N shuffled backwards nervously. What the hell was he talking about? Y/N hit the wall as Harvard closed them in between him and wall with his hands. ""W-what are you doing?"" Y/N stuttered. 

""Shh, don't talk. It ruins the vibe."" Harvard shushed them with a finger to their lip. Then slowly used his hand to cup their cheek and pull them in for a passionate kiss. ​ 

&amp;#x200B;

TBC ​ 

&amp;#x200B;

Note: Y/N ends up kissing back so all is consensual! Also anyone can pick this up, I'm too traumatized from writing this."

About a month ago my boss asked me to start training the senior citizen admin assistant to do large parts of my job. Admittedly these are the easy parts that is just a lot of busy work that eats up time. My manager said I had 30 days to train this person or else SHE would be fired. Maybe he was just putting me off the scent??

On a zoom meeting last week with a different internal department manager my manager was asked to stay on to discuss “that other issue” and I left the meeting. I think they might be ready to transition the intern from that other department into my role. 

I went into the office yesterday for the first time (I was hired during Covid) and people were acting weird around me. Admittedly it was their first or second time meeting me ever and I am quite pretty or maybe they were nervous? 

My attitude hasn’t been great for months but nothing was brought up in my review  so it would not shock me but I am listening to my gut but I don’t know ..."

The hiring manager liked my resume and pushed me towards the technical team for an interview. The team was impressed and decided to extend an offer to intern there. While this was going on, The Phoenix Group, a tech recruiter, connected with me on LinkedIn with an opportunity to get some IT experience by working at as a help desk specialist at a non-profit organization. I did an interview with the sys admin team working there and thought I bombed the interview. They asked me more technical questions than the internship and I fumbled on some of the answers. They gave me a ""we'll keep in touch"" so I assumed I didn't get the position. As a result, I decided to commit to the offer at IPG. 

A few days later, Phoenix calls me back to let me know that I did well on the interview and extended an offer to work part-time as a help desk specialist alongside the sys admins there.  The recruiter negotiated to get me $20/hr compared to the internship that pays only $17/hr. The recruiter also claims that the people who worked at that location have moved on to FT positions after 6 months and believes this company would be a great opportunity to grow with them and move up.  I noticed a lot of people, particularly on reddit hate the idea of C2Hs because of the lack of benefits and non-steady employment.  In reality, I just want a position that can replace my current security guard job that I hate and I don't mind doing either of these positions if it means getting out of security.  In terms of my situation, I live with my parents, but they don't work so I pay most of the bills, hence why I'm leaning more towards the help desk job. I wanted to know what you guys recommend?"

I'm also creating an application on my free time to get me some experience since I have none other than school. I'm being helped by my friend who has been a great mentor for me in learning languages + learning industry practices.

With my twin sister getting out of vocational school as a LVN, she has landed a full time job and has been getting her things sorted out. She recently bought a new car and now my mom has been pushing me, even yelling at me in some instances, that she wants me to find a real job already. The pressure is getting to me and getting multiple rejection letters from everywhere I apply to is killing my mental. She said that I could just work as an IT at her work (state institution), even if it's free, so that I can get the name on my resume. 

I don't wanna work for free, is that wrong to have that mentality? If I'm gonna suffer working through school, I better be paid for it, right?

I'm planning on applying to IT jobs just to get a step in, would this be the right path? I'm so anxious about the future and I need reassurance. Thank you!!"

I am a Civil engineering university student from Australia;

------------

Basically, I got offered a summer internship via email after 2 interviews in person, soon after I informed them I had an important family event planned (related to a family member passing away, the manager doesn't know this) 

I informed the manager of the dates I am taking off (6 working days), they approved this via email , thus I told my family it would be fine to book me in for accomodation for the event.


10 days later the engineering manager says I am now not able to get 'leave' as an intern does not accrue it, and is not offering me any negotiation around it (such as unpaid leave). This is because their policy is no unpaid leave for interns (she said other local companies have a similar policy too) and she believed I would have an employee leave system, rather than a non-leave intern system, but is now saying I can't take the holiday.


I am going to ask if I can work longer hours or several extra days to make up for the 6 business days, but I have a feeling this won't be approved as they seem to be quite focused on the summer period, where I will be mainly doing design work on the computer.

They have not sent through the contract yet, so I can't make much judgements from that, and technically I have not secured the internship in that sense that I haven't signed it. 

However they seem keen to keep me (according to emails) but I know they could simply rescind the offer if I put up too much protest / negotiation.

I am a hard worker because I have dreams, but I really need to be with my family and yet I know this internship (in a specialization I love) could boost my career to achieve my dreams.

opcxgs,67,2021-07-22,[IWantOut] 25F ITALY-&gt; another european country,meliip95,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/opcxgs/iwantout_25f_italy_another_european_country/,"Hello redditors, I'm unhappy with my life right now and need some life advice

Here are the facts:

After graduating University (Foreign languages and Tourism), I worked onboard of cruise ships for 2 years. It was a crazy fast-paced environment with -usually- toxic management, however crew life was awesome and I saw so many amazing places. After the pandemic, I was forced at home with no real idea about what I was gonna do. About 4 months ago a friend of mine told me there was a vacancy at the logistics company she was interning in, I sent my CV, did an interview and got hired (as an intern). In the meantime, I refused a new contract with the cruise ship (it was too risky due to the pandemic) My job is not exciting but it’s not bad either, colleagues are friendly, my boss is really nice and the atmosphere is chill.                                                                                                                                                  So here’s the issue: After pandemic restrictions started to lessen I quickly realized that outside of my job my life was pretty dull. I don’t have a lot of friends right now (some moved, some became acquaintances) and I feel like we never do anything meaningful.                                                                  No matter how proactive I was, trying to reconnect with old friends, inviting my closest friends to events, it just wouldn’t work. Some of my younger work colleagues have a group but they never invite anyone else to hang out. I visited my cousin in Portugal (she recently moved there to work) and the atmosphere was incredibly positive, everyone was nice, I hung out with strangers after talking to them for 10 minutes. These things just don’t happen here, people who have lived here all their life simply do not care about being inclusive and they’re actually pretty close-minded. It’s not a small town but it’s not an international European city either. I’m sure there’s plenty of “cool” people but meeting them in your mid-20 is really hard. Dating here is super hard for me as well.

Finding a job like this in Italy is a blessing and I feel really grateful, however I can’t help for wonder what if in 20 years that’s all I have?

&amp;#x200B;

* **Pros for leaving my job**

\- I’ll get to start a new life abroad and have the chance to meet many like minded people

\- I’ll use foreign languages again (don’t really use them rn)

\- I might eventually work in Tourism again (more challenging but also really satisfying)

\- I’ll make more memories and be more fulfilled with my life in the future

\- I might live in a place with a higher quality of life (less traffic, better public transport, better city life)

\- If I realize I made a mistake I can always go back to embarking for a few more years (hard life but good money)

\- Some of my senior colleagues and even my boss sometimes not so jokingly ask if I’m sure this is what I want to do with life (considering what I did before) This got me thinking.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Cons for leaving my job**

\- My relationships with the friend who referred me for the job might deteriorate

\- I’m losing a secure job that would become permanent in 2-3 years and a chill work atmosphere (not easy to find)

\- I’ll be away from family and my aging grandparents (I have already travelled for work so I’m used to it tbh)

\- We are still in a pandemic and we don’t know if and when we are fully coming out of it

**My three options:**

1. Stick with the city and this job for at least 2 more years and have a better chance to join another logistic company abroad, if I do that I’ll be 28 when leaving
2. Leave soon and start something else completely, go for a bit of an adventure knowing I have a plan B (Tourism and cruise ships, if the pandemic ends)
3. Abandon the idea of moving abroad, concentrate on my job and try to improve my life in my home city

I admit I’m an indecisive person, I’m still unsure which career I want to pursue, I love travelling and tourism but after the pandemic I realized that it’s a really risky field. I’m interested in HR and recruiting but I did not pursue the right education and I’m not sure I’m extroverted enough for that.

Thank you for sticking with me until now, please give me your **most brutally honest advice** and tips. Wish you all a good life."

Apart from my university coursework I studied React JS and Python in my free time, I posted my own implementation of the Game of Life in Python (PyGame), a covid tracker made with Material UI and a public RESTful API and React JS, and finally a clone of the Facebook main page with React JS, MUI and Firebase (you can create posts and I added authentication using Google). 

I hadn't done any programming before University and I'm really proud of my score and now that I have a good name and score on my resume, I would like to maximise my chances of landing a good internship next year. My course is a 4-year programme which ends with a Masters, and I'd love to get a job either at an investment bank or at FAANG, but I'd be happy with working for other good software companies.

1. I'm an EU citizen living in the UK, so I guess I'll be applying for jobs all over Europe but the UK is my first choice. How do European employers view British university students? Would it be harder for me to get a job in Europe compared to the UK?
2. What should I do to get through resume screening? I assume that a good score is probably not enough, how advanced should my Github portfolio be for FAANG? 
3. Am I screwed if I have no internship after my first year? I had close to zero coding skills and no portfolio when it was time to apply.
4. What else should I be doing to get a job? I'm doing leetcode daily."

I have recently finished a 4 year degree in Computer Science, and I have 2 years of experience in internships throughout that degree. I believe my experience would qualify me to apply for junior software developer positions as well as graduate positions. However, I recently saw a junior software position that was asking for scrum certification as a master or product owner, experience of delegating work, experience in leading agile teams and experience in managing stakeholders.

Now mind you, the actual job description doesn't include the need to lead a team. Am I right in saying those requirements are not what you'd expect for a junior position?"

For most of my job so far, I traveled to different teams in different parts of dev (QA, DevOps, and also straight up development). I landed in a dev position which I was excited about. However, the onboarding experience has been awful and I have learned next to nothing about the project I am working on. One ticket, I asked for help and a senior Developer asked me some questions, did it by themselves, and never once tried teaching me. This ticket was also way to complicated as it resulted in a new dev simply trying to learn about the program because it required architectural changes that the senior dev had to come up with for it to work. I started a new ticket that is also complicated as I am unsure how to start it. I message basically the only person that is available and they simply just do not respond even though they are in and go to standup. This isn't the first time they've straight ignored me either. They are our team lead so I'm sure I'm busy but to be ignored completely on multiple accounts is odd.

I've talked to my boss and he said he would work on getting me easier tickets and that I should reach out to person mentioned above - none of that has happened and obviously reaching out didn't work.

I just feel like a big baby at this point lol. I just want to learn and be good at development but I have no idea how. The scrum master on me team acts like these tickets I've been given should I just be easily done/at the same rate as other devs. It is just so disheartening to sit and stare at a project all day, having no way to understand it or learn about it. And on top of that going to standup saying I'm working on the same ticket over and over. They onboarded someone else with my experience and although I know their onboarding was different, they are doing much better and seem to have learned but they have been with the team previously.

I am just at a loss. My internship sucked and now at this position that I thought would be way better sucks. I just want to learn and be good at my job and it just seems impossible. Is it time to look for a different career? Is it me? Is this situation impossible?"
opflrp,7,2021-07-22,Does anyone's mind toggle between feeling really ambitious and feeling really lazy towards this field?,rice_python,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/opflrp/does_anyones_mind_toggle_between_feeling_really/,"I saw this post earlier, and it reminded me that I've been inconsistent with my motivation:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/op3evp/its\_okay\_to\_not\_want\_to\_be\_the\_best\_in\_this\_field/](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/op3evp/its_okay_to_not_want_to_be_the_best_in_this_field/)

&amp;#x200B;

I realized that in the past 3 years, my mind has been repeatedly toggling between these 2 phases:

**Phase 1:** feeling very ambitious and driven, and wanting to score high-paying, prestigious internships.

**Phase 2:** feeling extremely lazy, unmotivated, picking all the bird courses in school and not wanting to do any coding outside of school/work and just watch shows and play games all day. (**Just finished undergrad and I'm going through this phase right now LOL**)

&amp;#x200B;

I suppose phase 1 was probably caused by me comparing myself to the top 20% in my school, while phase 2 was probably me feeling burnt out. I consider myself to be an average coder. I've seen what the top 20% is like in my class, and I'm definitely nowhere close to them. When I work hard, I tell myself I should relax a bit. And when I'm being to relaxed and having a lot of fun, I feel guilty for not being productive.

I work at a very big company with many different locations, divisions, etc. and quite a lot of options to move up the career ladder, relocate, etc.
The thing is: I’ve never worked at another company (first internship up until my full-time job now that I’ve had for 2 years), so in total it’s been 4 years now.

I’ve been thinking about making some changes in my career, and I was just wondering: is it advisable to look for positions at the company I currently work for? The working conditions, pay and benefits are exceptional and switching jobs internally would be much easier. 
Or is it time to look for jobs at another company after 4 years (or more if I stay) even if that might mean less money etc? 
Doesn’t it look weird to future employers if I’ve only worked for one company all my life?
I work in tech, and I’ve heard multiple times that you should switch jobs every 2-3 years anyway, is that true?

Sorry for bad english and thanks!"
opftn6,4,2021-07-22,Corporate Dread starting to kick in during an internship - Starting to look at Academia or Research as a better option,AnonymousCSRantAcc,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/opftn6/corporate_dread_starting_to_kick_in_during_an/,"The beginning of the internship started out great, I was learning a lot and the office is full of good people. But as time goes on that feeling of corporate dread is starting to kick in. And this is 4 days a week in the summer! Imagine full time over a year, I think I could be miserable. Commuting to an office, sitting at a desk staring outside, working on boring CRUD apps, missing out on exploration and teaching myself more interesting CS concepts, is starting to take its toll.

Of course, it depends on the company, this is a medium sized company so maybe I would like bigger or smaller more. And the work we do here is all basic CRUD for customers who I don't find interesting at all. But I feel like the only other options you can do with a B.S is embedded systems, and all of the fun stuff requires grad school.

I think it would be absolutely amazing to have a PhD, answer a real question in a thesis, and all of it. I know academia and industry research has their own problems. Less pay early career, potentially pigeonholed by a niche subfield, issues with peer review, high bar to get into top PhD programs, but all of it comes with the benefits of getting to ask and answer questions, and really constantly learn.

When I think of the people I look up to, many of them are professors or researchers in some way. And I think this internship is starting to show me that. I am still early on, going to be a sophomore, so I have plenty of time to take lots of math classes, do undergraduate research, and potentially dual major in something like cognitive science. 

Has anyone else ever come to a similar realization? Am I romanticizing the PhD and research process? Separate to career I need to travel, explore, camp, and be outside, and I don't think corporate has that flexibility to offer me."

opgouu,88,2021-07-22,My employer was screwing me out of overtime pay so I reported it and got it back and then some. Figured you all might like this story.,timeslider,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/opgouu/my_employer_was_screwing_me_out_of_overtime_pay/,"This company, I'll call A contacted my school during my last semester. They were looking for the best student the school had and that just happened to be me. It was at a community college and I had some university experience so I was killing it there (4.0 GPA)

A wanted me to do an internship which was fine but it wasn't an internship at all. It was just unpaid work. I had to teach myself things. That was annoying and lasted a month. At the time, I really needed a job so I took it. After the internship, I thought they would hire me but apparently they didn't trust me enough yet so they switched me to an independent contractor. This is problematic because it means I have to pay more in taxes and I have to pretty much lie on my tax return because I don't own a business. That lasted 4 months. I needed the money so I kept my mouth shut.

After 4 months, they hired me as a regular employee even though my job duties didn't change from intern, to independent contractor, to employee. Meaning I should have been an employee the whole time.

I thought I was in the clear. The pay was decent for my area so I figured I'd let it all slide, sweep it under the rug. But then about 4 months later, they decided they didn't like the IT administrator so they wanted me to start learning his job. The problem is they wanted me to stay 2 hours over each day and have him train me but I had to clock out and into another company they owned that was in the same building that I'll call B. So I was clocking into to B but still working for A so they could avoid paying me overtime. Of course, that's not how it works. I can't create 2 companies and work an employee 80 between both of them and not have to pay them overtime. It's even worst because I wasn't working for B at all. If this happens to you, it's called joint employment.

I wasn't hurting for money too much at this time, so I said, ""Fuck it, I'm not going to say anything and let it build up and then slam them with a complaint down the line."" Maybe if they were nice I would have been nice back but my boss is rude and manages via intimidation and fear. So of course, she has to pay the asshole tax.

In the end, it didn't work out exactly as I'd hope but it wasn't too bad either. I told a coworker and she got scared that I was going to mention her name when I complained. No idea why she'd think that. I'd never drag her into it but whatever. So they found out about it from her and within 3 weeks my desk was moved making my job more difficult, my overtime hours were stopped, one of my breaks was taken away (and then given back the next day after she talked with her lawyer lol), I furloughed for 90 days—during which someone else got hired to replace my position—and finally then I got a letter saying my position was eliminated altogether even though it wasn't. They claimed I was furloughed and the position was eliminated because of economic hardship due to covid-19 but they had hired another person about a month before I was furloughed, hired my replacement during my furlough, and had their leaky roof fixed which cost about 2 million according to my friend who still works there (probably not accurate though). I'm not buying their reasoning and hopefully a judge won't either.

After I got the letter, I submitted a complaint to the Department of Labor. They investigated the whole company and looked into all the employees. Turns out, they were screwing over a lot of their employees. About 15 people got between 300 and 600 dollars. I was rewarded about 2000 plus another 2000 for punitive damages. They flushed 1300 down the drain training me. It has already cost them but they aren't out of the woods yet.

I've also submitted two complaints to the IRS for when they misclassified me. They haven't made a judgement on that yet but they said it does appear to be the case that I was misclassified.

And finally, I submitted a claim for retaliation. I wasn't expecting them to do that but once I noticed they were, I started documenting everything I could. My boss making me move my desk near hers was the dumbest decision she could have made. She thought I didn't know what was going on but HR told IT and I'm friends with IT so he told me. I started documenting everything and while pretending I didn't know anything. I probably could have said something which was what I had originally planned but I have a lot of anxiety.

I'll update you guys on the IRS ruling and the retaliation complaint as soon as I hear something.

What's sad is that I gave these people my all and they just screwed me every chance they got. I worked there for 18 months. I missed 1 hour of work because my phone died in the middle of the night. I was really good at my job, my fellow coworkers liked me. You couldn't have asked for a better employee but they went out of their way to take advantage of me.

I just don't get it. Like, bitch, I'm on YOUR TEAM. I'm busting my ass to make YOU richer and instead of being nice and delighted you, fuck me over? What the fuck is wrong with you?

This isn't the first time they've been caught doing something like this. A few years ago, they got caught  by imports/customs for claiming some goods they were shipping was only 10,000 dollars when it was worth 100,000 dollars to avoid paying so much tax on it. They were fined over 911,000 dollars + 250,000 in lawyer fees. I know this because I personally saw it in the database thanks to IT."

I am very passionate about getting into the field of DevOps/Site Reliability and two of my offers are for an SRE role.

The offers:
* Data Scientist at One of the Big 4 (consulting, not tech) TC of 65K
* SRE at Goldman Sachs with a TC of 120K
* SRE at a product based tech company with a TC of 200k

Of course the Big4 isn’t a consideration by any means, so I wanted to get an opinion if it’s worth choosing Goldman Sachs (solely on the basis of it’s brand name/image and exit status advantage) over a product based tech company with a good work/life balance? I’ve heard a couple of experiences where people tend to be overworked at financial companies and they don’t get the same level of attention, budget and perks as the actual people on the trade floor or management roles in GS.

I would love to hear your thoughts on this, as I am mostly leaning towards the product based company over GS. I am not sure if this is the correct sub for this question or would I be better off posting this in r/itcareerquestions? Thanks in advance for any advice!"

The only IT experience/knowledge I have is from my current Helpdesk Internship this summer and the courses and projects completed at my college. I studied for the exam from May to now.  

Resources I used in this order:

**Darril Gibson's GCGA book**. I read the entire book and took every end-of-chapter quiz. I took the post-assessment exam and the pre-assessment exam after I finished reading the book. I scored around 77% on the post-assessment exam (I took that first) and scored around 84% on the pre-assessment exam.

**Professor Messer's SYO-501 videos.** There are 141 videos, and I watched all of them.

**Messer's Exams.** I **s**cored 70% on first, 74% on second, and 88% on the last. Messer's questions are similar to the exam with wording and trying to trick you, but do not expect the questions to be exactly like Messer's. The pbq's will get you prepared for the exam, but I thought the exam pbq's were much harder. 

**Post Exam Thoughts.** I took the exam in person and had a good experience. I felt unconfident going further and further into the exam. There were a handful of questions I answered unconfidently. I finished the exam right when the clock hit 0:00. I struggled a bit with time management. I think if I took Dion's practice exams, it could have help me with managing my time better. The exam questions try to make you second guess yourself. Lots of scenario-based questions and asking you which is the ""BEST"" option. A good amount of log analyzing questions which were more challenging than any I saw on practice exams. There are a lot of abbreviations on the exam, so make sure you know them. I see many people in this forum stuck on memorizing all 35 protocols, but my exam only required knowledge of the common protocols. 

I'm super excited about passing and now thinking about what is next for me. I'm considering my next certification either being Net+ or the CYSA+. I will be looking/applying to jobs as well since I will be graduating in spring '22. Hopefully, some of this information helps anyone taking the 501 before it expires, good luck!"

Everything is great and I learn new stuff everyday there, but what kinda bugs me is that programming and working on new features is probably around 3-4 hours a day, the rest is meetings, planning and so on. I totally get that it's how things need to be, but I started thinking that I don't code as much in my work as I used to just working on my own projects. I started to feel that I need to code more after work, at least 2 hours a day to learn more, use that knowledge in my work and get an offer from this company after the internship ends. And not only that, I have few ideas for apps that I want to make and it gives me so much satisfaction to create a project just on my own.
 
However, after I come back home from work I can't really do any meaningful work as I'm just tired and sleepy. 

Have any of you found themselves in a similar situation? Have you got any tips on how to get focused for a few more hours after work and also don't start to hate programming when coding after hours?

EDIT: Thanks everyone for your suggestions, help and input. I got so many comments I can't really reply to everyone, but once again thanks a lot. 
I got a feeling after reading some of the comments I was a bit misunderstood. I don't say meetings are not important and that I don't want to attend them. Quite the contrary! People saying meetings are as important part of software development as coding are right and I totally agree! That's why I want to code more AFTER work and work on my personal projects.

After reviewing a resume, do employers look into the program to see what the applicant studied? Or do they judge by the name?
For example:
School A is a small not well known school but provides a set course schedule, guest speakers, and winter workshops. Cohort based curriculum that uses corporate partners’ current data sets, requires a summer internship plus a semester long practicum. They also boast about 100% of their graduates are employed in data science positions.
School B is a very big school and very well known. Very reputable computer science school. This of course results in great connections and corporate partners. Curriculum offers a ton of electives, offers a 6+ month coop and is located in a tech hub. Boasts that graduates work at Dell, IBM, Amazon, etc., but no real stat on employed graduates. 

I know this may not be the best example for you to judge, but would it be foolish of me to think that School A sounds too good to be true? While School B seems great but leaves some question marks, especially for the money it will cost. 
I’m really stuck on making this decision where to go and any opinion would be greatly appreciated."

I consider myself intermediate level in Excel and also put it on my curriculum (never lied about it), with the exception of the basics functions and formulas, I know countifs, sumifs, pivot table, if, vlookup, I'm also doing the Excel Basics Free Course from ExcelIsFun to remember the concepts and learn new things because I never did a specific course, all I know I learned by myself.

In the job advertisement, they only mentioned:

Perform service in the administrative area according to the company's needs.

Ease of computing/computer skills (Sorry for some weird words, english isn't my native language, this was the best I could translate)

Experience in the administrative area. 

I just gave a quick look in the company's website and some services they do are b2b distribution, b2c distribution, courier milk, run back, hall transfers and container transport.

Is there something I should know in Excel that a logistics company would use or anything that could help me?"
opq18s,6,2021-07-22,How can I find a remote internship?,[deleted],internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/opq18s/how_can_i_find_a_remote_internship/,"I'm supposed to start my internships on october (although I need to declare to my school where I'm making them by August). I'm studying IT and I'm having a hard time finding somewhere to make them.

It's specially hard because I want to focus on web development, but living in the middle of nowhere I can't find a place that does that sort of thing. I also have trouble because, I can't relocate and I still don't have the vaccine (not a personal choice).

I sent my linkedin profile + CV + github profile to some companies that offer remote internships. I got two interviews but never heard from both of them again.

What other things would you suggest to try?"
opqjun,4,2021-07-22,I need advice (hs freshman),Relative_Shoulder171,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/opqjun/i_need_advice_hs_freshman/," Btw, this is a throwaway account   


 I’m an HS freshman, going into sophmore year, and I’m just so worried by this whole process. I got good grades but I really just don’t feel like my ECs are enough to be competitive for good schools. I’m in a couple of clubs (will have 2 leadership positions next year), this summer I’ve been doing a lot of volunteering as a tutor and preparing for the PSAT/SAT and competitions. I’m trying to take a few hobbies seriously as well, like coding. But honestly, it feels useless, it feels like I’m doing exactly what anyone else would do, the thing is I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to start a nonprofit, do research, or do whatever the hell other people that I see on this subreddit do.     


And sure, some might say that I worry to early but this whole idea of the application process has really taken a toll on my health and my confidence. Just seeing all the internships and competitive programs has makes my heart drop. I’m not even aiming that high because my parents can’t pay for ivies and most T20s, yet still I get the constant dread that I could do more but I have no idea what to do and so it just results in me feeling so stuck.    


I’m trying my best to pursue a “passion” but truthfully I have no idea what I want to do. It feels like I’m putting on a fake persona just for college and I hate it but I feel so helpless.  How can I do more? Do I even need to do more? Am I even doing enough? I need advice so badly and I greatly appreciate anyone who’s able to give some. Thank you so much    


TL;DR HS freshman, mental health deteriorated due to stress of the college process because I don’t feel like I’m doing enough but I don’t know what more I could do. Feel like a disappointment to my parents and even a disappointment to myself. What do I do?"

We currently live in Las Vegas, NV and my husband got accepted into UT Austin for CS. He also got accepted to UNLV for CS. However, he wants to move to Austin to attend UT Austin because he said the ranking is better and its a good CS school and there are way more tech companies there than here. 

My question: is he right? Does it matter? Will employers care? He also said that it would be easier for him to get internships living in a tech hub. 

Moving would be a big change in lifestyle and finances as Austin is much more expensive than LV. I heard its quickly becoming San Francisco/LA/Hawaii/NYC levels of unaffordability."

optmnw,30,2021-07-22,I literally suck...graduated and am unemployed,soniya6889,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/optmnw/i_literally_suckgraduated_and_am_unemployed/,"Hi all. So I am a recent graduate and have been on the job hunt for the past three months. I turned down an amazing full-time offer at the start of the summer from my old internship since it would require me to be in the same city I have been my whole life ( I think I need to get out...or else I will lose my mind).

This time has allowed me to think a lot about how much I suck. Don't get me wrong, I have been blessed with a good life, I have a roof over my head, food to eat, plenty of clothes, amazing family and friends. Quite frankly, my life does not suck but I definitely suck. I can't help but realize that I have never accomplished anything I wanted to accomplish or planned to.

\- In high school, I wanted to go to an Ivy league, and while I understood that it is competitive, I told myself if I didn't get in, at least I'll try to go to school out of my city or state. Well jokes on me, I ended up going to my local state school. Nothing wrong with a state school, but I definitely felt I did not grow as a person these four years and also wished I was surrounded by more go-getters in my field. (My school was predominantly a STEM school and I was a Poli Sci major).

\- Before starting college, I told myself I would do a study abroad. I knew going in, that not doing a study abroad was the number one regret most people had in college. On my first week, I went to the study abroad office and tried planning a study abroad experience. I kept meeting with a counselor each quarter until I realized I truly could not afford it. I was already taking a loan for what my financial aid did not cover and the study abroad scholarships required me to still pay a deposit for the program. Now here I am a college grad, deeply regretting not doing a study abroad. This regret is def going to go with me to the grave, I just know it.

\- In college, I told myself I would never go into lobbying no matter how desperate I am for a job. Now here I am, progressing through the interviews of a bipartisan lobbying firm. I feel like I am going to go to hell for this, I am strictly a progressive, god I hate myself.

\- In college I also did not get to do the fun stuff like dating, go to parties because I held way to much cultural guilt from my mom. After a pandemic and being home with my immigrant parents (who I love regardless), I regret not doing all that stuff while being away from home...my fear is living at home till I am in my 30s but I am afraid that is just exactly what is going to happen and I need to accept it. I am also 22 years old and have never been to another state. I am 5'2 and have only had two guys ask me on a date (I am pretty sure I am ugly), I told myself I never will get an arranged marriage but the more I think about it, the more I realize it will probably happen because I suck. I also still have crooked teeth despite thinking by this age, that I would have been able to afford braces. I also thought by now, I would have my own car and pursuing a MA after undergrad (I couldn't afford it).

My Asian friends are doing so well in life and I am very happy for them. One is going to Harvard Med School, the other Cambridge, one is a Rhodes Scholar, one got featured in the New York Times, another is a model and then there is me...a literal looser. I get it my friends work hard, but I would not rule out that I myself am not a hard worker. I just don't know what is wrong with me.

I always try to be positive around people so this is the only space where I am being negative, but I really can't help feel this way. I feel like the rest of my life is destined to suck and I just need to drop the big dreams I had as a kid like earning a stable salary right after undegrad, getting an MA, having a nice wedding, owning a Mercedes, traveling, etc. I feel like everything that is happening is only meant to disappoint me. I just don't know what to do with my life. I also have been spending every waking hour applying for jobs and I can't seem to stop. I feel awful for not earning money and so I can't even seem to relax without applying to a number of jobs.

I guess I am here to just vent, but also hear the wisdom of others. I have never shared these feelings with anyone besides my therapist. I feel awful for being a negative nancy but seems like being optimistic about my life is just stupid at this point."

I'm interning there and I basically shadow my manager, we call for hours everyday and I go to all her meetings with her. She's so nice and awesome but I get on at 6-7 AM everyday and get off at like 7  PM. Often, I go back to work again around 10 PM.

I'm so stressed and overwhelmed with the work. She's been happy with me but all the other interns get off at 4 PM and complain they have nothing to do. I've talked to mentors and they said I shouldn't be spending this much time at work.

I'm not sure what to do. I really want a return offer because I love this company but I feel like I almost work too much. Any advice? I only have 3 weeks left so should I honestly just suck it up?

## 1. How difficult is it to find a job as a Software Developer in Germany?

This is a very common question!

Germany is one of the best countries in Europe to work in as a Software Engineer.

The salaries might not be as high as in the neighboring [Switzerland](https://swissdevjobs.ch/?utm_source=gtj_blog&amp;utm_medium=gtj_blog&amp;utm_campaign=gtj_blog), but still higher than in most other EU countries, and you get a **high standard of living** with quality public services: education, healthcare and transportation.

The country has a vibrant tech job market with **over 30.000 tech job openings** and startup hubs like: Berlin, Hamburg or Munich.

At the same time, there are over 800.000 Software Engineers in Germany, so the competition is stiff. The following factors might work in your favor or against you:

## 1. Work experience and technologies

\- while getting a job in Germany is not easy, it is even harder as a Junior Software Engineer, especially if you are a foreigner. Most of the companies are looking for Developers with 2+ years of experience.

Having said that, it is possible to find a job even as a Junior, but you should be rather looking at internship or trainee offers (Praktikum in German).

**Do you need a degree?**

I wouldn't say you need it, but yes - without any work experience it will be your main bargaining chip. If you are experienced though (2+ years), then most companies will turn a blind eye to the lack of a degree.

The 2nd part is the technology that you specialize in. If you search through openings on [GermanTechJobs](https://germantechjobs.de/?utm_source=gtj_blog&amp;utm_medium=gtj_blog&amp;utm_campaign=gtj_blog) you can see that there are many offers for Java, JavaScript, and Mobile Developers but not as many for Ruby, C# .NET or C++.

## 2. Being German or EU / EEA citizen

\- if you are a citizen of one of the EU / EEA (European Economic Area) countries it will be pretty easy for you to migrate to Germany - it is a matter of filling the papers after you get the job.

When you find the job and move to Germany, after arrival you just have to visit the Residence Registration Office (Einwohnermeldeamt) or Immigration Office (Ausländerbehörde) and get registered.

That's why most of the time German companies prefer EU / EEA citizens when searching for new employees.

## 3. For people from other countries

\- there are 2 administrative categories:

a) If you are a citizen of the **USA, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, South Korea or Israel,** you can move to Germany to find a job, and after that apply for a residence permit from the Ausländerbehörde.

b) If you come from any other country, for example: **India, Brazil, Ukraine,** etc. - then you have to either get a Job-Seeker Visa or find an employee that helps you with a work visa. For more details please refer to the [official government website.](https://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/visa/kinds-of-visa/jobseekers)

## 4. Language skills

\- the only official language in Germany is, well… German :)

Speaking German fluently is definitely an advantage and many companies simply require it. However, you can still pretty easily find a job with English only, especially in startups or in big corporations.

Nevertheless, if you have the time and possibility - **start learning German**. Even if you speak it on a basic level (A2 / B1), it will vastly increase your chances on the job market.

📷

## 2. Step-by-step process for finding a job as an EU citizen:

## Step 1. Apply to companies while staying in your country:

It has 2 big advantages: first, you don’t have to bear the high costs of living in Germany and second, you can focus on the important things - interviews.

In this step, you need to find the job offers. For that, you can use [**GermanTechJobs.de**](https://germantechjobs.de/?utm_source=gtj_blog&amp;utm_medium=gtj_blog&amp;utm_campaign=gtj_blog) or any other job board. Alternatively, you might want to get in touch with a headhunter to help you.

We recommend that you apply to as many **job openings as possible (even 100+)**, because it is not easy to actually get an interview, especially with less than 5 years of experience.

If you want to get informed about new job postings in real time and apply as one of the first candidates, check our [**Job Alert.**](https://germantechjobs.de/subscribe-newsletter?utm_source=gtj_blog&amp;utm_medium=gtj_blog&amp;utm_campaign=gtj_blog)

It is good to mention in your CV and motivation letter that you are **committed to moving to Germany** (if you have a family there, bring it up too!). This makes the companies see you as a safe bet and not someone that might run away after a few months.

From our experiences, it is really worth to work with headhunters if you are on Junior level (0-2 years of experience) because German companies tend to be quite reluctant to hire graduate developers from abroad.

A headhunter might easily help you to get some interviews. You have to be cautious though - headhunters often work only with specific companies, and sometimes will not present you the whole picture (you will not have access to the entire job market). If you are working with a proven professional, you should be fine.

## Step 2. Job interviews:

Normally the job interview process consists of 2 - 4 steps.

It starts with an **introduction call or/and a coding task** where you will be asked some basic technical questions.

As the 2nd step, if you are not located in Germany, there might be a **video call with live coding.**

The last round will be an **onsite interview** where you visit the company's office in Germany.

The practice of reimbursing travel and accommodation costs is not widely spread, though some companies may offer it, especially the big ones. Therefore, it’s best to try to schedule a couple of onsite interviews on subsequent days, so you won't have to fly back and forth.

After the last interview, you should get a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer in the following days, max. 2 weeks.

If you have multiple offers, you might want to negotiate with the companies. Be careful though! **Do not give the impression that you only care about the money**, because it's still a taboo topic in Germany.

## Step 3. Moving to Germany:

Congratulations - you have found your dream job in Germany! After the hard part, there are only formalities left. :)

After signing the contract, you need to prepare to move. If the company doesn’t offer any relocation package / assistance, you have to save about **2.000-4.000 EUR** for this purpose.

When you arrive to Germany and want to find a place to live, there are 2 options:

**1) Rent a flat or house** \- this is probably your choice if you are relocating together with your family.

**2) Rent only a single room** \- it might be a good option if you plan to arrive alone (in Germany it’s called a Wohngemeinschaft - living together with other random people or friends).

Finding an apartment in some parts of Germany (especially in Berlin) is quite challenging! You will often end up competing with 20-30 other people that also hunt for the same flat!

The landlords are quite picky, and you will need to make a good impression, **show them your job contract and documents proving that you don’t have unpaid debts** (from an organisation called SCHUFA).

A good option might be to find a short term rental (for example with Airbnb or Couchsurfing) and patiently search for a long term place when you are already there.

For more details on this topic, for example why the apartment often comes without a kitchen, [check this guide.](https://www.simplegermany.com/renting-in-germany)

Be aware that, more often than not, you will have to deposit the amount that equals to about 3 monthly rents.**At 1.500 EUR / month it means a single payment of 4.500 EUR!** Therefore, if you are on a tight budget it might be a bit tough till you receive your first salary. You will get the deposit back when you're done renting an apartment.

## 3. Checklist of things to do after moving to Germany

## Important formalities after arriving:

After you arrive and get comfortable in your new place, you need to take care of the following:

* **Register your stay** \- If you are a citizen of the EU (or Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland), you don’t need any work permit. You will only need to register your stay at a local Residence Registration Office (Einwohnermeldeamt) or Immigration Office (Ausländerbehörde).
* **Open a bank account** \- There are a few types of banks in Germany:
   * **Branch Banks (Filialbanks)** are traditional banks with a country-wide network, but often higher fees, examples: Postbank, Commerzbank
   * **Local banks** in specific regions, called Sparkasse, Volksbank or Landesbank
   * **Pure online / mobile / FinTech banks** with almost free accounts, like: Fidor, N26 or Kontist.
   * For an in-depth comparison you can check [this article from Simple Germany.](https://www.simplegermany.com/best-german-bank-english-speakers)
* **Choose health insurance (Krankenkasse)** \- In Germany you can choose between **public and private health insurance**, but only if you earn more than 64,350 EUR per year (as of 2021). If you earn less you are forced to use the public one, but you can still pick a provider. Health insurance in Germany amounts to around **14,6% of your salary** and is deducted automatically [(Source).](https://www.howtogermany.com/pages/healthinsurance.html)
* **Other important things** \- if you plan to use the public transport then it might make sense to buy a long term ticket. Otherwise, bikes or electric scooters are also good choices.
* **Integrate and have fun** \- find local groups related to your hobbies and interests. In bigger cities, you may be able to connect with your own ethnic group, as there are some big diasporas living in Germany, like: Turkish, Romanian, Polish or Italian.

## How much does life in Germany cost and how high are the taxes?

Germany is quite expensive compared to other EU countries, but not *CRAZY* expensive like Switzerland. It is worth to mention that there are big differences in rent prices between the various cities, for example: Munich is quite costly, whereas in Berlin you should be able to find a place with lower rents.

Your first month or two might be a bit tough, but after receiving the salary you will quickly realize that the things are actually quite affordable.

Below you can find a breakdown of income and costs for someone earning **60.000 EUR and living in Berlin:**

**60.000 EUR** annually (according to [this calculator](https://www.bbx.de/grossnet-wage-calculator-germany/)) gets you **3.049,25 EUR** net per month. This is assuming that you are single and not a church member, because there is an extra tax (around 9% of your income tax) if you belong to one. It assumes that you are single and don't have children (Germany offers a generous tax reduction if you have kids).

Income tax in Germany is a complex topic. The taxation is progressive, which means you pay a bigger percentage the more you earn. There are also six tax classes in Germany - the rates are based on your civil status (being single or married, having children, etc.). We recommend checking the [gov resources](https://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/jobs/taxes/income) for more information.

To simplify, let’s assume **3.000 EUR** to spend per month.

Now let’s move to the costs:

* **Apartment: 800-1.500 EUR** (with 1.5k you can get a pretty, but not the biggest flat in the center) or a single room in a flat: 500-900 EUR
* **Food: 150-700 EUR** (150 if you always cook for yourself, 700 if you are a foodie and eat out every 2nd day)
* **Entertainment: 200–500 EUR** (a beer in a pub costs \~5 EUR, monthly gym subscription 40 EUR. Again, all depends on you, but you can have a lot of fun without spending much)
* **Other: 150-300 EUR** (phone, clothes, public transport, a car, etc.)

To sum up: if you are single and opt for *""live cool and don't care about expenses""* style, then an average developer salary will be enough (it might be harder if you have a family to feed).

On the other hand, if you choose to go the student-like route (living in Wohngemeinschaft and not eating out too much), you can easily manage with just **1.200-1.500 EUR** per month, and save the majority of your salary.

As you can see, both options are doable!

So basically, a month ago I had an interview for an internship position with a company that is located in a city 2.5 hrs from where I live. They mentioned that at least the first two months will be remote, and they might change that from the 3rd month or so. Right after signing my contract, I was informed that I need to work from the office since interns were not allowed to work remotely. I have been commuting back and forth to that city to work while looking for someplace to rent there.

Recently, I got an email from a company I applied to a while back to schedule an interview. this one is actually a tech company and is based in my city so no commute is required. I am wondering if I should explain my situation to them or not. I am afraid that they might think that if I can leave a job this easily then I might not be the best person to hire. Also, assuming I do indeed get an offer from another company, how do I go about informing my current company that I am leaving? I am still in my probation period so legally I can leave at any time, but I do not want to burn any bridges and would prefer to keep good connections with the people who work in that company.

Basically, the owner has noticed some workers like to clock-in early in the morning or late in the afternoon (Before &amp; After 9am-5pm) to idle around and collect minutes. 

To accommodate for this, a new rule suggest that employees who arrive before 9 will be defaulted to just 9am.  AND employees who leave between 5:00-5:45pm will be defaulted to only 5pm. 

If an employee leaves after 5:45 (15 minute window) we will assume they are still working and include their hours.

In the beginning it was ok with the tell me about your work experience history to which I thought my answer was a ramble but I felt like I got the point across - I had a brief experience working in a bar so I told them about that - the interviewer then asked me about alcoholic drinks and names etc and I didn't remember any of them - he kept pushing me and asking me what alcohol names I remember but I just couldn't answer. The last time I worked in a bar was over 2 years ago and I'm not a big drinker so I really don't know that many alcoholic drinks. Furthermore he asked me what campus I will live on in September - and I said the wrong name! Ughh I feel like shit I just lost an internship earlier this week because of my interview and now I know I lost this opportunity which was ideal for me since I will be needing extra cash when trying to pay for my rent.

Need some advice,mjn1200,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/oq90q3/ec_help_for_someone_who_might_double_major_need/,"Hey y'all, I'm a rising sophomore and I'm in this sucky situation where I'm pretty passionate about politics + my beliefs and thus, have been setting eyes on majoring in polisci in the future. As a result, a lot of ECs that I do and hope to do later on are being done so with the intent of strengthening my application as a polisci major (I do speech and debate and hope to do an internship with a local politician's campaign + have recently applied for a writing position on a news type of site)

So the sucky part comes here: practically no one in my family is eager about my goals and I'm not really leaning on any support rn. It's not so bad to the point where they're unwilling to help pay for college or anything like that, but there have been some intense arguments, to say the least. Essentially, there's been some obvious aversion to be doing polisci as they want me to do something in engineering (god this is becoming just a rant now lmao)

At this point, I'm not really trying to risk my relationships by being defiant so I've kinda juggled the idea of just meeting in the middle and double majoring in both polisci and another field that pleases my family (something in engineering, but no idea what exactly)

Now this takes me to the real question: if i apply as a double major, is it bad that so many of my ECs are only related to the one I'm actually passionate about? Should I try to start catering to engineering/STEM related ECs too?

(Bonus question: are there any schools that allow you to apply with one intended major, and then pick up a second later on? Because if so, that'd be ideal lol)"

Almost all of my work is done in C, with some regression testing written in Python, but really, 99% C. I graduated in 2017 with an electrical engineering degree and after working a hardware job that I hated, I took my current position with nothing more than some internship experience writing Python scripts. To be quite honest, I'm not sure what qualifications I had to even get this job in the first place. But now I am in the market for a new job, specifically a remote position (not sure if this is relevant or not).

Scanning through job boards I see the same basic set of requirements for 90% of listings: SQL, AWS, JS, HTML etc. My problem is that I have ZERO experience with any of these technologies. I graduated with a hardware degree and only took basic programming classes in C/C++. My current role has given me basically no experience in any of the requirements that pretty much every single front, back or full stack job lists. 

My question is, how can I demonstrate to recruiters/HR that I have these skills if I'm not going to get any experience at my current job? I read some of the wiki that made it clear that certificates and online classes basically mean next to nothing compared to working experience. I am willing and able to learn these skills on my own but what good does that do if I don't have a job on my resume that utilized these concepts? Am I basically forced to go back to school to try to break into any sort of career in web development? Am I being too hard on myself and I need to be patient? I've had a handful of interviews in the 3/4 weeks I've been applying to jobs but when the question comes to my experience with AWS or Ruby on rails or noSQL, I can't help but feel like I'm completely in over my head and frankly, I'm very pessimistic that I'll be able to find a job that will help me expand my skill set.

oqadhh,78,2021-07-23,Need advice on how to proceed with my interest in finance.,manolismi,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/oqadhh/need_advice_on_how_to_proceed_with_my_interest_in/,"Hello everybody and thanks for sharing your thoughts on my case:

I'm currently 22, and I need one more year to finish my Electrical and Computer Engineering master. As you can guess I've taken a lot of math, statistics, electrical engineering and computer science courses, my talent though is in algorithms, programming and problem solving. I've been coding since middle school, got selected twice to participate in the International Olympiad in Informatics while in high school and I'm currently close to finishing a 1-year C++ developer internship.

The thing is that my interest in finance has grown too much for me to ignore. It started with a basic microeconomics course I took at university, then the spectacular covid-19 market crash persuaded me to start learning about the stock market and then the lockdowns gave me plenty of free time to investigate, read, watch and experiment with stock trading. As you know it got even more interesting with the Tesla, Gamestop and Bitcoin mania. I felt like I had just discovered a new world, very complicated and with rules that I couldn't understand, even though they make perfect sense.

However, I had to stop as my current job demands a lot of time and energy and I can't get distracted. So this contact with the finance world left me with a challenge: I want to do it right. I want to learn from professionals and not from cheap posts and youtube videos or fake coaches. I was thrilled to read that trading and investment firms also hire people with no economics background. So I made this plan for myself:

* Pick data analysis, time-series analysis, AI, pattern recognition courses that my school offers and replace other engineering courses with economics.
* Buff up my maths
* Apply for an internship in trading.
* Decide if I'm really interested in this, or if I've just made a beautiful image in my mind that doesn't correspond to reality.

Some more reasons I'm interested in this attempt: I consider finance to be equally important as English and technology/computers are for a successful life. Also, C++ developing is very demanding and energy draining, so I'd prefer to learn and invest in skills that will allow me to work for my pocket rather than somebody else's. Also, I've seen examples of people in my background making bad financial decisions and getting their life ruined. To this, I'll add that I'm Greek (we're famous worldwide for our complete lack of fiscal education and responsibility) so I'm kinda disgusted that finance here is something like a taboo and you can't get reliable information or talk about these things in a constructive manner.

What I want to ask you:

* A fact-check: is my plan realistic?
* How to get better educated? My logic is my best weapon, but I find it hard to navigate myself through the economics terminology (for example I read that nice list of financial careers but I have no clue what all these jobs are about, what skills they need and if they're suitable for me).
* Adding to the above, I like the idea of developing the skills to manage my money and I dislike the idea of just working in a safe/sandboxed environment getting a salary and later a pension (that I can already do with my programming skills).
* Which internships/companies should I look at? I'm based in Europe.
* Are there ways to utilize my programming skills while getting what I want (learning about the markets or whatever I want to learn about and I don't know it's existence yet, lel). It would be a pity to drop 8 years of experience in programming and problem solving and try to compete with people that have years of experience in finance.

Thanks a lot, any help will be greatly appreciated."

I have been suffering from depression and anxiety for a couple of years now. I am in my 3rd year of university have 1 year left. I really don't know what to do after that. I am seriously considering dropping out. I feel I don't know anything, and I am not good at anything. I feel I will never get a job and even if I do, I will suck at it. I don't really like what I study but I also don't have anything else that I like. I have done 2 internships and I sucked at both, and I hated every bit of it.

I am supposed to do another internship as a part of my course. And still haven't been able to even start applying. Just thinking of the fact that I have to sit for an interview makes me so anxious and I get panic attacks. I don't think I will ever be able to do or have a job. Every time I read a job post I feel I am incompetent. What to write in a cover letter? and what to say? I am not good at anything. Hence, I want to drop out.

But if I drop out, then what to do?

If I do finish my last year, after that what?

Uni is expensive and my parents are paying for it, I really don’t want them to pay for 1 more year just for me to do nothing.

oqezbi,24,2021-07-23,Why would Facebook just reject me like this?,BlueBoyKP,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/oqezbi/why_would_facebook_just_reject_me_like_this/,"First of all, I don’t mean to be pre-sumptuous or entitled, but it just doesn’t make sense to me.

I applied to a Facebook Internship last year with a referral, I had a weak resume without any internships.

I managed to land a really good internship at Goldman Sachs where I learned so much and did so much. Everything from APIs, used multiple programming language to write scripts, Software methodologies like agile and scrum, automated tasks with workflow schedulers, etc….

I updated my resume with that, and also my project section with other projects that I’ve done.

I then ask for a referral for this new internship that opened up from a friend of mine who works there full time…..I get rejected the next day.

I don’t understand what I have to do to became to get an interview. Again, I’m not trying sound entitled, but it is a SWE internship. Like, what do you have to do to get to the screening step, even when you have relevant experience, in both internships and projects.

I know that the recruiting process can be tough, but just wondering if anyone here has insight to the Facebook candidate selection process?"

How does space help agriculture?|Hi there! If we are to manage our Canadian agricultural resources properly, then we need to be able to monitor them. According to Statistics Canada, Canada has 93.4 million acres of cropland, spread across 193,000 farms. That’s A LOT of area to cover!
&amp;#x200B;|The only way to obtain frequent and reliable observations over this entire landscape is to use space-based systems that let us collect images over the entire landscape with no gaps.
&amp;#x200B;|With these images, we can tell what crop is growing, where it is growing and the condition it is in. This information is then used to make targeted decisions that reduce risks to the agricultural sector.
&amp;#x200B;|Satellite data are also used to support government activities and programs.
^(the below has been split into two)|&amp;#x200B;
Thanks for doing this, I never even though about using satellites to help with farming! I have 2 questions: 1. How many satellites do you currently have operating that are related to agriculture?|While we have not counted them all, AAFC uses data from quite a few Canadian and international satellite missions to monitor our agricultural resources. From Canada, this includes the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM). Internationally, this includes the American Landsat-8, Terra, Aqua, and SMAP; the European Space Agency Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2; the Japanese ALOS-2, the German TerraSAR-X, and the Chinese GF-1!!
&amp;#x200B;|We have used all of these satellites to some degree for research, development and operations. All are useful in their own way for different agricultural applications
2. Are you conducting any experiments about agriculture IN space or on other planets? Thanks again!|We are working with NASA on the Deep Space Food Challenge, a competition to develop new technologies to produce food for future space missions while expanding opportunities for food production on Earth. The [**Deep Space Food Challenge**](https://impact.canada.ca/en/challenges/deep-space-food-challenge) seeks to create novel food production technologies that require minimal inputs (materials, energy, water, etc.) and maximize safe, nutritious, and palatable food.
&amp;#x200B;|These innovations will not only be used for long-duration space missions, but will also have the potential to benefit people on Earth, particularly in remote and harsh environments, such as Canada's North. Visit our website if you would like to participate: https://asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/sciences/food-production/deep-space-food-challenge.asp.
Is Canada an exciting innovator in this field, or are we following behind?|Hello and thank you for your question. AAFC is making a significant contribution to the development of a global monitoring system through international collaborations such as the Group On Earth Observation Global Agricultural Monitoring (GEOGLAM) initiative.
&amp;#x200B;|By providing leadership for research coordination, Canada is among the world leaders in the area of space-based agricultural monitoring and helping to build capacity around the world.
&amp;#x200B;|It is widely acknowledged that AAFC has one of the most advanced agricultural remote sensing programs in the world. However, keeping up will undoubtedly require continued investment in the technology and science in Canada.
Hello! With an understanding that global warming is overall humanity's biggest problem I ask this question: does climate change cause an increase in land available for farming in Canada, particularly in its northernmost regions?|It is a good question. In the long term it might lead to significant outcome/impact generated by climate change and certainly somehow allow new agricultural activities in various forms. However, the main impact in the short term will result in habitat/species perturbation/migration and on human infrastructures (road, housing, water, etc.) due accelerated permafrost ground thawing.
Is your research entirely for Canada, or is it global, but you happen to be in Canada's programs? For example, do you study desert encroachment on crops in Tunisia?|Hello! AAFC is linked to the international Earth observation community through its involvement in the Group on Earth Observation Global Agricultural Monitoring (GEOGLAM) initiative, whose purpose is to increase market transparency and improve food security by strengthening the international community’s capacity to utilize coordinated, comprehensive, and sustained Earth observations.
&amp;#x200B;|Experts from AAFC are heavily involved in all aspects of this collaboration, and co-lead GEOGLAM's research and development arm, the Joint Experiment for Crop Assessment and Monitoring (JECAM).
&amp;#x200B;|Under JECAM, global teams are conducting experiments at more than 30 sites, throughout Europe, Asia, Africa, North America, and South America, chosen because they represent the planet's main cropping systems and agricultural practices. Satellites pass over these sites, collecting data from above, while researchers on the ground take measurements to corroborate the data and validate algorithms. JECAM data are shared among network participants, enabling unprecedented growth of global knowledge in this field.
&amp;#x200B;|In Canada, there are three JECAM sites managed by AAFC. Research on these sites has led to developing methods that assess surface soil moisture, identify crop type, monitor the growth stage and productivity of crops.
&amp;#x200B;|Desert encroachment is not studied explicitly, but would be part of any analysis into land cover change.
^(the below has been split into two)|&amp;#x200B;
This is an interesting space! 1. What kind of testing is involved in the development of such a satellite?|When we design a new satellite, it is important to understand the intent applications from potential users. In the case of the recent RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), The CSA did many consultations with other Departments such as AAFC to determine how crop monitoring could be achieved and design a system to meet these requirements.
2. Do you guys build the software as well?|That depends. When software is required to process image data for specific agricultural applications, and that software is not available, AAFC develops its own software.
&amp;#x200B;|Two examples are the Canadian Ag-Land Monitoring System (CALMS) that maps vegetation conditions weekly, and the Annual Space-Based Crop Inventory (ACI), which maps every field in Canada on an annual basis.
&amp;#x200B;|The CSA is supporting the development of satellite EO applications with the Canadian industry, academia &amp; governments, including the agriculture applications. Some applications need the development of softwares, systems or cloud platforms for the users. With these on-line tools, users can access and process various information such as: crops, fertilizers, vegetation, soil moisture, soil drainage, drought and flood estimates, etc.

What question would you hope to be asked today that you want people to know about?|What is smartEarth? The CSA smartEarth projects will allow the development of innovative satellite data solutions that will help solve key challenges on Earth and in our everyday lives in a variety of fields.
&amp;#x200B;|For example, they may help monitor our agricultural lands, help improve agricultural practices and give us the opportunity to adapt cropping systems to climate change challenges and impacts.
&amp;#x200B;|smartEarth is the Canadian Space Agency's (CSA) renewed funding initiative related to Earth observation applications development. It fosters a smart use of satellite data to develop solutions to key challenges on Earth and in our everyday lives.
&amp;#x200B;|Funding opportunities are provided through three different tracks: the Accelerator, the Integrator and the Enabler.
&amp;#x200B;|The objectives are:
&amp;#x200B;|-Develop innovative satellite data solutions to help meet various needs on Earth and in our everyday lives
&amp;#x200B;|-Increase collaboration among Canadian stakeholders
&amp;#x200B;|-Enhance expertise, growth and competitiveness in Canada's space sector
&amp;#x200B;|- Advance scientific knowledge

Are there any studies that investigate the effects that cattle grazing has on helping with wildfires?|There is a very interesting article (Sept. 2020) about the benefits of cattle grazing and the reduction of wildfires in Nature. Cattle grazing plays an important role in reducing fine fuels on grazed rangelands, by example in California. Without grazing we would have hundreds to thousands of additional pounds/acre of fine fuels on the landscape, potentially leading to larger and more severe fires. More information here: https://nature.berkeley.edu/news/2020/09/benefits-cattle-grazing-reducing-fire-fuels-and-fire-hazard#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20reducing%20fine,brush%20and%20trees%20onto%20grasslands.&amp;text=Reducing%20fire%20hazard%20is%20not,to%20low%20level%20of%20fuel.

If I were to grow a QR code out of crops that led to, say a music video, how large would it have to be to be detected by a satellite? Would the satellite be able to read the QR code? Or does it not have that built in?|I love this idea! Well, the pixel size at which the satellite collects data would need to be *smaller* than the details in the QR code. If the details of the QR code are too small, then the detail will be missed. Take a look in google earth for corn mazes and you will see what I mean.
&amp;#x200B;|Sadly, the satellite would not be able to read the QR code.
&amp;#x200B;|-AD
Thank you for taking the time to do this. Has space agriculture hydroponics helped with any innovations for uses on earth?|The pleasure is ours! To answer your question, we work to ensure that space science and technology make life better for Canadians and help solve everyday challenges on Earth. Learning to grow food in extreme or hostile environments like space is a challenge that many of Canada's northern communities also face.The Naurvik project (""the growing place"" in Inuktitut) is a community-led hydroponic food production system in Gjoa Haven, Nunavut – a small community located about 250 km north of the Arctic Circle. The Naurvik system includes three recycled shipping containers that were retrofitted into ""pods""—the Grow Pod, Research Pod, and Power Pod. The system is powered almost entirely by renewable energy sources such as wind and solar in order to sustainably grow fresh food year-round. By working with community members and partners, we can support opportunities related to Arctic food security, green energy, nutrition, health, infrastructure and technology.
What was the most surprising find you discovered that wouldn't have been noticed without satellites?|Maybe the “discovery” of the concept of geographical perspective with satellite imagery: from local, to regional, to national &amp; global. Satellite information can be applied to local problematics (ex: crop health on a very small field), but also to global problematics (ex: effects of climate change &amp; impacts on the global stock and production of rice). Multiple sensors (radar, optical, hyperspectral, etc.) can provide critical and diverse information at the local, regional, national &amp; international scales. This is the perfect tool for different type of users and organizations (ex: a municipality vs an international organization such as the UN or FAO), they all have different needs based on different geographical perspectives.
&amp;#x200B;|-GA
How long before we grow crops in space?|We already do! The Vegetable Production System, known as Veggie, is a space garden residing on the space station. Veggie’s purpose is to help study plant growth in microgravity, while adding fresh food to the astronauts’ diet and enhancing happiness and well-being on the orbiting laboratory.
&amp;#x200B;|And there’s more! We are working with NASA on the Deep Space Food Challenge, a competition to develop new technologies to produce food for future space missions while expanding opportunities for food production on Earth. The [**Deep Space Food Challenge**](https://impact.canada.ca/en/challenges/deep-space-food-challenge) seeks to create novel food production technologies that require minimal inputs (materials, energy, water, etc.) and maximize safe, nutritious, and palatable food.

Is there any research being conducted using LiDAR imaging? How do you see the science of remote sensing being applied to Agriculture in the future?|Lidar imagery is a very useful complementary dataset providing accurate elevation maps. AAFC is providing access to some. There are almost limitless applications of remote sensing to agriculture as new and better data streams come online. This includes, but is not limited to: (a) within season acreage estimation: (b) near real time pest and disease risk assessment; (c) within field yield estimation; (d) within field surface soil moisture estimation; (e) mapping of detailed management practices; (f) applications to irrigation, and more!
What companies are using this technology most effectively?|In Canada, the data produced by AAFC are used widely in the agricultural sector, by AAFC itself, by other government departments, by the provinces and territories, by industry, by academia, by growers’ groups etc.
&amp;#x200B;|While we cannot list companies by name here, the data are used for a wide variety of purposes, such as understanding current ground conditions, calculating draw areas for grain elevators, and for calculating carbon credits, amongst many other things.
As a general strategy do you think large satellites with high resolution, bandwidth and other capabilities like gimbals or filter wheels outweigh more small satellites with faster revisit times? What orbits do you prefer? Sun Synchronous? Or is it better to try to arrange things to stay over canada for more orbit given that most agriculture land is East-west. What bands are most useful for Agricultural imagery? IR, 532nm(green)? Wide or narrow bands? When trying to optimize your link information per day, what kind of resolution is best for agriculture?|This is a complicated question to answer as it depends on a number of factors. Everything AAFC does in EO is intended at some point for operationalization in national-scale wall-to-wall mapping.
&amp;#x200B;|From an acquisition and processing perspective, we focus on operational wide-swath sensors with as fine a spatial resolution as possible. Thus, at the moment, larger government missions tend to be our workhorses. These data are also FREE of charge, which is essential to an organization that does not have a large budget for buying data.
&amp;#x200B;|Small sat technologies are interesting to us, but it is the cost of their data that is prohibitive to us exploring them further outside of a purely R&amp;D context.
&amp;#x200B;|We use multispectral - B,G,R,NIR,SWIR - for many of our applications, and narrower hyperspectral imagery would be interesting because it would allow us to better sample the red edge. We use C-band, L-band and X-band SAR too for various other applications.
What do you consider to be the most ripe opportunity for agriculture with satellites, that there just isn't enough manpower to make reality, but the data exists?|I very much like the pun. Right now, the data exists for many things, but we are limited by the IT infrastructure in place to process and analyse the data. The application of high powered computing / cloud computing to AAFC EO operations will make a significant difference to how quickly products are finalized.
&amp;#x200B;|I would also point to other areas of interest such as field-level yield forecasting, sub-field surface soil moisture, within season acreage estimation, disease and risk management. All of these are still limited to varying degrees by the data available, but also provide massive opportunity.
&amp;#x200B;|-AD
Have you noticed a gradual change in temperature (growing season timing), and/or weather across Canada in the time the satellites have been collecting data?|Earth’s global average surface temperature in 2020 tied with 2016 as the warmest year on record, according to an analysis by NASA. Continuing the planet’s long-term warming trend, the year’s globally averaged temperature was 1.84 degrees Fahrenheit (1.02 degrees Celsius) warmer than the baseline 1951-1980 mean, according to scientists at NASA’s GISS in New York. 2020 edged out 2016 by a very small amount, within the margin of error of the analysis, making the years effectively tied for the warmest year on record.
&amp;#x200B;|The last seven years have been the warmest seven years on record, typifying the ongoing and dramatic warming trend. Whether one year is a record or not is not really that important – the important things are long-term trends. With these trends, and as the human impact on the climate increases, we have to expect that records will continue to be broken.
&amp;#x200B;|This plot shows yearly temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2019, with respect to the 1951-1980 mean, as recorded by NASA, NOAA, the Berkeley Earth research group, and the Met Office Hadley Centre (UK): https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/temp-2020_comparison-plot.jpg

What’s the most important open challenge in your field? I have another question. It might not be your area, but I’m curious about it so I’ll ask anyway: do you expect 5G to play a role in agriculture in the years to come?|The most important challenge? Depends on who you talk to :) From an AAFC perspective, it is putting the infrastructure in place to be able to deal with the massive amounts of satellite data that are now available. Twenty years ago I would always say we are limited by data, but now I say we are limited by the infrastructure and tools that we have to process the data!
&amp;#x200B;|Will 5G be important? Anything that allows information flow more quickly will be important, more critically in rural farming areas. Imagine farmers having super-fast accurate to cloud-based data and services from their devices in their tractors. The technology exists, but connection speeds are often a problem.
&amp;#x200B;|As newer and better sensor are launched and their data streams come online, especially those with very fine spatial resolutions, we expect sub-field applications to become more widely used. Industry is already using fine-resolution data for precision farming applications that require this capability.
&amp;#x200B;|-AD
Is Canada expanding our farmlands using new technology on the ground? Is this something that is noticeable from space? How has climate change impacted out total arable land area?|Farmlands and agriculture fields can be monitored with Earth Observation satellites (radar, optical). Climate change and rising temperatures impact the arable lands in Canada in two ways: (1) some regions or more at risk of drought (i.e. variations in soil moisture, low precipitations); (2) other regions have now warmer climate and can grow new products (vegetables, fruits). Satellites can monitor environmental conditions (soil moisture, ground temperature, vegetation stress, drought, crop health and conditions, etc.) and help better understand the expanction or reduction of farmlands and crop fields in different regions.

How will Humanity grow food at large scale in Space?|That is a good question, even at a smaller scale for astronauts crew on long-duration mission! Ensuring that astronauts have nutritious food is a critical part of all human space exploration missions. Crews will likely have to produce food in space to meet their nutritional needs. This is why we are working with NASA on the Deep Space Food Challenge, a competition to develop new technologies to produce food for future space missions while expanding opportunities for food production on Earth.

can i ask about the agricultural potential of thawing permafrost? also, is there a doc or ref available to the public outlining canadian agri challenges in a global warming environment?|When the ground is frozen for more than two years in a row, forming permafrost, it is harder for plants to survive. Permafrost areas have very cold air temperatures, thin topsoil, and most water is frozen during the winter. Some plants are better adapted to these conditions. For the moment, by example in Inuvik, a community in Canada’s Northwest Territories, an old hockey arena was transformed into a multi-level greenhouse that has been successfully growing veggies for more than a decade. And in Iqaluit, a much smaller community greenhouse boasts tomatoes, peppers, spinach, kale, radishes and carrots.
&amp;#x200B;|Satellites are useful to monitor the permafrost melting and soil movements in the North.

**TL;DR** I'm kind of an analytics nerd. How much automation have you got for sorting imagery, do you have a public store of data (edit: yep, I rtfm'd and found it), and how much analysis do you do of the data you've got? For context, I grew up in the ag community of the Palliser Triangle and now manage databases. I've read some history of the Triangle and the work of the PFRA. I've done a lot of analytics and brushed up against AI. I've worked with oil and gas data in Canada, much of it using public databases (and some large private ones) to predict the impact of technologies on production and expenses, and a lot of the same techniques seem like they'd work on agriculture. The questions: 1) What kind of AI are you using for the Annual Crop Inventory?|A lot of these questions have answers in a book chapter we wrote - see following reference -- but I will also attempt to answer them here. Yes, we automate as much as possible the download, processing, analysis of our data.
&amp;#x200B;|Our classification is based on Random Forest, though we are testing other algorithms, such as NN (requires a lot of training samples) and Support Vector Machines.
2) Have you got the technologies to analyze and provide data about longer term trends than seasonal? Like, decade-plus impact of certain crop rotations, or regional trends in production? 3) Can you and have you done analysis on the impact of neighboring crops?|We do not hold a store of the data we use, but it is mostly available through the various Government Data Centers.
&amp;#x200B;|We do alot of validation and analysis of the data and the value-added products we produce. These products are used to support AAFC activities and programs so they have to be of as high quality as possible.
&amp;#x200B;|Yes, our Annual Space-Based Crop Inventory was first produced for the prairies in 2009, and nationally in 2011, so we can use it to do detailed analysis of crop rotation patterns.
4) Have you been able to identify variables that encourage the regrowth of native grasses and increased biodiversity? 5) Has anyone made much use of the public data in the Annual Crop Inventory?|Yes, the ACI is one of the most downloaded geospatial datasets provided by the Government of Canada. Right now I have a list of over 90 case studies of people who have used the data across the sector in their work (and since we do not track downloads, these are just the people who contacted us to say thanks).

Earth Observation is so important to the future of our planet. Can you guys discuss some of the areas, like illegal fishing, and what Canadian government and private investment is doing to progress our country’s space leadership in EO?|Yes, Earth observation is very important to deliver key services and address many challenges on Earth, such as climate change, ecosystem protection, and disaster management, to name a few. It advances cutting-edge science to understand our planet. The Government of Canada recognizes the importance of space as a strategic national asset. Learn more in Canada’s Space Strategy:https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/publications/space-strategy-for-canada/default.asp
&amp;#x200B;|To maintain Canada’s capacity to collect and use important data from Earth observation satellites, Budget 2021 proposed to provide: $80.2 million to replace and expand critical but aging ground-based infrastructure to receive satellite data, and $9.9 million to the Canadian Space Agency to plan for the next generation of Earth observation satellites.Learn more:https://www.budget.gc.ca/2021/home-accueil-en.html

If you are studying the effects of growing crops in space: have you noticed any substantial difference in the taste or nutrients from the crops grown off-planet?|Does food taste the same in orbit as on Earth? Yes and no! During his mission aboard the Space Station, CSA astronaut David Saint-Jacques said: “A lot of astronauts complain that because of fluid shift, their head is kind of swollen a bit, we’re congested, so that reduces your sense of smell and of taste, so it can make food taste a bit bland. So for that, most people like to add some spicing or condiments to their food.” As for crops per say, the Vegetable Production System, known as Veggie, is a space garden residing on the Space Station. Veggie’s purpose is to help study plant growth in microgravity, while adding fresh food to the astronauts’ diet and enhancing happiness and well-being on the orbiting laboratory.

What’s your favourite satellite and/or sensor? 🛰|Hi! As a Canadian, we are always going to say the Canadian RADARSAT missions!
&amp;#x200B;|But, honestly, we don’t have a favorite -- we will integrate data from any mission that best meets our particular applications needs.
&amp;#x200B;|We'll answer your second question shortly.
Edit: Also, how has the growing use of UAVs for precision agriculture impacted the way that you and the users you support use satellite imagery? Is it easier to get buy-in from industry now (since $$$ crop industries are becoming used to making decisions based on multispectral imagery) or harder (who needs satellites when you can buy a DJI UAV and a couple sensors for relatively cheap)?|UAVs are being used a lot in precision agriculture, and have a lot of good uses. However, they will never replace satellites, especially since there will always be a need for national scale wall-to-wall mapping. Indeed, with the launches of certain satellite constellations that provide very fine resolutions daily, we will inevitably reach a point where the space observations rival that from UAVs (though when I do not know).
&amp;#x200B;|Of course, UAVs are more flexible, you can do multiple passes per day, fly under cloud etc. I expect both will co-exist andbe used for their relative strengths.

How feasible is microalgae cultivation as life-support and food source for long duration space missions? How does it compare to conventional plants?|A new investigation aboard the International Space Station tests use the microalgae *Chlorella vulgaris* as a biological component of a hybrid life support system. *Chlorella* biomass is a common food supplement and can contribute to a balanced diet thanks to its high content of protein, unsaturated fatty acids, and various vitamins, including B12. The long-term goal is to facilitate longer space missions by reducing total system mass and resupply dependency.
&amp;#x200B;|-CSA
Is there any work being done to make Canadian satellite data and value-added products more accessible to the public?|The Canadian Space Agency complies to the directive on **Open Government** to ensure that **Canadians** get access to the most **government** information and data possible.
&amp;#x200B;|You can access the RADARSAT Constellation Mission satellite imagery by registering through: [Access to RCM data - Canadian Space Agency (asc-csa.gc.ca)](https://asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/satellites/radarsat/access-to-data/default.asp)
&amp;#x200B;|-DD
&amp;#x200B;|Many Government made value-added products are made available either through the Government of Canada Open Data portal or through dedicated web applications that allow the public to Analyste data without having to download it. For example, you can visit the AAFC Geospatial Data and Applications page to see a list of what is available: https://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/?id=1343066456961
&amp;#x200B;|* AD
Are there any Canadian private space companies that you work with for agriculture? How much of a role do private companies play in the CSA's work more broadly?|AAFC talks frequently with various space companies in Canada about agricultural remote sensing. Often they come to us for advice on methods and approaches for doing certain things. Sometimes we get to evaluate some of their data. We are always open to these types of conversations and collaborations.
How to join CSA? Ever since I was a kid I’ve always fascinated about astronomy. I’m going to be a Canadian PR by next year (hopefully). Working for CSA is something I dream of.|We are always looking for new recruits! You can take a look at the ""jobs"" section on our website to find a lot of useful information on careers, jobs and internships at the Canadian Space Agency: https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/jobs/default.asp.
&amp;#x200B;|-CSA
What is the smallest object you can see with the satellites that you are currently using?|The Canadian Space Agency currently has a Constellation of 3 satellites (RADARSAT Constellation Mission- RCM) that can detect features within 3m. However, smaller objects such as antenna towers can have a strong echo and appear very bright on the radar image.
&amp;#x200B;|-DD
a lot of your work appears to be related to crop management. Could you expand if you are also working on any research into applications of GIS for herd and pasture management?|AAFC does have a broader applications of GIS elsewhere in the department to other areas, however I know little about these applications. Sorry.
&amp;#x200B;|-AD
Do you conduct research on the effects of gravity on root/shoot growth?|Yes! The Vegetable Production System, known as Veggie, is a space garden residing on the space station. Veggie’s purpose is to help study plant growth in microgravity, while adding fresh food to the astronauts’ diet and enhancing happiness and well-being on the orbiting laboratory. The Veggie garden is about the size of a carry-on piece of luggage and typically holds six plants. Each plant grows in a “pillow” filled with a clay-based growth media and fertilizer. The pillows are important to help distribute water, nutrients and air in a healthy balance around the roots. Otherwise, the roots would either drown in water or be engulfed by air because of the way fluids in space tend to form bubbles.
&amp;#x200B;|In the absence of gravity, plants use other environmental factors, such as light, to orient and guide growth. A bank of light emitting diodes (LEDs) above the plants produces a spectrum of light suited for the plants’ growth. Since plants reflect a lot of green light and use more red and blue wavelengths, the Veggie chamber typically glows magenta pink.
&amp;#x200B;|-CSA
How connected are satellites in agriculture and autonomous/advanced farming?|AAFC is doing a lot of R&amp;D in the use of fine-resolution imagery from space and drones in the sphere of precision farming, though this is largely R&amp;D work.
&amp;#x200B;|Industry has done more work in this field (pardon the pun!).
&amp;#x200B;|Satellites are linked to this work not just in terms of earth observation. Satellites for guidance and navigation are important for autonomous auto-steer machines.
&amp;#x200B;|-AD
Do you use someone else’s satellite or do you use your own?|CSA supports projects for academia, the private sector and governments are using available satellites that are best suited to address key challenges in our everyday lives including agriculture. In some cases data are freely available such as for the European Agency Sentinel satellites suite while others are purchasable on the market. CSA launched its own satellite, the RADARSAT Constellation Mission. Imagery is available by registering through https://asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/satellites/radarsat/access-to-data/default.asp
Hey there! I'm a Canadian and an amateur scientist, I recently just finished a [project growing tomatoes in lunar highlands simulant.](https://youtu.be/8W0csI-fUn4) Our future work is going to be on primary succession in this simulant. I'm so happy to see this AMA, thanks for doing it! For my questions, not directed toward anyone in particular: 1. Do you find that attitudes seem to be more positive towards your work and its benefits here in Canada compared to other countries (particularly with regards to ""we have problems here, stop spending on space!"" sorts of attitudes)? 2. It can be difficult to change habits once they're entrenched, especially those of modern industrial agriculture. However, off-world agriculture is an opportunity to have a really strong impact on fresh methods going forward. What is something you do that you think has had the greatest impact on current terrestrial agriculture practices, and something that will impact future space/lunar/martian agriculture?|Wow, your message is right on time! We are working with NASA on the Deep Space Food Challenge, a competition to develop new technologies to produce food for future space missions while expanding opportunities for food production on Earth. The [**Deep Space Food Challenge**](https://impact.canada.ca/en/challenges/deep-space-food-challenge) seeks to create novel food production technologies that require minimal inputs (materials, energy, water, etc.) and maximize safe, nutritious, and palatable food. Visit our website if you would like to participate and submit your innovation: https://asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/sciences/food-production/deep-space-food-challenge.asp. There are also webinars coming up.

^(the below has been split into six)|&amp;#x200B;
Hi. I want to know what kind of data do satellites survey and gather. Is it about size of fields, temperature, humidity, etc?|Hi Catalina! AAFC uses spectral information from satellites to map fields and the crops within them, the condition of vegetation, surface soil moisture, land cover and use within Canada’s entire agricultural extent.
2) Are there satellites focused solely on agriculture?|No, the satellites are designed for many uses, but many of them are well suited for land remote sensing, including agriculture.
3) What are some current or future research projects going on regarding agriculture and satellites?|We have a lot of interesting work starting now to look at how we can get better data on farm management practices, such as tillage, cover cropping, etc using satellite data. Existing work focuses on within-season crop condition metrics and better crop typing algorithms.
4) Can satellites help sync irrigation in fields?|We have not done a lot of work on irrigation, but in theory it could be used to time irrigation. If conditions are known from space, and if a condition his known where irrigation is to occur, than in theory those data could be used to inform a farmer it is time to irrigate. Of course, it is more complicated than that, but yes, this could be an application.
5) Do satellites transmit data in real time?|Satellites transmit their data when they fly over select receiving stations. At that time, they downlink their data to those stations.
6) Are there training programs to help cultivators learn to work with satellite data? 7) Can satellite research be related to future projects of farming on the Moon or Mars? Thanks a lot for your attention. I am writing from the Montreal science centre. My name is Catalina :)|&amp;#x200B;Training often occurs in Universities and Colleges, but I am uncertain as to whether programs directly targeted at producers exist. It is possible. This is why industry has done a lot of work in this realm to provide services to producers (where the producers do not have to learn about using the data directly).

oqha6k,1,2021-07-23,I graduate university in 5 months and want to teach abroad—where should I apply? Tips for TEFL?,Poetrymakes,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/oqha6k/i_graduate_university_in_5_months_and_want_to/,"Hello all! 

I’m a 20f year old university student graduating with a BA in English and minor in Psychology. I’ll be graduating university in December of this year, 2021. 

All my life, I’ve wanted to experience teaching English abroad and eventually coming back home (I’m from Hawai’i), obtaining my Masters in Education, and teaching English in maybe high school or community college. 

*a lot of people have advised me that I should teach abroad first before getting into grad school, solely because I can save money for grad school and be more comfortable then. 

I’m going to apply for the JET program this year for a chance to teach abroad in Japan in 2022, however, on the chance that I don’t get in, are there any other programs you all recommend that are based in Japan? 



*Programs in Japan are preferred. 



It doesn’t even have to be Japan! I’ve been thinking about other places such as anywhere in Europe or even S. Korea. I chose Japan since I grew up closely with the Japanese culture (Hawai’i is heavily influenced by many cultures such as Japanese) and can speak and read some Japanese. 

Right now, I’m working an internship with a English literacy organisation, which focuses on ESL and ELL, and I’ll (hopefully) gain tutoring experience with ESL/ELL soon! 

I debated whether I should get my CELTA or any similar certifications or not but everyone says to wait if I do get accepted into teaching abroad. It does cost a bit of money, plus I’m working three jobs right now (part-time cafe job, student work at my school, and my internship which is paid). 


Does anyone have advice or tips on where to teach (I would love places that are rather safe, especially for women), companies to teach at, what I should do, etc.?

Where do/did you prefer to teach? Your experience? 

I really appreciate it! Thank you all so much :D"

I currently sit having an internship as a cloud intern with an IT company that is well known, several IT certifications (A+, AWS CCP) and a 3.4 GPA at a mediocre technical college in computer science on my resume. If this is a reach, what are some steps I could take in moving in that direction? Or maybe some more entry level jobs that I would be able to gain experience in to get into that position. I know that my achievements are far from being exceptional but was curious what you guys think it would take to get a job like a SysAd or Security Analyst right out of college?"

The replies were not only welcoming but also motivating and encouraging.

While my plan is still to enter a master program in Germany, I would like to apply to an internship in Germany, as a way to finish my engineering program, and get some real experience with German and a the professional environment. I'd like to know if anyone has any experience or advice in regards to that, as I'm still unsure whether companies would receive an international (Mexican) student for an internship.

Quick summary about me:

I'm a mechatronics engineering in Guanajuato, Mexico. I studied computer science in the US for a year in a non-degree program, and I'm looking for opportunities in Germany in order to be able to improve my prospects as an engineer and be able to live with my girlfriend."

im a semester away from graduating with a CS degree. Ive done two internships so far, one was just software development, and the other was making test cases for another piece of software. 

I wasnt really happy at all with either experience. I feel an intense desire to find a job that I can use my skills to give back in a meaningful way to people. I always thought hospitals and other places constantly need new updating hardware/software and that sounds really appealing to me.

I really enjoy math and code that follows with it, and was always interested in machine learning. But I dont want to get a job that just creates lifeless ads better catered to iphone users getting their data sold to companies. I would really like to create something that directly benefits people, something I can die happy knowing I helped someone else out with what I learned. 

I am really struggling to find direct careers like this or companies to apply to, I have tried numerous google searches but I get pretty vague results. I was curious if anyone here might be able to steer me in the right direction?

I m not some coding prodigy and I m looking into some internships to get. My abilities are introductory level C#, Python, and assembly language. Taking Data base/ sql courses now.  Am I suppose to be worried about my future? What should I do to make sure I can get in  50-60k$ job entry level?"
oqlikw,6,2021-07-24,"What would be the best, realistic option?",dirqs,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/oqlikw/what_would_be_the_best_realistic_option/,"Without giving too much away, I entered a field in education where people/statistics/etc said that finding a job wouldn't be a problem. This was after I was only taking home 20k gross as an office worker, sacrificing a lot for 3 yrs+ for my program, and generally being unsure if my career change and investment was worth it. Well, it all turned out to be a lie, since while there are jobs out there, they are generally in not-so-great areas. Job market is pretty competitive if I want to stay in a populated city. Maybe this is common sense, but I didn't grow up with parental figures and have been sort of aimlessly wandering through my life until I made this huge change.

Anyway, I stupidly (in hindsight) turned down a high paying job during my internship for what I felt at the time were valid reasons, but I haven't gotten any offers since May. Now, it's almost the start of the school year, and I don't have a lot of good options left.

Option 1: I have a 60k offer but the city the job is in is very expensive. The best rent I could find in a decent-ish area is 2k+utilities with parking included (thank god), so it would be a difficult first year. Doable, but I'm worried about being able to pay off my minimum loan payments while putting enough away for savings. I also have to put money aside for travel due to the nature of my job. The apartment is 20min away, but there will be wear and tear and regular expenses from having to need to drive. This job also decided to pass on me and barely gave me a 6min interview but I guess their first choice backed out and as I would not take a 3 month assignment, the district has promised me a school year contract. The district has already started and I will be starting late/getting paid less because of late start, and they were a bit pushy in making me take the job yesterday but I negotiated to either give me until Monday or I would pass. They are so desperate I got Monday. I am so desperate I am considering it even though I really hated how aggressive they treated me. The good thing would be the location, I could take walks and feel safe during the day. I have walked this area at night when I briefly visited to see if the city would be a good fit and while I didn't feel safe I didn't feel threatened. Again, I would like to repeat this job is only a school year's length guarantee, and I may be jobless again next June/July if they don't keep me since it'll be a temp position.

Option 2: Wait until next week for a position that I think is a better fit but I don't know what this school pays because for some reason they've gotten away with not posting salaries online. I've looked at all the normal gov agency salary sites and this school just ghosted the system somehow. This district is also in a very expensive city, I thought I interviewed really well (but then they started looking at their phones near the end), and they didn't like me enough to offer me the job right away (which happened with the job I turned down in May - I'm dumb, I already know). The issue with waiting is, I might not get this job and even if I do, I might run into the same problem of low pay in an expensive city. Or, I could luck out and be okay because they pay decently. I think I would be more satisfied with the work environment for Option 2 because I read their 100 page manifesto and it really spoke to me and I talked about it in length during my interview. While this city isn't any more safe or dangerous than the one above, I am more familiar with it, but walks might be a little more tricky since less people walk around and there are more homeless about. It most likely wouldn't be a problem in the day in crowded places, though. This could be a temporary position in a sense since I believe I would be an at-will employee in this district.

Option 3: I have an interview coming up for another district in the same area as Option 1 in a week that pays way more and that would allow me to be able to afford 2k rent in the area (IF THE APARTMENT stays available, otherwise, I would just have to look for something similar) since the job would pay 80k. However, this district is notoriously slow to hire (I applied back in March, only heard back in June, finally got my interview date next week) and I might not even get the job/could be a formality interview/etc. This is definitely a gamble and I'm not really considering it viable even though I'm gonna do my best to wow them when I interview because it is a decent city and I could do more than hide away in my apartment since walking is free. I believe I would be part of a union in this district but I don't know much about their core values since it's larger and it would most likely depend on the school.

Option 4: I could wait and possibly get hired in September/October/December/January since districts could grow more desperate and still need people in my field, which has happened to some of my professors and alumni and they all said it worked out in the end, but that is very stressful to think of job hunting for that much longer and it wouldn't be a guarantee. Plus, it would look bad if I didn't get a job my first year. Then again, might find a better job if I wait and don't make rash/fear-based decisions, but I honestly don't know anymore.

I previously got offers on the east coast early on, as well, but had to turn them all down because I realized I didn't have the finances to move that far as a first year grad with a shitton of loans. Pretty disappointing since I did want to leave my current state and also because I did find a lot of districts whose vision aligned with what I wanted to accomplish with my career. But that's all in the past now. Lesson learnt. Maybe one day I can make the move.

I also support myself entirely since I don't have any family backing and this is a huge first career move for me. Hopefully, I've given all the information I need, but feel free to ask for more details or clarification. Thanks!

\---

Extra info I gave in a comment:

My gut isn't giving me any direction. A part of me hopes Option 2 will hire me because I think I'll have a good work environment and do all the things I want to do professionally. But is it the easier option? Probably, because it's also a more standard school work environment.

Pros and cons of Option 1 are:

Pros

* Unique/difficult experience for a 1st year (could beef up my resume or backfire and lock me into a niche I may not enjoy)
* Could potentially open doors to other higher paying districts in that area
* Decent area to live in and do free things for leisure

A lot of what ifs and unknowns...

Cons

* More than half my monthly income goes to rent, not a lot goes into savings after my loan payments and necessary expenses. I can always forego food but not other bills, etc.
* Could be jobless in a school year (so less than 12 months) if they don't renew my temp position even though I'm stuck with a 12 month lease.
* If I don't take this opportunity, I feel that it closes the door for me to go to this area - not the opportunity will never present itself again, but it does feel like this is the opening for this area now because Option 3 is just a vague pipe dream at the moment since I don't know the future.

Option 2 was aggressive in a sense they were only looking out for themselves because they didn't have anyone to fill the position and didn't appear to respect or see me as a person who was being asked to pack up and move 200 miles to start late, get settled, and start the job ASAP (work began this past Wednesday and they originally wanted me to accept yesterday and drop everything for them after a dismissive interview and rejection earlier this week - like, it really shows the state of the school that they only made a hiring decision one day before school started and then that 1st choice backed out). And, yes, this person would be my direct supervisor."

Not a fixed and final list, but the learning will be covering
- hands-on programming with python, JS, PHP &amp; their frameworks
- databases covering SQL and NoSQL
- learn industry standard practices around TDD,SAAS,  microservices, automating CI/CD, deploying with Docker/Kubernetes etc.
- other needed skills like version control, UI/UX design, DB tools etc. 
- how to work as a team, work with deadlines, documenting, testing etc

Idea is to get small groups of 2-3 together and take things further as a group. The scope of what we want to try/do will evolve as part of our discussions.

Who are the ideal one candidates?
I can think of students, ones who may want to do a project, ones who want to learn? BSC/MSc/MCA students who need to do internship, junior engineers who are looking out for more challenging work (as their current work is not providing that), etc.

Overall, the tech I am strongest with is javascript, react/redux, html/css, AWS, certain databases(postgresql and dynamodb), and graphql. My current internship, which I will be continuing in the fall, focuses mostly on react, graphql, and aws lambda functions. The problem is that I have general full stack skills but no real specific expertise. I was originally planning to try and get a front end job but there's no way I could build a good enough portfolio in a couple months to show to people.

I graduated 4 months ago and I've since been working full time at 66k TC which is a little bit above average in my city. Due to personal reasons, I'll be switching cities in \~8 months.

My original plan was to work at my current company for 8 more months so that I can have 1 full year of experience along with 9 month internship experience, so that I could have a strong resume.

I've been doing 1-2 leetcode questions every week, in order to prepare for the job hunt in \~8 months and I decided to apply to a another company to get interview experience meanwhile, which ultimately lead up to a 90k TC offer which is pretty high for a new grad.

I'm torn between picking the 90k offer and leaving after a few months, which would make my resume look kinda bad: 9 month (internship), 4 month(FT), 8 month(FT) work experience.

Or declining the offer and having a better looking resume: 9 month (internship) 1 yr(FT) work experience.

I would essentially be forfeiting \~15k in order to avoid having red flags in my resume.

I spent the summer interning at a small hedge fund in NYC. AUM &lt; 100mil (granted thats only one of many accounts he manages). The name of the hedge fund is not well known, this summer the investment team has just been me and him (with lots of outsourced people for other roles and a ex cfo of 100bil asset manager as the ops guy).

Pros:

The pay is pretty good (70k + bonus as intern), I like what I do, he likes me and wants me back (but no written offer yet), Ill get a team of 2-3 interns if I come back, hours are very good(40-50), he has given me 1.5mil to manage with my first trading strat, he has some high profile investors (like C suit from big finance firms) and lots of other connections, I, more or less, have creative autonomy in how I approach projects, the fund has been around for 8 years and can sustain itself

Edit: To clarify, the 1.5 mil is for a strategy I  developed and I can control the position sizing. I am limited to working within the strategy with his oversight. 

Cons:

The firm is not well known, I have to train myself on the topics that are specific to my field (programming, DevOps, data science, etc) since there is no one here to teach me, while they are working to raise more assets there is a chance the fund will stay small for a while since they mostly get clients by referral, he has connections, but, those connections are his and not mine and Im not sure they would help if I want to leave

I know this is a very first world problem to have. But I want to pursue a career in Quant Research (eventually open my own fund) and I am not sure what the industry thinks of self taught quants so I'm looking for some input. I don't want to end up in a dead end.

Would it be better to just go to a BB / more well known firm / PhD?"
oqt300,261,2021-07-24,Why IT in India is doomed from the get-go: A rant from a fresher looking for entry-level jobs in the country.,LimeBerries,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/oqt300/why_it_in_india_is_doomed_from_the_getgo_a_rant/,"Apologies in advance, for this is going to be a rant littered with perceptions and opinions of mine. In fact, I'd love to be corrected in anything that I may not be right about. So, here goes nothing. (Oh and also, it's going to be super long.)

Let's throwback to one year ago: I'm a fresher looking to get into an IT or CyberSec field career, and I've planned my entire Undergrad around it. I've pulled out all the stops: I've done A+, Net+, Sec+, and am not far off from giving the Cisco equivalent certs too. I've set up a decent homelab with whatever decommissioned hardware I could find, and virtualized the rest, and did a massive amount of hands-on self learning, and in general had a great time racking up knowledge that is tangible. Heck, I even maintained a blog and did some YouTube videos to document my progress. I got myself a 4 year bachelor's in CSE with a Cyber security specialization. I've maintained a very strong GPA throughout. I've built a decent résumé, a CV, and paid whatever I could spare to get them reviewed by a couple of professional writers/reviewers. I sought professional experience wherever I could find, I interned with the university's IT team for a semester, worked with a couple of startups which are just setting up their first infrastructure, and amassed nearly 1.5 years of ""experience"" altogether. I spent days and weeks building a good professional network (at least how much ever I could online). I have a burning passion for this field, and I absolutely gave it my everything to be on the tip of the bleeding edge in relevancy.

So, on paper, it feels like I've got all the bases covered. Got the core education, got professional certs, got relevant experience, and even built a half-decent network. Not that I'm entitled to it after this effort, but finding an entry level or a fresher job should be possible, right? Wrong. No, not at all in India.

The only Achilles heel in my entire preparation, is that I could not sit for the university placement drive, because I was down with Covid at the time. Not that I've missed too much, they just brought in one company that was IT relevant (sort of), who came looking for straight up malware researchers (and of course they went back without any hires). Every other placement drive company came looking for SDEs, Programmers, HR interns, ML engineers, and basically everything ComSci. Well, I can't blame them, y'know? After all, I'm in a CSE degree. I was in an unfortunate minority that chose to specialise in cybersecurity. Okay, no worries, I'll hunt for a job in the free market. I'll find something or the other that suits what I learnt and what I can do. I'm even impartial to pay, I just want to work. Should be easy to find, right? Wrong. No, not at all in India.

Being on the job hunt, I realized that some things were fundamentally wrong with how IT is perceived in India. I'm sure you would've been around r/recruitinghell for long enough to know the unrealistic experience requirements, unbelievably long interview process, unlivable pay scales, and obviously ghosting. But that's just a symptom of a much deeper problem in the field.

IT in India is flawed, simply because no one knows why IT is needed. The discussion on Security is sparse to non-existent, because these companies are not that far in yet to worry about that. The big problem is that compliance, or IT standards, do not exist in this country. No company in India has to adhere to a mandated standard that encompasses IT provisions and security measures. Unless the company wants to work with international clients, which is when stuff like ISO come into picture, there are no requirements for a company's IT posture to fit a certain minimum standard. And it's not hard to put 2 and 2 together: companies that do not need to worry about having a set IT, need not have one.

Which is when the job requirements start making sense to me. ""Entry level"" IT jobs in India equate to a one-man IT+Support department, and they are called so because, well, there isn't anything beyond entry level. I know one man IT departments aren't unheard of (thanks r/talesfromtechsupport), but in here it's staple, and even more under-funded.

This keeps getting worse in startups. These founders, who probably built their product or platform in a public GitHub repo collaborating with their co-founders, try to make a company out of that very same public repo. Thanks to the lean startup ideology, there is simply no IT at all that exists in funded Indian startups. I've seen 50-100 employees in a startup, all working out of their own laptops, posting code to their own GitHub repos to basically make a jigsaw puzzle of a platform/project, no DLP, no privacy policy, no data handling pipelines, no DevSecOps, nothing. What makes it even more appalling is that these guys scored a major hospital chain as clients. They handle sensitive medical data over their platform built on a mish-mash of 10 public repositories, outward facing APIs that have zero input sanitisation or authentication, and a dev pipeline so public, it would be a hacker's wet dream. Go figure.

Keep in mind that I was willing to work with crap pay, as long as I could work in IT. The reality is, no undergrad or a fresher, or even people with three or four years of experience, are ever going to be suitable for these entry-level roles in the job market. All the companies that aren't insanely large and/or branched out across the world, simply aren't going to have an IT need until poop hits the fan. IT in India is built reactively, not proactively. Damage control is the name of the game. Everyone who chooses to work for, or with these companies is sitting on a ticking time bomb. While new laws and regulations are being drafted in the government, it's gonna be long before industry actually evolves to that point.

So, I ended up getting CySA+ and Project+, and became a consultant now. Because damage control is a big market here in India.

That concludes my rant. Thank you for wasting 10 minutes of your day on this steaming hot stew of words that I just could not stand not putting out. Have a great day ahead."
oqtfxw,56,2021-07-24,Lost in Life. On the verge of giving up.,WaterEarthFireAir2,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/oqtfxw/lost_in_life_on_the_verge_of_giving_up/," I have always been timid since young. Often bullied by my peers, have only a few friends, and extremely low in confidence. Because of this, my practical/hands-on skills are literally non-existent. I always isolate myself and avoid participating in any activity because I am afraid that I will screw up, which often happens. Tried working as a Cashier, but can't handle the pressure. Quitted a few days later. The embarrassment just stresses me up even more.

Faster forward to Polytechnic, the good thing is no one picks on me anymore. But the damage is already done. Still low in confidence, have negative thoughts which interferes with my ability to do anything practical, no practical skills. I don't even know how to use an freaking OVEN or cook Maggie Mee. Even half heartedly attempted suicide. Decide to leave this issue unsolved, instead I worked hard in Poly, AKA Studying, to make up for my lack of practical skills.

Finished Poly internship, graduated with a pretty good GPA, at least for me. (3.7). Thought everything was going well. NOPE. Fast forward to NS, everything went downhill. My lack of practical skills and negative thoughts haunted me. Within the first week I OOCed because of suicidal thoughts. My buddy hated me. Don't even know how to adjust my bag. It's partially my fault because when I went for my NS check up, I didn't declare any mental health issues I am facing. I got a down pes and worked as a clerk, but I am still very afraid. Nothing has improved despite going through so much. Since then I have been visiting psychiatrists and counselors for treatment, but it wasn't effective. I still suffered from relapse.

Didn't make use of my NS years to choose my desired Uni course because I was so stressed up by NS, I don't even dare to attend an UNI interview due to fear. Even after ORD I am still scared. NS was the breaking point. I am never the same again. Ended up withdrawing from Uni, took a gap year in an attempt to solve my mental health issues again because I tried to attempt suicide again. I hate myself for not attending the UNI Interview, and for not applying for Uni in NS. I wasted this gap year to ""treat"" my mental health condition when in fact I did not do anything to overcome it. I simply did grab food and thought my problems are over just because I can be a delivery man. How naive I was. Such jobs can be done by anyone and probably only me see it as a challenge. Instead I used it to play games etc. I was afraid to apply for internships or work due to my fear, yes that is how bad my condition is. I lost the will to even step out anymore. As mentioned NS scarred me for life. I just couldn't take it.

For a moment I thought I recovered, but nope. I was overconfident in applying for UNI this year, thought I could get in. Nope, appealed and still unsuccessful. Covid 19 made the competition intense. I lied to myself, I told myself that once I get in UNI, I will just ""force"" myself to be independent and take up internships. Seems I am still afraid. I still dare not take up internships or work. No work means no portfolio. No portfolio means poor CV. The thought of it makes me want to kill myself. I contemplated; breathe in carbon monoxide, use a knife to stab myself, or jump down from a building? The thought of it makes me so relived, but I don't have the courage to kill myself.

While my peers are studying in Uni or working to make themselves productive, I am here confined in my room and afraid to talk to anyone. I just want to hide in my room for the rest of my life and not do anything. I have wasted 4 years now. 2 years in NS and 2 gap years including this year. I am tired. Very tired of constantly worrying. I ain't sure what I should do right now. I am still in touch with my counselor but I really ain't sure what should I tell her at this point in time. I am overwhelmed with thoughts. What if I failed to get into UNI next year? Can I cope with UNI? Can I cope with the working world?

oqtgax,136,2021-07-24,[Rant] Lost in Life. On the verge of giving up.,WaterEarthFireAir2,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/oqtgax/rant_lost_in_life_on_the_verge_of_giving_up/,"I have always been timid since young. Often bullied by my peers, have only a few friends, and extremely low in confidence. Because of this, my practical/hands-on skills are literally non-existent. I always isolate myself and avoid participating in any activity because I am afraid that I will screw up, which often happens. Tried working as a Cashier, but can't handle the pressure. Quitted a few days later. The embarrassment just stresses me up even more.

Faster forward to Polytechnic, the good thing is no one picks on me anymore. But the damage is already done. Still low in confidence, have negative thoughts which interferes with my ability to do anything practical, no practical skills. I don't even know how to use an freaking OVEN or cook Maggie Mee. Even half heartedly attempted suicide. Decide to leave this issue unsolved, instead I worked hard in Poly, AKA Studying, to make up for my lack of practical skills.

Finished Poly internship, graduated with a pretty good GPA, at least for me. (3.7). Thought everything was going well. NOPE. Fast forward to NS, everything went downhill. My lack of practical skills and negative thoughts haunted me. Within the first week I OOCed because of suicidal thoughts. My buddy hated me. Don't even know how to adjust my bag. I even almost got PES F. It's partially my fault because when I went for my NS check up, I didn't declare any mental health issues I am facing. I got a down pes and worked as a clerk, but I am still very afraid. Nothing has improved despite going through so much. Since then I have been visiting psychiatrists and counselors for treatment, but it wasn't effective. I still suffered from relapse.

Didn't make use of my NS years to choose my desired Uni course because I was so stressed up by NS, I don't even dare to attend an UNI interview due to fear. Even after ORD I am still scared. NS was the breaking point. I am never the same again. Ended up withdrawing from Uni (I applied and got a place prior NS enlistment) because i dislike the course after much research, took a gap year in an attempt to solve my mental health issues again because I tried to attempt suicide again (Failed, sent to hospital which in turn referred me to IMH). I hate myself for not attending the UNI Interview, and for not applying for Uni in NS. I wasted this gap year to ""treat"" my mental health condition when in fact I did not do anything to overcome it. I simply did grab food and thought my problems are over just because I can be a delivery man. How naive I was. Such jobs can be done by anyone and probably only me see it as a challenge. Instead I used it to play games etc. I was afraid to apply for internships or work due to my fear, yes that is how bad my condition is. I lost the will to even step out anymore. As mentioned NS scarred me for life. I just couldn't take it.

For a moment I thought I recovered, but nope. I was overconfident in applying for UNI this year, thought I could get in. Nope, appealed and still unsuccessful. Covid 19 made the competition intense. I lied to myself, I told myself that once I get in UNI, I will just ""force"" myself to be independent and take up internships. Seems I am still afraid. I still dare not take up internships or work. No work means no portfolio. No portfolio means poor CV. The thought of it makes me want to kill myself. I contemplated; breathe in carbon monoxide, use a knife to stab myself, or jump down from a building? The thought of it makes me so relived, but I don't have the courage to kill myself.

While my peers are studying in Uni or working to make themselves productive, I am here confined in my room and afraid to talk to anyone. I just want to hide in my room for the rest of my life and not do anything. I have wasted 4 years now. 2 years in NS and 2 gap years including this year. I am tired. Very tired of constantly worrying. I ain't sure what I should do right now. I am still in touch with my counselor but I really ain't sure what should I tell her at this point in time. I am overwhelmed with thoughts. What if I failed to get into UNI next year? Can I cope with UNI? Can I cope with the working world? How do I mention to my relatives the fact that I will be taking 2 gap years? Some of them aren't very nice with their words?

I want to erase my memory honestly. Sick and tired of all this shit. Why am I born like this? Why is my life like this? Sorry just need to rant here, and maybe indirectly seeking advice.....

oqu6dy,1,2021-07-24,Really need some advice on what to do next,idkwatodo751,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/oqu6dy/really_need_some_advice_on_what_to_do_next/,"Hi everyone,

I kind of need some advice in general. I was always kind of scared of disappointing my parents, but I kind of ended up not being a good kid anyways, especially during my teenage years. I got into a lot of trouble and hung out with the wrong people, but never really did anything ""bad bad""(No hardcore drugs/Sex/etc). Still though, I never really learned how to say no to my parents, it's more or less of me just telling them I'll get all A's or meet some other expectation, and most of the time I'll fail and they'll get really angry at me.

I should also mention that when I was a kid, my parents didn't really get me stuff I wanted too often. As a result, I would never understand how to play the same games or whatever that everyone else did, and I always kinda got left out at school and stuff. I did fortunately make a few friends in middle school, but made only the wrong friends during high school. I was always kind of introverted, but being left out all the time made me kind of try to seek attention by doing stupid stuff later on in HS/MS. I never enjoyed misbehaving, but honestly because I was insecure I kind of did want the attention, even if it was negative.

By the time it was senior year in high school, I ended up dropping all of my bad friends I made throughout my high school life. This basically left me with 3 old friends from middle school, none of which were bad influences. I really was sick of going to school then, and I honestly wanted to just take a year off after finishing school(my grades were far from good), but I ended up going to college because I thought that was what my parents wanted for me, and was too afraid to tell them otherwise. I also ended up not going to prom, because I felt like I didn't fit in at the school after I dropped all the friends that I felt were bad influences, but also because it was really expensive and I didn't want my family to pay for me(to be honest I was more afraid of them being angry that I would ask).

By Freshman year of college, I felt like I was in a major I didn't like, and just somewhere I didn't want to be. Since I was really stupid at the time, I decided to just take low amounts of classes and play video games for the rest of my time. This kind of spiraled out of control for a bit, and I kind of lost contact with my remaining friends. I ended up coming back to actually do something with my life about a year later(beginning second semester of my second year), where I reconnected with my old (3) friends, made a few new friends, and actually took a normal amount of classes.

Stuff didn't stay well for long though, as I realized I would have to an extra amount of classes to make up for slacking off previously. 2 of my old friends moved, and the 1 that remained really didn't stay connected with me well(I'd send him a message and I won't get a response until a week later, etc). I ended up getting through the extra work for the most part, as I'm still on schedule to graduate on time assuming I keep up with the extra work. Thing is though, I feel lonelier then ever.

My new friends, I don't know how to put it really, don't make me happy in general. Since I ended up being fairly good at Overwatch, they would always beg me to come with them to play in school tournaments with money and stuff, but they would always leave my out otherwise. I would message them ahead of time(usually 2 hours ahead) and they'd get 5 people together and leave me out still. Like I don't get it, I never offend people or anything, I guess I just wont figure them out. But once school tourney is back, I get the ""you gotta come play with us, king"". Seriously not too happy with that one, since I'm kind of insecure about getting left out to begin with.

I think it's normal to want a Girlfriend at my age too. I don't think I'm hideously ugly or anything, but during high school when I asked my crush out for winter formal, she started laughing before telling me that I shouldn't be asking stupid questions. Same thing happened later, basically, in my high school years, but with different girl this time around. So now, I'm honestly scared to ask anyone out, even though I'd really like to meet someone. Meanwhile, my friends all have really pretty girlfriends that they flex on instagram all the time. I know it's wrong to be jealous, but honestly its how I feel at the moment.

At this point I want to just have some time off(I would actually like a reset button irl but that doesn't exist). I feel so lonely and sad so often now, but I don't get a break. I've been told for my major that I need an internship or else it would be really hard to find any work, so I'm working as an intern right now, but at the same time I have to take these summer classes(they're pretty intense) as well to graduate on time, along with other stuff that never seems to end(between practice problems for job interviews that are really hard for me/2nd job to earn money because I know I'm leaving in 1 year, so I gotta save up).

So basically, I find myself being somewhere I don't want to be in. I'm in a major I honestly hate and have no talent for, but I don't really seem to have talent for anything anyways and I'm scared of my parents so I have to do it anyways. It's really lonely for me, and since I'm pretty introverted and quiet, along with the fact the epidemic is still kind of going on it's kind of extra hard for me to make friends(or find a girlfriend). There's literally loads of work I have to get through every day, and I don't enjoy any of it, and I feel like my life is just wasting away at this point.

I honestly love my parents, though, and really want to be successful for them. They've worked so hard and I know they just want the best for me, so I'm still trying to get through work and school despite me disliking it so much. I really really want them to actually be able to retire and not feel like they've raised an useless son, but I feel so useless all the time. I'm bad with people, introverted, socially awkward, not smart, not strong, and generally don't want to work. This obviously kind of sucks since I wish I had more friends, a girlfriend, and was actually somewhat successful in life to the point where my parents don't have to work anymore. I don't think I'm a horrible person or anything, but I honestly don't know what to do from here to make things improve.

If anyone actually read this huge wall of text, thank you so much. I think I got a lot of it out of my system just writing this, and any advice would be appreciated."

I'm having some trouble trying to figure out how to best describe my experiences from this summer (basically 3-week Android dev bootcamp where I built a bunch of apps and then 5 weeks of individual personal projects). I know everybody always talks about the importance of quantifying stuff on your resume, but I don't really know how to do that here considering I didn't actually work on any FB products or ship to any users lol. What I currently have is something along the lines of:

\- Created \[app name\], an Android \[type of app\] app that helps users \[what the app does\]; utilized X, Y, and Z APIs

\- Built an Instagram clone with a custom backend, a Twitter clone using Twitter’s API, a movie-viewing app, and a to-do app

I'm mostly just wondering if there's a better way to describe what's essentially an 8-week mobile dev bootcamp. I would really appreciate any advice you guys might have -- I'd especially love to hear from past FBU interns about how you put it on your resume. Thanks!"

\*Masters\* taught in English in Economy-related fields, closer to practice rather than theory, such as; Quantitative Finance, Supply Chain, Banking &amp; Finance, etc, in either Germany/Austria.

Of course I'd be willing to work 40+ hours at an entry or student level job to sustain myself while learning German - Currently I'm level A1 and I understand it isn't easy to even flip burgers with B2 let alone A1). 

I love nature, animals, and absolutely adore kids therefore I'm willing to apply for an Au Pair if the opportunity provides (I read that non-german speaking students can work those jobs.

I've had 3 friends suggesting me 'modeling' bec im a blue-eyed blonde white-privileged looking bloke and objectively I think im a 7, maybe 7.6 bec of my 13 months 'crafted' physique. I'd be willing to work in a gym too.

**--Background--**

Mom told me to pack my stuff and leave. I only have a Bosnian passport. Currently in Bosnia and I have until Thursday the 29th to find a place to live (I do not want to contact any family member coz all they'll do is gossip). Planning to go to Germany/Austria by the end of September.

\-Graduated in Turkey with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in \*\*Management \*\*with 60+ ECTS in economics/finance courses, \~35 ECTS in Philosophy/Politics, and \~25 ECTS in Math/Calculus/Statistics. In addition, I received an Honor certificate (3.11 GPA).

\-Work experience; 3 months Internship in a Finance &amp; Risk Evaluation department in a Corporate Bank through daddy's connections. 2 months Student Affairs Office in a university in Qatar. I can easily find a $600 job (no tax). $800+ through daddy's connections but I don't want to rely on him anymore. I don't even want to say goodbye when I leave.

Tl:dr; 0 work experience.

\-Languages (from highest to lowest); \*English C2\* (IELTS 7.5 without studying, GRE 148V with 2 weeks of prep), \*Arabic B2\* (my guess as I don't have a certificate but lived \~20yrs in Qatar and can speak 9 different accents), \*Bosnian B2\*, \*Turkish B1\*, \*German A1\* (After starting 2 months ago, I successfully obtained A1 certificate). I have the motivation to learn German - I sometimes even speak basic German with myself in a moronic authoritative fashion, I believe I can obtain A2 certificate in 2 months and B1 by end of December.

**---My Questions---**

I have been looking for Master's programs taught in English. So far I have found 4 universities in Germany and 2 in Austria (shoot me if u guys have any suggestions). Though, I am unsure about several requirements such as;

&gt;In addition, you need a school-leaving certificate that qualifies you to study (university entrance qualification) in order to be able to study in Germany.

&gt;Letters of recommendation written by a course teacher, an advisor or supervisor of an academic thesis

My university closed 1 year ago (can DM name of Uni). It took me 8 months to get a physical copy of my certificate. I then stamped and officialized it by the embassy of Qatar and the Turkish Ministry of Education.

&gt;""EUR 10,332 per year""

I am confused how to officially prove this but I am sure I can prove this somehow, given that I'm a spoiled brat.

I have $1000 of my own. I can sell my PS5 for $600+ and I have the right to ask my parents for min 3 months expenditure.

Spent a week reading resources and wiki and other info I can find about moving and studying/working and I would absolutely appreciate your responses.

**----Useless info----**

Bosnian expat living in Qatar. Came to Bosnia for summer. Lucky to come from a Middle-class family. Truth is, I am spoiled. Never had to work for a dime in my life. Had everything I ever asked for (material-wise), never asked for much I have a premium smartphone, 4k TV, a decent laptop, a PS5, expensive watches, and other items that a middle-class undeserving whity would own. I'm ready to give all that up and work hard to start a new life. Since Jan 2021, I have spent 6 months mostly playing PS5. I'm glad my mom told me to pack my stuff, it finally opened my eyes to work hard towards my affirmations and becoming independent."

I understand that you are very busy and receive a lot of emails so this will only take 40 seconds to read.

My name is John Doe and I am a student at X High School. I have been reading the X think tank for quite a while now and I want to state that I very much appreciate your organization’s research-based policy work and recently found your study on X and how it relates to X to be very informative and interesting.

I am writing you this email because I would very much like to get involved with X. I understand there is already an internship program in place but only undergrad and grad students are eligible to apply.

So I want to inquire about an opportunity for an unpaid, remote, 10-25 hour a week, fall research/writing/analysis internship. I have a decent amount of experience in the fields mentioned above and believe I can be a valuable asset to your team by assisting and expediting many parts of your team’s news, study, and other article/media creation processes. 

I love US politics and public policy research, writing, and analysis, being able to work with X this fall would mean a lot to me. I have attached a resume to this email for your reference.

Thank you for your time.

Best,

I've been honing my skills for the past year and I feel like I'm ready for a job or something so I decided to apply(also because of some friends i met online) to backend jobs that use Java. Personally I think it would be better to do internships but I just couldn't find java internships or atleast internship job posts that has java in it. I did see one but I wasn't selected :( . So I decided to just apply to junior positions and I was actually getting some replies but the farthest I've ever gotten was an hr interview which also rejected me because I was 17 and was just a grade 12 student. 

Should I just apply to internships that don't use java and just learn another tech stack up until I get to college next year or keep on focusing on java and just keep on applying? I really want to be proficient in java before learning another language.

I've been learning to program on my own now and I'm really enjoying it, so this seems like a promising career option for me.

The following are what my PERCEPTIONS are of a programming career vs other corporate careers which makes the shift even more appealing for me, I would love if anyone with experience/knowledge from both fields could offer their two cents to either dispel or confirm if I'm in the right

\-better work-life balance (no crazy hours, mostly 9-5, or slightly more)

\-more supply of jobs, ie all other things being equal, while both pay well,  it's less competitive vs big finance/law consulting. Obvs the top jobs like Google are still super tough, but there is more of an abundance of still good opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

\-work is more skill-based rather than relationship-based. I don't like how consulting and banking are more about bullshitting and networking rather than having a hard skill like coding where it's easier to 'show' how good you are.

\-better culture, ie less office politics

\-I also feel like there is more of a community among programmers than the other professions, such as this subreddit or tech twitter etc because programming is not just a career, it's also just a hobby for many people.

\-work is more independent. This is a positive just for me personally, for some this might be a negative, but I prefer having my own work that I can do independently rather than having to sit in pointless meetings all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to be proven either wrong or right. Also, any other points/observations are very welcome"

Ironically from a general point of view it's really not awful and while I'm fully aware of it, it still everyday kills me a little more. However this internship was my way-out ticket from last year which  was one of the worst years of my life. We've got sent home from uni, my 3rd and last study year became online and I don't think I've ever encountered so much loneliness, isolation and dullness like I did during the pandemic in my life. Besides work and work again though on my 2 days off I either read or stay in my hotel room. Have got absolutely no one to do anything with. Go out, hang-out, eat or explore the city and doing all these things by myself just makes me feel even more alone than I am so it seems like that's it. That's where my life stops. And I'm stuck. Because even though I feel like I can't stay here any much longer I know for sure I can not go back home. Because as little as I have here, I literally don't have anything back home. No friends, no group, no social life absolutely nothing. And that makes me feel like I'm completely missing out on life, at 23 when I should be living my best years, gain all these experiences and feel young, I feel old and tired and absolutely broken inside. I just can not fathom why seemingly I can not have a more active life. What's painful is that I'm someone to who being active and friendships count a lot and yet no matter what I try or where I end up, it's always the same pathetic record - me being so on my own and never having friends ever since I've graduated high-school. I honestly just don't know what to do anymore. Where to go or what to follow but this can not be it. It's exhausting feeling and living this way. Doing and having nothing and holding back crying almost every day.               

A huge part of why I'm so unhappy that's probably even more excruciating is the fact that I'm not able to do what I'm really passionate about professionally. The school I ended up going to was a plan B. I've chosen it after already dropping out of another one and deep down even though I was hopeful I've knew I'd probably end up here. That's the thing about plan B's isn't it? I think that is exactly the reason why I'm so lost and can't seem to find my place in this world. I've tried so many different things and they all were such a clear reminder that I know I'm on the wrong path and that my biggest issue starts from there. I've grown up with an immense love and fascination for film and I don't think there's anything that I'd wanna do more than film-making. Unfortunately in my home-country there's no school or even an industry for that and abroad I just simply can not afford to study. It's literally the only thing I know in my bones I'd be good at. It's hard to explain but I just feel it. What I'm having a hard time with is understanding why is that my so-called professional call if that is literally the only thing I'd want to do, but can't. It consumes me how much I'd want to at least be able to try to do something about it but can't. And accepting whatever's left instead just kills me and clearly even though I've tried and am still trying even these days is not a healthy option. 

Lastly I just want to quickly mention that for some reason even though I love reading, books make me feel even worse. I've been reading a lot of YA and they all depict a reality I'd like to find myself in. All the laughs, all the friends, all the parties and crushes are exactly the elements I'm missing and have always been missing from my life. And this is exactly why I feel like I don't belong. I feel things differently. Maybe I just feel more. People nowadays are so shallow and to me valuing things, being genuine and having genuine connections is still so important. I've got so much life in me and things I'd wanna do, places I'd wanna visit but here I am. Maybe I'm just delusional, maybe I have high-functioning depression, I've been thinking about therapy a lot but I just know that it's not going to magically give me neither friends nor the career and life I'd like to have. I just feel like I'm not right for this world, I honestly do and even though I'm not suicidal and I would never do anything to harm myself death seems like such an easy way out. As if tomorrow I would be told I have a terminal disease it would give me a twisted purpose because for the first time in my life I'd know where everything is headed to. This one and a half year for some reason I can not begin to tell you how much I've thought of that.

However, I did find one which I do like. I will be coming up at a year soon, and it seems from what I can tell everyone tends to leave after a year or two, mainly because of pay, which I will admit is on the low end of being a developer.

So I guess what I'm curious of is where would you go from here if you want to see great success in this field. Which to me means being a little above middle class, so I guess near the higher end of middle class.  
I feel like everyone just points to web dev. Which I'm starting to think is true. However, I never been a fan of it. Although, if this is the route I would need to take, I would at least want to give it a try.

Currently at my job I do C++ for a software application.   
However I also had internship doing C#, WPF and working with Modbus, for embedded project. 

I have programed a little bit in python, and currently have a server setup running in docker which is something more or less iv been working on now for my own personal needs."

Firstly, I'm in the School of IT - and over the last 3 years, I can safely say **I hate studying IT**. Anything code-related gives me PTSD of all the school projects that I barely passed due to begging someone smart in my class to help my dumbass out. (No offense to IT students who love coding and IT-related stuff, keep up the great work y'all)

Over time, you start to learn more about yourself, so I'd like to list some of my traits:

* I don't really have any interests that can be useful in securing a healthy future (I like cats and playing video games, maybe I could be an e-boy streamer haha)
* COVID-19 has fucked up my mental health more than ever (depression, don't wanna live, don't feel like waking up on some days, video games don't feel fun sometimes, etc)
* I've always gone with the natural flow of life, as in I can't seem to make hard decisions by myself. After Secondary School, I joined the course I'm in due to my parents because I didn't have any interests back then, which I don't know if I regret to this day. (and I didn't want to go to JC because I really hated mother tongue, lmao)
* I really dislike doing anything I come to hate, even if it's graded (case in point: Internship and Final Year Project)

I'll eventually graduate, go to NS, and forget most of the stuff I've learned while holding a Diploma which I hated studying for.

Would it be possible for someone like me to go to University? Should I even go to University? Or should I just go straight to the workforce? 

Frankly, I've always thought that I could just go straight to working full-time in a position that doesn't require any experience (retail, F&amp;B, cleaner, etc.), but it seems like everyone who ever graduated from school goes to Uni, and I'm not so sure what I even want for my future (no GF, house price still too expensive after selling all organs, essential jobs being automated, etc), maybe this post will be pointless when my parents force me to go to Uni because it's Uni, haha.

I'd like to hear your opinions, stories, and any constructive criticism you would like to share if you can relate / would like to offer help to the situation I'm currently in.

Thank you!"

For reference, I have Autism(ASD) and Idiopathic Hypersomnia(IH) - being tired is normal for me but lately it's getting worse and worse and affecting all facets of my life.

\- I work an internship that's usually 40hrs a week (6am-2pm) plus 10 hours spent commuting. Last week was brutal, as I ended up working \~50hrs, got tossed on a 3pm-11pm shift twice(one of which turned into 3pm-2:30m), and had to work on a Saturday. I do enjoy my job, and they've been very accommodating with my parents health stuff. Between people leaving and projects ending things have been busy and everyone's putting in a lot of time.

\- My mom recently had hip surgery so my dad and I have had to do more around the house. Nothing wrong with this, but I haven't been keeping up with my fair share honestly. 

\- I've been working out 5 days a week (though switching to 3 days a week cause lack of time). I'm also studying to take the Fundamentals of Engineering exam 5 days a week but switching that to 4 days a week. I also try to meal prep on Sundays, making lunches for the week.

\- My girlfriend (who has been kinder than I deserve through all of this) and I usually hang out each week. Unfortunately due to my increasing tiredness, arguments keep happening and I feel like I'm unable to put in enough effort, or just be a functioning human, for as long as she can each day.

\- I take medication for my IH, a stimulant to keep me from falling asleep during the day. It's been getting less and less effective, to the point where I'm dozing off behind the steering wheel on my way home from work daily. It also kills my appetite, meaning I can't eat enough to gain muscle while working out.

\- I've been horrible at keeping in touch with my friends. Lack of energy is a big factor in this. I should be more comfortable texting (occasionally) while I'm at work during downtime but I'm usually busy enough it's hard to get myself to do it.

\- When I get home at the end of most days I just want to turn my brain off. So texting or calling people or doing stuff around the house is... hard. Takes gas out of the tank that most days I don't have left.

Just.. wondering how to keep all of this going. Feels like something's gotta give, and that thing keeps ending up being me. Sure, when I'm working full-time I won't have to study for the FE, but I might be working longer days. Am I going to be trapped in this for the rest of my life? How do I become more efficient, save some energy so I'm not a reanimated corpse by the time I get home? I'm not expecting to function on 6 hours of sleep or anything, but I'd like to be able to use all of my waking hours effectively. Any recommendations are welcome.."

The last two years have been tough since I was diagnosed with major depression and generalized anxiety disorder. Despite this diagnosis I was able to finish one year of grad school, do two internships and now work as an office assistant for a local government.

Truth is everyone tells me I’m underemployed. Lol even my boss! But what a lot people don’t know is how depressed my body is. Anyways, I’ve been trying to leave the safety my current admin job provides and venture out now since I’m somewhat stable (due to therapy and medication). But I am so scared of how mental illness will affect my prospects. Since my diagnosis my typing skills have declined (55wpm), I no longer like public speaking, my sleep cycle is messed up so I’m very tired in that day. I feel an employer will be turned off.

I have been taking courses though currently pursuing a certification in web  development. I am thinking of going to school full time but I’m afraid of debt since I’m already $50000 indebted.

Anyways, my question or reason for posting is: people who have been in a similar situation how were you able to manage through and finding satisfying employment? Is talking about disability with prospective employers advisable?"

Hello, I recently graduated from a 2-yr Mechanical Engineering diploma program (specializing in Mechanical HVAC/Plumbing systems). I am debating on which career path I want to pursue. Previous work experience includes an entry level technician role, and a summer engineering internship at a local refrigeration company.

**Estimator/Project Coordinator Path (Possible PMP Certificate)**

The first path I am considering is the contracting route. Where I live, the HVAC &amp; Plumbing contractor/suppliers seem to be a growing industry. I have taken a Project Management class as part of the mechanical diploma, and have a basic understanding/skill of preparing cost estimates. I feel fairly confident in my communication, writing reports etc. (on the soft skills side) so Project Management is also something I'm interested in. However, the majority of the job postings I've looked at require at least 2 years of past experience. In this path, would one start of as a junior estimator, then work their way up to a Project Coordinator?

My end goal for this route is to become a Project Manager: will I need a PMP or other certifications to achieve this? This route seems to be the least expensive choice for me; however I am concerned about the earnings potential. I am looking to make about 100k in the next 10 years.

Pros:

* Don't need an Engineering Degree (Lesser education?)
* PMP certification can be acquired part time if needed
* Don't need to relocate
* (Bonus) More soft skills required which I like

Cons:

* Unsure of salary long term

**Mechanical Designer ---&gt; Mechanical Engineer (Degree needed)**

The second path I am considering is first working as a Mechanical Designer for a few years before heading back to University to get my degree. This route is more expensive and time consuming; the degree program is only an extra 2 years but I would also need to travel across the country. Perhaps if the company paid for a % of tuition, it would alleviate some of those costs.

Pros:

* Can become an engineer
* Can become a Project Manager later on if I wanted to
* High Salary Ceiling

Cons:

* Spend extra time, money, also need to move
* Opportunity cost of losing 2 years worth of salary
* Stress

**TL;DR: Better career path &amp; earnings potential?**

I am interested in both paths and have trouble deciding, any Project Managers or Engineers I would appreciate your input :)"

I managed to get an paid internship at a local startup company and will stay there until am ready to take on a big role. 
I don't know what happened, but my love for programming died midway of my bachelors. I am now catching up but I feel now its to late for me to catch up with the current programming world.
 Am 25, with just one year of experience.. My current stack mostly comprises of javascript, php laravel and MySQL. I am currently solving as many problems as I can and would keep doing so until am proficient at atleast one language. Am just afraid that laziness might again overtake and ruin me up.

Last year, I applied to approximately \~15 places and didn't get any interviews. However, I am very confident in my ability to succeed in most technical interviews because I have a strong math and algorithms background (just take my word for it). As a result, I have concluded that my best chance to get an internship is if I can somehow showcase my skills in coding efficient solutions to problems in hopes of making it to the technical interview stage.

I applied to Goldman Sachs and saw that they offered a hackerrank test. This seems to be exactly the kind of thing I'm looking for - it should hopefully slim the applicant pool enough to improve my chances of making it further in the process. Which other companies use hackerrank as a way to weed out some of the less qualified candidates?"

They say a journal is the key to understanding the true depths of one’s mind. They say that journaling, talking about experiences help you achieve your true path in life.

Total nonsense to me, but I’ll give it a try. So I'll be taking my journaling to this site every so often, and hopefully, it'll be great.

My name’s Tiffany Hydrangea, and I work as a sort of historical research expert with a paranormal research institute. Honestly, I don’t believe half the things the institute has in its extensive files, but money is money, and they sure make for an interesting read.

I was called today to join Investigative Team Seven of the institute, which itself is called the Julian Page Institute.

Based on what I’d been given in the pre-mission report, we were spending a week or so in a small city, investigating the death of an elderly man living in a unique mansion with a large, golden bell placed within the safe hands of a bell tower.

The team consisted of the leader, a calm, logical blonde haired woman that seemed to always be wearing a black coat named *Paris Chambers*. Next in charge was the nonsensical, seemingly insane, yet surprisingly smart *Caleb Azalea*. Third, would be a bold, yet critical man named *Kyran Grey*. Fourth, and last of all was a young intern sent to learn more about the arts of investigation called Rainie Light.

And then me. Skeptic, but with an eye for a good ghost story, *Tiffany Hydrangea*.

We arrived in the sweet, sunlit city of Maplelyn sometime in the late evening. The house we were investigating, a behemoth of a beast lay on the outskirts of the city, its sole belltower reaching into the sky like a pillar of justice.

Then, the team went our separate ways. The others would be setting up their instruments and other devices in the mansion.

And me?

I had a story to collect.

I stepped into a soothing coffee shop off a street corner and saw a man dressed head to toe in red clothes. “Ah, Jonathan Hughes?” I asked, nearing the man.

“Yeah, that’s me,” he replied, looking at me with scared, confused eyes. “You’re wearing all blue, as per the agreement, so you must be Tiffany Hydrangea?”

“Yeah, and you’re wearing red, so we’re all here.” I took a seat across from him. “So, you’re here to investigate the death of my grandfather, Damien Cryloft?”

“Indeed.” A waiter passed, and I ordered a cup of sizzling black coffee. I’d be staying up all night, and that’s exactly what I needed.

“So, when do we begin?”

“Now.” I took out my phone and turned the record audio function on. “Let’s start from the beginning.”

“Okay, as you probably know by now, the mansion he died in is the one and only Cryloft Mansion, the ancestral home of the Cryloft’s and its families,” began Jonathan. “However, the mansion fell into disrepair half a century ago, and it was only last year when my grandfather, Damien Cryloft won a lottery and set to work on turning the mansion once more into our proud Cryloft Mansion.”

“Noted,” I murmured, jotting down what the man had said into a notepad I always carried.

“Two months ago, the majority of the house, save for the old wine cellar, family cemetery, and bell tower, was cleaned up, and made great once more. When those were finished, we ran out of spare money to fix up the bell tower and the parts I mentioned. So, my grandfather arranged a sort of party and show off the house to the world.”

“And then?”

“The party lasted a while, but, like all things, it ended,” Jonathan continued. “Everyone had left around nine at night, and I decided to stick around and explore the place a bit more. I practically spent the entire night searching all of the hidden passageways, rooms, and the garden outside.”

“A garden?”

“Yeah. We had an old oil painting of the mansion’s garden with roses and so many awesome flowers. My grandfather recreated the garden when he fixed up the ruins of the place.”

“Interesting.” I jotted down more notes.

“Anyway, I found this room that I haven’t been able to find since,” Jonathan informed. “It was a clean white door with a gold knob that stood out from everything else in the house. It was unnatural, because these… these scratches were all over it. I found it strange, yet something about the door seemed awfully familiar.”

“Did you open it?” I asked.

“Unfortunately not,” he responded. “You see, it was locked, and I went downstairs to ask my grandfather for the key, and he told me there was no white door of any kind. I took up to show him the door, yet… there was nothing there.”

“Impossible!”

“Possible indeed,” Jonathan responded. “Anyway, I went to sleep, and the next day, I was in the city, shopping when I heard a little child tap on my shoulder. Naturally, I turned around to greet them, but then… Well, the child just looked at me, then pointed to a blank, scratch covered white door in the corner.”

“That’s...”

“I rubbed my eyes, refusing to believe it was the same door I had seen only yesterday. When I looked back, the door- and the child were gone. Well, not exactly. The child, well, he was with his family a distance away, behaving as if nothing had happened. At first, I chalked it up to lack of sleep, but then, it happened again.”

“Again?”

“Yeah, this time, I was on a bus when the world suddenly just kind of slowed for a moment, and then-,” Jonathan paused, “well, then, I saw all the passengers, including the driver, while the bus was still moving get up, and then, in unison, all point at the back at the bus. That’s when I looked back and saw the white door seemingly beckoning for me to open it.”

“Then?”

“I suddenly found that I had a golden key on my hand, and that I was walking towards the door. It was like it needed me to open it, and the key had almost gotten in the lock when the bus crashed into a tree and I, along with most of the passengers, were knocked to the ground,” Jonathan revealed. “Then time seemed to snap back normally. The explanation was that the driver had suffered a heart attack and lost control of the bus, and that was exactly what was shown on the cameras.”

“And the passengers?” I asked.

“Well, they just told me that they only remembered the bus crashing, the camera footage didn’t show them getting up.”

“That’s...”

“Terrifying?”

“Yeah.”

“Anyway,” he stated, resuming the conversation, “after that I began to see the white door more and more, and every time I did, I began to notice more details on it. The shape of the key that seemed to somehow appear in my hand, the smooth texture of the door. I don’t know what the door is, but it wants to be opened. Things got worse after I was watching a movie with a group of friends, and then the door appeared on tv, as if it was completely normal for it to be in the background. I saw the actors all point at the door and I heard this screeching soft come out of their mouths. And it resumed. I turned back the show, but it only showed me what was supposed to happen.”

“Impossible,” I murmured, still taking notes.

“I went to Cryloft Mansion to visit my grandfather, who told me he’d been digging around the garden when he found this box with a journal inside. But, the real reason I was there was to find out more about the door,” Jonathan clarified. “The journal seemed odd, and there was nothing on the cover to tell us who it belonged to. We opened it, and we found that save for a seemingly random page, it was all blank.”

“What was written on the page?” I asked.

“On the header it said, ‘follow this rule’, and on the very bottom was a single sentence: ‘Do not follow the cats’. Then everything seemed to make sense to me. I had heard the sound of cats mewling coming from the actors in the show, and I realized that before that, I’d been hearing the sounds of cats near my house more and more.”

“Cats?”

“Yeah,” Jonathan began, “cats. My grandfather laughed, saying it was a joke, but I could tell he was scared. I asked him if he knew anything about cats, and he did say that he’d been hearing these meow’s and screeches inside the mansion, but whenever he’d look, the sounds would be coming from outside, or another part of the place. Being as old as he was, he wasn’t really in shape to be chasing cats, so he usually returned to what he was previously doing.”

“And then?” I asked.

“I began to see the door more and more, and I kept finding the key in my hand, near the white door, people all around me pointing at it. Every time, I heard something behind the door, something scratching, or something mewling. Like cats, yet the sounds were too low pitched, too slow.”

“Strange indeed.”

“A few days passed, and then, around ten at night, I got this cryptic message from an unknown number with a single text message. It was simply a text of a single rule- ‘Do not follow the cats.’ Immediately after I received the text message I got a call from my grandfather,” Jonathan stated. “He said he’d seen a group of cats walking outside the mansion, and sent me a photo of four white cats walking together.”

“What did you do next?”

“Well, nothing. He called me, and he told me to listen, and so I did. He activated the video mode and showed me the cats outside. I heard the shrill noises of cats mewling, yet the ones outside didn’t seem to make a sound, just walking in a circle, mouths closed, and tails up. After the call, he told me local animal control would arrive tomorrow, and that he’d have nothing to fear.”

“So?”

“Animal control arrived at lunch the very next day. I went with them, and we searched every corner of the house, yet we didn’t find any proof of an infestation of cats. No cat fur, no noises, just nothing. It was too silent, and utterly impossible,” he continued. “We had recorded yesterday's call, but the volume seemed eerily absent, and we had no proof of the cats. So animal control simply left, asking us to please get more proof.”

I noted this, and the rules. Perhaps the rest of the team would be interested in what the interview had to offer. “Okay, continue.”

“Later that day, I was walking downtown to get dinner when I noticed a group of cats, the exact same cats my grandfather had shown me out of the corner of my eyes. They were looking at me, and when they saw I’d noticed them, they stood up and began to walk into an alley. I, confused, followed them in. I saw them scratching at the wall, and then they just stopped, and then simply walked away.”

“Scratching... wall,” I murmured, noting down the information.

“The next time I saw the white door, it had more scratches on it. And that night, my grandfather, on call, loudly declared he’d had enough of the screaming cats every night, and swore he would follow them and find out where they were coming from,” Jonathan told. “I warned him about the text message, the bizarre rule journal. He laughed it off, saying it was some sick prank, and then shut the call off.”

“That’s when...”

“Yeah,” he muttered. “Through the texts he sent me, he told me that the cats were getting louder as he neared the group outside, and that he had a gun in case he needed to shoot them. I once again told him to call animal control or something instead, but he wouldn’t listen. He told me the cats were all running away now, leading him to an alley and then- well, that’s the last text that was sent to me.”

“After that,” I began, remembering the case notes, “you rushed over to the mansion and found him missing.”

“Right, I filed a missing person’s report, and soon, me and the authorities were all over the city, searching for him. That night, I didn’t hear nor see the cats or the white door, and it felt like something wrong had happened, something that simply wasn’t supposed to. We didn’t find my grandfather then.”

“That was the next day, right?” I inquired.

Jonathan nodded his head. “A corpse was sighted in an alleyway early in the next day, and it was almost impossible to identify the body due to what seemed to be scratches all over the body. When I heard the news of the corpse, I knew it was him, and soon, it was verified that it was indeed Damien Cryloft, my grandfather.”

“And that’s it?”

“Yeah, since that day, I haven’t heard the cats scream or seen that white door anymore. I truly hope you and your team find out what the hell happened to my grandfather.”

“We will,” I assured, finally switching the recording off. “We will.”

With that, Jonathan Hughes left the table, and vanished into the nighttime air of Mapelyn City.

As I got up, I swear I could have heard the soft, yet eerie sound of a cat mewling into the night air of the city.

orx022,15,2021-07-26,Where do I begin as a transfer student?,ContributionLower377,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/orx022/where_do_i_begin_as_a_transfer_student/,"I’m a new junior transfer student who is studying at a Big 4 CS school. Being in the Bay Area and seeing all my friends interning at top FAANG companies and unicorns, it’s a little disheartening to feel like everyone around me knows what they’re doing and are progressing in their careers/making good money while I spent the last  2 years at community college practically doing nothing in that regard. I’ve never even had any proper job before. My only shot at doing an internship before I graduate is going to be next summer, the summer before my senior year (summer 2022).

I have a couple personal projects under my belt, but 0 internship experience and know nothing about prepping for SWE interviews other than “Leetcode”. I’m really struggling with my summer class, since I was so used to community college level rigor for 2 years, and worst of all, if I don’t do well enough in it, I might not be able to declare computer science as my major and might have to settle for data science (but the classes/requirements are very similar and it definitely gives me the programming/theory knowledge). A lot of shit that’s braindead easy to some people, like tree recursion, feels hard as hell to me and I know similar stuff is asked on coding challenges and interviews so I feel really hopeless no matter how hard I try to improve. 

I really want to pursue SWE but I’m not sure if a data science major (if I have to settle for it) will hold me back/limit me in the internship of job search or corner me into an analyst position. I’m trying to plan for the next 2 years until I graduate, but I’m super clueless about timeline should look like or what I should be doing and when I should be doing it. Since I spent so much time studying in community college just to transfer to the best school possible, once I actually got here, a lot of new concepts like internships came into the picture very quickly that never crossed my mind even once before. It feels a little overwhelming tbh.

Is it normal to feel this way as a transfer student? Have any other transfers ever felt the same? Sorry for the little vent, but I feel really lost rn and if anyone has any guidance, I’d really appreciate it! I understand that I’m running against the clock and have to play catch up game compared to most traditional 4-year students, but I’m determined to work very hard once I figure out a good place to start."

The issue is, I have never been able to point to a specific type of job that I want. A lot of people can say, ""oh, I want to be a doctor, so I know what sorts of medical school I need to attend and how to start that career."" I don't really know what kinds of jobs are out there for this, so I struggle to think of a plan. Does anyone have any experience in this field or any ideas for jobs I could pursue? My main motivation is to use technology to help combat climate change, and I really want to try and make a difference. I am open to continuing school in a graduate program if it helps push me towards a career I might care about, but I also do not want to extend my education just because I can't decide what I want."

orza81,2,2021-07-26,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (7/26/2021),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/orza81/weekly_job_qa_thread_7262021/,"Hi all,

Here is the seventy-fourth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

Both are located at the same college and both are 3 years long and offer paid internships. My interests somewhat lean towards the field of cyber security and I was doing some research recently and it seems like a degree in CS will open more doors than the IT degree. Will the CS degree better prepare me for the future since technology is always evolving? In security as well? I would appreciate everyone’s thoughts and responses. Please provide details. Thank you.

I am (26F) have been having some difficulty with my dad. So a little background. My dad Frank (43m) has been my step dad since I was 5. We are a military family him and my mom(42F) When I was about 16, 17 I found out my mom had been cheating on my dad throughout the marriage. They talked about divorce and my mom pleaded with my dad not to end the marriage. So my dad said yes under certain stipulations. She had to have a gps tracker on at all times. However, during that time that they were not in such a good place my dada started to come to me to ask for massages. First they were fine, but later he would move his dick closer to my hand, and would tell me to massage his crotch area. He would always say I could stop when I wanted, but would then guilt me. If I got in trouble he would be I'll let you have your car back for the day if you give me a massage. He would also say he would give me a massage on my back that would turn to home touching my chest. 

After I built the courage to tell him how uncomfortable I was he would tell me he wasn't making me do anything. But would tell me not to tell my mom.

Him and my mom started acting like normal again, and he never brought up massages again until my mom got deployed and we were staying with my grandparents. The massages had turned into jerk off sessions. For me it turned into something normal. I would put into the back of my head and ignore it.

After my mom got back the requests stopped. I moved away and everything was ok. However after the COVID-19 I had to move back home cause I couldn't afford to live there. My mom had a three month internship in a different city. After she left my dad was upset cause he said that him and my mother hadn't had sex in a while. He then started requesting for massages again but I told I would but would not get him off. He would say oh yes you and your morales. It would of course slowly turn into something sexual. 

One day my dad came to me upset and said what he thought would happen happen. Mom cheated while on her internship. He told me that he was done with my entire family anyone with my mother's maiden name he was done with. That includes me. He said that he would stick around though if I became his intimate partner instead. He literally said he wanted to have sex with me. Also he constantly brings up his life insurance policy and that he wants to have me be his benefactor, but I had to prove it to him that I was worthy enough to get it. Later my dad found out she didn't cheat, and that he over reacted, that he was sorry for the emotional stress he caused. But later again asked for another massage. 

I'm so lost on what I should do. I'm starting to subconsciously become uncomfortable in his presence. What should I do. Thanks. Please be kind to me."
os37g0,63,2021-07-26,Grad Season Post: How to Get Your First Job! (from someone with 2+ years of exp),kreddit2,phcareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/phcareers/comments/os37g0/grad_season_post_how_to_get_your_first_job_from/,"I know the job-hunting landscape now is very difficult - and as a fresh graduate you may feel that you're at a disadvantage since it's likely you don't have formal work experience yet. I'm hoping that some of these tips will work for you! (And for those who have differing opinions...please feel free to comment below so fresh grads can get a fuller picture and different points of view!)

*Personal Context: I was a non-honor, delayed graduate from a Big 3 University in 2018. I got my first job early 2019. I now earn more than double that salary, 2ish jobs later :) I got my current job during the pandemic in late 2020. Giving this background info upfront so you have an idea where my perspective comes from. Everything I say below is my opinion based on experience!*

The 3 steps of getting your first job are...

1. Knowing what you want
2. Presenting yourself well
3. Evaluating the offer

**Knowing what you want**

The main question here is *""Which jobs do I apply for?""*. Even in a pandemic.... there are A LOT of jobs to look through even just on LinkedIn! (And of course there's Kalibrr, Jobstreet, Facebook groups etc...). As tempting as it is to apply for every single job you see because job hunting IS to an extent a numbers game, I strongly discourage this. First - there is very little chance your resume will be a GOOD resume if it somehow sets you up for a sales AND finance AND marketing AND operations AND HR role -- these jobs require different skill sets! The same goes for interviews and cover letters. Second - it is much easier to job hunt and look through options carefully (i.e. making sure the company is somewhat reputable, reading job descriptions thoroughly) if you limit what you are looking at so you give your best applications to the 5 jobs that you actually like rather than default applications to 30+ jobs. Finally - to try and improve your chances of happiness at work. If you know you don't like talking to people...don't apply for sales roles!! If you know you like structured environments, you can target FMCGs and traditional companies!! If you want to WFH forever, go for remote jobs!!

To create that list of what you should apply for think of the following: 

1. What you've enjoyed doing in the past (can be college work! can be an internship! can be a hobby!)
2. What you have been successful at doing in the past and WHY were you successful (Was it the environment? who were you working with? which skills did you tap? did you simply get lucky?)
3. Basic logistics: what you/your family's needs are (i.e. do you need a higher paying job because you're the breadwinner? do you need to stay at home because you're looking after your family?)
4. What you want to try doing/what you're interested in now &amp; in the future (do you read about ecommerce in your spare time? from the people you know whose job sounds the most exciting....or at least tolerable.

Something to remember here -- you do not have to get this right on the first try and this can change or be added to as you go through your work life. There are ideas that work well on paper but not in real life. You &amp; your circumstances can change. Also - this is your first job - you have an excuse ready to go for your second job ""I thought I wanted to XXX so I looked for that in my first job but I learned XXXXX so this is why I am now applying and looking for a new second job that is not connected to my first job"" if you end up looking for something completely different.

**Presenting yourself well**

This is the resume-cover letter-interview portion of things. So now you know what types of job you're open to and you've actually found something (wow!!!) ... how will they notice you? Chances are... they won't. Even the best resumes never get noticed by everybody. So be very, very comfortable with rejection but at the same time... always improve your chances. 

*For resumes*: look at free Philippine-based help sites targeted towards fresh grads. I know of The Bumpy Career and Liyab. These two posts from The Bumpy Career were very helpful for me (Liyab was not around when I was looking for my first job lol) - [Things to Add to Resume](https://www.thebumpycareer.com/blog/2016/02/07/14-5-things-you-didnt-realize-had-resume-value) and [Fixing Resume in 1 Hour](https://www.thebumpycareer.com/blog/2017/07/19/how-to-fix-your-resume-in-1-hour). I don't believe in customizing your resume for every single job application - I do believe that the same type of resume should go to the same types of jobs, and that you can always improve your resume. You will know your resume is successful if companies call you for an interview. According to my 2019 Job Hunting Spreadsheet (lol) - I applied for at least 18 jobs (I don't think I tracked everything but I'm sure the number is not much higher) and got 4 interviews (~22% success rate). Since it's pandemic time and job hunting is harder.... I would think that if you don't get an interview invitation *at least 10%* of the time - you should improve your resume. 

*For cover letters*: Yes, everyone knows we mostly work to earn money but honestly, I have a much better response rate when I submit a cover letter than when I don't. My cover letters have been referenced in around 1/3 of my interviews. So even if the cover letter is optional....just submit one. At worst, no one reads it. At best, you get shuffled to the top of the pile because you have extra content which makes the HR department think you're hardworking. Again, you do not need to tailor the whole cover letter to the job application. You do need to change around 2-3 lines (the company's name, why you're interested in the company, specific job you're applying for). I also used [another Bumpy Career article](https://www.thebumpycareer.com/blog/2016/06/22/how-do-you-write-a-successful-cover-letter) to make my cover letter. My favourite part: she only recommends 150 words.

*For interviews*: My interview routine was drafting possible responses to common interview questions (I started off with [College Info Geek's 21 Questions](https://collegeinfogeek.com/common-interview-questions/)) on a word doc, downloading it to pdf on my phone, and using the commute time/reception area waiting time reading it over. Some of these answers have to be changed depending on the company but I'd say that most of the time you will just reuse the same answers. Post-interview, if there were any questions I really struggled to answer (either I rambled too much/I couldn't answer follow-ups properly/I just blanked completely) I would either add that question in (unless it was a question super specific to the company) or change my prepared answer (make it shorter, focus on a different scenario etc.). Other tips: traditional companies/FMCGs focus more on character/beliefs/soft-skills while start-ups have a ""tell us solutions to our company problems"" section 99% of the time. If you're interviewing for a start-up, read all about them/the industry pre-interview. If the start-up has an app, download it and use it. If you're lucky enough to know someone working there, ask them for advice. If I've gotten a phone interview, I usually get an offer 50% of the time (since the beginning!! I got an offer from 2 of the 4 companies I interviewed with for the first job). I've noticed that I need to be super relaxed to do well in an interview i.e. arriving on time....NOT thinking ""this is my only chance to get a job!!""...not putting pressure on the company (both the companies I received offers from were fine companies but they were not my #1 choice at the time.  It's also good to remember that you are not competing against 200+ other job applicants here. At most you are competing against 4-5 other people *EDIT: once you are getting interviewed by someone in your future job function (most likely your boss) At the phone call level, I think you're up against 10-15 other people*. Once you're in the interview stage, your odds of winning are much higher.

**Evaluating the offer**

The main question to answer, ""Is the package worth the work I'm doing?"" To simplify this paragraph, I will focus on pay - but honestly everyone should be getting some form of additional health insurance &amp; vacation &amp; sick leaves more than the minimum mandated by the law (5 is the minimum guys...it sucks). The only exception is freelance/remote work, where your pay should be higher than standard.

Honestly it is very hard to give advice on ""how much should I be paid?"" without knowing the company you're applying for, the position you're going for, and your educational/extracurricular/internship background. My best advice here is to ask your college upperclassmen (2-3 years above you is ideal -- they *should* have already had raises/moved jobs so should be more comfortable disclosing pay for their job) and to work together with your batchmates (help each other out!!!). At the same time, if you are okay with the offer even if it is lower than standard AND you know you will get a lot of good experience... I would lean towards accepting it. My first pay was lower than what I was aiming for and I had to negotiate to get it. The initial offer was 2K lower. I told them I wouldn't be accepting it unless it was higher and they increased it by 10%. I did end up accepting it even if it was lower than ideal because I had a very good feeling about my future boss (and everyone was telling me that ""my first boss was important"") and I knew I would be able to add something substantial to my resume. I was right on both points. Again, I was not earning for my family at the time - I could afford to go lower. This may not be the case for you. And as someone who did go lower than expected for another job and had additional family expenses... NEVER GO LOWER THAN WHAT YOU NEED!

Markers of experience worth a lower than desired paycheck: good boss vibes from the interview, clear job descriptions with ownership of things important to the company &amp; doing something new/innovative (either based on the company, the role, or just even in the context of your resume).

I have no experience with job bonds but my gut feel is that if they have to force you to stay on for X years (and it's a full-time employee, not project related position) there is probably a reason. It may just be they want to recoup the benefits of training....it may also be because no one will stay otherwise.

**tldr: know yourself enough so you can target the jobs best suited for you, put your best foot forward in every way possible to stand out during the job application process, and know what you're worth to get a first job that will be, at least, tolerable**


*PS: I'm writing this on a caffeine high so may edit this tomorrow to make it more concise. If you have advice for that, please comment haha*

*PPS: I got a good portion of interviews and one of my other jobs through networking/referrals - if you want a post for that I'm willing to write one haha*"

os4s8p,0,2021-07-26,How difficult is it to intern in one office and get a return offer at another in big tech companies?,gitletftw,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/os4s8p/how_difficult_is_it_to_intern_in_one_office_and/,"Hi! For context, I’m studying in the Bay Area but grew up in NY and my ideal scenario is to be working in NYC after undergrad (to be close to family etc.).

With that in mind, should I be primarily applying to internship openings in NYC? I’ve been applying almost entirely to SF openings because I figured my school would hold more merit, and because I also kinda wanna experience what it’s like to work on the west coast (knowing I plan to settle down on the east coast).

But if entertaining that would mean giving up the opportunity for a return offer in nyc, the excitement factor is less of a priority for me.

So my question is, how easy is it to get a relocation on return offers? Is it as easy as checking off a box, or would I have to enter a new interview loop as a fresh applicant, since the other office has never met me?

I realize this is highly dependent on the company, but part of this is so I can learn which companies are more flexible and which ones are historically strict on location."

os55vw,1,2021-07-26,Looking for some context on my out of Grad school job offer,El_Gris1212,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/os55vw/looking_for_some_context_on_my_out_of_grad_school/,"As background, I did not start my career on a traditional development path, so I'm not extremely familiar with skill or pay expectations. My undergrad is in Business Administration, as coming out of high-school I was unsure what I truly wanted to commit to. I ended up disliking my general business curriculum, and I picked up a CS minor to start shifting my direction more towards Business IT. After graduation in spring of 2020, I started a Masters in Information Systems and ended up landing an internship in software development making internal applications for a relatively large construction company.

The internship has gone well, and they are extending me a full time position starting at 60k a year with a 3k signing bonus. I enjoyed working development, and would like to continue down that path, but as someone with more of a CS adjacent degree I'm not sure if I'm being valued correctly. I live in a relatively high-cost area, and 60k starting seems to be on the lower end for developers with masters degrees. The work I did for my internship wasn't particularly rigorous, even though I also understand with my less specialized background I probably have limited raw coding skills/experience compared to most people coming out of grad school in this field. I'm definitely not unhappy with this offer, most of my friends from college can't even find jobs in this current economy, I just want to know how this looks relative to other potential options in this field that I may be able to pursue with my background."

I missed the application window for internships for next summer because I was working full time this spring and had no time to research, network, or apply, and I feel like I completely lost out.  I’m super anxious about not finding a job or one that pays enough to pay off loans, and not finding an internship for next summer.  Everything I’m looking into is super competitive and I feel like there’s no chance I’m going to get anything this late.  I’m a math and finance major for reference, so jobs definitely exist, they’re all just super competitive.  I have a 3.9 gpa, and I can interview easily (every interview I’ve had I’ve gotten an offer from), but my concern is getting to the interview because of the whole black box application process.  I know I’m not alone in my experiences, I just feel like I am and need advice on how to deal with it and how to get some interviews.

TLDR: overwhelmed by application process, feel like I’ll never get a job."
os7u8w,0,2021-07-26,Internship offer - red flags,TechnicalEstate8733,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/os7u8w/internship_offer_red_flags/,"Edit: Thank you all who replied. I won't be moving forward with this internship! 

Some context about me - I'm a senior in CS graduating in May 2022. I had no luck with getting any internships so far except this one. I would be pretty excited getting one finally but there are a bunch of red flags I noticed during my interviewing and now when I got my offer. 

- It's unpaid. Yes, I know, unpaid internships are pretty terrible in general. But seeing as this will be my last chance to get some professional experience, my fear of not getting a job, and my desperation necessitates getting at least *something.* 

- It's a startup. About 15 people are working there when I checked the company's LinkedIn and I read many horror stories about interns getting completely crushed under the amount of work with little lifelines. It is remote, and they did tell me to expect about 20 hours of work weekly, but I'm currently registered for 16 credits for fall and I'm not sure if I'll be able to balance the two. Plus, I fear that 20 hours can quickly turn into a lot more because it's a startup. 

- Interview process was sketchy. I'll be honest, I thought I completely bombed the two interviews I had. I was nervous, I mumbled, and I didn't know stuff. They asked me some personal questions and technical questions, but I found it weird that they didn't ask me about any of the projects on my resume. 

- They want me to sign an NDA. Despite my terrible interviews, I somehow landed an offer from them. And alongside that they want me to sign an NDA. I'm fairly certain that NDAs are common in this industry but I have zero references since I never had to sign one. All the legal jargon flies over my head, plus with all the other stuff compounded, this particular one stands out like a sore thumb. 

So, yeah, I don't know how to proceed. All my friends and family are saying to do it because ""experience"" but I really don't know what I'll be getting myself into."
os8au5,4,2021-07-26,How to treat this opportunity from my manager?,IThoroughlyEnjoyENG,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/os8au5/how_to_treat_this_opportunity_from_my_manager/," Hey  everybody! I am a rising senior mechanical engineering student at my  first summer internship with a large company. From what my  manager/mentor has been telling me in our recent meetings, it seems like  he is happy with the work that I have done this summer and wants to  help me get a full time job with the company in its aerospace division,  which is an area of high interest for me as an engineer and my skills  seem to line up nicely with their goals. Over the next few weeks, he is  going to schedule calls with me and some of the mechanical engineering  team leads in the aerospace division, who are situated high up in their  organization, so we can get to know each other.

I  am extremely thrilled and thankful that this is happening, and I am  nearly certain that this is what I want to do after graduating next  spring. With this being said, it also feels that this is happening so  early and I am a little scared to make what feels like a commitment so  early.

* For  one, being able to land a job in aerospace for this company would mean  moving across the country; it is in a nice city which I would be excited  to explore, but I would probably also feel sad and somewhat guilty for  leaving my family.
* Also,  I am not sure if I know our aerospace side well enough from a technical  and business standpoint yet to relate to whom I will be meeting with or  to make a big decision if they extend one to me this soon. Furthermore,  I am not sure how things would work out if they offer me a job to  accept this summer and I do happen to come across a better opportunity  elsewhere over the next year.

Overall,  this seems like a great company to work for, and landing a job this  early would probably be a dream come true for me not having to worry as  much about job searching my senior year. I am just not sure yet if I am  ready to make the commitment if this is what my manager and the  aerospace leads are looking for given how much can change regarding my  feelings about moving so far from home, opportunities that come up, etc.

Do  you have any advice for how to handle meeting these leads and how to  discuss my thoughts on a potential opportunity while making the most of  it? So far, I have been treating it like a job interview with doing  whatever research I can fit in about certain products that our aerospace  designs and manufactures. I truly appreciate your time and help!"
os97v0,0,2021-07-26,Another internship that’s the opposite of what I want to do.,throwawxy_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/os97v0/another_internship_thats_the_opposite_of_what_i/,"Here we go.

Last fall, I co-oped with a large company that makes travel items. I wanted to work on hardware for commercial applications, but got stuck working on software for other applications. I tried to make the best of it, but that combined with them wanting an older intern with more experience made the job awful.

Last spring, after not receiving any summer internship offers, I accepted a software engineering co-op for this fall with another large company that makes kitchen items. In the moment I was excited but as time went on, I realized I really didn’t want to do this co-op. After running the numbers, though, it turns out that I need the money, so I absolutely have to do it.

So, last week I get an email asking to put in my preferences. I had work, so I didn’t get to put them in until right before the deadline (yes, I know, so this is probably my own fault).

Not only did I not get placed in my top 3; I got placed in one of my bottom 3 departments working with embedded software/firmware, which is the exact opposite of what I wanted to do. Again.

Usually I am of the mindset “the worst they can say is no,” but I’m really not sure if that’s the right approach here. Would it be a dick move to ask to switch teams? How should I go about doing this? Would it reflect negatively on me? This isn’t a company I’m looking to work for in the future due to its location, so getting future rotations/offers isn’t really something I’m worried about.

I’m just fucking pissed and don’t want another internship that I get nothing out of other than an emphatic confirmation that it’s something I have no interest in doing. Please drop any words of wisdom you have, even if it’s just that I’m screwed.

Thanks, all."

It basically was me saying I was a little worried about what the requested optimizations where doing to kernel binary size  (exceeding 7MB) and got kinda laughed at? But then they did not indicate if they were laughing because ""wow that's a huge bin file"" or because it's comically small and I don't need to worry. I don't have a good intuition for this kind of thing yet. Any perspective would be very helpful because I'm very confused."
osavt0,16,2021-07-26,Am I just having a bad experience at my internship or am I actually just bad at SWE,throwaway383648,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/osavt0/am_i_just_having_a_bad_experience_at_my/,"I’m a junior in college and this summer I started my first internship, which I’m close to completing now. 

My project has mainly just been making some automated chaos tests for an application, so I’ve had to ask a bunch of questions about it to the people who worked on it. Thing is, my mentor is the only one who knows the Java side. 

I’m pretty good at Java, so if I have questions it’s pretty much only about the application itself. But I’ve just been having a tough time lately because my mentor can be hard to reach. Like I check in with him at least once per day just to update him on my progress but it’s been a week since I’ve gotten a response and I know he’s available, at least for like a single message. 

I’ve been trying my best to work around it which involves working on other bugs or another project I have (which I don’t need to ask questions about) but since all the deadlines are coming up I feel like I’m screwed and I won’t be able to deliver, which has gotten me really stressed since the other SWE intern has gotten a ton done. 

I honestly do like other aspects of the job and my manager does seem to like me but I’m not sure if I’d want to continue here. I just hope that I don’t have a similar experience at whatever company I intern at next year."

osb1mn,4,2021-07-26,how to get into Data science/ML masters after econ bsc,haveyoumetouz,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/osb1mn/how_to_get_into_data_scienceml_masters_after_econ/,"Hello friends, I am currently in my third year in economic bsc but I would like to get a job in the quantitative finance sector, so I would like to apply DC/ML or quantitative finance masters but I am not sure if I qualify for them because of my major.

Currently I am trader/data scientist intern at fintech startup and I can do basic stuff in python like pandas, multiple regression models, knn and using finance APIs. But this is all I know about cs, however I am pretty sure that I enjoy coding, particularly when it is related to finance. Is there a chance that I can put my head into such programs?

If it is related all my mathematic classes have been A or A-. I took linear algebra, diff equations, statistics and probability, econometrics and of course calculus and aced all of them. And my reference letters is pretty impressive. I can probably get letters from teachers graduated from columbia,princeton or oxford, my school is very well known across europe.

For example, LMU in Germany has DC masters but it requires at least 30 ECTS of programming courses. Does that mean I do not have a shot for LMU? And I can at most take  2 ıntro to programming classes at my university, it is hard to take them because of my major."
osb284,10,2021-07-26,Question regarding projects,turkishjedi21,EngineeringResumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/comments/osb284/question_regarding_projects/,"So important context: I'm a rising junior majoring in computer engineering. Im looking for my first internship, no prior relevant work experience

I've been getting conflicting information regarding putting projects on ym resume.

Because I'm new in the grand scheme of things, my projects so far haven't been anything crazy. I have a c++ project that I did as the final project for my second c++ class, and I have a final project that I did for my second digital logic class. Both projects required good knowledge of the material covered in the courses.

I've been told by some that the projects aren't ""interesting"" enough, and they aren't impressive enough. These were constructive comments, not hating.

My brother on the other hand (currently his third year employed as an EE) , says that as long as I understand the project well enough to describe it in detail, it uses concepts that I'm familiar with, and I can appropriately name it, I can put it on my resume

What are your guys' thoughts? I understand my brothers side more, because that way I can at least convey my interest through my projects, and it shows that I'm working on stuff outside of class (the project I'm considering adding was done completely outside of class over the summer), on top of showing where I'm at with concepts.

I can't imagine leaving projects out of my resume until they're very advanced could be a good idea. The only thing I have going for me right now is my GPA and my projects, seems like id be greatly missing out by not putting projects that reflect my current understanding on my resume"

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* UNH (EA)

**Additional Information:**

My dream school since I was a freshman was Johns Hopkins and would have applied early, but I wasn't ready. I'm glad I didn't because I never would have gotten into  MIT and the other schools. Sorry Johns Hopkins, I still love you.

For future applicants, I advise you apply early if you are ready, but don't worry if you aren't. I didn't apply early anywhere except my safety and I was fine. I know my test scores aren't bad at all, but compared to a lot of other people at MIT, they suck. So I guess, don't be discouraged to submit your test scores if they're not up to par with the top students who get in. Also try not to procrastinate as much as I did!!! Good luck"

osd87r,2,2021-07-26,"Greek Philosophy PhD, no job experience besides teaching, can’t find academic employment. What should I do?",jobhuntjobhunt,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/osd87r/greek_philosophy_phd_no_job_experience_besides/,"Hi all,
 
This is a new alt account for career research. 

I’m wondering if anyone has any advice for someone who’s received a PhD in Ancient Greek philosophy, has taught multiple classes, published in professional journals, but is currently unable to find academic employment. I probably could get a tenure-track teaching position somewhere, but, now that I have kids, I’m unwilling to separate them from their grandparents. And the odds of finding a college looking for an ancient philosophy specialist *and* getting the job are incredibly slim.

I knew the risks and went “all in” on my passion, but I lost. (Rather: I misjudged how willing I’d be to move away from my family after having kids.) What do I do now? I’m smart, I learn quickly, I write well, and I’m an excellent researcher. But I’ve never had a real job besides fast food and managing my father’s pizza shop. I majored in philosophy, so I don’t have an “employable” major. Just wondering what the path of least resistance is to finding a decent job.

I’m thinking of computer coding or finance/stock market stuff, but I’m not sure I can really get good enough at coding on my own to get a job and finance seems very hard to crack into or even get an internship without a relevant major. 

I’ve thought about law school (actually got a full ride years ago but turned it down for the PhD), but I don’t think I can go three years without income. My wife works but does not make enough to support our family in a HCOL area.

Any guidance or suggestions here would be appreciated."

I'm a rising junior in college looking to land an internship with a game development studio, ideally for next Summer, but I'd be willing to start earlier or have it go for longer.

I started learning game development back in July 2020. I've published one game to the iOS App Store with my friend, and I am almost finished with my short solo project that I will be publishing to itch. Both games were made in Unity, so I have a decent understanding of how the engine works. My main strength is programming but I have also done the artwork for both of my games (3D low poly and 2D pixel art) and I would say my art is slowly improving, but still has a very long way to go.

I was wondering what the most important qualities / traits are for people applying for an internship at a game studio. I am willing to go for an indie or AAA studio and I would be open to relocating for a time (provided I'm not at school). Bethesda is my most ideal place to work because they are located the closest to my home. I am curious if I should focus on learning technical skills such as C++, or stick to creating games in Unity and expand my knowledge and experience with making games.

Couple of other traits to note:

1. I have pretty good programming knowledge, I am familiar with C#, Java, C, Python, etc. although I have never really worked with C++
2. I am currently wrapping up an internship with a government contractor, but I do not have any connections in the games industry (should I try reaching out to people on LinkedIn? not sure how that all works)

I appreciate any advice you all can give me! Thank you!"

How can I do so given that I am not from computer sci/ sw engineering background?  I have done simple python/matlab in my coursework previously if that helps.

osgq87,3,2021-07-27,Looking for advice on whether I should leave my job while in a internship or continue doing both.,Anointed33,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/osgq87/looking_for_advice_on_whether_i_should_leave_my/,"Hi, hope all is well. I'm in a little dilemma, I would love advice and reassurance from you all.
6 months ago I got into a program that teaches you IT related skills and then puts you in a internship with a giant tech company. Well I did really well and landed an internship with a one of the World's most popular companies.
Throughout the program I was working at a retail job as a budtender. I have been at this job for almost two years. I got to meet cool people, saved a lot of money, and built extreme discipline being sober for almost 9 months while working at a cannabis club. The program was all from home so I got to work from home then after I went to work part time.
Now I'm starting my internship and will be commuting two hours a day. I am debating on leaving my part time job and focusing solely on the internship. The problem is my program pays me a stipend of $1,000 a month. Which is good, but I would have to be more conservative with my funds. I also have a lot of money saved up and my cost of living is low at the moment. I am not sure if I should leave my job and focus solely on the internship or continue working part time while in my internship. While I do have a lot saved up, I would hate to dip into my savings for anything that may come up. However at the same time for 6 months I have been doing school and work for 60-70 hours a week. I have been putting off some self-development, I have been wanting to practice meditation, yoga and read over 45+ books that I have been accumulating over the past year. I still am struggling with self-love and need to work on that aspect of myself. On top of that, I would love to sped more time with my family.
Basically what I'm asking is do I leave my job and focus on the internship or continue working while doing my internship, the only problem would be is I'd be really busy. My heart is saying to possibly leave, but I don't really like the idea of not making as much income as I have been making for 6 months."

I graduated college with a degree in economics from a state university a few months ago. 

I worked through (and still work) at the distribution center for a major retailer in their warehouse through college. 

I’ve tried to get ahead in my current job. I applied for a “merit” position and lost the position to a coworker with no degree and less relevant experience; I honestly think it was more favoritism that set them over the edge to get the position. 

I’ve put in for jobs constantly - I would honestly venture to say I have submitted 200 applications since I graduated. While I make really good money, I’m torn between staying at my job for the short term vs taking a possible pay cut and furthering my career. 

My current plan is to stay with my job until the beginning of 2022, at which time I’ll receive a few thousand dollars back in tuition reimbursement. Until then, I’ll try to work as many hours as I can stand - at that time I will be willing and able to take a possible pay cut. 

While this is a small wait, I’m a few years older than the traditional college grad ( mid 20s). However, since I’ve finished my degree, I’ve gotten increasingly less patient with my management. In many regards, they too just graduated college. I’ve seen very green interns and recent grads alike get management positions with no experience, meanwhile I have experience and a degree and have no prospects for advancement. 

I apologize for not posting a more concise thread, I just wanted to get the thoughts that have been living inside my head out."

oshy3v,73,2021-07-27,How to tell my AP I'm not coming back,pink-pheasant,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/oshy3v/how_to_tell_my_ap_im_not_coming_back/,"A few years ago my dad kicked me (24F then) out of his house when I wanted to introduce my non Indian boyfriend to. Because everything was taken from me (including my money and phone) I said yes to his condition to let me stay in the family house - to never speak to my boyfriend again or go out etc. Me and him still spoke via a spare phone I had. A few months later I had to leave for an internship that was in a different state, so I was able to leave my hometown and live there, so I was able to leave the house (on the condition I'd come back home when I'd finish my internship) and maintain my relationship in secret.

But my internship manager offered my a full time position, which would mean I'd permanently would be in a different state. Dad wasn't happy with this idea saying  ""I'll never speak to you again if you take this job"" ""you'll have to take care of yourself financially I won't be there for you"" ""I'd rather you stay living I this house and not have a job"".. I'm very nervous to put myself back in that territory and to literally be locked up again. I'm also doing weekly therapy sessions which he doesn't know about and will get super angry when he finds out - because most of my trauma is from that behaviour. Generally, I feel much better when I'm not in that house, or speaking to him everyday.

After a few weeks he said he'd be ok with me doing the job, but there's a small break between my permanent job starting and when the internship ends. This break starts next week so he's expecting me to come back this week. I want to tell him I won't be back till after my job starts, so I'd wait a few weeks before letting him see me or I see him in person.

How do I say this to my dad without sounding unreasonable (they've said sorry so from his side so he thinks he hasn't done anything that would make me scared from taking this job). Even though what he's saying may be true, I don't want to take a risk on my freedom when I'm settled in a good position now. I still want to maintain a relationship with my dad."

Ever since my supervisor quit, I've been left to pick up the pieces and considering I've only been here for 5 weeks and I'm classed as an intern, they've just given me an entire business to run and the stress of it all I hate, especially when in my opinion at least, they've bitten off more than they can chew. But I might be wrong, this might just be how they operate but it isn't how I think/work and that just makes it worse. 

The company itself too I just don't like. It's incredibly competitive (when I'm not) and everyone here is so outgoing and goes out for drinks after work etc. Meanwhile after work I'm too tired for that and I just want to go home and see my partner. They also ask to work during your lunches and when I was off ill, my manager still asked for me to work from home even though I said I wasn't going to work due to being ill. 

I understand that going from uni to a placement, especially an full time office job can be hard and tricky but i feel like I've gotten used to that. What I don't think I've gotten used to, or ever will, is the way they work here and how they want me to work. I've already spoken to my uni about it and they suggested to wait a couple more weeks and see how I feel, but I have a feeling that when it comes round to talking to them again, it'll be the same, if not worse. 

Any advice from just anyone, especially those that have felt like this in the past would be great. I'm really not sure what I should do and I've sort of banged this out before I start work today so sorry if it doesn't make much sense... If you need more info just feel free to ask. I'm pretty sure I've made up my mind to quit just because I'm so unhappy here but idk what I'm gonna do afterwards or when I should do it etc. And it doesn't help that I don't even have any time to think about this because pretty much all I'm doing is working constantly now. 

Either way, any help/advice would honestly mean so much to me"
ositw5,3,2021-07-27,Carrer Advice for Career Switch Individuals (BA) in the working world,Various_Pain3065,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ositw5/carrer_advice_for_career_switch_individuals_ba_in/,"Hi, I'm a Business Analyst in a big startup company and I just started working in this company since Oct 2020. Prior to working here, I graduated from a bachelors degree in Accounting and Finance. Basically I decided to do a career switch and landed on this Business Analyst role - hoping that it would bring me one step closer to becoming a data scientist 

I am the only BA in my team, basically no one else knows/understands the codes and logics that have been in placed. Not even my boss. The person that had this position previously left long before I join the company. If I ever need help, Id have to ask help from those in the Tech /Data team - which majority of the time they dont have time to reply or teach me or make sure Im doing the right thing as they have more important things to work on.

Over the past almost 9 months, I have been learning how to read and fix codes on the job without any mentor or senior to double check on my work. This has bite me back when I made a huge mistake during an update of the logic in the code. This was when I was only 4 months in, and I was just getting the hang of how the code runs. That mistake caused a huge discrepancies for a financial report that the finance team had to send to our clients. Since then, I get panic attacks in the morning and at night, hoping that I havent made any mistake. 

Ive mentioned to my boss about this issue and I was not comfortable with given so much responsibility at this early stage but my boss only cared about the output and that the problem was resolved and now there are no more issues. My boss also shrugged off about the fact that I was not comfortable with this amount of pressure. It sort of implies that my boss doesnt want to know what is really going on. 

Aside from that, being the only BA in the team means Id be participating in multiple different projects, helping my teammates with their respective services that they are primarily working on. It has its pros and cons. Pros would be Id understand the type of services that the company provides and cons would be Id only understand it from a very top view perspective bc I am only involved in one small part of the whole service. It becomes harder for me whenever people require my validation on certain logics in the code at very last minute and I would get panic attacks again bc I dont deal with the codes on a daily basis and I am not involved with how the output data is being used after it is generated and also it takes a while for me to understand 200+ lines of code that was written by someone else. 

The more I read these codes, the more I realized that these codes have not been updated for quite sometime which also explains the issues that id run into. I also realised that Ive been picking up bad habits along the way as I am maintaining these bunch of codes - learning how to just force the code to run the way it should be when suddenly there's an error. Basically now the code is in poor condition and needs to be revamped but no one is doing it. For the code that is incharge of the company's revenue, as much as Id want to just fix it right away, I know I dont have enough knowledge to do it, let alone the confidence to do it by myself. 


As Oct 2021, is nearing, so is the end of my contract with this company. Lately, I have this huge tendency of giving my notice soon (since id have to give a 2 months notice) bc I cant take it anymore. I dont have another job line up but I do have a plan to just take up a bootcamp course while finding another job /internship bc I feel my current job isnt supporting me the way I needed to be supported and I am not growing my technical skills. 

My family told me to just try to stay until end of the year but thinking about staying another 2 more quarters with the company just makes me want to puke because of the amount of uncertainty that comes with this role and there's no one to back me up. 

My family is worried that once I quit it is harder to get another job. So might as well stay and have this job as a safety net while I look for another. 

Honestly, I am tired of having this mentality of suffering now while waiting for something better. I just want to stop this pressure that I feel bc it has been demotivating me to even want to pursue my career of becoming a data science. Im worried that once my comtract ends and I become a full time employee, itll be harder for me to quit my job if I dont have any offer. Ill just keep on delaying it even more. 

My questions would be:
1) Is it normal for someone who just switched careers to be given this amount of respomsibility and not have any senior that can help guide?
2) It is okay to want to quit without any job lined up? Ive talked to my parents about this and they are okay with me being unemployed as long as I have a plan but is it really okay?
3) Is it normal to feel this way?"

Basically the whole company is allowed to WFH except me and a colleague my age (we’re both young). 
Nobody comes to the office except the two of us, not even the bosses.

I spoke about this with colleagues and they said the bosses have no problem whatsoever with people WFH and are not aware of any rules that are different because of our junior roles. 

Both our roles are entirely working on a laptop so it doesn’t make a difference on the type of work we can do. 

I spoke to my boss about my personal needs for this two months ago and he said he’d look into it ‘administratively’ but last week he emailed my colleague and then called me to say that for us it’s not a thing unless it’s an emergency. He did not give an explaination on why it is so (‘administratively’ he only needs to send an email to fix this and maybe fill in a form). 

I don’t want to work remote full time, I just want the flexibility to go work somewhere else sometimes.

I am young but I have an awesome CV with a top master degree from abroad and several internships from very renowned organisations abroad and came back to Italy for this job (full-time) during covid,in a city 4 hours away from my hometown. 
I like the job and it would be probably hard to find another one like this in the short term but this doesn’t sit right with me.

Is it silly to keep asking to fix this, should I make it clear this is something worth leaving the job for me? 

I am a resource for them, they are also training me but with all the projects we have at the same time they would be in  trouble if I left. I’ve started looking for other jobs, but in Italy the summer is an halt period so there’s not much currently on the market.

What should I do? How do I approach this?"

Wondering if I could get some advice or just some resources. I’m quite new to this thread so please take it easy on me as I try to navigate this.

I’m a recent PR graduate (bachelors) who has had 1-2 years experience within the PR field with 3 internships under my belt.

I love Australia so much, and before anyone asks questions like “why would you want to leave?” - please understand that I realise how incredibly fortunate I am to live in a wonderful country with so many benefits.

However, PR and agency work is very sparse in my country, whereas, the US and UK have way more opportunities. 

My ideal scenario would be to live overseas for a few years and see how it goes. The hard part is finding a job that will take me-

Is my only option to just go overseas and find a job while I’m there? Is it worth the risk? I have money saved but the AUD isn’t as strong so it’ll go down quite a bit.

I’ve tried looking at as many possible resources, as well as trying to reach out to recruiters. Anyone have any advice or resources? 

Thanks guys!"
oslgbu,174,2021-07-27,My year without a job,rampaging_teddy,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/oslgbu/my_year_without_a_job/,"This is gonna be a long one, boys and girls, sit back.

Last September, I left my job working remotely for a US-based company 3 months after I started, leaving me with 3 months of experience, fresh out of university (studied in the US, Carnegie Mellon Uni) in every other sense, and with no other leads. Initially, I was panic applying everywhere and even though I cleared interviews, no opportunity ended up leading anywhere. This was from September last year till around January.

Around this time, my self-esteem was pretty low and I had severe impostor syndrome, despite having been really confident in my abilities as an engineer up to this point. One day, out of the blue, I kinda realized that I wasn't making good use of my time. My parents were supportive and wanted me to find the right opportunity so I had the freedom of time to look for work. Luckier than a lot of others in that sense, I know.

So I decided to just upskill. No courses, nothing fancy, just relearning everything web-related by myself from scratch. I did projects in various areas, not to put on my Resume (and none of them did end up on my Resume) but simply to put problems in front of me and have me work my way around them myself.

This happened in parallel with the occasional interview with a big product company/unicorn startup. Around May was when I started feeling very good about my skill level and the confidence started setting in. I was still clearing interviews like before, but I also asked insightful questions during my interviews and felt more confident in general. Every interview taught me new things, while also reinforcing what I already had.

I was interviewing with a certain large ecommerce giant (B) starting from May, and around June I decided to do a 3-month internship with a Pune-based firm while I waited for opportunities to come through. The internship started off fabulously, and my superiors were kinda stumped at how I finished things way faster than they expected of an intern. It got to the point where the CTO himself joined my morning meeting with my mentor gave me a huge internal project to make decisions on and build. (This was a week into my internship, and also happens to be yesterday). On the very same day, I got a call from my recruiter at the large ecommerce giant B congratulating me. I was extremely ecstatic, but also kinda sad I couldn't work on this project (would've been hella fun).

I called the CTO to let him know and he asked if he could make a full-time counter offer. 

Completely out of the blue, shocked the hell out of me. 

Well, they couldn't offer as much as Amazon, and the location was also Pune (I live/grew up in Bangalore and love it to bits as a city), so I had to say no to him. Got the offer letter today and now I'm gonna be an Amazon SDE-1.

10 months of unemployment, more rejections at the final stage of interviews than I can count (one company even started talking about delivering my office laptop to me but backed out a day later after the HR round), and a huge grind later (no leetcode because I was already a competitive programmer in uni), I finally made it.

Thanks for reading this wall of text if you made it here. The biggest lesson I got from my period without a job is the value of just learning new frameworks and trying new things for fun. I'm gonna allocate some of my free time even after I start work to upskilling and keeping up to date with tech, frameworks, and libraries. The first week at my internship was proof of how far I'd come from whom I was a year ago. I feel like I'm 10 times more productive and a world apart in terms of experience compared to my old self.

My 2 cents to give from this experience: Leetcode is great and all for interviews, but making sure to put some time into upskilling to the point where you carry yourself with the confidence of an experienced dev is an extremely valuable trait to have, and I'm sure it really shows in the interviews."

Just a quick background. I have a BS degree in Information Technology and a CompTIA A+ certificate. I am currently a hardware field tech in the USA. Been at the same company for over 2.5 years now making $18/hr. I troubleshoot and repair laptops, printers, rack, cable, and replace hard drives in servers/storage systems at people's houses and businesses. Have an internship help desk experience few years back with active directory, office 365, imaging experiences too.   


Have been wanting to get into a help desk office role as I prefer not to drive so many miles every day. Have no problem making it to second interviews but that is where it stops. Even for entry level help desk roles, they don't think that I have enough trouble shooting, active directly or office 365 experience. I would let them know that I have trouble shooting experiences with my current job and active directory in my previous internship and that I am willing/interested to learn and expand my skill set.  


Any suggestions on how I can get into help desk roles? Does having server experiences on my resume make them think I won't like help desk? Would getting a CCNA cert help? I've tried both direct hires and contract agencies at companies and data centers. Thanks in advance!"

I’m 20 and starting my final year of cs engineering in a tier 1 college. I was put into this field by my parents and took it up without much thinking since they said it’s just a foundational bachelors degree. I got depression and started self harming since the first year itself

I did two internships in two companies that are like some of the world’s top tech companies. Both failed miserably with no return offer, no learning and absolute incapability from my side and I knew this field is not for me I don’t like it I am not interested in this. I had multiple breakdowns and conveyed this to my parents and they said they understand and that I don’t have to do it if I don’t like it but they want me to sit for placements again that are starting in a week and that stuff gives me insane anxiety and worsens my depression 

I wanted to pursue culinary because that is something I absolutely love but my parents don’t seem very keen on it and don’t want to spend money on a 3 year course after a wasted bachelors 

Even when they found out about my self harm etc they didn’t take it too seriously and continue to taunt me on it. My desire to indulge in anything career related is dead and my only hope for some happiness is marrying into a nice family as a stay at home wife where I will be happy hopefully

I’ve hired a very reputable lawyer who is familiar with the area as they work in it, and has many fabulous reviews concerning getting charges reduced, and who most likely has a relationship with the judge. They have given me the following recommendations (I’m doing all of them):
- Have speedometer calibrated
- Send a copy of your resume (for me, this includes entrepreneurial experience and an internship, as well as multiple awards for high academic achievement, as well as entrepreneurship)
- Complete at least 60 hours of community service
- Complete an 8 hour driver improvement clinic and a 4 hour aggressive driving course.

In addition to the lawyer’s recommendations, I’m having a trusted professor write a Letter of Character attesting to my character, and may have my boss write me a letter of character as well. I’ll also most likely be completing more than 60 hours of community service. I have a 100% clean record, and have +2 positive points on my driving record.

I LOVE developing people, laying out a career path with them, working with them to improve themselves, etc, but I don't think it is needed to have the formal assignment of such a role which often comes with management and therefor a lot of politics. 

Further, I realized that the nicest working days are sitting with my colleagues and thinking about new architectures and so on. Hence, I could imagine that a more hands-on role would maybe suit me and my personality better (I don't have the typical manager personality).

Since role descriptions and titles are often more than ambiguous, I would love to hear your input on own experiences in taking such a change.

ostaco,1,2021-07-27,Can someone rate my chance of going to grad school ?,[deleted],gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/ostaco/can_someone_rate_my_chance_of_going_to_grad_school/,"Hi, bit of background about me

\-Study at community college for 2 years. GPA is 3.87

\-Transferred to UMich. Graduated with double majors in Econs and Stats. GPA is 2.94

\-Worked as an intern for 3 months at a risk advisory firm in Singapore then for a Big 4 auditing firm in Vietnam for 15 months. I also had 12 months of part time work and internship experience while in schools with the longest stint being a clerk at my community college for 7 months

\- On my GRE practice test (did not prepare carefully to the best of my ability for this one), I got a 166 for quant (87th percentile) and 158 for verbal (79th percentile)

I am looking to get a MS in Computer Information Systems, Data Analytics Concentration at Boston University. They say that their student average GRE percentile is 60% for Verbal and 80% for Quantitative. Can anyone rate my chance of getting in ?"
ostmum,9,2021-07-27,"What websites do you use to search for entry-level CS jobs on the west coast, and what search criteria do you use?",tesrella,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ostmum/what_websites_do_you_use_to_search_for_entrylevel/,"Hi everybody, it's a pleasure to talk with you here. I appreciate your insights.

TL;DR, what websites do you use to search for entry-level CS jobs on the west coast, and what search criteria do you use? 

For some context, I graduated in April with a BS-CS from a midwest school (EMU in MI, USA) with a 3.7 GPA. In 2018 I participated in a state-funded summer bootcamp for frontend design in ReactJS for 1 month, in 2019 I interned at Tesla on their Service-Engineering team working with Python/command-line stuff for 3 months, and in 2020 I was supposed to intern at Delta but that fell through (COVID cuts).

In my job searching, I'm currently trying to find a job on the West Coast (preference on CA, secondly OR, lastly WA). I'm not exactly sure what I should be looking for in a job at this stage in my professional development, though, and I'm either not looking in the right places for entry-level positions or they just don't really exist right now due to the state of ""things"" in the world.

What websites do you use to search for entry-level CS jobs on the west coast? What search criteria do you use? How long on average should it take me to find a job given my experience and search criteria?"

I have worked in corporate offices for around 6-7 years, one of those years in cybersecurity as an intern.  But for the past 4 years in accounting, while going to school for my MS in cybersecurity.  
I have applied to maybe 100+ positions (entry level and up) even ones I don't really think I'd care for, but would at least get my foot in a door.  I haven't gotten anything back besides a handful of emails saying no.  I have even called companies to try to get something back with no avail.
My resume is impressive and unique, but professional looking.  So I'm not sure what I can do more to get anything, since no one will take a chance on someone with little to no experience, even though I am easily taught and a fast learner, which shows since I got my masters in less than 2 years, while working full time!"
osudpb,2,2021-07-27,Feeling overwhelmed from my internship at a small company,curryflavored,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/osudpb/feeling_overwhelmed_from_my_internship_at_a_small/,I’m currently on my second to last week of my remote internship at a small IT company. To sum things up it’s a very small company (less than 15 employees) and I feel like it’s been a horrible learning experience. I’ve been thrown on this project after my first week and I have no experience with the software used for this project. My boss knew that and still just threw the work at me and told me to figure it out. My direct superior that I used to go to for assistance is busy on a bigger project and I’ve been told to leave him alone by the company “president”. I’m currently stuck on the very last task to get this project to work and it’s very complicated. My boss chewed me out saying that I need to step it up and figure it out because it’s elementary level work. I don’t feel like it’s as simple as he makes it at all. I’ve completed so much work with such little training and find it so disrespectful that they just blame the setbacks on me being dumb. My boss is very derogatory when I ask for help as if I’m not a intern. Is it wrong for me to feel like I should be cut some slack considering I’m working completely alone and have zero experience with what I’m doing? Has anyone else had a horrible experience with their internship like this? I have no clue how to move forward at all and it’s ruining what I thought would be a fun learning experience.
osv2dp,0,2021-07-27,When to apply for a desired internship role?,MarshallArtz,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/osv2dp/when_to_apply_for_a_desired_internship_role/,"Hi, I'm a current CS student at UNT in Texas and I was wondering if I should wait to apply for more sought after internships at Amazon, Facebook, etc. so that I can finish courses in Data Structures and Algorithms and other advanced courses or should I go ahead and apply now and reapply for the same role around April time?

I assume it would very much depend on if these companies review on a rolling basis or not. Thanks in advance for the advice!"
osvlmu,1,2021-07-27,Feeling very lost and uncertain as a computer science student who will be graduating next year.,Poniyes,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/osvlmu/feeling_very_lost_and_uncertain_as_a_computer/,"A little bit of background on myself - I am not a very qualified or standout computer science student. My first year and a half of college I did not accomplish very much in terms of building myself up besides for taking the cs courses that were required of me. At that time, I felt like I had a lot of time to start taking things more seriously in the latter half of my college experience and so I slacked off.

However, COVID hit soon after, and I found myself feeling very unmotivated and lost in life due to some real life circumstances. Online classes really sucked my will to learn out of me, and I continued doing the same as I did before, just doing ok in my classes, without really thinking about improving my post-graduation prospects. I knew I had to apply for internships and find opportunities at that time, but I just didn't, I couldn't focus on these things at that time.

The past few months, I've been coming to terms with my impending graduation. I have little work experience besides for 2 months spent as a research assistant at my school, where I didn't accomplish anything substantial. I have the bare minimum of skills that I've learned from my classes, which I feel are not enough to net me a job in the future. 

I know I have one year left where I can still turn things around to some extent, but I'm feeling very overwhelmed on how to start improving, because it seems there are so many things to do. I'd greatly if anyone could help me break down what I should be doing to make myself qualified, or just any general advice. Thanks!"
oswed1,1,2021-07-27,I need some motivation.,note-takin,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/oswed1/i_need_some_motivation/,"I landed an informal internship for the summer (woo!) and I’ve been doing alright. It’s a small company but I needed all the experience in the field I could get. When I have a good amount of work to do, the day goes by quickly and I feel refreshed and motivated to keep learning. But most days I’m given one task that I finish in an hour. On top of that, it’s a family company made up of all men in their late 20’s/early 30’s (I’m the only student/woman in the office) and I don’t really have good rapport with anyone there that would keep me entertained for the day. 

I know I should be grateful that I have the opportunity to learn, but I can’t help but think of all the other productive things I could be doing at home when I’m just sitting at my desk staring at the same screen for 8 hours straight. It’s starting to feel extremely draining after 2 months, and a part of me wants to give them some lame excuse and quit while I still have a summer left to enjoy and take advantage of. 

tl;dr : I’m getting bored at my internship and I need some extra motivation to keep at it. 

Does anyone have any life experience/wisdom to share?"

Admissions from these schools state students make a successful pivot to IB/consulting. My understanding was it's unrealistic to make the switch to IB/consulting from a PT program WITHOUT an internship.

Does anyone here know or have made this switch from a part-time program? (without interning)"

Hello All,

So, here is the backstory. I am a recent college graduate majoring in computer science and a minor in computer information systems. I played division 1 baseball while completing my degree and often played ""summer ball"" which took away my summer opportunities to land internships to gain valuable professional experience I am now finding out that is very important in the software engineering world. I am looking for an entry level position just to get my feet wet. I really don't even care about the money at this point I just need the experience. I am really struggling to even get noticed on my resume because that professional experience is lacking and ""entry-level"" no longer means entry-level as it once meant. Any advice would be lovely."

ot01zp,4,2021-07-27,Should I pursue a full-time position or summer internship as a rising senior?,asaucez,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ot01zp/should_i_pursue_a_fulltime_position_or_summer/,"I am a rising senior at my university (Computer Science Major) and am currently finishing up an internship this summer for this organization. However, I'm undecided whether I should apply for full-time positions or pursue internships for next summer. The current internship I did this summer wasn't the experience I was expecting and wasn't as challenging. I don't have real experience working at a company so I was wondering what would be best for me? Also, I have a connection at one of the big tech companies and wondering how much could that help in my application process.

I still feel like I don't have much industry experience to be useful in such a setting. I know how to code decently but haven't really had to chance to feel what it's like working on an actual company project and when I would use what. I will take any offer I get if it's in Data Science or Software Engineering. Any tips or suggestions would be kindly appreciated."
ot0cya,888,2021-07-27,Hard Drives? What Hard Drives?,[deleted],talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/ot0cya/hard_drives_what_hard_drives/,"Ok, to set the scene...I work with the DoD so we have pretty strict procedures when it comes to the decommissioning of equipment.  About three months ago we receive an intern.  This intern had about six months to go (now three) on his tour of duty and decided he wanted to get into IT.  He signed up for an internship through the military and before you know it he's walking in our door eager to do the computer things.

His job was to take updates from a secure network and install them in fighter planes.  That's it.  Update goes from A to B, if there were any problems he was to contact someone else.  He has no experience in troubleshooting, desktop support, server support, IT security, no formal IT education, and with the exception of the Sec+ cert he was given years ago by the military he has no professional certifications.

At one point I was showing him a few things related to local security policy and I opened up the local users and groups mmc.  He says ""Is that the registry?""   \*facepalm\*

So...we just went through a PC migration.  A little over 100 computers were replaced with newer models and the old ones are in the process of being decommissioned.  Part of that process is removing, documenting, and destroying the hard drives of the old computers.  The hard drives had been pulled and were awaiting documentation and destruction (something we do on-site).

Today, I find a random hard drive in a drawer and ask my team lead about it.

TL: Yea, I dunno.  Hook it up to a non-network computer and see what's on it.  Maybe we can reuse it.  And while you're at it, check those other two drives in the other drawer!

Me:  What drives?

Intern:  Oh?  I moved those.

Me:  To where?

Intern:  In the back with the rest of them.  I trashed them all yesterday!  \*looking very pleased with himself\*

Suddenly, I feel much sympathy for the poor souls at SolarWinds..."
ot0yea,2,2021-07-27,Any long term affect?,Limp_Flatworm_1832,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ot0yea/any_long_term_affect/,"I am a new graduate, I also finished an internship right before graduation. My previous employer where I interned asked if I wanted a job and he is very excited to hire me (at a low starting wage).

My issue is, I learned a lot in school, and I really like using the MERN stack, his company is a WP company, they only use WP, which is what I was learning as an intern.

I've applied to well over 300 places in the last couple months and had a few interviews that were above anything I've learned yet, so no interviews that fit my skill level. But I will say in the past 24 hours I believe I have found a way to create resumes that will get me more interviews of my skill level.

Anyways for now, my concern is if I take this WP job and still practice React/Node/Next.js on the side if I will be able to get a React position in the future or if by taking a WP job now it will make it harder to get my dream job?

Thanks for your time."

I'm a student and have just started using Excel, which is why I don't have a subscription or anything yet. I've used Excel in the past here and there for internships and for school and I noticed that the one I'm using on my laptop is missing some functions or just doesn't look the same as the Excel I'm used to. I apologize if it's a dumb question but I'm just super new to Excel. For example, the formulas tab usually has many buttons and options but mine only has three and more importantly (the reason why i'm panic-posting right now) the subtotals button that's usually in Data under Outlines is missing. Is this normal? Or do I have to manually add it to my toolbar? Or do I just need to purchase the full subscription to use these functions?"

I spent two years as an intern at the same company doing RTL design before changing my career path because I've always loved writing software.

&amp;#x200B;

My main problem comes from code reviews and verbal deadlines.

&amp;#x200B;

Many of the moderators chosen for these reviews have completely different requirements in coding standards, testing, etc. Some moderators don't seem to care and approve my PR as long as there aren't obvious bugs which causes me worry about code quality since I'm still a junior dev. On the other hand other moderators require extensive documentation, multiple meetings, and dig forever about the little things for days which pushes my completion date back a day or two past my deadline but I learn a ton.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, my team lead asks for dates when we are expected to complete our tasks daily which is fine. But when I underestimate the date they seem disappointed when I don't complete in time, then they'll fight back when I overestimate to give myself breathing room which causes me to miss my deadline. I'd rather have an explicit assigned deadline than bounce back and forth always disappointing my team lead. As a junior dev I feel very overwhelmed and anxious because of my performance, I never make deadlines and hate giving updates during our standups.

&amp;#x200B;

All these things make work unpleasant, how normal is this? I have a 1 on 1 with my manager tomorrow, but they're not involved on my project so I'm not sure how helpful it will be as far as performance anxiety goes. Maybe these issues will get better over time, anyone else deal with something similar?"
ot20vp,2,2021-07-27,"I desperately want to leave my job, but I'm worried about the vulnerable position doing that will leave me in. Need advice!~",-florianraven,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ot20vp/i_desperately_want_to_leave_my_job_but_im_worried/,"I've posted a bit here about this place I'm currently working at and the situation I'm in. I've been looking for advice on how to handle a lot of the shit I deal with, and I've reached a point now that I can't do it anymore - I want out. 

Below is context on my situation so you can understand what's happening. I posted all this a while ago but deleted the post, so it's just a copy and paste. It's quite long winded, so **TL;DR: I work at a toxic shithole that treats me like dirt and I'm getting paid trash to deal with all this.** However, you should probably read the whole thing to understand.

\~ \~ \~ 

**CONTEXT**

I'm a Business Trainee. It's essentially a paid internship where by the end of my 12 month contract, I'll have a business qualification, though I'm getting paid dirt to be here as per government rules. I was hired by the employment centre that runs my traineeship and they've placed me in a fucking squalor. It's a family run roof-racking retail business managed by three bothers -- The Manager (the eldest), The Orders Man (the middle brother), and The Fitter (the youngest). Additionally, their bat-shit mother at aged 70+ also works here. There are only three of us who are non-familial employees -- The Apprentice (also an employee at the employment centre I'm employed by), The Guy (a retail salesman guy who answers many of our phone calls and works in the shop; he's a great guy, a really hard worker), and me.

I have never worked in such a disrespectful workplace. I have never worked in such a toxic environment where this family cares nada about their employees. Want to go on leave, even when you have enough? I don't think so, because we don't have enough staff because these fuckers keep dragging their heels. The Guy wanted to take a week off for school holidays so he can spend time with his kids. What does The Manager do? ""No, I need you, a week is too long. I'll give you Friday and Saturday off."" Is this illegal? Pretty sure it is. I'm just lucky that these wankers aren't my true employers because then I'd never get leave despite being full entitled to it like The Guy. 

The family fights all the time. There are literal screaming matches, all caused by The Fitter who is essentially a man child throwing a tanty when things don't go his way. The Mother is always on The Fitter's side, basically being very combative against The Orders Man and The Manager -- her own sons -- making the situation worse. The screaming and swearing is so loud that you can hear it from upstairs, and there have been many instances where customers in the shop upstairs can hear the screaming matches. How do I know they can hear it? Oh, well, it's clearly displayed on their faces as their eyes widen in shock. It's embarrassing to say the least. Every single one of these people have a screw loose, some more than others. Not just that, these people are so disrespectful to customers. It baffles me that these people made over a million dollars in profit last year and yet the rudeness they exhibit to customers who have knowledge of the industry is baffling. It's always to people that know some or even equal to them on product knowledge, so it's like they're threatened by this or something. Us non-familial employees all think this place is toxic and we all want out. 

The Manager is an asshole. He's supposed to be training me as my host employer and as a trainee myself. Does he do that? Nah. So I have to go around blindly trying to teach myself, which obviously means I'm going to make mistakes. And when I do make these mistakes, I get talked down to -- I guess even mansplained -- which can be easily avoided if I was fucking taught how to do shit! The Manager is snappy, talks to me disrespectfully, and clearly doesn't trust me because every phone call I answer he hovers over me like a helicopter parent. After 7 months, he does not trust me. Do I blame him for that? Yes, because I have if I was trained properly, YOU'D BE ABLE TO FUCKING TRUST ME! When The Manager is stressed, he takes it out on me through snappy remarks, eye rolling, cutting me off during explanations and just in general disrespect, therefore completely not incentivising me to want to ask for help. I hate asking him for help, but I never have a choice because I know nothing about this industry nor have I been taught properly. Rather, when I do ask for help, I get sarcastic replies, complete disrespect, and he makes me feel stupid for asking anything at all. Asking him for help gives me raging anxiety. 

The Orders Man is no better I'm not a graphic artist, but I have a bit of experience doing it for my own small photography business, but when I've made stuff for him with little to no idea on what he wants -- so I ask questions, get very vague answers, so I just freely assume what he'd like -- he never gives me constructive criticism. Rather, his replies are usually, ""what's this shit around here?"" or ""I don't like this shit"". Majority of the time, it's just, ""figure it out for yourself"". Well, okay, I'll do that. ""What the fuck is this? I didn't ask for this"". Well, cunt, maybe give me MORE OF A FUCKING IDEA OF WHAT YOU WANT NEXT TIME! He's asked me what I think, I tell him and I always finish with ""whatever you want, I'll make it"", which I get an eye roll for. Well, what do you want me to say?! When I do what I think, it's ""shit"". When I do what you think, it's still ""shit"". I've sat next to this motherfucker as he's thrown the phone receiver at his desk -- like, full-on hurled it -- while the customer was STILL ON THE LINE. He calls everyone who calls into the store wanting questions answered ""dumb cunts"" and things similar, and he swears every sentence, even to customers. I don't have a problem with swearing. I swear every sentence too (not at work, though, since it's supposed to be a ""professional environment"" apparently). What I do have a problem with is calling my work ""shit"" when if more directives were given, it wouldn't be ""shit"". Oh, also, this asshole has made fun of my math skills on more than one occasion. Okay, yeah, I'm sorry that my math isn't that great, but I'M NOT A FUCKING ACCOUNTANT! I'm a BUSINESS ADMIN TRAINEE. I do OFFICE WORK, not MATHS WORK.

Ironically, despite having the most screws loose, The Fitter is the nicest out of the three. He's never gotten angry at me, is never snappy or mean, he's always been very cordial and nice. He's had a tanty and then I've talked to him a bit later and he's always nice despite previous events. I don't respect him, though. I respect no one here.

The Mother is just a weird creature. She comes in at 6am every work day despite us opening at 8:15am and fucks around in the workshop for ages. And she doesn't use deodorant. My god, the smell, it's terrible. She comes into the office sometimes to count cash to take to the bank, and I have to hold my breath and breathe shallowly every time she sits across from me, it's that bad. In winter -- which it is now -- she's not that bad, but when it was summer in December and January? It was absolutely putrid and repulsive. I have a horse and even he and his shit doesn't smell has bad as this woman.

\~ \~ \~

My supervisor/overseer from the employment centre comes in once a month to visit and see how I'm going and to talk to The Manager about my ""progress"". She came in a few weeks ago and I told her everything. I told her about my feelings of this place and the treatment I've been getting. I told her that after she comes in on the Wednesday, The Manager is good for the rest of the week and then the weekend happens and he resets to be the shitty person he is. She interrupted me as I was explaining to ask if I want to leave. Yeah. Yeah, I do. I said that I wanted to leave. And at the end of my explanation, she downplayed it. She *fucking* downplayed it. She sided with him. She spoke to him first and sided with him, despite her always saying that she's on my side. She sympathised with him and even disagreed with me when I told her that I feel this work environment is toxic. She told me not to use the word toxic to describe this place, even though she's not here 5 days a week like I am. She asked me if I was normally sensitive, which I'm not in a workplace, and she told me that this behaviour is normal and that she's going to help me with being able to ""stand up for myself"", which I've been doing the whole fucking time because I'm constantly having to defend myself on shit I had no part in. And to top it all off, she told me that she can't transfer me anywhere as there's nowhere for me to go, which I find incredibly hard to believe because every week I'm still getting emails for traineeships from other providers at locations, so she's clearly giving me excuses. 

I asked to be transferred about 4 months in (about 3 months ago), but got persuaded to stay and give The Manager and his team a chance since I got dumped here at an erratic time. Essentially, I was asked to be patient. Well, it's been 7 months and nothing has fucking changed. It's gotten worse, even. I have no incentive to work for these people because of the disrespect. I have no drive to do my job because of the constant nasty criticism and snappy replies. I don't have any wish to work here when these people are stressed, because it's like walking on eggshells and I have to crack one because, whether I like it or not, I have to ask for help and then I get bashed with words. I hate it here and I want out. The qualification isn't even worth it anymore. I never go home happy. I never come to work happy. Mondays are days I dread. I'm depressed. I do the best I can, I do everything I'm asked, I'm a fucking doormat for these assholes and it's never enough. 

I want out. I'm really, really, really considering leaving, but I'm scared. I'm scared about what will lay before me if I quit. I've been doing this traineeship since December and this coming December will be the end and I'll have my qualification. I can take that piece of paper and leave. But that's 5 months away - I don't think I can handle this for that long anymore. I don't want to throw away the 7 months I've spent on this traineeship, but my supervisor is making it clear that there's nowhere for me to finish up the 5 months as much as I don't believe her. I'm extremely worried about not being able to find a job immediately after leaving here. I'm on absolute dirt pay at the moment. I'm on the traineeship wage which is significantly less than a normal full time office job - I'm only earning roughly $600 a week after tax which here in Australia for a full time office job is poor. I live with my boyfriend out of home and he earns a great wage to be able to afford rent in a high-end area and enough to spend on what he likes. He's amazing in that he knows I'm having money troubles due to my low income and has let me skate past rent I owe him in order to stay afloat - he's been looking after me financially. I have a horse that I don't want to sell and my parents are helping me pay for all his expenses, but I've been given an opportunity to move him to a fantastic barn but that'll mean I'll have to pay for him all myself (we have 3 horses, 2 of them are my sister's and my dad has made it clear that if I move my horse from where my sister's are I'll be on my own for all expenses). This is a great opportunity that won't come again as spots at this place are rare, so if I pass it up it could be months until another spot opens again. I still have to pay for my phone and my half of food and so many other expenses that I can just be able to afford with my shitty income now. I'm terrified that if I leave this traineeship, I'll be out of a job for months and won't be able to afford living away from home - that I won't be able to afford my horse who I've had for 8 years and am nowhere near ready to give up.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to throw away these past 7 months of work to gain this qualification by leaving and I don't want to be left in a hole with income and expenses, but I just can't take this place anymore nor can I handle my supervisor who is supposed to be protecting me sweeping everything under the rug.

This is my first time posting on Reddit. I just graduated in April with a mechanical engineering degree out in Phoenix AZ (I love it out there). I moved back home to Orange County CA (free rent living at home with my parents and my girlfriend lives 5 minutes away, woo hoo! #LongDistanceSuck). 
I love building things and got an internship working for a company that makes parachutes for drones (super cool and I loved it but wasn’t getting paid). I was working on a side project for them and was 3D printing and prototyping every day. I have my own 3D printer also and really enjoy it and actually working with prototypes. I started applying to engineering jobs on indeed to make some money and landed a position as a CNC laser programmer/CAD assistant for a manufacturing company (I’ve been there about 2 months now). They manufacture tubes that are cut and bent mostly for aftermarket off-road parts but we have all types of clients and customers. Basically what I do is convert the customer’s CAD models to what our laser cutters and benders can use and make sure the programs look good. Im on ‘training pay’ right now making $18/hr but will probably get ‘tested’ in the next week or so and will bump that up to $25/hr or so. Not super great pay but I’m getting a lot of experience so that’s cool and I will hopefully use that knowledge at my next job. The owner said he hired me to help with some engineering work down the line (he mentioned six sigma) but they needed more help with the CAD model stuff so that’s what I do right now. As of right now I was thinking of saving up money living with my parents for a few years and then moving to Arizona (I’ll probably be married by then too). 

I’m looking for advice on what to do because What I do right now is cool but don’t want to just look at CAD models all day and print out drawing of parts for the rest of my life. I like more the hands on building and rapid prototyping, but it looks like I’m stuck converting files for the time being. I took a few programming classes in college and use a little bit here and there for the G code and have enjoyed that as well and wouldn’t mind doing a little programming. I’m interested in working in manufacturing as an engineer but I’m open to pretty much any industry. I am CSWA certified in SolidWorks and have been using it on and off through high school and college so I am pretty comfortable with SolidWorks. 
Any advice from you guys would be appreciated like how long to stay there or look for other job, how does the job market look in the Phoenix area/AZ, honesty anything that I can do that can help me or that I can learn that would help my Carreras. 

If there is anyone in the OC or Phoenix areas who would want to be a mentor that I could reach out to with questions or even meet up, that would be very cool. 
Thank you guys in advance for all the help."
ot3xsz,2,2021-07-28,Need Some Advice or Guidance,Miserable-Teaching20,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/ot3xsz/need_some_advice_or_guidance/,"I feel so lost and sad recently b/c I always had a plan in my head but that plan somehow failed, and I don't know if what I am doing currently is a waste of time or not. Any advice or insight here might help.

Just a quick background

* Bachelor in Mathematics and minor in Economics from BostonU
* Master in real estate finance from NYU
* MBA in progress from a local university here in OC California. 
* CFA L2 Exam this November  

I had some really solid internships that align my career goal during the college days such as risk management analyst. Then things went different when I started pursuing real estate degree for family reasons. Still very helpful since I learnt how to construct pro-forma and acquisition models. However, I made a very stupid decision when I picked my internship during that time. I got an offer from Hugo Boss, which I could work directly under the Head of their real estate department and manage hundreds of stores in North America. Instead, I picked a well-known brokerage firm because I was naïve to think that while I was young, I had the time and the luxury to step out of my comfort zone and acquire different skills that weren't taught in school and I was really unfamiliar with. I considered myself shy and inward since English is not my native. And that was the same reason I chose to accept the offer from BOFA Merrill as a Financial Advisor working in financial centers here in OC, because I wanted to sharpen my interpersonal and client-facing skill. My intention was to do it for a year and then go back to my main goal - being an analyst in an investment or a real estate firm. Then Covid hit so I decided to stay a bit longer since I felt like I was destined to be there during the pandemic to help more families. During that time, I managed to cover 7 different financial centers and did really well at building relationship with the clients. None of my surveys were below 9/10 and clients even wrote me poems to praise my service. However, I was never a sales guy and that was the only thing the company cares about. Later on, I found out the existence of Chief Investment Office department within BOFA and that is exactly where I want to work at. I realized that CFA might be the key to get there so I studied after work and during the weekend and passed L1 this February. Becoming a husband this May and turning 27 in a month, I realized that I've learnt enough interpersonal skills and it is time for me to move on and get back to what I truly enjoy, a platform where I can utilize my quantitative analysis skill and my CFA learnings. So I resigned in the beginning of this month and thought everything was on track when I landed the interview with the CIO for the Investment Analyst position in Manhattan. But unfortunately, I got rejected. 

I was still very optimistic bc I thought with my math and real estate background, my CFA L1, my series 7 and 66, and my interpersonal skill, it would be easy to land a role as an analyst. However, due to my all over the place experience, my previous experience as a FA and no coding experience, the only companies that are interested in me and have reached out to me are sales roles within insurance and financial advising companies. I have tried reaching out to recruiters on Linkedln but they never replied. I am at a point where even internship opportunity within PE investment firms is considered as a blessing. I don't mind starting low, but what makes me worried is the fact that I might have wasted my most valuable years b/c of my naïve career approach and that can really hurt my career path. Thinking from the company perspective, why would they hire a 27 years old as their investment analyst if he spent 2 years as a Financial Advisor and 3 years in real estate? The only thing that keeps me going right now is passing the CFA L2. I am not even sure if it can open any doors to the position that I desire but It is the only thing that I can be in control as of now. 

I don't know who to talk to and seeing my wife working really hard for this family, I feel like I've let her down. Sorry for all the ramblings and nonsense and thank you for reading this far. I would love to hear some advice from someone who came from a similar situation, which is very unlikely, or someone who currently works in PE or IB. Any advice on the things to improve on in order to make myself more appealing for an analyst position is appreciated here. Wish everyone the best and don't make the same mistake as I did."

I’m located in Northern NJ but have been applying to positions in other states around me like PA,NY, etc and even applied to different states such as Cali &amp; Texas. 

I wasn’t able to do internships during college because I had expenses &amp; needed benefits for myself so I worked retail but I did manage to gain a lot of customer support experience over the years.

Right now, I am doing my obligatory military service. After some tests, The army decided that I was good enough to enter in their cyber security formation. Accepting This formation would make me waste 6 more months in the army which I kinda hate plus 1 year of work as a cyber specialist in the civil If I want the certificate.

I am torturing myself with questions related to whether I should do this formation. Should I just go with just my math degree (I have also done an internship btw) with which I can already apply to a lot of kind of jobs or is it better that I spend some months or a year to try to get into a cyber security job?

ot9fmv,272,2021-07-28,Learning from my mistakes - here are the changes I made in my application,mnist07,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/ot9fmv/learning_from_my_mistakes_here_are_the_changes_i/,"After I wrote about how I got accepted into prestigious graduate programs after getting rejected from all in a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/oc9gt7/advice_from_someone_who_got_rejected_from_all/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), I got a ton of questions asking **what were the differences in my applications in the two cycles** which I will explain in detail in this article. If you are applying for the first time, you might want to eliminate these mistakes I made. If you have previously applied and got rejected, you would definitely want to make these changes in your application. Some of the changes were quantifiable - for example, more research papers while other changes were more subjective.

The article is long and hence, I have divided it into relevant sections.

**1.** **Zeroing down on a particular subject (deciding a theme for your application)** \-

* I believe applications centred around a particular theme are much more impactful. My research interests always revolved around **Computer Vision** (sub-field in Machine Learning) and its applications in different areas (chemical informatics, computational biology and medical imaging). However, computer vision is a very fast subject in itself. So during the first admissions cycle, I mentioned all those professors who had even the slightest of interest in this area. In my opinion, **this made me look like a candidate who had made some effort but didn't properly research his potential supervisors**. By the next cycle, I had **strategically** completed couple more projects in **Computer Vision + Healthcare** and decided to make this the theme of my application. This made it extremely easy for me to shortlist professors. I was able to reference their papers, articles, and even their talks in my SoP which helped me look like a very serious candidate.

**2.** **Shortlisting Graduate Programs Cleverly -**

* A lot of us, especially Indian students, are used to having **hard distinctions** in our subjects and the jobs they lead to. For example, Mechanical students might not be allowed to sit for CS jobs. However, I have observed that programs abroad are very flexible and allow you to largely design your own curriculum. **Hence, one should definitely look beyond programs that are simply an extension of your UG degree**.
* Having a particular theme for your application helps not only in shortlisting professors but also in **graduate programs**. In the first cycle, I applied to very general programs like Computer Science while during the second cycle, I applied to programs like [Quantitative Biomedical Sciences](https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/qbs/health-data-science/), [Biomedical Artificial Intelligence](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/biomedical-ai), [Biomedical Engineering](https://www.cmu.edu/bme/Academics/graduate-programs/index.html) \- basically all those programs that would allow me to work at the intersection of AI and Healthcare. Due to my background, I appeared as a strong prospect for these programs.

**3.** **Statement of Purpose** \-

* We all know the importance of an SoP in graduate applications. The first year, I wanted to talk about all of my projects, papers and achievements. This might have looked great but it also **added a lot of noise** and **clouded my main reason for applying to a program**. The next year, I removed several projects and even achievements to make space for answering questions that mattered. Some observations in this matter -
   * **Your extra-curriculars don't matter (much)** \- When talking about graduate-level programs, universities want good researchers, students who are academically good. Talking about how you organized your college fest will have no impact on them. However, some activities like tutoring and mentoring students do help your case.
   * **Mention selected internships and projects** \- Doing this will allow you to explain more relevant elements of your background in detail rather than merely mentioning all of them superficially.
* **Taking help from seniors and professors** \- I believe your seniors and professors are very few of those people who will give unbiased advice. When you write about yourself all on your own, everything sounds perfect. This is a major mistake I made in the first cycle. The next year, professors helped me in selecting what was relevant rather than what was shiny. **Leverage the experience that they have**!
* **Answer questions that matter** \- I have talked about this [previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/StatementOfPurpose/comments/oixwox/do_we_really_need_a_hook_for_the_sop/) too. We tend to focus too much on the creative aspects of our SoP - thanks to the superficial advice flooding the internet. Instead, your SoP should be more about justifying each aspect of your background – answering the why’s and how’s. **Some questions to answer in your SoP are** \- 
   * How have your previous experiences (internships, projects, publications, hackathons, etc) shaped your understanding of your subject?
   * How are you a relevant candidate for this program?
   * Are there any particular courses you are interested in?
   * What are your ambitions after graduating? What do you expect from this program?

**4. Letters of Recommendation** \- Thanks to my RAship in my subject of interest (Healthcare AI), I was able to obtain LoRs from people who were active in the subject. I always believe that the content of your LoR matters much more than the person writing the LoR. Many times, we settle for an average recommendation from a hot-shot professor. Last year, I made the same mistake. This year, my recommenders were young (Assistant Professors) but related to my field and knew me inside out. If you have an option, choose someone who knows you very well.

**5. Redesigning my CV and Resume** \- Your resume is another very important aspect of your application. Following a naive approach, last year I tried to mention every achievement of mine in my resume. This made it very cluttered. In the next attempt, I took time to properly design my resume to make certain sections pop out by categorizing them. I also used ""[action words](https://www.google.com/search?q=action+words+resume&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN855IN855&amp;oq=action+words+resume&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l2j0i22i30l7.5217j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)"" to add that final touch. You can find my own resume for reference [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18VBRtSYu8qxFqEkXCXIwkYNyJMPA3dH-/view?usp=sharing).

**6.** **Doing smart research** **and using social media**\- I invested a lot of time (several months) into shortlisting my graduate programs, professors associated with those programs, their research groups and evaluating my chances of getting admitted. For every university, I contacted 3-4 professors on average, asking them if they were looking for new grad students. I also tried to note down every small detail that I could reference in my SoP. For instance, a week before I applied, Duke University tweeted that they were setting up the Duke Center for Artificial Intelligence in Radiology which I included in my SoP. **Being able to stay on top of all these details and transferring them effectively into your statement of purpose proves that you have gone the extra mile.** Another important tool for effective research is leveraging social media platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn. I used these to engage in conversations with professors, making contacts and making them aware of my candidature. I have written a detailed article on how to leverage these platforms which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/ogavu6/az_on_building_your_network_on_twitter_following/). 

**7. Organizing my Applications** \- The previous point should have made it clear that there are hundreds of pieces of information that you might want to note down for a single university. As useful as that might be, it is extremely challenging to do so effectively. I spent a lot of time designing something for myself that allowed me to do so and a Notion template felt like the perfect choice. I have released that as a paid product (5$+) on Gumroad. Sometimes, investing a small amount (like 5$) can help you in saving hundreds more in your applications.

Getting into a good graduate program is getting harder each year due to the ever-increasing competition and staying ahead of the curve demands committing to the process and investing time. I hope, this article gives you some insight about avoiding certain mistakes that nobody really talks about.

I'm planning my schedule for the next year in hopes of landing an internship in Summer '22. I'm wondering if there are any courses that are really helpful for succeeding in an internship? For example, I was planning to take CS361 / CS344 in spring term right before the internship. However, this would make it so I couldn't take Cloud Development (an elective I want) due to having to take CS372 in Fall '22, and hoping to graduate in Winter '23. Would CS344 be beneficial for an internship, or could I take CS372 before the internship and CS344 after? 

Thanks!"

As painful as it is, applications for competitive CS internships are already open and the Summer 2022 rat race has begun! Feel behind or unprepared? That's why we're here! I founded this Discord server last semester with the intention of gathering enough interest to transform it into an official CoC club. Our members have interned at the best of the best: from FAANGs to top Quant firms. Recently, I obtained support from several GT faculty members and will be moving through the process of registering the club with the CoC over the next month. In the meantime, we will continue to host events such as **resume workshops, mock interviews, 1-on-1 ""advising"" meetings from students who have been there before, and other such events.**                   

The server itself is modeled after [cscareers.dev](https://www.cscareers.dev/), but with a GT-focus and the intention of morphing into an official in-person club. I highly recommend joining cscareers as well if you haven't already - the owner is a friend and mentor of mine at Uber this summer; really great guy!            

**Anyways, if you are searching for a competitive, supportive, motivated group of GT students to aid you with your CS career at GT and beyond, look no further!** We are also always open to successful students who are interested in joining to pass on their advise and experiences to newcomers.

oth44t,3,2021-07-28,35m. Lots of different studies. Lots of different jobs. Can't find work. Lost.,Titahn,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/oth44t/35m_lots_of_different_studies_lots_of_different/,"Hi,  


I'm a bit lost right now. Since never knew what I wanted to do, I changed of path a lot. And here I am, right now, struggling to find a job for the past 10 months. But before going any further, here is who I am, professionnally :   


I'm French (sorry for my english mistakes !). I studied for 10 years (mathematics, accounting, computer science, actuarial studies, finance and in the end I got a master degree in Environmental Economics even though I'm Really bad in theoratical economy). The pattern, except once or twice (for instance I completely blinded myself right before my exams once) was pretty much always the same : ""Oh, actually I don't like what I'm studying, I found something that seems to correspond more to what I liked, so let's change !""  


Then, I did an internship in statistics, which led me to work there for 3 years. Frustrating because I didn't really have any statistical knowledge, so I was rather mediocre at my job.  
Then, I changed and did a training in software testing and automation. Could have been nice, but in the job I found, they needed someone for something else immediately. I was supposed to do it for 2 weeks, I did it for 2 years.  
Then, because it was very hard to find a job in testing/automation since I had zero experience with it, I became a mathematic teacher as a replacement. Nice job, but if I wanted to become one full time, I wouldn't be able to move from Paris for the next 5-15 years, and I hate Paris (my SO too, so we are trying to leave asap).  
Then, I did an 8 months training in data science / artificial intelligence, and a year of internship, which ended 10 months ago.  


And here I am right now. The covid didn't help, of course, and Data Science was THE place to be... 5 years ago. Now the market is saturated with young profiles like mine.   
I applied for 40-50 jobs (everywhere in france but Paris), got 3 interviews, and no job. Always the same reason : ""Your profile is very... Interesting, but we chose to go with someone with more experience, sorry !"". And I can understand them, especially with the Covid, people will work at all most, if not all the time, and it's way harder to train a novice in that situation, so they prefer someone that will be immediately ready to work.  


And the more time goes, the more it's hard to sell myself, since in that area, we are supposed to be passionated, and work, just for fun, in our free time. I like Data Science. But I like my free time too, and I lack the self constraint to force myself to work for free 4 hours a day just so I can show what I did in the last 10 months in job interviews (and I feel very guilty about it, but that's more of another psychological problem :p).  


So, in the end, I'm 35, I just want to live in a nice, calm home with a garden with my SO. I have lots of hobbies, I like to bike (one a bicycle, not a motorbike), to cook, to play golf, to sharpen knives with japanese stones, to read, to play. I'd love to have a forge and try blacksmithing. I love to help people too, and would love a job where I could make the world better in my teeny tiny way. I'd love to try to live in another country (Canada, Northern Europe, New Zealand, Switzerland...).

Also, since my SO and I want to leave Paris (we stayed here 5 years, since it was easier to find a job, but there is WAY too many people here, who would have though !), the plan is : the first one to find a job in an okay/good place will make use move there, and the other one will try to find a job there. A bit less pressure on here since she has way more experience in one job, and tried to be self employed a few weeks ago, and it seems to work rather well. So it's not ideal to go for a short contract when looking for a job.

And with that in mind, and the fact that my unemployement benefit will end in 3 months, I've no clue what I should do. Try to find a job in Data Science, even though it will be harder and harder. Change, again, to find something that will allow me to have a job. Create my own little company and open a tea house, where you can buy homemade fresh pastries and have some tea. Maybe self employed in data science and try to find short missions.   


As you can see, I'm a bit lost, I needed to talk about it, thanks for reading it, and any comment/suggestion is very welcome !  


TLDR : I tried many jobs. Lastly in data science. Can't find any work, my unemployement benefits will end soon. I don't know what to do, go on, or change, again."

I’ve been at my current job for a little over 2 years now. I’m beyond unhappy with my pay and benefits, as well as some of the manager/general environment. The actual job role itself I do not mind. 

I started looking for jobs in March. Started off light at first and have increased significantly since. I apply to at least 25 jobs a week, honestly if not more. (This includes some LinkedIn/indeed easy apply, but I usually try to go to the site and apply directly). 

I have 2 years experience in advertising (my role is web-based one, content management). I have a bachelors in marketing from a good business school. I have been applying to jobs of all levels of experience, some where I’m overqualified, some under, some right on track, some jobs in my same line of marketing, other areas, sales, e-commerce and also banking as I had a finance minor and banking internship. Not being picky in the slightest.

I get interviews, move onto the second/third rounds often before getting rejected. I’ve had my resume reviewed, I’ve had so many interviews by now I’m not even remotely nervous, I have solid answers for the general interview questions, I ask a number of questions myself and really engage myself in the interview. I don’t think it’s my resume since I’m getting a fair amount of interviews, and I also don’t think it’s my interview skills since I’m often making it to second and third rounds. 

I’m getting incredibly frustrated now, as I spend all this time applying, prepping, interviewing and waiting just to get ghosted by these companies. I can’t tolerate my job much longer, I’m not even making it paycheck to paycheck. 

What can I do to make myself standout? I need to do something but I’m not even sure what I can do. I enrolled in some coursera courses so once I finish I can add them to my resume. I’ve reached out to some fellow students when I was in school to see for referrals as well. I’m just stuck and frustrated I need help."

My ideal career is data science specifically the analytics side of data modeling and interpretation of data.

Needless to say the job market for recent graduates is crap right now -31%-45% unemployment of the 2020 grads let alone the 2021 grads-. And I don't qualify for unemployment benefits because I'm a recent graduate.

I've applied to many jobs over the past 2 months and gotten nothing back.

Until I got a call back from a job I applied to out of frustration which would be data entry/data processing 14$/hr full time and expected to last for 6 months.

I know I'm qualified for a better position, and I'm blessed enough to have a mom who will feed and house me until I do find work but I'm tired of feeling like a leech and I'm wondering if this is a good stop gap until the labor market sorts itself out or if its an underemployment trap that I should just avoid and tough out the labor market for longer to find a more career oriented job. Or if there are any other options I'm missing?"
otjh62,2,2021-07-28,Fun Summer Job vs. Internship,TheFoolsWhoDream,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/otjh62/fun_summer_job_vs_internship/,"It's not for a year or so, but thinking ahead into the future I'm debating if I should keep my current summer job that I love and have so much fun at or look for an internship related to my major(s). The summer job pays decently well and being that I will be a junior this coming school year, next summer will probably be my last summer when I'm still somewhat of a ""kid"" / when it's socially acceptable to not have a ""grown up"" job. I don't feel like I'll be ready to leave the job at the end of this summer and I want to do it again next year, but I also know that internships are very important. 

To speak more on the internship side, again, they're obviously very important and helpful, but 1) I'm not entirely sure which of my two majors I want to start my career in and 2) I'm not in that much of a rush to start my working career. I think if COVID has taught us anything it's that we should spend more time doing what we love with people we enjoy spending time with, and while I could enjoy a possible internship, I doubt it would be as fun as my summer job. 

Ideally with how things are now (and will possibly still be next year), I would be able to find some sort of part-time internship or online one and keep the job.

If anyone has ever been in a similar situation please let me know - any advice is appreciated!"

For 1 year I was only an intern.

I'm working as a designer which I have a graduation on. The boss and my colleges are quite nice.

The problem is, I'm not learning anything new. Beside that, I'm only earning slightly above minimum wage.(It's quite normal in my country that people with graduation only earn minimum wage). The boss is very against telework which I feel would make me happier (for personal reasons to do with the location of the job).

I'd like to improve my condition at my job, either with telework or moneywise, however, I feel that I might be ungrateful  because what I have is not at all that bad considering the conditions that other people my age face (no job). I'm also worried about asking the boss that because earlier this year he said that he'd be able to put someone else at my job.

So, I had finally gotten myself an internship in one of my dream companies. Had a fabulous time interning there at least till today. Did my project religiously, stayed late and worked early when I had to discuss stuff from international teams in different timezones, participated in 24 hour on call for a week (asked by my manager if I was up for a new challenge) once.

My manager was constantly of the opinion that I was doing great and I should keep it up. The engineers with whom I worked also had great feedbacks and everything. My mentor was very happy with my work and skills. Basically, everything was fabulous.

And today in my final feedback from my manager, I got that no intern conversion. And I needed some more practice and basically experience with companies of such scale. I had a talk with all the engineers before this and everyone was still approving me for joining the team. I tried asking where exactly it went wrong and I did not get a very clear response to that and he said that there were no red flags just that I needed more experience in companies of similar calibre. My feedbacks from all the engineers were positive but just a little bit more experience was needed.

Well, I am not sure what to think. Maybe I did not understand what he meant by it, but at least for me I'd have gotten ""a little more experience"" after joining the team in like 3 or 4 months.

Thanks for hearing me rant, wanted to just share this with somebody. If anyone has any advice regarding this, would love to hear it!

Now, I am just left with nothing in my hand, so will start prepping leetcode again. I had solved like 100 mediums, 90 Easys and 10 hards, but I don't have very good memory regarding that. Any ideas of how I should refresh that stuff up and start new problems too?

Thanks!"

Getting it made me realize that I want a woman who put in the same work I did to get that degree or is willing to (if we meet and start dating while she’s working towards it that’s fine too; it tells me that she’s a hard worker). How much they make doesn’t matter as long as they’re not mooching off of my income, which is already not that high (I am doing a paid internship at a company but I still live with my mother because I can’t support myself financially).

I’ve also come to terms with my religious beliefs and I have them set to Agnostic. Religion can be a dealbreaker for some people, but I want to be with someone who shares the same beliefs I do.

Setting high standards for myself when it comes to dating does feel pretty good. It tells me that I have accepted that I won’t just go for the first person that talks to me because of desperation or loss of hope, which I unfortunately have done before. I can wait for someone and be okay with myself until they come along.

Even though a lot of people are probably dating now that things are open again, I’m not ready to do so. I’m still getting over my last crush (I did have a short relapse today where I looked at some photos of her even though I have her blocked) and I will be competing in a world championship this fall.

otnzb7,0,2021-07-28,Should we move to California?,vvelv,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/otnzb7/should_we_move_to_california/,"We are a couple, 24 and 25. We're suppose to move to California after university and that has always been the plan since we were in school, our jobs (software engineering) were suppose to move us to California after pandemic, the reason we are not there yet was just because we were waiting for each other to finish school, to get paperwork done etc.  I would say 80% of our university friends have moved south or plan to move south, either California or Washington.

The thing is, we love our life, and didn't like the idea of the traffic and homelessness issue in California.  Our family is here, and I value that very much. We both think we will love to stay more than moving. We did have some experience living in California when we did our internships.

Financially, we are very comfortable here too. My spouse joined his company pre-ipo and after ipo the company blew up, so we probably will make obscene amount of money (first vesting in September). This won't last though as after 3 more years of vesting we will make significantly less in refresher.

However, doing the math, we could make so much more in California, we could grind there for a couple of year, save like crazy to gain financial independence, then move back when its time to raise our family, we both want to have kids in a 3-5 years. But I also worry that we will not move back because of the golden handcuff.

Here's the math we did:

Current expected income in Canada 2021: 542K CAD -&gt; 328K CAD after taxes

If we move to California annual income becomes 564K USD -&gt; 365K USD. Stock remains unchanged but will be converted CAD-&gt;USD so lower number, base pay goes from 215K CAD to 270K USD. The USD also includes 20K cash for relocation (so it would be 20k lower next year).

Assuming rent will be a lot higher in California and expenses will be similar but in USD, we are looking at 70K CAD expenses in Canada combined and 90K in the US. Which mean in total our saving rate will be 258K CAD in Canada or 275K USD = 344K CAD.

Another aspect to think about is, many big tech companies are going remote, which is driving the wage up a lot, maybe in a couple years the difference will not be as significant. When I graduated 2 years ago, Amazon was paying base pay of 100k in Van/To for new grad. Now I am seeing my fresh grad friends bagging offers that are 120-130K in base pay with bigger signing bonus than before.

As for net worth, it is currently still low for current income level. But we focused on paying debt when we graduated 2 years ago and are only getting this large RSU this year.

So, PFC, make my decision, should we go to the US to accelerate our saving rate? What would you do?"

I've been suffering from mental health illnesses for years (was diagnosed 6 years ago). I hate it. I genuinely hate it. I have to take meds to boost serotonin levels (store-bought serotonin as I call them). 

On my birthday in June, I told myself I'll end things an year from then (provided things don't get better). I am 24 and am yet to do achieve anything significant (unlike my parents, siblings, close friends and connections on LinkedIn). Turning 24 recently is really hitting me hard. 

I graduated university at 21 and have done internships (a local bank, a Big 4 firm consulting firm and startups) every now and then. My last paid internship ended before the summer of 2020. I am yet to secure a full-time paid job since, unlike my peers who are pretty successful in the corporate world (i.e. they are getting promoted or moving to international offices say London, UK). But, then, there is me. I've wasted the last 3 years of my life. I could have learnt a new language. I could have learnt new software (say PowerBI). I could have been studying towards a professional qualification (say CFA, CAPM etc.). I could have lost weight and gained muscle. My ex left me at 21 because of me being suicidal and unstable back then. 

But, my untreated mental illnesses don't let me too. I messed up the final two years at university (relative to my first year performance which was stellar). At all of my internships, I was extremely slow with tasks i.e. making PPT slides, replying to emails (I believe I have undiagnosed psychomotor retardation). In my daily life, I avoid doing a lot of chores, for instance, doing the dishes, folding my laundry, cooking, reading a book. It takes me 30ish minutes to do the dishes (something that would take my sibling 15 minutes). It takes me 7 minutes to read a page of a novel. Taking that into account, it would take me 2 months to finish a 300 page novel. Because of how slow I am, I've gotten very dumb too (I struggle with basic mental maths and avoid doing things that require a lot of brain power). 

I am not even sure if therapy would help me. I am scared of entering the corporate world or pursuing a masters. Because of how slow and dumb I am and how stressed I get in pressured situations. I point fingers towards my untreated mental illnesses. At times, I wish I had cancer or something similar to show people around me that I was actually struggling. 

Even though, I told myself I will commit suicide a day after my birthday next year in June. If things don't get better (i.e. I don't land a full-time job and not be as slow as I am today). However, I feel like ending things this Saturday. My method of suicide would be jumping off a bridge (near a major public hospital) and getting hit by an incoming vehicle once I jump. Or, I will overdose on my meds. But, very likely, that will be next June. 

Whenever I hear of people dying on the news or from other sources, I say ""Lucky them. I wish it was me instead of them."" I always pray I die in my sleep. But, here, I fucking am. I know things will not get better (there's too many things to work on and fix). I am better off dying, either naturally or via suicide. I am currently working on launching a non-profit startup, centered around mental health. In that case, it will further motivate everyone involved in case I end up killing myself. 

Turning 24 has really hit me. It feels like I've run out of time to achieve things......It's too hard to turn things around. 

If you've made it this far, I appreciate you reading of my struggles and my suicidal thoughts."

Now I'm set to start an MSCS program in the fall in a track that's geared toward those with little programming experience. This program will take 2.5-3 years to finish. First semester, I'm basically taking an introductory class and an algorithms class. And second semester, I'd probably take OS and databases. 

Tbh my resume definitely needs some experience and projects added to it, but I'm not as worried about prepping for interviews. I hope to intern at a FAANG at some point during my degree, but I'm not sure if it's worth it to apply for summer 2022 given my current circumstance. Would applying for summer 2022 hurt my chances of applying for a co-op or summer internship later? Would it be worth it to hold out on applying and getting referrals till the next application cycle?"

otqrqu,1,2021-07-29,I need some advice about some job postings that my IT/data analyst program is recommending me to pursue,Section-Tight,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/otqrqu/i_need_some_advice_about_some_job_postings_that/,"So I'm in a vocational training program for youth looking to get into technology. Technically, the program I'm in for is Junior Data Analyst, but the organization also has a Junior IT Analyst program, and they help you to apply for all sorts of help desk, junior analyst, customer service entry level stuff, intern positions. I want to either get into a junior data analyst role entry level, or if that fails because there's not many opportunities in my city, I want to go the traditional IT helpdesk route.

They forwarded me a few jobs that I should apply for. Here are two. My impression is that the first role is kind of decent entry level help desk stuff. Am I right or wrong?

The second one is Shopify Support Advisor (formerly Customer Guru), and it doesn't seem like a tech job at all, and purely customer service. Am I wrong here? Am I overthinking this?

I am not too familiar with the rules, but I know job postings are not allowed, so I'll just paste the title and responsibilities. I would like some advice if either of these jobs are worth pursuing from an IT perspective:

1) ""Remote Client Services Analyst""

&gt;The successful candidate will be responsible for providing remote application support to our clients via email and phone support. The CSA will also appropriately route general questions or concerns about sales opportunities, software licensing and user management. The position offers highly motivated self-starters an opportunity to join a successful, dynamic company. This is a remote position and requires the candidate to work from home.
Essential Functions:Actively participate in achieving departmental service levels and corporate goals by way of being a positively contributing Client Services Team member and demonstrating our CORE values (Care, Ownership, Respect and Excellence). This may include direction or assignment of work under the Client Services Department scope of work tasks. This could be from various channels including but not limited to calls, faxes, emails, voice mails, chat, social media or cases of any and all skill set as required to achieve both Service Level targets and Client Satisfaction.Review outstanding cases to ensure that Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements are met.Take ownership of calls and case volumes in Client Services queues to monitor for trends and suggest solutions.Clarify customer's concerns or issues and take appropriate action to respond to cases in Salesforce CRM prior to escalation to the Central Desk Coordinators, Team Leads or another department as necessary.Provide shadowing / training both internally to new staff and externally to customers.Actively participate in the scheduled rotation of the After-Hours Client Services phone to ensure that Service Level Agreements are being met.Provide support services for acquisition products and communicate with external contractors as and when required.Demonstrate Case Close rate &gt; or = average of within acceptable variance of CSA’s with similar skill sets.Achieve 85% or greater quality scores on spot checks (Matrix TBD).Reliable attendance: Defined as- schedule adherence to start and end times, lunch and breaks with professional communication regarding matters of attendance.Be accountable for any assignment of work given by the Client Services Central Desk Coordinators or Client Services Leadership team.

2) Shopify Support Advisor (formerly known as Customer Guru)

&gt;The work of a Support Advisor, frequently called a Customer Service Representative within the industry. Our merchants have amazing stories filled with highs and lows, frustrations, and triumphs. It is in these moments and many in between that you would make an impact.

&gt;Qualifications
• Adhering to a daily schedule that includes a mix of: Phones, three (3) simultaneous chats, and emails.
• Ensuring merchants have a quick response time by staying on top of your assigned tickets, with same-day ticket review.
• Acting as a business coach and thinking about the merchant’s business holistically when offering solutions.
• Completing essential follow-up documentation after each interaction.
• Engaging in human conversations with merchants to identify and resolve issues, and provide coaching/growth opportunities for their businesses.
• Offer needs-based solutions, not pushy sales.
• Advocating for merchants and the Shopify platform by communicating with stakeholders.
• Owning your own development through reflection, reviewing past interactions and preparing to discuss growth opportunities with your Team Lead in regular 1:1 meetings.

&gt;As a Support Advisor, you’ll work within a dynamic, diverse and, supportive environment. You won’t always know the answers to the questions you’re being asked, so your ability to be resourceful is key! We believe in human-centered, high-quality customer experiences. Using chats, phone calls and, emails, you’ll be there to listen, teach, problem-solve and, explore growth opportunities with Shopify merchants. 

Option 1 seems IT related, whereas option 2 just seems to be a purely Customer Service role. Am I right here? Or wrong?"

I wanted to know if you’ve ever experienced what the title ask. I’ll give a backstory.

A few years back I started working for a startup where I thought the leader was trustworthy. As a current student who graduated from a previous institution and has had unsuccessful graphic design job hunts, this seemed like a great opportunity to learn on the job. A few months down the line, the work ended up being horrible and the environment became so toxic where I was verbally abused and gaslighted by the leader for not “working up to his expectations” (there was miscommunication between him and the project manager which resulted him in insulting me and my work while calling me and some other colleagues useless). 

By this point, school was about to start again so I handed my resignation letter and left. Mind you, I had stayed for about 1.5 years. Fast forward to this year, I applied to the internship course in my program in hopes of gaining some work experience. Luckily, I was able to land one. On my first day, I was anxious and very nervous (to be expected) but throughout the day my anxiety had led to negative thoughts about myself and the internship (I had that thought on imposter syndrome while berating that I won’t work up to their standards). I ended up having a panic attack I got home.

I discussed the events with a close friend of mine who also worked in that startup with me and she had asked whether these thoughts were stemming from the previous experience with the startup. After putting the two together, I realized I had some sort of trauma from the startup and leader that affected my mentality at this internship. This ended up leading me to have a call with my director to discuss my issues and how it could affect my work. Thankfully, she was really understanding and gave me valuable feedback that allowed me to feel somewhat relieved from my worries. 

So I’d like to know whether you guys went through a bad experience at work and had it led to some trauma at your new workplace. If so, what did you guys do to help alleviate it?"

For example, they were already looking to hire, and the current lead developer is leaving soon to go to another location within the company. They need people badly, and they see investing in me as a good option. 

The downside is I’ve got to finish my degree. I just have to to ensure I get a good salary when I decide to leave this place. Unfortunately, my school offers no online option for a swe degree.

otwzf4,1,2021-07-29,Need some advice - first job after college.,jax_925,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/otwzf4/need_some_advice_first_job_after_college/,"Hi everyone,

 I need some advice, as I don't know what to do. I'm new to office jobs (worked retail mostly before this). This is kind of a long post, but if you want a TLDR, the job I was promised is no longer needed or is covered by other employees, and the company culture has changed a lot since I started. The company is no longer a good fit for me, but I don't want to commit career or financial suicide since I'm just getting started.

4 months before graduation, I received a job offer from a company where I had my dream internship. I was able to pretty much create my own experience, and was the sole person working on social media, marketing, content development, website maintenance, and branding. I was told I'd be continuing my duties from my internship, hiring an intern underneath me, and adding several more duties (including troubleshooting computer issues and helping with the digital side of employee training). It was a very generous offer, and I made arrangements to officially move to the town where I went to school.

But now the job I was hired to do is mainly covered by other people, who were hired in the months before I graduated. This is a small company, so it's not like there's big teams working with everyone. Additionally, I began to get conflicting messages by members of upper management as to what my job is and what tasks and goals are important to the company. 

The company culture has changed as well, and I find myself working in a place where management and my bosses are hard to get ahold of, and (I know this shouldn't affect my perception of the job as this is everywhere) work drama and gossip is getting out of hand. It's getting hard to work with every day, especially since I have been moved to a place where my workstation is essentially a public conference table and where I no longer no what is going on with the company. I get up every day dreading going into work, and while I enjoyed my old internship, things have changed so much since then, I no longer feel this company is a good fit for me.

I'm in a place now where I'm ready to look for a job where I have more clear guidance and hierarchy (as I know I'm a new grad and probably need it to grow as an employee and professional), but I don't know what to do. I am making quite a bit working here, for a new grad, and have already moved into to an apartment, switched all my bills over, and settled in. In my area, with most entry level jobs, I would be making almost $5/hr. less, and I'm afraid I won't be able to afford my bills. I don't have a good relationship with family, so I wouldn't be able to ask them for help.

What do I do? And if I'm wrong here, how can I change? I've been asked to write my own job description, but I no longer know the needs of the company as I've been kept out of the loop. Please help."
otx8rk,4,2021-07-29,Career/Academic Advice,ML_Science,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/otx8rk/careeracademic_advice/,"Hello, I'm a first time poster. I'm going to explain my history in science, but the end question is pretty simple. 

Now what?

I took quite a while to finish my undergrad in chemistry. The first 4 years I mostly did half-credit semesters (6 credits) because I was never a great student. During year 5 I began my undergrad research under a computational chemistry PhD candidate and fell in love with research. I realized how much I loved researching something new, and trying to find answers to unknown questions. Once the undergrad research began I decided I wanted to pursue an advanced degree, which was the first time that thought had crossed my mind. Before the research I was a C student at best, the day it started I had straight A's in 18 credit hour semesters till I completed my degree.

The coding was a big part of what I loved as well. I have a knack for breaking problems down to bare bones logical structures and this has really helped me succeed in various programming environments.

Just before finishing my degree (grand total of 7 years for an undergrad in chemistry) I was hired as a lab tech in a molecular biology lab (processing covid tests on PCR). Using my coding background I was able to help a team of 2 developers create a PCR analysis app. I helped design the AI that interpreted the results. Once I officially graduated I was promoted to the RnD department as a scientist. 

Most of my work is developing better pipelines or workflows for different labs. I have developed AI for our infectious disease lab, and workflows for every step of their multiple protocols. I've programmed liquid handlers (robots) to automate the majority of the lab process for the toxicology department. I've developed automated reporting apps for the toxicology department as well. I've developed and validated 3 or 4 different assays which are now in production as different methods to analyze covid variants. 

During all of this time I've had exactly 0 experience with biology. The only biology course I took in undergrad was biochem, and the professor tried his best to only tech chemistry of it.

Recently the company took a leap and picked up a sequencer (NGS). I am the only person with any coding experience and so was put in charge of developing the pipeline for sequencing analysis. For the more technical points I brought in a bioinformatics PhD candidate as an intern and helped him develop the pipeline for 1 single sample, then I structured the workflow for a full run (384 samples) into a parellel processed pipeline. We've recently validated it against the industry standard pipelines and it's been perfect! 

This last section has been a huge motivator for me. I've absolutely loved this work. I'm starting to be research PhD programs and which would meet the things I want to do most, but I know that a huge part of what I love at work is the ability to mess around with all kinds of data (tox/LC-MS/TOF-MS/meltcurve/PCR/PGx/NGS/big data). I know having this same expectation for a PhD program is silly, but I want to at least maintain some kind of wet lab along side the data analytics.

I've considered bioinformatics, but I worry I'll lose the wet lab side of work completely. Along with that, I'm far behind on biology knowledge, comparatively. I've learned a LOT in my year as a RnD scientist at this diagnostics company, but still a lot to catch up on.

I think my main two wants for a program would be to keep some bench work, but mostly I would miss the data processing. I would imagine any wet lab will have to process their own data, and maybe my programming could be my niche there? However if I go into a dry lab, I know the wet lab work will be taken away.

Any recommendations for areas of study I'm completely overlooking?

Tl;Dr
I am in a great scientist position where I get to do whatever I want with very little experience, but I'm falling in love with bioinformatics. What to do."

This has had an effect on what i feel is my desire to learn, it's been hard to stay focused on what i want out of my degree, i didn't feel as motivated to get the top grades that i was capable of getting, nor did i find the subject matter as engaging as i did in my first year. Throughout the second year, some of my peers have been doing independent projects to help fill the gap of what has been a very long break in between the finish and start of our academic years (i finished in April of this year) and others have managed to get a summer job/internship. These internships have all been remote and thus i fall into the same scenario, where I suck at home with many distractions to continue to pull me away from learning. 

This started when I finished my second-year exams, it was such a relief to have that weight off my shoulders that i kinda said ""im not doing anything for a few weeks and I'm gonna do something else"" and that has basically continued to this point in time, 3 months later. I have of course been applying to the odd internship here and there but that felt forced. 

I haven't completed a summer project to fill the void in the CV nor have i been successful with any of the applications that I've submitted. Outside of being enrolled on a course or having a deadline looming over my head for a paper, test or project i just simply don't have the drive to get anything done that could be beneficial to me in terms of education.

I do know what i need to do to improve on this, but what i don't know is that if this is normal behaviour? I enjoy most of the aspects of my degree, there are certainly some areas that i prefer more than others, but for the most part, i have a rather strong interest in the subject matter. Maybe i don't have as much of an interest to continue to develop my understanding in my own time, is that normal too? Maybe if i had a job where again there was some kinda deadline for learning X or Y then it would be different, but when im technically ""on a break"" and have no real implication to get things done, i simply don't. 

TL:DR - Is it normal not to continue learning until you have to go back."

I worked jobs like retail (working at a store), at a supermarket, working at restaurants/bars as a waitress? 

(I'm not an introverted person at all and I like talking to people but whenever I'm at work it all just goes out the window it seems.) 

I've had multiple side jobs while busy with my studies. But I always experience it in such a negative way. I'm not lazy, I want to work hard. But I really struggle with my ADHD especially during those types of jobs.

I dont know how to explain it the best way.
The tasks you have to do feel like they should be relatively easy. But sometimes a supervisor will give you 10 little tasks and then you have to just remember all of those tasks and I just mess up sometimes (more often than others).

And the supervisors or coworkers always get mad at you for messing up simple tasks like taking orders or helping a customer or they say I'm stocking the shelves too slow. Or I'm waitressing too slow. Or I just forget to do something or do something wrong. And then I get panicky because sometimes I have to ask how do I do this? Or can you help me with this? But then I have to ask for help or an explanation multiple times because they didn't explain it well enough the first time and that makes me anxious in fear of the coworker getting annoyed with me. So I just don't ask. And then I make a mistake. 

I also never understand how you make friends at work. You can talk during breaks but while you're working it's so hard to even have a small interaction. 
And the fact that Im bad at this makes me even more sad to go to work. Especially if you have no one to just talk to for a second. 

I feel like a lot of this is ADHD related.

And I'm trying to find a side job again but I just want to have a low key job that's not too stressful. 

Wondering if anyone has any tips on how to handle these types of situations better or if anyone can relate?

When I do find the confidence to do something that mixes these two lives together, I feel judged by my coworkers and even the partners (for example, getting long nails or forgetting to take out a piercing from the past weekend and it being the hot topic of the office--and not in a flattering way, IMO--when I'd like to be left alone to my work to the point where I don't want to reach out for handshakes or anything anymore, or bringing another POC friend to a work event and we stick out like a sore thumb). There's also a few that are visibly cold to me as well and I'm not sure if it's me personally that they dislike or the fact that I'm not a middle aged white person and they can't relate to me.

It's made me really rethink about my priorities now that I'm finally out of survival mode and actually want to pursue happiness, so I'd like to elaborate on that as well.

Growing up I was extremely artistic and liberally expressive (I'm talking tattoos and piercings), but because of the pressures of being financially stable especially from a family that hasn't always had everything, I feel responsible for making sure that my family can find generational wealth within what I do and that I don't let anybody, even my cousins down and so I kind of suppressed that side of me going into college. But now that it's over, I can only find happiness in creating in many different ways. Living in my hometown, I was accustomed to cannabis and still consistently consume it, and have due to COVID gotten into the hobby of creating (delicious) edibles. My state currently does not have it legalized and so pursuing that would take a lot of preparation if I were to move somewhere where recreational use is legal, but I have a vision for it that could easily come to fruition because I believe that I have the talent for creating a successful business from it come a time it is legal what with my experience and education.

The city I live in is where my job is based in, but I truly have no attachment to it or anything/anyone here and that's why I'm looking for a change. I really feel that if I just uprooted my life and left to start somewhere new, I could do that but at the same time I feel that I may be taking for granted the luck I've gotten to get to where I am now. I see a lot of people online just YOLOing it and somehow it's all worked out for them, so I daydream consistently about what it would be like to not have a boss and do what I love for a living.

Do you have any advice as anyone on any side of this transition and if so, when is really the best time to just pull the trigger? Should I just do it as a side hustle? Is there a different route that’s possible for me that I’m just not thinking of?"

I graduated with a degree in biology in 2016, worked in the medical device field for a few years, and in 2019 returned to school for a second degree in computer science. This summer I have been interning as a SWE at a large software company, and today I received a full-time offer.

I have a year left to finish my CS degree (graduate in May). If I can skip my last year of college, I would save ~$50,000. I spoke with my hiring manager about this, and considering I already have a degree and have performed exceptionally as an intern, he said he has no problem with me opting to start working immediately instead of spending another year to finish my CS degree.

My question is: is there a chance this would negatively affect my career later in life? Is there any compelling reason I should spend another year and $50k for that piece of paper?"
ou1wky,57,2021-07-29,Is it worth it to transfer? I went from having several Top20 acceptances to being homeless. (It's a long read—sorry!),imgoingtocryfr,TransferToTop25,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransferToTop25/comments/ou1wky/is_it_worth_it_to_transfer_i_went_from_having/,"Hi everyone I'm a hs class of '21 grad who was accepted to many top schools like JHU, Northwestern, UPenn, CMC, etc. and was waitlisted at other institutions like Harvard, Columbia, etc.


Despite this, I'm currently homeless and am looking to start at a community college in VA or my local state school in the Midwest (ranked top 50ish).


My situation is VERY unusual so I will try my best to explain how I fucked up my future so badly. 


I come from a very small town in a Midwestern state (I grew up just outside the border of Appalachia). My parents are Muslim African refugees with a very conservative/traditional worldview that went unchallenged in rural America. From a very young age, they beat into my brain that the only education I need is one that will prepare me to be a good, domesticated wife. When I was in 7th grade (12 years old) I was pulled out of school and enrolled into an online program for two reasons:


1) My mother was ill and needed a full time caretaker.

2) My parents didn't care for my education too much, and online schooling made it easier to circumvent truancy laws.


So from 7th grade to 12th grade (the better part of 6 years!!) I worked around the clock to take care of my mother by bathing, feeding, and looking after her. My two elder sisters looked after our younger brothers and my dad worked long hours.


In this time, I also became very interested in my education so I would study whenever I had a spare minute. Additionally, because my school was completely online, I was able to get involved in clubs and thus connect with my classmates and teachers. As the years passed on, (and my mother's condition either improved), I became involved in more and more educational ventures. When I was a freshman, my parents enrolled me in Arabic classes at a cc to make me eligible for marriage in my home country. I was able to negotiate and enroll myself in other subjects and got accepted to a more competitive dual enrollment program at a 4-year institution (my state flagship). I had a lot more clubs to join at that point and by the time I graduated, I had a decent resume:


GPA: ~4.7 W, ~3.98 UW (only 2 A-'s in AP courses)

SAT: 1530

+ Extensive clubs and internships in related to law/public policy.


Of course, I had a few more barriers to education (commuting 2+ hours a day to get to school, often by bike or bus). My school didn't offer AP exams so I would have to negotiate with nearby schools to take them. (I got 4s and 5s.) I mentioned this to the schools in order to put my achievements in context.


Anyways, by my 2nd semester of my senior year my parents were no longer reliant on me for housecare as my mom was able to be more independent. However, they did not respond well to my college acceptances. Even though I had full rides at my safety and my t20 acceptances were near full rides, my parents believed that an unmarried woman living in a dorm was a ""whore"" and would get killed. They told me they didn't think I would do well academically at such institutions and they wanted me to get married or work to support them instead. I protested against this, as both my sisters are enrolled in college (but commute from home). They said that degrees are useless, as ""evidenced"" by high unemployment during the pandemic, and they don't support my ambitions to go to college.


Since this was during the school year, I consulted my advisor at the uni I was dual enrolled into and she told me that out of state universities are out of the question. I am 17 and won't be 18 until late into the year, so I won't be able to sign a housing contract or any legal form necessary to enroll at a uni. The only exception would be my safety, which I was already a student in and had completed most registration (apart from housing).


I committed to my state school and my dad responded violently. I stayed in a homeless until I could get to my relative's home in VA. 

Currently, I feel extremely disappointed in the outcome. My state school isn't where I want to study, it's too close to home and I'm scared just being on campus. Transferring is ultra competitive and I'm not sure if it's even worth trying if I won't have stable housing for the duration of the school year. I'm low income so a lot of schools are out of the question already."

If you feel that my list is unrealistic for my profile please slap me with the reality.

Intended Major: I am deeply interested in stocks and the financial markets and my goal is to be a quant trader on Wall Street one day. I plan on applying as a Computational Finance major or something similar to it to colleges that don't have this major specifically.

Demographics: Indian, Male, Residing in NJ

Financial aid: Don't need it

SAT: 1480 (690 r/w 790 math) I will be retaking it August and I am aiming for a 1520.

Rank: School doesn't do rank

APs:

Self studied in 10th: Chemistry (3) and Statistics (4)

Taken in school in 11th: Biology (5) and Waiting on Scores for Calc BC, Microeconomics, and Computer Science A but I am fairy confident that they will all be 5s

Will be Taking in 12th: Both Physics C courses I am only taking 2 aps in

Cumulative GPA: 3.79 UW and 4.45 W

In my freshman year I did poorly due to difficulty increase from honors classes which results in several Bs. My freshman year GPA was a 3.4 UW and 4.0 W. For sophomore year it was 3.96 UW and 4.45W. For junior year I had a 4.0 UW and a 4.87W. I hope that colleges will see my upward trend and allow it to compensate for my lower cumulative GPA.

Courses that I will be taking in 12th:

Both AP Physics C courses

Multivariable Calculus Honors (next level after AP Calc BC)

Advanced Topics in Computer Science (next level after AP CSA)

American Studies 2 Honors (For graduation requirement)

LA 4 Honors

Spanish 5 (For graduation Requirement)

Letters of Recommendation:

My English and Physics teachers who I had in my junior year are writing my letters. I had a pretty good relationship with them. I emailed them to discuss about the college applications process and I didn't have to ask them for the letter, they offered to write me one on their own. I would give these letter a 9.5 or a 10/10.

Extracurriculars:

Unpaid Summer Internship at a private equity firm where I report directly to the CEO and get all of my assignment from him (this is my first summer doing this)

Cross Country/Track and Field: I did this in my freshman year as a jv althlete and won a few medals, nothing special here. Didn't continue it after 9th grade due to the amount of time that I would have to commit to it.

Robotics: I have been on the team since my sophomore year but I unfortunately got outvoted for getting a leadership position.

Outreach Ambassador/Tutor for tutoring group: I was a tutor in computer science in 11th and for the upcoming year I got the position of Outreach ambassador for the group.

Youtube channel for Crypto/Finance: I started a channel with a friend on cryptocurrencies and stocks and the channel has around 800 subs, 50+ videos, and around 65k views. (Started this 2 months ago)

Vedic School Volunteer: I volunteer as a teacher for my local Vedic school branch. I teach my native language and Vedic Mathematics to upper elementary children (4th-5th grade). I started this in my sophomore year and have gotten 2 Bronze PVSAs for this.

Colleges I plan on applying to:

Carnegie Mellon

CUNY Baruch

Georgia Tech

UIUC

NYU

Purdue

Rutgers - New Brunswick

Stevens Institute of Technology

UMD - College Park

UT Austin

What are my options of leaving the job?,Aggravating-Ad-1439,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ou20p9/made_the_mistake_of_picking_contract_to_hire_job/,"After desperately looking for an IT position to get experience, I got an offer to do part-time help desk at a non-profit through a recruiter. I thought everything was good until I saw the contract. After doing research, I realized this was a contract to hire position. I’ve heard mixed things about c2h but kept thinking if I treat it like an internship and just do good, I’ll probably be promoted full time. Also, I thought the $20/hr they offered was good. I’m an idiot. Stupidly, I signed the contract. My first day was Monday and to be honest, I don’t mind the work. The team is pretty small consisting of one other help desk person, a Jr sys admin, and our sys admin. They’re pretty cool people and like working with them but the thought of only being temporary and I could get fired anytime is eating at me. I sat down and spoke with my sys admin(assistant manager) and she told me that she was placed by the same recruiter several years ago, but was hired soon after due to the company needing people. She also mentioned that the others were also hired the same way but they were “at the right place at the right time”. She basically told me there’s no guarantee that I would be hired at the end of the contract since it’s based on what the company needs. She said I could get let go in 3 months, or I could stay another 3 months. This depressed me as I was hoping to be there for at least 6 months as the recruiter told me it was permanent hire after 6 months.

A day later, I received an internship offer. It would be up to December 2021, with an extension to April 2022 if I like the position and it could go until August 2022 after graduation if I haven’t accepted a FT offer. I was so happy for this offer that my dumbass signed it without taking into consideration of my contract to my job and I start next Monday. I looked at the terms of the contract and they charge a penalty of 40 hrs that would be otherwise owed to me through through my pay for leaving without insufficient notice. I assume they would garnish the time I’ve worked so far. Now I realized I fucked up. If I leave my job, I would potentially owe $800($20/hr for 40 hrs) and burn a bridge with my recruiter and company I work with now. However, I don’t want to stay here now knowing I would lose my job in 3 months. What are my options?"

I started as an intern and now am part of management and have really changed the role I was originally hired for. I even started taking on interns a couple years ago, and one of them has stuck with us for a couple years. She's smart and efficient-enough, doesn't make waves, and has a good way of giving her opinions without being out of line. She's really helped get us through some hard stuff, and I had been advocating hiring her on full-time as an assistant before the pandemic hit - there are things in my own job I could easily pass off to her so I can focus more on bigger picture items that require more intimate training and knowledge.

We've been unable to hire her full-time due to budget approval issues with the CEO (who, as so many are, is out of touch with our company's needs). There's only 8 of us in the whole company so that's saying something here. 

As her direct-supervisor, I've fought for her and really helped defend her; I make sure she doesn't receive only crap intern work and is actually getting something out of this job, I demanded she make a better hourly wage, and I let my all-male staff know they have to treat her with respect. Respect that no one demanded for me when I was coming up. Really I'm doing all I can to make this a better environment for her than it was for me, and it's working - she's receiving more praise than I did, better pay, awards that I didn't get til I was several years in, and she has told me she feels truly appreciated. 

Meanwhile, I am disrespected 50% of the time and gaslit more often than not so hard into wondering if I am intuiting bad signs at work or if I'm overthinking and being paranoid. My therapist thinks paranoid. If something is slightly incorrect on a project and I need to go back and fix, I'm made to feel completely stupid. I don't have anyone looking out for me. I would never allow my intern to be talked to the way I am, and I never let her fail and pick up the slack when she's having a hard time because the work needs to get done and I will get blamed if she falters, too. Really, it's all my fault as a manager, you know?

That stress of doing my own job and making sure she's doing hers while watching her be rewarded where I'm only scolded because I won't let her screw up or let them know when she has is killing me. Meanwhile, we just hired her full-time temporarily during our busy season. She will receive a small salary but no other benefits. She's about to turn 26 and confided in me that she's worried about losing her health insurance. I've encouraged her, on a personal level, to look elsewhere since she's not getting enough here - not because I want to get rid of her, but because I don't want to see her get stuck somewhere doing something she doesn't even want to do (she is trained in another industry) and then not even get benefits on top of it. I've been there, I'm trying to not let her be where I was.

Yesterday we had a conversation where she told me not only does she feel respected, but she enjoys the work because she's not ""as emotionally invested in it as she would be in \[her own industry.\]"" So, basically, I'm over here dying and feeling unappreciated and pouring in hours and hours of work nights and weekends and lying awake at night worried about things going well because I DEEPLY care about the work we do, and she's not stressed in the least because she's emotionally detached from the mission (but less so the job). No wonder she's so likable, she isn't stressed out all the time!

My therapist, mom, dog, etc think it's because I've been there a long time so they can talk to me however they want. I used to be more resilient and let it roll off but I'm at the point of feeling upset by these things for days instead of minutes. I can't shake it. And it's making me WORSE at my job, no doubt.

I realize this went in a few different directions, but I don't know what to do here. Do I sit down and talk to my boss and tell him how concerned I am in the discrepancy in treatment? Ask him if I can do better somewhere or if there's a reason I am being talked to so poorly? I don't want my insecurities to get the better of me but I am so worn out and upset.  I mean, hell, maybe I'm not as good as I think I am, I'm surely overworked and overloaded but I definitely don't deserve to be talked down to."

Thanks, r/ITCareerQuestons!",Shock8372,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ouazsy/managed_to_land_a_job_thanks_ritcareerquestons/,"Hey all! I recently got hired on to a help desk position at a small tech company. I wanted to take a few moments to thank everyone in this community for all the advice shared within; I've benefitted a great deal from the tips and insight you all have proffered, and now have a job to show for it!

I recently graduated college this past May with a bachelor's in IT, and have been seeking out an opportunity to enter the wonderful field that is information technology for the past few months. For reference, I don't have any certs, internships, or formal experience directly tied to IT; however, I will say that I've had a pretty extensive background in the customer service industry, which I feel is a good selling-point to potential interviewers. 

I've interviewed at a fair number of companies , submitted quite a few applications, and have had my fair share of rejections. But, in the end, all it takes is one yes, and finally that one yes came :)

For everyone out there applying, I'd like to offer a few pieces of advice that I've picked up on either through this sub, or, as a result of my own personal experience applying and interviewing.

Firstly, don't get discouraged. It's definitely a timesink submitting multiple apps through LinkedIn, Indeed, Monster, etc. This can feel even more so once you get hits from employers only to interview and be told you didn't get the role. But, the upside is, no matter how ""bad"" you think you did during an interview, or how crappy it feels to get rejected, chances are, you'll have learned something in the process. Whether that be in the form of learning how to answer specific questions, ""quirks"" you may find you possess whilst interviewing (i.e. saying ""ummm"", pen-clicking, etc), or, simply learning something new about the employers themselves, each interview merits a chance to grow and expand your situational knowledge. I doubt interviews are going anywhere anytime soon, so the more experience you have practicing them, the better off you'll likely be.

Second up, the site [resumake.io](http://resumake.io) is a lifesaver. For real. I can't remember where exactly I saw it recommended, but it'll save you a lot of time and hassle composing a resume yourself. It's easy to modify, saves your current resume template (which I really appreciated, means you don't have to re-enter the same thing ten times), is free, and allows categorization of your skills, educational history, awards, etc. Highly recommended, and a great resource.

Next, I'd say consider your strengths, and reflect on your weaknesses, before actually interviewing. As mentioned before, I served in a restaurant for a few years; while not directly correlated to IT, it shows that I have proficiency in customer service, multi-tasking, and ""troubleshooting"" situational issues that may arise. I leaned heavily on this during interviews since I don't have any formal training on troubleshooting or help desk experience (my education acted as a substitute for this, but I'll make an obvious assumption that it'll be 10x easier if you do have prior relational experience). 

I will admit, however, that -  for me, personally - strengths are much easier to answer than weaknesses. I think it's because I know what I'm proficient in, but don't necessarily think about the aspects I'm lacking or needing to improve on. Therefore, it's important to think on how you'd answer this question before it's actually asked (a personal anecdote, but every interviewer I've had has asked me what my strengths and weaknesses are). The thing that's proved most effective for me is stating a weakness I may have, and in turn how I plan to improve upon that weakness in the future. So, if I were to say, ""I don't know how to subnet"", I'd then discuss the steps I'd take in the future to ensure I'm improving upon my ability to do so.

Finally, don't sell yourself short. You are a worthwhile investment; make sure the company knows this (that is why they're considering hiring you after all!). I've interviewed with one company that offered no long-term benefits, required me to travel extensively, and wanted me to be in-office by 7:30 A.M. M-F. The next company I interviewed for (which ended up hiring me) is fully remote, grants a higher salary, offers complete benefits, and provides a number of additional incentives. It pays (literally and figuratively) to seek out more than one company; don't accept the first offer you get if it you think you can do better (within reason, of course). An interviewer once told me, ""you're interviewing me as much as I'm interviewing you"", and that's true! It's a chance for both parties to get to know one another, so make sure you like what you hear before jumping aboard.

I apologize for the huge wall of text, and, of course I'm not the most experienced or knowledgeable person when it comes to all this stuff (hell, it is only my first ""career-oriented"" position after all). But, I wanted to make a relatively long write-up to hopefully help others as much as I feel that this community has helped me, and let them know that in-spite of not having extensive experience, or any internships, or certs - whatever the case may be, it is possible to ascertain a job in this field if you're willing to put forth the effort and time to seek a position out.

Thank you all again for the guidance, insight, and tips readily available and provided through this sub, and if anyone has any questions or needs some help themselves, please ask! If I don't know the answer (which may very well be likely), I'm sure someone else will :)"

The longer I search, the more I feel I’m doing something wrong and should take a different approach.

I recently graduated with a bachelor’s in Informatics (it’s like information sciences, user-systems interaction, and computer science-y). It’s a new-ish major that’s been around for about 20 years. I studied Java (Principles, OOP, algorithms), some math (discrete, linear algebra, brief Calc), statistics, a little SQL database design, some web development, some user experience study projects, and I took some graphic design, illustration, and video editing courses for my major-related electives. 

The past 2 years I’ve been doing part-time digital marketing and some administrative tasks for a law firm. I don’t want to do marketing again, it was supposed to be just while I was in school. Before that, I had a horrible UX internship and I worked at a restaurant and a coffee shop.

So I was thinking, maybe I work on a portfolio website with fresh projects related to a job type I want to focus on? Because I checked my newest resumes formatting and made sure the information was all there when I exported to a txt file. I must just not have enough stuff. Maybe new projects would help?

Or maybe there’s some networking I could do. I would love to meet someone who studied similar things I did and hear how they got work after school. I don’t know any female engineers, programmers, developers, researchers, analysts, etc. I have no idea how to meet people in the industry.

Would love some suggestions :)"

I have two chairs, one junior and one senior. So my school is a top school in it's field and most graduates go into academia. When I told my advisors that I was going into industry last year, they didn’t like the decision and I think that’s when things started. 

I wanted to take an internship during my last year after I finish my dissertation and they demanded that I need to see the paper through revision and publication. Otherwise they wouldn't let me take an internship. I was made to believe that I need to publish my dissertation in order to graduate,which was not the case. I was able to finish the paper. 

During my internship (this is after I defended and passed) we need to revise the paper for publication. They got very unhappy that I was too slow with revision while I was juggling interviewing and my internship. I said let's get another co-author (at this point the paper was 95% done) to run some robustness tests. They rejected and put me as second author and put the junior chair as the first author. I though this is how things works and I am afraid they will take away my degree and give me a hard time to graduate, so I had to say yes. After that I shared everything I had worked on for the paper (code , data etc) and answered questions that junior chair has about my code. She submitted the paper as the first author. 

I thought that was the end of it until another revision round came. The junior faculty now claims that my code does not work for her and she cannot do revision work. Truth is she not only didn't tell me what's the issue when I asked her but also didn't seem to open the code at all. She kept asking where are things but I already answered those months ago. She claimed that only I can do the revision work because she cannot replicate my results. Senior faculty believed her that there's something wrong with my code and said ""replication issue is a problem for both the publication and degree"". I have tons of proof that my code works and I have log files from servers to show that I didnt make any results up. I got really pissed and afraid at the same time that they are using my degree to threaten me. 


I am going to have a conversation with my PhD office about this. I am also worried about my degree and my reputation as my senior faculty said she will work with someone in my current company. Months after I graduate I still feel I am being taken advantage of."

oufirl,44,2021-07-30,I am working on fairly old technology and I am not sure wether that hurts future prospects,KazZarma,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/oufirl/i_am_working_on_fairly_old_technology_and_i_am/,"To start with, I will try to keep very specific info about the company private, just in case any colleague lurks around here (although I highly doubt it).

I am a 22-year-old programmer from Eastern Europe, I graduated with a degree in computer science and economics at a university in my home country (3 years program) and I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Distributed Systems (1 year in, 1 more to go).

In our second year of uni, we had to find a 2 month internship in order to get in touch with reality and I found a pretty small local company (around 10 employees total, not all of them programmers) that gave me a chance and eventually hired me full time after the 2 month period ended.

Problem is, the company develops a suite of apps, all web based and all based on ASP.NET Web Forms using the VB.NET programming language. As far as I know, this is pretty old tech, this was news before 2010. Also the pay is quite above average in my country for people my age (~12k€/year), but not exactly competitive 

Now you're probably wondering, why did I take this offer if I knew what I was signing up for? The answer is I simply didnt know better. In hindsight, I knew basically jack shit from uni (as one would expect) and for me, this was an opportunity to learn, and to be completely honest I did, I learned and developed a whole lot in the 2 years I've been here.

Recently, I was pursued by a couple of recruiters from a social platform and I ended up having a bunch of interviews in which I did quite well. However, whenever I would say 2 YoE and Web Forms, they would sort of freeze for a moment and I believe this hurt my prospects.

From all those interviews, I ended up going the full distance with 3 companies, 2 of them quite big. I received only 1 official offer from 1 small company who was basically a duo at that point and they also worked with Web Forms and WebAPI in C#. They offered me a higher salary, but I declined since I considered this opportunity to be a side-grade at best. 

Another point which baffles recruiters and interviewers is the fact that I use VB at work, but I always tell them the experience is transferable and it's not a big deal, it's company policy, I have no say in what language or tech we use at work. Also, I am not quite sure if switching tech stack (eg. Java) would mean I need to look for lesser positions than my current experience. I worked at length with Java in both uni and master's and I have some projects on my github to show for it, but recruiters/interviewers don't even flinch. 

To kind of fix this situation, I constantly learn tech in my spare time to keep up and try to get a better job. My aims right now are proper C#, WebAPI and finish an MVC course I've tried my hand at for a while. I would also want to learn a front end framework as I've seen it's considered nice to have (React, Angular, Vue). 
I also study German in my spare time because I want to try to go be a programmer there sometime in the future. I also have a Cambridge Advanced certificate passed with C2 for reference.

How would you guys handle this situation? What tech would you try to learn? Would you lie about the tech used at work in interviews in order to increase chances? Would you take a pay cut to work with more modern technology?

Thank you if you read through this wall of text :)"

For example, in 9th grade I didn’t clean the house and she made me stay home and miss an exam to clean it. One day I was late to a meeting somewhere and she canceled my summer research internship, unenrolled me from a scholarship program, and didn’t allow me to leave my house for the summer. She has cancelled my birthday party on multiple occasions. She has cancelled thanksgiving and Christmas before too. Most recently, i accidentally left a box of product in the garage and we couldn’t sell it so she cancelled my SAT test dates and said I’m not allowed to take it and threatened to unenroll my from all my AP and colleges class and force me to take all regular classes or to switch to online homeschool. I am not a bad child but bc I live in a black household she doesn’t believe that it could be possible for me to have adhd so it’s undiagnosed and therefore I’m struggling to maintain “good behaviors”. I have two dilemma: one I lost all the forks in the house and there are only two more. I don’t know how when she just bought new ones and all I do is clean the dishes put them in the dishwasher and put them up. More importantly, I’ve lost one of my $1,000 hearing aids. If I can’t find she will flip out when she notices and I don’t know what she’ll take away then. I am terrified but I also don’t know where it could be bc the house is kinda messy and if I clean it and don’t find it when I’m cleaning I’m going to be even worse off than I started. If you were to lose a hearing aid where would you think to look for it outside of drawers, backpack, and dresser tops? Same with forks."

I had to take a mental health day today or I might have gotten a legit break down. I'm currently 22 turning 23 and for the last couple of months I've come to realize what anti-work really means to me. I've been working since I was 18 in retail for four years in college. I've had to deal with the Karens of the world. I didn't really mind it too much. Going to school, doing my work study, doing internships, going to my retail job. For some reason, this day to day sentiment didn't hit me like a truck.

But then I got my first, full time adult job.

I slowly came to realize what this entailed. Waking up early, going to work, being too tired to do anything after work and just doing the bare minimum of eating and cleaning and upkeep.

Then doing it again the next day, then the next day, then the next day, and then its finally Saturday and you have some time to yourself right? Wrong. Now you gotta go grocery shopping, now you gotta do chores, you gotta take care of the kids (if you have kids), take care of your parents, etc and so fourth.

And then you do it again on Sunday. And then you get the dreaded going back to work on Monday feelings and now it's Monday and you do it all over again dealing with all the things you need to deal with at work.

For the next 50 years of your life.

That literally terrified me. I don't wanna live like this for the next 50 years of my life. And I don't know how people before me were able to do this for the entirety of their lives and retire in their 60s.

I ask around the people in my life and they say to just suck it up and this is how life is, and if that's the case I don't want this shit.

And then if you want to get out of the rat race, not wanting to work for someone else because they'll ultimately fuck you over somehow someway, you have the option to make a businesss of your own, and that has its own pros and cons but at the end of the day you're still working. You're still working towards that end goal, whatever it may be. And I'm TIRED of it, I'm only 22 and I'm TIRED of it.

I can't go to the dotor or dentist because I'm working my 9-5, and most doctors and dentists are open at that time. So if I need my annual checkup I have to take PTO. Have to do all my grocery shopping after work where everybody else also has to do it at that time as well. My parents are aging and they're not able to move around as much as they want to, and I can't help them out cause I'm at work, and my younger 18 year old sister can't help out because she's moderately intellectually disabled. So ultimately I have to take care of her and my parents.

I apologize if this sounds like a rant or vent, this is why I took that mental health day. 

I wish I can be born as a cat in my next life. Anyway, what's your story?"

oul6pm,1,2021-07-30,Advice for a late transfer student,Upfrog,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/oul6pm/advice_for_a_late_transfer_student/,"Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a rising junior at a small (not nationally ranked) college, and I'm strongly considering changing my major to Computer Science. The question of whether or not to do this is mine to make, but in the event that I take the plunge, **I'd like some advice on how best to compensate for my later start date, as well as any more general advice that comes to mind.**

&amp;#x200B;

First, some general information about me: I don't have a fantastically strong CS background. I took an AP CS A class in high school, which was quite good, and a college class, which was horrible. These were done in Java and Python, respectively. I've been brushing up on both languages over this summer, and I've been poking at a few minor projects, one of which involves interfacing with a SQLite database, but nothing more complicated than that. My current major is in Economics and Finance, and I've taken through Calculus III and Linear Algebra.

&amp;#x200B;

Some specific questions I have:

* What does the internship scene look like for people starting as late as me? And what sort of internship would I be best served in targeting? I don't have long at all to prepare; what are some ways I can best optimize to get something next summer?
   * If all goes perfectly, I will have taken classes in data structures, system organization, algorithms, and basic web design. There is a slim chance that I will have also taken a course on networks and/or computational theory. But I won't have as many classes as many CS juniors, nor will I have had nearly as much time to do personal projects.
* More generally, what are some of the more efficient ways for me to make up my lost time?
* Are there any ways that you think a full or partial Econ and Finance degree could be synergized with a search for tech job? I don't have the *impression* that it would be a leg up for, say, a fintech job, but maybe I'm wrong?
* As a fun bonus question: do you see any advantages of my late start that I should keep in mind?
* As an extra fun bonus question: have I revealed any premises which seem fundamentally flawed? Any ways in which I'm just approaching this set of problems poorly?

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, here is some advice that I think I already know:

* Just Do Stuff. Do whatever projects are interesting and within my scope right now. Don't wait to take a particular course, don't wait for permission, don't wait to be ""ready"", don't wait for any other milestone. Just do the thing.
   * Contributing to open source projects is also super great, but takes a lot of effort and runs the risk of annoying already-overworked maintainers with my amateur code.
* Pay attention in all my classes, but super-extra-especially in those on Data Structures or Algorithms.
   * Try to take these classes as early as is practical, as they have the most carryover to interview questions, and are generally the most fundamental.
* Start practicing interview questions early.
* Don't give too much focus to technical interview prep at the expense of behavioral interview prep.

&amp;#x200B;

Please feel free to pick these apart; my family is fond of the saying ""It's not what you don't know that gets you, it's what you do know that's wrong."""

\-I love using the power of Excel to make data organization, access, and edits more efficient. There's just something awesome about writing perfect formulas that reference other formulas that reference other.... you get it. Formula-ception. This has been the most enjoyable aspect of the two tax internships I have done.

\-I value money highly because I am a late starter at age 33. However, between work-life-balance and money, I would choose WLB if the money was good enough. I would be happy with reaching $85k about 8-10 years after graduation. I know that public accounting would easily achieve me 6 figures in 10 years, but I am not sure the hours are worth it. 

\-I think I prefer budgeting and forecasting over reporting.  It's more exciting.

I know big tech generally has good WLB for interns besides maybe Apple or Tesla? LinkedIn? Are unicorns a good option?"
oumbsn,3,2021-07-30,Should I pursue the freelance route or accept a marketing job at a non profit organization? Should I try to do both?,Powerful_Solid,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/oumbsn/should_i_pursue_the_freelance_route_or_accept_a/,"Hello there! A little background on me: I am 23F and I work pt doing Pinterest management for a small agency. After graduation I couldn’t find work and had to intern for free. After 6 months I found an internship at a digital marketing agency and worked for free and got paid $10/hr for the hours I completed outside my internship. I now work 20 hours a week making $15/hr helping a small agency with their Pinterest accounts.

I have recently been booking interview after interview. Some are freelance gigs while others are full time in person roles. My strongest interviews have been with non profit organizations with a pay of $33,000 (pretty low Ik but they will offer me experience). 

I have a company looking to hire me for freelance and I’m estimating $2,000 a month with average of 20 hours a week. If I keep my current freelance gig along with this new one I have now I will be doing $39,000 a year with the potential to add another freelance gig (that I just interviewed for) that I am estimating will pay me $1000 a moth if they choose to hire me. 

Should I stick with freelance, work remotely and do basic social media management and make more money or should I accept a full time role and try to make my current freelance gig work on the side? 

I am stuck. Working with a non profit will get me out of the house and meet new people but I will be payed low and I will not be able to manage my freelance gigs. Doing the 3 freelance gigs promises me a hire pay, remote work, and flexible hours. The only thing is that I will not be able to meet new people and learn additional skills. 

What do you think is more important? Any advice is appreciated!"

I've gone through my school's resources, but our DS program is very new so they don't have many connections to help out there.

I'm an upcoming second year student and I'm thinking about applying for summer internships. However, I'm kinda dubious about applying as I don't have much to put on my resume.

I don't have any prior internships or work experience (other than being a volunteer) and my resume isn't that great. I have a good GPA and over the summer I picked up some front end development. I do have a couple of personal projects on my hand (such as a restaurant page, tic-tac-toe, a library system, a todo list, a calculator, sketch app etc. I know these projects aren't that great but I'm still relatively new to coding). 

Is there any point in me applying for internships right now? Is there anything I can do to improve my chances of getting an internship? I'm seriously doubting myself as my resume looks so bad compared to others. I'll definitely be improving my skills more over the coming months. Any feedback is appreciated. Thanks!"

So, I have been in the United States of America for the last two years, pursuing a Master's degree in Data Analytics from a reputed US University.

Coming from India, and being away from my home for so long, in addition to having all Financial responsibilities on me after my father's death at the end of last year, it has been a really difficult road for me to find a job here in the states with about 10 months of professional experience as a Business Analyst and having a Master's degree with innumerable skills in Data Science is not helping as well.

I have worked on multiple personal/real-world projects in the field of Data Science, thinking that, it would make up for the lack of professional experience I have in the Industry as a Business/Data Analyst, but every company I talk to either wants 6-7 years of experience or a Doctorate degree to make up for it.

With only 20 days left for me to stay in the country with my F-1 OPT EAD work Authorization, I really don't know what I am going to do, since going back home would not help me sustain my family financially, after what we went through and the immense pain and financial trauma our family has gone to pay for my tuition, especially during COVID with no source of income and the loss of my father.

I would really appreciate it if anyone could help me with leads/references for any company/contracting roles here in the USA, or even unpaid internships that could help me stay in the US.

Please let me know if anyone can help and I can send you my resume and profile, and would love to discuss anything in particular or questions you might have."

I am an intern at a pretty big company, and we just finished asking users to drop their computers off on-site for the past 8 months so we could take them for 3 hrs, keep them on LAN, push our company windows update package, and have it install. Now we have to do it again for EVERY user for 20H2. I don't really know anything about anything at the moment, but the way we do our current updates seems ludicrous. To add, if the user refuses to comply or tells us to fuck off we literally can't do anything. We basically have to BEG them to let us update their machines which results in literally thousands of emails that we have to send out twice a week...

&amp;#x200B;

To me, this seems very inefficient, and borderline stupid to require users to come in just so we can connect them to a dock, push our company package through ivanti, and then give them the computer back because for whatever reason they don't want us pushing the packages over vpn through our software.

&amp;#x200B;

Surely there is a more efficient way to do this, for example pushing it over vpn and letting it update that way, or by deploying it through PDQ Deploy or WSUS or something right? I do not believe for a second that forcing users to drive sometimes over 2hrs away to leave their computer with us for 3 hours while we just push a package is efficient and/or correct.  


  
I would like to learn more about deployment software in general and maybe even find a better way to do this task, so any comments/advice is greatly appreciated."

I have an opportunity to expedite the process with Palantir through an organization that I’m in, and so I think I have a pretty good shot at a SWE intern role @ Palantir.

I like Palantir and can see myself working there but it’s not my dream company. On the other hand, I don’t wanna miss out this process because I might not have any other opportunity.

Some questions I have been thinking about are -

1) How fast should I be assimilated in my role and be fully performing?

2) Is there a need to have a professional and personal self? Should I bring my liveliness in my interactions with my colleagues - will smiling in conversations give off a bad impression?

3) The firm is known to have a self-service culture (which I am used to), however, how often should I ping someone for help without coming across as annoying? A mental model that I am living by is to problem solve first, and only reach out if I can’t find any resources anywhere - but there are a multitude of tools which I will only learn when I have a use case for it. Plus, I see it that the first time asked is a lesson, and the second time is a mistake. 

4) How honest should you be in your 1:1s with your manager? During my internship, I mainly used it to keep my manager updated on my weekly tasks plus to seek mentorship - which had been useful; however, now as a full-timer should the structure be changed?

5) Do you see your colleagues as your friends? Or are most bonds kept professional?

To provide some background, I just graduated and managed to get a role in another team in the same tech organisation that I was an intern at - which I am extremely grateful for. 

While the culture is similar, the role is very different - but it is something that I’m enjoying so far. And I have been working for 1 month - was at my internship role for 6 months. 

However, the feeling of imposter syndrome has been weighing really heavily on me, and I feel the need to be able to deliver - especially as my internship manager had put in a good word for me with the team I am at.

And I have been using weekends to complete work. For example, using Sunday’s to prepare for meetings on Monday. Plus working till almost 9pm every night - I am used to working longer hours, as I’m using my time to go through training materials and unfamiliar documents. But I don’t know if it sustainable for the long-run. And I know it’s about working smart, not hard - but I feel that there is a need to come across as competent.

Any other advice will be great too."
ourb4s,196,2021-07-30,To my professors who believed in me…thank you.,ParisNicole911-,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/ourb4s/to_my_professors_who_believed_in_methank_you/,"I am the first in my family to graduate college (we now have two more college grads). And now I’m the first who is less than a year away from attaining a masters degree. I’ve had to figure out a lot on my own, but man I am shedding tears of gratitude because of the opportunities my professors have given me.

I’ve shared with nearly all of them my background story, how I got a shitty undergrad GPA (working two jobs, caring for my grandma with dementia, and mourning the sudden death of my boyfriend), but that I’m willing to do whatever it takes to learn the field (health administration), and that I’ll take any internship or fellowship that’s willing to take me in.

Nearly all of them have offered to write me letters of recommendation. And two of them pushed hard for me. They wrote me excellent letters and connected me with two different healthcare organizations.

Because of them, I now have almost too many options. During the summer I started interning at the #5 pediatric hospital in the nation. And they’ve asked if I’m willing to extend my time which I said yes. The head of the neurology department asked me to apply to a position that would help me learn about operations (and get paid).  And the head of the fellowship department wants to meet with me next week for a potential opportunity as well. 

But last night I received news that Kaiser Permanente would like for me to join them to learn about budgeting and operations. 

Right now I’m crying because I’ve NEVER had so many people believe in me or understand my goals. I used to be the student that was overlooked (rightfully so with my crappy grades). I got rejected from other grad programs. I cannot believe the amount of support I’m getting, and my family doesn’t understand the lengths my professors have gone to get me where I’m at and where I’m going. 

If anyone would’ve told me a little over a year ago that I would be in this position I would’ve never believed them. While I have some serious decisions to make, I’m so grateful to every educator I’ve had in my program and I wish I could give them all $5 million dollars to thank them for everything they’ve done for me. 

To anyone who is struggling to get into grad school or reach their goals, please do not give up your dreams. Keep pushing and believing in your potential and people will see your hunger to strive. Never surrender!"

I have a desktop system I game on so don't worry about gaming

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**

Big comfy keyboard to use would be lovely.

Would love for it to last a few years till I'm at least in my first year of a real job before I look for a   
replacement.

I'm really looking for a solid workhorse computer that will last a few years and be able to   
handle whatever a being a student or job would throw at it. I was looking at the HP Spectre   
x360 originally but am currently a little lost and undecided as to what to pick"

ouvref,2,2021-07-30,How do I increase my likelihood of finding internship on Summer 2022? (Currently working on my .NET skills),developer-27,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ouvref/how_do_i_increase_my_likelihood_of_finding/,"Hello Everyone, I changed my major last year. I took an intro to programming, data structures and an intro to C# class. After I took C# class. I liked this language and improved myself on Windows Application Development (UWP, WPF and Windows Forms). So far I attended to 6 hackhatons, completed 18 personal projects and 3 group projects. During this summer I additionally learned C++ and MySQL. Making Win32 applications were a little harder with C++ so instead of making C++ applications, I made 2 database applications with MySQL. I also made some good desktop applications with Java as well. In one of my hackathons I used my web development experience a little bit. I used JavaScript in one part of the project. I also took Python classes at the very beginning but it still needs some improvements. I could have explain more, but I guess the situation I described would be enough. I started to apply for some internships this month. But they were not recruiting at this time so I keep applying. I have a month left to complete my “initial skills”. Because when the school starts I will focus on improving my GPA. Right now I focused on improving My MySQL skills. How would I go further in order to increase my likelihood of getting internship next summer? Would this be better to expand further .NET development or I should transition to Android Development or C++ development? Thank you for answering my question."

I have been at my current place of employmentship for approximately 10 years, moving from intern to leader in my area. My manager is set to retire soon, and has been grooming me to take over her position. She recently informed me that there will be a restructure in the area I work at, and that leadership above her, stated they are thinking of bringing someone at her level to manage the team I am leading currently. I do not have any direct reports but for all intents and purposes, lead in my area.

I have been applying to leadership style positions around my area with no luck. There was a job posting that is half the drive (currently 20 minutes to about 10) for a non leadership position but some place I feel I could grow into.

I had an interview with this new place, and it seems to have went really well. The entire interview team was laughing and overall seemed to really get along! I think it went well!

So here is my dilemma, do I stay in hopes of being able to get a management type position in my current place of employment, or do I take this new risk if offered? 

Benefits are about the same, new place would possibly have a pension, Pay may be slightly better at this new position, and it is half the drive.

I am ok with either position as I am taking steps to improve myself (school etc) outside if work. I would like to lead a team, however, I do like being on the technical side too.

Thoughts? Advice? Help?"

ouye4j,1,2021-07-30,I received a record label job offer and am unsure of compensation,throwaway-1426,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ouye4j/i_received_a_record_label_job_offer_and_am_unsure/,"I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this to so please let me know if there are any better subreddits to post to.

I was recently offered a position with a start up record label and I would be the head of the Film/TV Sync department but also helping with promotions and marketing until more people come on board. While I don't have too much experience in sync licensing, I do have connections in the industry with music supervisors, agents, promoters, etc. I also have a background in sales and a degree in business so I know my way around marketing. 

The question of compensation came up and I'm unsure of what to say as it is a start up and not much money is being generated. I was originally under the impression that this was an internship but was corrected today during the interview to head of department. They asked straight up how I wanted to be compensated and while there is obvious compensation with sync licensing which they mentioned I would be paid on, there isn't so much for all the work done with networking, marketing, etc. 

My question to you all is if anyone in this subreddit has experience with working in a start up in the entertainment industry and what, if anything, they were paid.

Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
What kind of surgeries do Ents usually need? Is it hard having to use a ladder every day because Treebeard et al are so tall? Does it get annoying trying to get their symptoms because they talk so slowly?|Fortunately, Ents are lieing on a table when we perform surgery on them. So we don't need a ladder. They need to fill out a form before I see them. So I already know what their problems are. Saves a lot of time.
Do German people say “gesundheit” after someone sneezes or is that an American thing?|It is a German thing as well. It is considered polite to say ""Gesundheit"".
Why is there one doctor for all 3 of those orifices?|I'm not the only doctor. All of us work at the ward, in the OR and in the doctor's office. We have a timetable which tells us where we are working at which time. I am the head doctor of the ward which means that I am responsible for the patients there and need to coordinate stuff.
^(the below is another reply to the original question)|&amp;#x200B;
I guess it's because they are all connected.|I didn't understand your question at first. Sorry!
&amp;#x200B;|There are ENT surgeons who sub-specialize. However, since ear, nose and throat are connected, many diseases affect all of them. That's why it is one specialization.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|&amp;#x200B;
Are the eyes or tearducts connected too? When I was young and stupid I could smoke and blow it out of the inner corners of my eyes.|Yes, they are. That's why your nose is running when you are crying. The tears travel through a tube from your eyes to your nose.
Do you see any connection between people with nose breathing issues/sleep apnoea and weight gain?|There probably is a connection. Some years ago we assumed that weight gain is a major risk factor for sleep apnoea. Today, science isn't too sure if this is right.
&amp;#x200B;|From my personal experience, most of my patients who have sleep apnoea are also obesive.
How are you doing Kevin?|So far I am having a great day off. How are you doing?
^(the below is a reply to the above)|&amp;#x200B;
Very well, thanks for asking!|:-)
I am residing in Germany and it has become harder to breathe through the nose over the years. Using a facemask everyday makes me notice this especially. I must mouth breathe alot and always when going to sleep. What is up? Is it Polyps in the nose? Should I consider a Septoplasty?|That can have several reasons. Polyposis is only one possible disease. You should see an ENT surgeon and maybe also get a CT scan of your nose. That helps to find the cause of your symptoms. And that is necessary to decide on a good treatment.
Do you need fluent Entish for your role? Or can you get by with a translator?|Fortunately the nurses at my ward can translate for me. I'm fine with simple phrases like ""Hi!"" and ""Goodbye.""
[deleted]|Our ward is very big. So we can accommodate the ENTS according to the standards of the National Ent Health Association (NEHA).
I lost my smell completely due to COVID about 2 months ago .. it has returned to about 40%. At what point do I give up on it healing all the way?|I wouldn't give up. It may take a lot of time. You can try to improve the process by using oil nasal sprays.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|&amp;#x200B;
I'm using a saline spray, should I switch to oil? Also thank you!!!|You should try oil. Both are fine, but maybe oil is better for you. Trying it out won't hurt you.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|&amp;#x200B;
Could you recommend what to look for in an oil nasal spray? I’ve never considered one and I’m seeing quite a few choices.|Look for dexpanthenol. The remaining ingredient don't matter too much.
Is the removal of swollen/enlarged turbinates an effective treatment, or do patients usually don't report that they can breathe better after removal? Are there any cons to remove them? Edit: I also have had a weird feeling at the back of my nose/throat since December. It's as if something is stuck in there. An ENT specialist checked it for me and found nothing. I still feel it though. What could be the possible causes?|1) You shouldn't remove the turbinates since they help to improve the air flow through your nose. However, you can reduce them. In fact, when doing nasal surgery in patients with problems breathing through the nose we almost always make the turbinates smaller. If done right, there is no major downside.
&amp;#x200B;|2) Hard to say something about that without checking myself. Maybe your nose is too dry. Try oil nasal spray.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|&amp;#x200B;
Thanks! So would burning the turbinates be the same as reducing them? (my first language isn't English so I don't know if burning is the correct word)|&amp;#x200B;Yes. Essentially, they get burned and by doing so they get smaller.
How often after an hpv polyp is removed from the esophagus does it recur as cancer, and is there a correlation or increased risk with persons who have viral issues such as HS2 or EBV? Thank you.|We don't do too much cancer surgery (we are sending patients with cancer to the nearest university hospital). So, unfortunately, I don't have any personal experiences on that. I am sorry.
[removed]|About 4800 per month (because of taxes my real income is about 60% of that).
&amp;#x200B;|13 years of school, 6 years of university. Basically free expect a small fee for university (about 250 Euros per 6 months).
What's the latest you've seen someone have a full recovery from Sudden Hearing Loss? I live in Berlin and lost my hearing in my left ear in December. The German doctors tell me there's hope for recovery up to 6 months, but the NIH website says it's a lost cause after 4 weeks.|Did you get any treatment so far? 6 months can be possible, but if your hearing hasn't change for 4 weeks, chances are low.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|&amp;#x200B;
Oral cortisone for 10 days, then IV cortisone for a week, then 3 cortisone shots directly in the ear. No improvement after 3 months :(|Seems like the doctors did what they could. I feel sorry for you. However, hearing aids are really great nowadays. If your hearing is still not good after 6 months, give those a try!
Hello colleague! German internal medicine resident. In the city where I studied in, ENT residency was surprisingly competitive given that there was only one department and they had only few new residents per year. What's your view: How competitive is ENT for applicants who are geographically flexible?|I think it is better over here in Hessen. There are many hospitals with ENT departments (I know of Frankfurt, Darmstadt, Hanau, Mainz, Marburg, Gießen, Rüsselsheim and Fulda) so it isn't too hard to get a job.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|&amp;#x200B;
Good to know. I'm hoping to find a spot in NRW or southern germany. Do you have any opinion/experience with german graduates from eastern european med schools?|I don't have any personal experience with that. But in the end a lot comes down to your attitude and how willing you are to learn stuff.
Two questions first what's the best way to treat ent rot? Second question where did the entwives go?|1) You need to use fertilizer. Orc poo is awesome for that!
&amp;#x200B;|2) Please see an Ent gynecologist for that problem.
Hi I’ve always had tinnitus. I had gromitts as a toddler. What I wanted to ask is about the sound. When I clench my jaw or move my jaw around, I can change the intensity of my left ears tinnitus and so I wondered if there is any research on this? I don’t feel it is from ear damage but maybe the nerve in jaw?|Diseases of the temporomandibular joint can cause tinnitus. You should see a orthodontist to check on that.
Do you have any advice for Foreign doctors who wants to practice their profession in Germany?|The most difficult part probably is learning German as the language isn't easy. Maybe apply for an internship (for like 1 month) to see if you like it here. Most people can speak English, so you should be fine for the internship.
How does it feel to be a walking tree surgeon?|Mighty
what newer advice would you give professional singers on voice care?|Don't use too much force. Some people use a lot of force when talking and singing. You can produce a loud voice without stressing your vocal chords too much. A speech therapist can help you with that.

Lol you should watch the video dude, it's a joke.|My answer was meant as a joke as well. Seems like my joke was bad.
So I wear a CPAP and it has done wonders for me, and almost done with it in a few months. Having said this I still can't breath at the same rate through both of my nostrils..almost like one is just getting a little less air. Now if I push my nose to one side it opens up the passages and I can breathe fine out of said nostril. I've seen doctors and specialists and just getting tired of the constant tests and referrals and have a few that I give value to. If I get the surgery where they break my nose and re-set it.. How painful is it? How long is the recovery time? Assume it's a general anaesthetic? Edit: The advice that I got from a doctor that I truly trust was lose weight and stop smoking (both of which I am doing quite well - totally done smoking and weight will take time). I assume that surgery should be the last and final option.|Congratulations for quitting smoking. I am sure you will also manage the weight loss! The surgery sounds more painful than it is. Don't worry. But as you said, maybe you won't need it anyway.
Do you have any knowledge or experience with tinnitus? I developed tinnitus in my right ear 6 months ago. First of all I tried a general doctor who prescribed me medication for blood pressure (didn’t help). Then I went to see an ENT specialist who went down much the same route (so not really helping). Then I decided to see a dentist and it’s possible that I have somatosensory tinnitus, I currently receive physiotherapy treatment to help relax the muscles in my head and jaw. My symptoms do point towards somatosensory tinnitus since i do not have any hearing loss and I have a history of TMJ issues. But I also get the feeling there might be something else going on. For instance my right ear “feels” different inside. Before my right ear would “pop” when I swallowed, but now that doesn’t happen so frequently. I am tempted to try another doctor to explain all this to see if there is more to explore in my middle ear/eustachian tube. If you had any thoughts that would be great.|Do you experience hearing loss on that ear as well?
^(the below is a reply to the above)|&amp;#x200B;
No, I’ve had two tests now and my hearing is perfect.|Try practicing the Valsalva's maneuver. If that doesn't work, dilating the Eustachian tube or Tinnitracks might also be valid options depending on the results of a proper examination.
Why can't I smell anything? Had a surgery (nasal septum) few years ago but it didn't change anything. Is there any advice that you can give me?|You should probably see another ENT surgeon. Sometimes a surgery isn't successful (for whatever reason). Then it could be necessary to get another surgery done.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|&amp;#x200B;
I had two surgeries for the same reason. If i remember correct he said that there is an anatomical anomaly. Do you know what this anomaly is called?|Probably either a [nasal septum deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_septum_deviation) and/or too big [nasal conchae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_concha).
Do you prescribe T3 for thyroid patients?|No, we don't. Since treating thyroid diseases isn't trivial, it should be done by a physician who specialized in nuclear medicine.
After a suicide attempt at 19 (now 22) my throat got completely fucked, my trachea is completely shattered and I have a tube on it to hold everything in place, one of my vocal chords is almost paralyzed and the other isn't as bad but still isn't doing too well. Every few months I go back to the hospital to remove the tube to check if my trachea holds and also to avoid the plastic from sticking to my tissue. From what I understand the main issue about me is my youth, the scarring happens way too fast and so it doesn't actually repair correctly. My doctor really cares about my case but even then there either isn't much hope to being tube-free again or technology isn't advanced enough to swiftly fix this. Can you confirm this? And can you give your opinion? I can go more indepth about my case if need be|First things first: I am glad to you are still. Life can be beautiful and even if times are rough, things will get better eventually. At the moment there is no reliable way to replace a severely damaged larynx. However, from a medical standpoint it is a great time to be alive because technology advances really, really fast. So I am optimistic that there will be a fix in a not too far away future.

What are seriously ill patients on the ENT ward? Do you have your own ICU or are ENT patients who need intensive care treated separately?|On our ward we treat patients with infections of the inner ear or mastoid, severe dizziness, abscesses,...
&amp;#x200B;|We don't have our own ICU. We got a pediatric ICU and an ICU run by anesthesiologists.
How long have you been an ENT surgeon and how many surgeries have you done since?|I'm a resident in my 3rd year. I'm in the OR once a week and perform about 5 surgeries on that day. I also do smaller surgeries under local anesthesia on the other days. When I started working at the hospital, I was in the OR almost daily to learn some ""beginner friendly"" surgeries.
Are you part of an on-call system responsible for the COVID-19 ward, or is this a ward specifically led by ENT surgeons?|We have an on-call system for the Covid-19 ward.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|&amp;#x200B;
So you are not an ENT surgeon but an ENT surgeon in training, correct? Considering you’re giving out a lot of medical advice on this thread, it would be good to be upfront about this. Your translation of ‘Head doctor’ is misleading to people not familiar with the German system.|I edited my initial post to make people more aware of that. Thanks for the suggestion.
Are you married? On a serious note what made you want to specialise in ENT? Also how old were you when you graduated high school before attending University? Thanks!|Not yet, but I do have a girlfriend. ENT is just very diversified. I see male and female patients, patients of every age (since we have a pediatric ICU some of my patients are a few days old) and treatments range from simple antibiotics to complex surgeries.

Do you encounter patients with BPPV often? I was diagnosed with it a couple years ago while I was traveling in Hungary and I've always been curious how often ENT doctors come across it, since I was fortunate to be diagnosed in the ER and have been able to manage it pretty well on my own since then, so I've never been to an ENT for it.|I see a patient with BBPV weekly, it's pretty common.
[deleted]|If the frequency of the ringing is always the same, try Tinnitracks (google it). Also, you should see a doctor to exclude a vestibular schwannoma (a rare, benign brain tumor).
I went to a German ENT (I am American living in Germany) to get a refill of my cpap supplies given to me by a sleep specialist in the US. The ENT looked in my nose, declared I probably didnt need the CPAP and that he will perform a procedure to fix something in my nose. He gave me some nasal sprays and told me to come back in 3 months after baby is born (Im 8 months pregnant too). Any idea what procedure he could be talking about? My German is limited in medical terms so I didnt get the full picture.|Seems like he wants to fix your deviated nasal septum and reduce the size of your turbinates. It is a small surgical procedure and might really help you.
Is there such a thing as permanently swollen tonsils? Like chronically?|Yes, tonsils can get too big chronically. For example that can happen, if you have a lot of infections of the tonsils. When tonsils are so big, that they are touching each other, they are called ""[kissing tonsils](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ahmed-Al-Abbasi/publication/319877122/figure/fig11/AS:539867224305665@1505725784925/Figureshows-kissing-tonsils.png)"".
I snore like a monstertruck and wake myself up during the night. Is it a common thing to do surgery to fix really bad snoring?|Before thinking about surgery a full ENT examination and a sleep study should be done. In many cases, a surgery can fix (or at least reduce) your snoring habits. We perform that surgery regularly and most patients are happy with it.
I feel like there is fluid leaking out my ear. What is the overlap between that and vertigo?|A hole in your eardrum can lead to infections of the inner ear. Go see an ENT surgeon!
My dog hit the end of my nose with his wrecking-ball sized head. It hurt like hell, but didn't bleed and after 5mins was fine. I later noticed the forward half is slightly crooked. I laughed it off and assumed it would go back to normally eventually.... 2 months later and it's still crooked. I'm permanently disfigured now, aren't I?|If your nose is broken, the bones start to heal after about one week. So if you don't get surgery before that, your nose will stay like it is. However, the tip of your nose is made of cartilage. So maybe your nose wasn't broken after all. An easy surgery could fix your problem.
How often do you see Tullio phenomenon in head trauma patients? Or is it often something else? (Currently awaiting a CT and MRI and this is one of the things they're looking for, suffered trauma to the left side of my head.

It is a pretty rare disease.
I have an unusual question. Have you ever had a patient complain about strange symptoms happening with their eyes/ears after a sinus infection? I have issues where I can HEAR when I blink (the noise I presume it would make in my ears), when I move my eyes left to right and up and down (scrolling on my phone for example) I can hear the eye movements in my ears. I've been to an eye specialist and he laughed it off and diagnosed it as migraines (because I also had blurred vision and vertigo as a direct result of the sinus infection - trying to work at my computer screen when I should have been resting). I have had far few tests to rule out eye issues so I'm booked into see an ENT next week but would love your professional opinion in the meantime. I have constantly crackling in my ears (2 months later) and the sounds of my eyes in my ears has finally gone away even though I currently have another sinus infection. The initial sinus infection was end of December and the symptoms were present for atleast 6 weeks! Thank you Edit: I'm also not able to equalise/pop my ears when I hold my nose and blow.....|The bone between the orbita (the cave of your eye) and the nose and nasal sinuses is very thin. So I think that could be possible. A proper ENT examination and probably a CT scan should help to say more.
[removed]|Hello there, just uploaded a proof of my claim (via cognitoforms).
Kevin, I was always wondering about the relationship between doctors and the insurance in Germany. Is it true that there is an issue with lack of financing (especially for more mundane stuff) and that you are subject to certain quotas and if you exhaust the quota you will get written up by the health provider? I am a German citizen myself, and I never had any particular issues with the German healthcare system, but after I moved to Switzerland I was really surprised how much quicker everything moves down here.|That really is a problem. Another example: If a patient is in hospital, we get a fixed amount of money for that patient (depend on the disease he has). But only if he stays for a certain minimum amount of days and isn't staying longer than a certain maximal amount of days. So if he stays too short or too long, we get less money. That can be a problem if a patient feels better very fast or takes longer to get better.
I have a hole in my eardrum; had tympanostomy tubes in the 80's, and they never healed. Doctor realized years into it, pulled them out, left ear never healed up. So, I had a paper patch, that failed. Tried again, years later, failed. Had another procedure with tissue from my earlobe put in, also failed. The last remaining option in the states is to peel up my ear, patch *behind* the eardrum, pack with cotton, and reassemble. Problem is that seems likely (10%?) to seriously affect my sense of taste. Any odds of better surgeries coming down the line, or anything weird in that because of the US healthcare system being, well, what is is, for better and worse?|We perform that surgery regularly and 10% seems very low. You might want to make an appointment at another hospital.
I have an annoying dry cough. It's worse when I'm in a stuffy room with no fan running, or when there's a lot of steam like after a shower. Throughout the day, I will cough randomly. It's always bothered me because I don't want people to think I'm sick, but it's worse during these covid times. Don't want people thinking I'm sick and infectious. I spent a year or so with local doctors trying to figure it out. We did asthma tests, allergy tests, tried steroids, and we even did surgery to try and deal with my gerd. Eventually the doctors started repeating tests and it became too expensive, even with insurance, so I stopped. Any suggestions on next steps to work on a resolution?|Are you experiencing postnasal drip?

My friend is getting surgery on her throat next week to remove a growth on her thyroid. They don’t know if it’s cancer and she is really scared.

Have you ever had any patients with sleep apnea who have (wrongly) received an ADHD diagnosis?

I have a pretty large lipoma (I hope) under my trapezius muscle. My doctors have not decided which kind or surgeon should take this out ENT, orthopedic, or general. What do you think?|I'd say orthopedic. None of the ENT surgeons I know has performed surgery at that location.
Any tips on tonsil stone prevention?|To be honest: None. There just is no useful method other than a surgical removal of the tonsils. And that option should only be considered if your tonsil stones lead to complications (e.g. very bad breath).

Hi I’m considering ENT as an option for residency. Unfortunately our ENT rotation was halted by COVID, so I had a few questions That I hope you could help with? 1) How is your day to day structured? And how is the balance between ward:clinics:surgical exposure as a resident?|8-9 AM: Seeing the patients on my ward and getting things done. Afterwards consultation hours in our doctor's office. Between patients I regularly go to the ward and see if everything is alright. I'm in the OR once a week.

3) Which aspects do you love the most about your specialty and why did you choose it? Thank you so much!|Different patients and treatment options. Patients of every gender and age and so many options to treat them from antibiotics to complex surgeries.
I had an MRI for another issue and it showed a cyst in my right sinus and thickening in my sinuses. It's been years now and I haven't had it removed. Is a cyst the same as a polyp? Could this be dangerous for me or turn cancerous? I have severe allergies and have been using nasal spray for 15 years. I never had allergies before several years of nasal spray use. I now use flonase and claritin which helps a lot. I used to have to use the afrin several times a day but now I only use it once a day. My right ear leaks fluid and itches all the time. It's the same side as the cyst. I'm guessing this is probably the cause of all my problems but can surgery make me normal again? Sorry for so many questions.|A zyst is filled with fluid, a polyp isn't. Some benign tumors can become malign. So if it doesn't get smaller with steroid nasal spray, surgery might be a good option for you.
I've gotten the green light to have a tympanoplasty done to restore some of my hearing at a ENT clinic in Munich. However, I ended up not doing it due to lack of support from my family. Sibling and father with similar ossimilation issue (but not same) in the ear, had procedures done and it ended up badly for both. Brother lost complete hearing on one side, because of damaged ear nerves inflicted in the surgery. So two questions. Do you think tympanoplasties are becoming safer (e.g. advancement in technology)? Approaching age 30, is there a time where it would be too late to get the procedure done?|1) Tympanoplasties are pretty safe today. If you are unsure if Munich is the right hospital for you, the university hospital of Würzburg is very good as well. 2) As long as your body is fit enough for anesthesia, you are fine. The surgery isn't very stressful.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|&amp;#x200B;
Thanks for the response. I'm actually now residing in NRW. Anything around that area you'd recommend too? My brother got the procedure done at the UKD Düsseldorf. So I'm steering clear of that one. That's another question. I hear the procedure can be done with local anesthesia, however I feel like that's more typical in the US from what I read. In Germany they prefer full anesthesia? I'd prefer with local or doesn't that make much sense?|Personally I would prefer full anesthesia. Even if you won't feel pain you will hear some nasty noises. I haven't heard a lot of Düsseldorf but you can also take a look at Lübeck.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|&amp;#x200B;
With local I thought there would be a benefit of giving immediate feedback to the surgeon if the process is ""working"". I think I'd personally handle it. Had some other procedures done with local anesthesia, and shouldn't be worse then the noises from the dentist I hope. But I'll reconsider it. Thanks. Will also look into Lübeck.|You likely won't be able to give immediate feedback as your ear will be filled with blood (sounds worse than it is).

(This is a question specific to the German system) Have you already or do you plan on writing a thesis? When do you feel is the best time to do so, during or after medical school? Do you think it is necessary to do so in the first place, as in whether adding ""Dr."" to your name nowadays has a significant influence on your career?|I did a experimental thesis because I was unsure if I wanted to work in clinics or in research. If you want to write a thesis, do it during medical school. You won't have time and/or motivation afterwards. Most hospitals don't require you to be a ""Doctor"" anymore. However, if you can see yourself working at a university hospital, they probably want you to have that title.
Is there such a thing as too small nostrils? I noticed that I can't breathe through my nose even after I lost weight. Sometimes better, and they try to tell me I just need saline nose spray or a capillar constrictor nasal spray that would be addictive in the long run. Neither of them works. I don't have polips, and the two sides are symmetrically not working most of the time. Sometimes one side feels clogged, sometimes the other. Engineering wise, I'd like to get larger diameter intakes and pipes.. Is this possible?|Yes, that is totally possible. You should see an ENT surgeon as he can do some tests to check that.
Whenever I yawn, my ears “pop” and then I have to sniff to “unpop” them. The same happens when I talk to someone, or give a presentation. I end up sniffing a lot as if I’m sick.

I am in California, US and about to get a turbinate reduction via microdebrider. I've been reading and have talked to my doctor a lot about empty nose syndrome, which I'm terrified of. He reassured me, but I'm still anxious. Do you do this procedure often in Germany? Is it considered safe and empty nose syndrome discussed with patients? Thanks!|We perform this surgery on a daily basis and I wouldn't be afraid. Empty nose syndrome occurs if the surgeon removes too much of your turbinates. But that rarely happens (never seen it so far).
I was recently told by my ENT that I have a deviated septum. Is that something that can form/happen over time? Or is it something that I could've had since I was a child but never diagnosed with? What is the surgery/recovery time for a fixing a deviated septum? Thanks for your time!|Could be both. It is a small surgery that might be possible to be done as outpatient surgery (or 1-2 nights in hospital). Recovery time can take from 1-6 months (but after 1 week you should feel really fine. It just takes a bit time to be fully healed).
I just got a diagnosis of a severely deviated septum and my doctor wants to correct it surgically. I've been having issues with mild sleep apnea and have not been able to fall asleep with a CPAP machine on. Basically I'm a little nervous about having the surgery and want to know how many people on average report better sleep and more energy after having septum surgery?|We perform this kind of surgery 2-4 times a day and most patients are very happy afterwards.

I have developed a habit of using earbuds since my childhood. I feel itching in my ears and liquid get out of my ears. What should I do?|If your eardrums are intact (let a doctor check that), you can use 1-2 drops of olive oil every evening. It prevents itchy ear canals.

I've had terrible nasal polyps / sinusitis for 15 years and four surgeries, how can I prevent the polyps from returning forever? I've changed my occupation, irrigate my sinuses daily, etc..|You probably need to use a steroid nasal spray for the rest of your life. Talk about that with your physician.
Is sinus surgery risky? I have severe polyps &amp; my sinuses have complete opacification.|Depends on which sinuses are affected and on your individual anatomy. Sinus surgery isn't easy but often not too hard either. However, you should see a surgeon who performs this type of surgery on a daily basis.

My FYP is 1 semester long and my internship is 6 months FT until Dec in FMCG.

I wanted to know how the experience was like for you guys, was it very hectic? Or quite mangeable? 

I’m asking because I was planning to also take another minor 3K mod alongside so that I don’t have to overload in my final semester next year — but I’m not sure whether it’ll be too much HAHA 

Would appreciate if anyone has any advice on this! ☺️ thanks so much &amp; hope y’all are safe"

I live in Australia. I got lucky and have recently started on an internship with a well known company contracted by a big supermarket as an Operations Support Analyst for the online delivery app.The job is more advanced than just help-desk. Its level 2 support and incident response but with a lot of SQL related to wave management, I also use some basic Splunk and AppDynamics.

Before this I have had one year solid experience in GIS and used python and SQL on the job regularly. I am self learning javascript, just finished learning vanilla js and moving onto react now. I have also messed around with webGL for my dissertation to create 3d web maps.

I do like GIS and coding and have been working towards a 'GIS Developer' position, but after landing this internship it feels like I can open more doors and a lot of areas like cloud, devops and frontend development that seem to pay a lot more and I find it interesting. Except database administration, that's a bit too much fir me lol. Feel like I am jack of very unrelated trades and master at something I am losing interest it. I will graduate soon and have to decide between continuing in a full time role or looking for something more GIS related. If I continue will it be possible for me to jump into Cloud over the next year or two by grabbing the right certifications and some self learning? It seems like the company allows some room for growth but I cant expect much. What other possible IT paths can I take based on this (Other than database stuff )? Can I wiggle my way into a more APM role? Or am I looking at this completely wrong? Any advice? Thanks!!"

Knowing that, I want to follow my current will, which is to start a junior position as a Go developper, but almost all of my internships and personal projects experiences are in python. I really like this language and I will probably eventually want to come back to do some python professionally.

I am wondering if trying to stay with one tech, or a smaller tech stack is a common strategy to have more leverage for the relevant positions and to be considered a more senior person in this tech (e.g: some company will say they want a Senior Python Dev, so they ask for 5-7 years of professional python development)

Would it be hurtful for my career growth to diversify and get some golang experience if I want to eventually be that python senior developer? 
Do most people try to stay with a single tech ? A small set of tech ? Or is it ok to go with whatever tech you feel like doing at the time and/or what a particular job needs you to do ?

At the moment i am just thinking of being a backend dev with knowledge in both python and golang. And maybe brush on my frontend skills eventually to maybe do full-stack. But I am wondering if it might be too much ?

ov39ew,2,2021-07-31,From software engineer to ?,takanoha,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ov39ew/from_software_engineer_to/,"Hi I am trying to figure out what I want to do (job wise) an did someone could give me suggestions I appreciated it. 

I studied Electrical Engineering for my Bachelors and after my internship as a software engineer I had decided to stick to it instead of looking for a job in the EE field. Since my intern days it's been 10 years in the tech industry. I didn't expect every job I have had so far lasted only around 2 years; laid off twice, left with my own will once and contracts ended. 

Time passed so quickly and looking back what I had done I am not fully convinced this is how I want to live for the next 10 years. Knowing how volatile the tech companies are it's inevitable not to experience layoffs but it's been too unstable. As much as I enjoy solving problems I have been thinking about looking for alternatives other than working as a software engineer for my career. In the big picture engineers are not different from ""koma"" in Japanese shogi. Players in this context they are entrepreneurs or executives in the corporate world move ""koma"" in this context software engineers to make their business successful. There is no emotions at a time of making sacrifices. I have been hurt a handful of times and the most recent was a case when my colleague passed there was non-emotional care offered from the company but laid me off because of the decline of the business due to covid. 

Anyways nowadays there is no such thing as a stable job but I want a steady job so maybe PMs or Manager level work may be a little more promising than working as a software engineer. It seems to me that those who have a privilege to make a business direction get to choose who is to keep and who is to leave. After 10 years of my experience in the field I have seen this trend. 

My question is other than moving up the corporate ladder how do I do this ? Will MBA be helpful ?


Thanks."
ov3skm,12,2021-07-31,Unsure if I should stay SDET or switch,lncognito_Mode,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ov3skm/unsure_if_i_should_stay_sdet_or_switch/,"Lately I have been heavily debating and stressing over whether or not I should think about a career change.

I am a 24m that graduated a year ago. Thanks to my internship experience, I was able to land a job at a mid sized company and become the lead software developer in test over there, kickstarting their test automation effort and writing a selenium + cypress framework from scratch with jenkins integration. Since then, the company has hired 4-5 SDETs including myself and I am in charge of all QA automation projects over here. I consider the pay pretty good for my age and location (100k+ in Montreal), but lately I've been feeling less and less motivated for work due to a few reasons that I will list below


1. Although I enjoy having a lead position, I find myself teaching more than I learn, and I am afraid of falling behind on my skills. Also, the people I teach are often way older than I am (mid 30s to mid 40s) and I find myself teaching people who are supposed to be more experienced than me and who are paid more than me stuff that I feel like they should know with their experience level (ex: git, coding principles, or just straight up being independent and googling stuff instead of asking 100 questions). This creates a mental imbalance because I am the one who does the most technical coding and holds the team together, but get paid less simply because I have less years of experience.


2. I have no direct control over the code. I have set up an extensive test coverage and have good success catching most bugs prior to production environment, but lately since the product website itself is inconsistent and slow, my tests have become flaky and slower as well. This leads to a tedious process of finding out if each fail is a real bug or a false-positive, and many reruns. I have brought up the decaying quality of our product many times to the devs, but they are unable to fix the source problem and often suggest I find other ways to ""skip"" the shaky steps, which doesn't make sense to me since it's a band aid over the real problem. All in all, the devs here have gotten quite complacent and are more focused on delivering anything at all than delivering quality, which in turns hurts the performance of my own tests. I don't enjoy not being able to directly change things and fix the bugs I find. 


3. I feel like SDETs are often frowned upon by the devs as being the ""lesser"" of two roles. Lesser importance, lesser pay. This in itself is not much of a problem, but I'm also starting to notice that a lot of companies don't have dedicated SDET roles anymore. Instead, they want devs that can write tests. I dont believe it's a good practice, but that's what the industry seems to shift towards. Also, SDET is a support role; a company will always hire devs before SDETs, and I am afraid that our position will become increasingly harder to find a job for as years go by. 


For all the reasons above, I have been thinking whether or not I want to shift to Dev or DevOps. I am worried because I am good at what I do, and changing fields would mean letting go of my experience and ""advantage"" and learning new tools and frameworks. I'd probably sacrifice my wage and go back to being a junior. One interesting idea I have though, is to learn to do DevOps and become a hybrid between test automation and devops, a ""TestOps"". It seems like a natural progression since a SDET often needs a DevOps to help him setup the tests in a container and set up automated runs in the CICD pipeline, so a TestOps can do all that by himself and be the ""go-to"" guy for all things automation. In short, my options are either staying SDET and hopefully become a manager down the road, expand to devops to become a ""TestOps"", switch to Dev or even work towards being a PO. 

I know it's quite a read but ultimately, I'd love some feedback and guidance and hopefully start an engaging discussion, let me know if you agree with the things I've said and what you think my best options are. Thanks."
ov45da,1,2021-07-31,Interning literal integers,schoolcoders,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/ov45da/interning_literal_integers/,"I believe the standard Python implementation interns values between -5 and +256, so in this case

    a = 10
    b = 10
    c = 5+5

a, b and c would all contain the same object because the value 10 has been interned.

But in this case:

    a = 1000
    b = 1000
    c = 500+500

a and b contain the same object, but c contains a different object. Presumably this is because literal integers get interned in a similar way to strings?

Does anyone have a link to where this might be described? I realise it might be different for different implementations/versions of python."

So I have an offer to join the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) as a Signals Officer which I have until next Wednesday, August 4 to accept. I’m extremely excited for this opportunity and have been preparing for it the past few months. The military lifestyle intrigues me very much and is something I wanted to experience. However, I just recently (few days ago) got accepted into the International Space University (ISU) in France for my Masters in Space Studies. With my background in Aerospace Engineering - Space, this would be a great opportunity as well. It is my career goal to one day work in the Space Industry and I was hoping to get involved with the Space Sector within the CAF later on in my career. It would not be 100% possible to do so, but it was something I would work towards. On the other hand, at the end of the ISU Masters program, I would get the opportunity to have a 3 month Internship with a Space organization such as NASA or the European Space Agency, which would be very valuable. This internship is the main selling point for me personally attending the ISU.

Now the part where I’m stuck at is on what to do. I really wanted to join the CAF, but this Masters is also a great opportunity. Obviously, it boils down to more schooling which I would have to pay Tuition for, or on the other hand a stable full time job with the CAF with good salary. Tuition wise, I am being provided with a half scholarship, which is a great help as my Tuition is only half the normal amount. The other main concern I have, is on completing my Masters in such a specific field being Space Studies. One of my concerns is that it will limit me to only Space Jobs in the future, which is my dream sector to work in, but it seems like a very risky route to take. If anyone has any sort of advice on try situation, I would greatly appreciate it!

I'll get my degree in two years with little *work* experience:

* Real-world company project (with \~3 teammates)
* Personal student project (\~ 180 hours)
* Internship
* Master thesis

I said I’d update my profile when my next SAT score showed up… instead I waited for my AP’s to get here too, and now here I am a day or two before applications open to see how good my chance is for sure.

Intended Computer Science Major aiming for good colleges.

Demographics: White (Middle Eastern) Male, applying from NY public school (can’t reveal it but it’s top 10 in the state). No hooks

Intended Major: Computer Science

ACT/SAT: 1520 (780 Math, 750 English), and 1530 (800 Math, 730 ERW) 

Superscore: 1550 (800 Math, 750 English)

UW/W GPA: (98.80%) 4.0/4.36 (My school doesn’t provide a weighted GPA, so I calculated it based on my AP classes, I wasn’t sure if some of my classes counted as honours so I didn’t factor that in.)

Rank: N/A (School doesn’t rank)

Coursework: 5 AP’s (I took max AP’s I could in Sophomore and Junior year) and 2 Dual Enrollment classes

Sophomore Year (Secerely reduced AP exams)
AP World History (3, I got really unlucky with the SINGLE question the test was reduced to)
AP Physics 1: (4)

Junior: 
AP Computer Science (4)
AP Calculus BC (5)
   —AP Calc AB subscore (5)
AP US History (4)

“AP” Russian (really the NEWL exam) = 4.

Dual enrollment:
College Russian 
Forensics

Senior Course Load: Results not out yet but I’m guaranteed Multivariable Calc, and have a fairly high chance at a few AP’s like AP Physics 2 and AP US History and Gov.

Awards:
-Some local/regional track and field medals/awards
-AP Scholar with distinction

Extracurriculars:

-Inducted into NHS but no leadership

-JV Track and Field (mainly Cross Country and Steeple in Outdoor track) for all years of HS. Pretty sure I’m running Varsity this year but my school only opened sports back up a week ago.

-Internship in the summer before Sophomore year, as an IT assistant, about 40 hours of it were unpaid extra work that the school counted as volunteer work.

-Worked as an IT assistant throughout sophomore year (COVID sorta put an end to that when we went remote)

-I’m a deacon at my local church and spend 2-4 hours a week at least (not sure if that counts)

- Full Stack development of a school related website from scratch in a small group. Has already been hosted on a domain and work on it is finished up. I mainly worked on backend but have recently had to make a few changes on the CMS, and quite as the amount of work in the frontend fixing errors and applying API calls. Also made a couple of components in our component library.

-A Paid internship with my school this summer where we’ve continued development from my AP Comp Sci class since it’s a pretty important website. Same teacher as the IT internship but with a lot more coding than IT.

-A very large coding hobby, have a ton of udemy courses bought for everything from React/MongoDB websites to Udemy courses for Unity and 2D game development.

-It I had to make a list of my coding languages they would be

Very good: HTML, and CSS (although my color schemes always suck so I’m relegated to back end), Javascript, Typescript, 

Decent: Vue, Nuxt. (Not as much use for them outside error handling, but over the last few weeks I’ve used them so much I might be able to get away with saying I’m very good or at least good with them)

Passable: Tailwind CSS (I mean Tailwind is basically just a CSS framework but it’s complex enough on its own I count it as basically it’s own coding language), C++ (Used to be really good at it but haven’t had much practice in a long time)

I’m trying to learn Python via Udemy and boost my C++ by next School Year so maybe I can put them somewhere on my application? 

Letters of Rec: 

I got my Sophomore AP World History teacher for it, she knows me well and despite my AP grade she knows I was probably among the best students in her class with a lot of participation etc. I’d expect at least a 7/10 - 8/10 essay from her.

My Computer Science teacher, he knows me super well since I’ve worked for him basically continuously since Sophomore year and I’ve had him every year of my high school career.  I have a feeling I can expect a top tier admission essay of at least 9/10. 

My Counselor Essay is probably not going to be the best, I don’t know her well, and she doesn’t know me well either. I’ve met her like 5-6 times ever and only for a handful of minutes. I’m expecting an average essay of 5-6/10

Essays:
I’m a pretty decent writer so I feel confident that given enough time I can write some good essays. I’ve already started a few supplemental essays for some of my lower choices to get the hang of it.

I don’t want to pretend to be fake humble and say anything here is bad or something, however T20’s are on a whole other level and my AP’s and awards in particular get me nervous (Only one 5, and basically a single award) so I’d like an accurate assessment of my chances. 

Reach: MIT (top choice), Caltech, Harvard, Yale, Carnegie Mellon, Columbia, Dartmouth, Brown

Lower Reaches: UPenn, Tufts, University of Virginia, Vanderbilt, Georgetown university, and Cornell 

Target: Northeastern, Gatech, NYU, Boston University

Safety: Rensselaer Polytechnic University and Rochester institute of technology, and maybe a state school.


Any help would be appreciated!"

I got an email from them saying I have been selected for Brainnest Junior Business Analyst Programme. There is an 129 euro fee for the 1 month programme, which is dodgy firstly.

I genuinely can't tell if this is a real legit company or not. I went on Linkedln and all the new internship trainees start on July 2021, a little dodgy. I cant find any evidence of them working with any of their partners shown on their website, some big names like EY. Its supposed to be a German company, I searched for it and could find no registered company  under that name in Germany, again dodgy!! 

It has 14,000+ followers on Linkedln though. Website seems dodgy also. 



Can anyone tell me if this is a legitimate company or some dodgy money making scheme of some sort."
ov9vqf,18,2021-07-31,relapsing thoughts,MilkyPothole,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ov9vqf/relapsing_thoughts/,"about 2 months ago I was in my car driving to the edge of a cliff that's well known in my town for the fact that 6 people (and a dog?) have committed suicide by jumping off of. Before I could, I got a few calls in the car, and ended up going to a mental health Rehabilitation facility instead. it was nice there but it felt like I was in a cage and I ended up leaving my program early.

i went into PHP and everything was going alright, ups and downs of course but generally, I felt like I was getting better. I went back to work at my part-time job i literally couldn't afford not to go back to. its at a movie theater and cleaning up after the hedonistic slobs that leave their shit in the theater didn't help me.

I'm also a pot smoker, up until lately because now i don't have two nickels to rub together. so the thing that i was using to numb the pain is outside of my reach (i cant drink) and i feel shitty asking to use other people's supply.

it feels like the only people who would notice if i killed myself are my boyfriend and my dog. and even with them, i can never fully enjoy my time because of the major depressive disorder and anxiety, I'm medicated and it helps a bit but i feel like I'm the problem. I feel like I'm dragging down my boys mood constantly and making him support me more than any reasonable partner should.

talking to people doesnt help me, my automatic defenses kick in of feeling like a burden and so i pretend everything is alright. im really good at pretending now.

I tried to plan ahead for the future to give myself something to hold on to, but everywhere i go to apply for college loans would rather i do kill myself than give me a loan without a cosigner. and the people who i would ask to cosign are to busy being as actively neglectful as they have been for the last 20 years. So i'm probably about to get dropped from any of my future hopes of doing what i would want to with life.

For a few days I had an internship in the field I want to work in, but I got let go from that after my second day working

Last night i cut again for the first time since i went to rehab, it felt good. i feel guilty knowing people might find out and give me those pity/ dissapointment eyes, but it still feels good. the sting."

I just finished my AAS in integrated engineering, and I was planning to get a BAS in mechanical engineering there. So with an extremely short notice I had to start looking for a BA program in a place that would not be too far nor too expensive from my family (my immigration story is a big fucking jumbled mess). I found a community college that was not too far from where I live and they had similar prices to my previous college. They have the MEMS program which I liked when I read it, but when I asked my advisor he told me that he had heard from some of his friends that had taken similar programs that it was not the best. I do not recall the reason, but what he saw that he liked was that there are paid internships every semester of the BA program. Here is a brief description of the program: 

The new bachelor of applied science in microelectronic manufacturing is an industry-tailored, hands-on program with core content in Printed Circuit Board (PCB) and microelectronic manufacturing, design, assembly and prototyping with additional content in quality, electronics and drafting. Building on the associate of applied science in MEMS, the bachelor’s degree program will develop your knowledge in computer science, electronics, soldering, chemistry and mechanics and teaches you to perform work on a microscopic scale. 

&amp;#x200B;

It also says that they have partnered with 30 different companies for the internships. 

If anyone has had any experience with this program I would like to know your opinions, and if it is not the best BA program, what could be a good degree to pair it with?  Would it be wise to get a minor in physics?  

I know the way I went about it is not the best, but I was put in a terrible situation due to events outside my control. I had to choose something that could keep me in the US with all its shitty infrastructure lol

This may be too much, but I also feel very unprepared because I feel like I learned very little from my integrated engineering degree. I wish I could be working in the industry but the nature of international student immigration policy does not allow me to do that easily, and companies where I live do not have much experience with immigration paperwork. I have nearly zero experience.

Even if you just read this, thank you!"

In my spare time (\~8 hours during the summer), I like to find projects that I'm interested in, and make contributions to that project. I also like to create many OSS applications. Anyway, I recently got a nice internship (paid), but didn't find myself as interested in the work (Web Dev) as I thought. It's still a really fun internship, don't get me wrong, but I prefer to be working on these systems applications. My two problems are that: a) I don't have the time to really do both, and with school coming up, I'll have even less time. b) As I'm in high school, I need to build up my resume, and internships are great for that (but I prefer doing systems work). I guess my question is, ""Is there any way for OSS projects to really shine as much as an Internship for a high schooler? How can I make my contributions and interests apparent on my resume?""

I am a masters student studying computer science. I originally switched from another field to CS, so I spent the last year trying to get caught up and learn a tech stack. As such, I somewhat neglected leetcode prep, although I am trying to make up for that right now. Anyway, I am graduating May 2022, and I am starting to think about what to do after graduating. Obviously I am going to be applying for full time jobs, but another thought occurred to me. It seems to me that generally internships have easier interview processes than full time job interviews, probably because there is less risk to having a bad intern than a bad employee. Since I am not super confident in my DS/A skills, I feel like my performance in these interviews won't be amazing or anything, and I might have an easier chance passing the intern interviews than the full time ones. And for certain companies, I also believe there is a very high intern to full time employee conversion, although not guaranteed. What are your thoughts on what I should do? Thanks."
ove5qv,30,2021-07-31,Feeling extremely guilty,limebean420,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/ove5qv/feeling_extremely_guilty/,"I recently accepted an internship out of state, I tried to look for rental rooms that would allow me to bring my dog but I had no luck. I finally gave up and my parents told me they could watch my dog while I was away. They had previously said they had really warmed up to him and were enjoying his presence. About a week ago, I got into an argument with my parents. During it, as a way of lashing out, they told me they hate my dog. My dog is a 7 year old Great Dane mix, who they got for me, and is as sweet as pie. 

We have forgiven each other for what the argument was about, but now I just feel horrible leaving my baby with them. I have no other options though. I’ve already signed the lease and the offer letter, and there’s no way I can afford a sitter for him for 4 months. 

I can however afford to have someone come walk him three times a week. My dog has been with me to almost every state, I’ve had him since he was only 12 weeks old, and I’ve left for trips before but never one this long. We are very attached, and he’s getting old for a giant breed. I’m just so nervous to leave him alone especially as he nears his senior years. He can’t do everything he used to and I feel horrible because I want him to get love everyday. 

I am feeling so so guilty and stressed at the thought of leaving now. I thought he would be in loving hands, but to hear my parents say that has me so concerned. I don’t have anyone else who can watch him. 

I just feel terrible. Has anyone here gone through anything similar? Please no comments that are rude, it’s not helpful. You won’t change how I feel about my dog."
ovehf1,6,2021-07-31,"The common app opens tomorrow, and I don't feel so well (rant)",StaticManOnEarth,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ovehf1/the_common_app_opens_tomorrow_and_i_dont_feel_so/,"Warning: long rant ahead.

The common app opens tomorrow, and I don't feel so well. It is 3am in my timezone, and I just finished my second draft of the Common App essay. And yet I am already feeling like it is going to be complete cr\*p, just like the first draft. My stats and my profile are also not what I wanted it to be, but if I am being honest with myself, that is my fault entirely. My parents did the best they could, sending me to a good competitive school with strong academic programs and lots of ECs/clubs. It was definitely me. My friends are ending their junior year with full 4.0s UW GPA from all 3 years of HS (lucky me, school doesn't rank) and they took advantage of as many EC the school offered as they could. Well, I didn't. Yes, I did OK on the SAT and AP exams. But at the beginning of HS (freshman/sophomore year), I was simply not... preparing.

I was not joining the clubs in my area of interest, I was not volunteering, I was not playing sports for the school team ( I played ball at lunch, for fun and banter with my mates. Not something you tell colleges about.) What was I doing? Jesus, if only I could hop on a time machine, go back to pre-9th grade me, and slap him so hard his glasses fall off, and tell him to wake up and start preparing for college, god damn it. Instead, I went to classes, made stupid pranks, snarky jokes and all that cracking people up stuff, and that was it. Some dudes on chanceme/a2c out there starting businesses in high school, winning state championships, heading for T20s, 6 figures job, happy family, fulfilling his dreams and purposes. I was the class clown. Yay me. So how will you contribute to the campus? ""I'm funny. Got em dirty jokes, too."" Haha.

Anyways, during the second semester of my sophomore year, Covid hits and my family business closed. My dad still has some assets - real estates and such - but he told me that our finance took a big hit, and I would have to ask for financial aid. That was my wake up call. I started joining clubs and voluteering, I took part in a fundraising charity, I did an internship, I participated in STEM competitions, I had a part time summer job at big tech company. The junior year I rushed my ass off trying to add ECs... but somehow I still don't feel good enough. My friends has more stellar ECs, national/international awards, and 4.0 UW all year round. Meanwhile, the only award I have is... the AP scholar award. And yet, more supplements to write, and the common app essay to edit... Not to mention the fact that I am an international needing financial aid which is the same thing as shooting yourself in the arm and asking doctors to enable you to play basketball again.

I really need this off my chest. I struggle with the idea that I let my parents down because I didn't make the most of the opportunities they worked so hard to give me. I am too afraid to say it to their face, but I'm sorry, Mom and Dad. I procrastinated, a lot. I played video games. I tried smoking. I lied, to many people, many times. Sometimes, I did not pay attention in class. I messed up many things, many times. I messed up my high school experience, although there was definitely positives and I had fun but I am just going to regret it now. But this is all my fault. Not the circumstances, not the environment like I tried to fool myself it is. No, I was too busy ""just chilling"", ""just messing around"", and it is my fault and mine only. My parents invested in me and I failed them, big time.

I am an upcoming senior. I am passionate about my field, yes, but the truth is I didn't do as much as other passionate people did. I was simply not passionate enough. And no, I am not going to ""change the world"", ""make a difference"", or delivering millions of aid to South African kids with malnutrition. I am just a 17 years old, and I am confused, I am nervous about the future, I am lost and I am not fine. I have problems. Many of them. But those are all my fault, so I will have to deal with the mess I made.

P/s. If you read until this point, thank you for listening to my story. It means so much to me that you read through until here. And I apologize for bringing negativity into your current mood. Should not have burdened this cool community with my lost-ness due to my own fault. But I really needed to type this down. So tired."

ovf5y1,7,2021-07-31,Is it worth trading your junior summer internship for a study abroad experience?,ShanceMeShrow,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ovf5y1/is_it_worth_trading_your_junior_summer_internship/,"Hey all, I just want a reality check to make sure I'm not massively f\*\*king up by making this decision.

I'm currently going into my junior year at a decent US state school studying Comp Sci. I already have 2 summer internships (after freshman and after sophomore years) and I'm in a pretty good position to grind for a good internship next summer. I've already started applying and have done a couple of OAs and hirevue interviews for summer 2022, but no offers yet (I've also been holding off on applying more until I can decide what I want to do).

However, I also really want to study abroad and have been very interested in a program that runs from  April 2022 - late July 2022 which would be counted as my spring semester. Money wouldn't be an issue since I am studying under a full-ride scholarship that would pay for the study abroad. But going on this program would mean that I can't do a summer 2022 internship. In return, I wouldn't be taking normal spring classes at my university so I would be free from when my fall semester finishes in mid December to mid March. 

At first I was thinking that I might be able to get a short internship in this time, but now I don't really know who would hire me for (realistically) \~10 weeks from January to March when most off season internships run for 12-16 weeks. I'm still looking for an opportunity like that, but I haven't heard back from any places so far. As a back up plan, I've already started a business/group project with a couple of friends that I know I can work on during that empty period if I can't find any other good employment. I can also try contracting though I don't know how I'd approach that. But is that really a good enough substitute for a summer internship? Additionally, how would that affect my new grad hiring search the following year if I don't pursue a masters to get another internship?

I'm not sure what to do. I feel like I want to go abroad but my head is telling me I'll be screwing with my future opportunities and I might be setting myself back a couple of years by missing out on my most important college internship period. 

Is it worth trading my junior summer internship for a study abroad experience?"
ovf93z,4,2021-07-31,Looking for volunteering positions,Dorisyo93,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/ovf93z/looking_for_volunteering_positions/,"Hi,

I am an international student with a wet-lab background and I am trying to switch to Computational. I have just finished my masters in data science (with computational biology focus) and I am on OPT. I am looking for a full time position but the search is not going well. In order to fulfill my visa requirements I need to be working at least 20 hours a week and volunteer work is accepted. So I am looking for a volunteer position (or internship) in bioinformatics/data science area to gain  experience and retain my visa status. I am in SoCal, and would love remote work. I am mostly interested in learning NGS, but I am open to other topics as well. Can you recommend me any companies/organizations that I can apply to or people that I can contact?

I would appreciate any help! Have a great day!"
ovfaai,2,2021-07-31,How to get used to a new routine?,anon_throwaway13579,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ovfaai/how_to_get_used_to_a_new_routine/,"I thrive when I have a routine, and as a college student my routines are regularly disturbed. Each semester and break my routine will change dramatically and I really struggle with it. The past two summers I've had internships where I work full time in a different location than my school/home and having to move back and forth a bunch is also really difficult for me to adjust to. I just found out my internship will be hiring me full-time after I graduate next year (yay!) but I won't find out until February where I will be going for the job. They then told me that after working for 2 years they will be relocating me again to an office across the state and once again I will have no idea where I'm gonna be until the last minute. 

I also struggle with overstimulation and under stimulation. When I am in school I take large courseloads because I generally do better under pressure and without the excessive stimulation I get bored and overthink too much. During school breaks I am irritable and unsure of what I should be doing. I struggle with self-care and I haven't showered in several days. I suffer pretty badly with emotional dysregulation and since I will be going back to my college house I will be long distance with my boyfriend again (who I've lived with for the past 7 years). We were long distance last school year and I was miserable and almost checked myself into a mental hospital because of how depressed and anxious I was. I would forget to eat, shower, drink water, etc however I still showed up to classes and got a fairly decent GPA because the motivation of not disappointing my professors fueled me to at least attend classes. Unfortunately my only motivator is not disappointing people. I find it impossible to keep a routine when class times and work times are always changing. I'm not really sure what I'm asking for here, but I guess any advice or whatever would be welcome. 

I should also mention I'm not currently receiving any treatment/meds at all. I was diagnosed as a kid, quit meds around 14 and just never went back to the doctor for it since then. I planned to but as soon as I tried to make an appointment and get in, I had lost my insurance and had to move for my internship, and now that I'm going back to college and have insurance again I will be trying to schedule an appointment. I didn't really notice symptoms until I quit smoking (yay for nicotine/caffeine keeping me sane-ish). I had to start smoking again just to avoid crying in class every day so I'm hoping if I start meds I can kick the nicotine."
ovh4os,2,2021-07-31,Recovering from Depression,Steelers6767,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ovh4os/recovering_from_depression/,"21 M

After a few years of struggling in life, I finally broke down and went to the doctor for my depression. I got some meds and they started working, I feel myself being happier and a more positive outlook on life. My problem is, is that I'm a huge creature of habit. Meaning that even though I feel much better, I'm still doing what I did when I was at my lowest. I don't go out, I smoke to much weed, I eat terrible foods, I sleep as much as I can. It seems like I'm still doing what I did when I was depressed even if my mental is better.

I'm finishing up an internship in LA this summer and I went out twice, both work parties. That's not good, right? I feel like I should be out doing stuff and living life, but I don't know what my next steps should be? How do I restart my life with this new mental? I don't want to waste my life

Thank you in advance for any advice/ suggestions, they will be read"
ovhh7z,3,2021-07-31,Majoring in CS vs DS,akiljoe,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ovhh7z/majoring_in_cs_vs_ds/,"Im stuck on which major to do. The upper div classes that really interest me are Info 159(NLP), Data 100, CS 194(Data Engineering), and Data 144(Data Mining) which are all Data Science oriented classes. None of the upper div CS classes seem to interest me or be valuable to me other than maybe CS 170 for the sake of interviews. This makes me feel like Data Science is a better fit. Computer Science though is a more reputable major that could get me more internship and job offers I guess. Im looking to do Data Engineering or SWE in the future.

Any recommendations for how I should decide? Any advice is appreciated!"
