v2in8p,18,2022-06-01,Thinking about asking for a raise after hearing my boss talk about his comp,fincareeradvice13124,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/v2in8p/thinking_about_asking_for_a_raise_after_hearing/,"I’m thinking about asking for a raise. My boss and I have worked together since 2017, and are at our third bank together, as research analysts. We both got stiffed at our prior banks. But we moved to our current bank together recently and now I want to ask for a more equitable share of the benefits from that.

Specifically, I want to ask my boss for 10% of the bonuses that get allocated to our team next bonus season. Is that unreasonable? I think it’s reasonable. I also have head hunters and recruiters reach out to me semi regularly, so I am assuming I can get a job elsewhere.

Background:

He was a vice president when he jumped over to the first bank we were at together in 2017, and was the same when we moved to the next bank, which was a better bank (solid mid market). However, 2/3 of the analysts there were managing directors, so the resources got focused on them rather than the younger guys. My boss ended up getting stiffed for promotions for multiple years.

I, on the other hand, was brought on as an intern at our first bank, and then at our second bank, with the understanding that Id get promoted within 3-6 months of hiring. It took them 18 months to promote me, because there was nothing I could do about it. I was interviewing at other places but wasn’t getting an offer.

We moved over to our current bank (a top middle market bank) late last year and things have been going well. My boss was given a managing director title. He was super pissed because when he’d left his job as an associate at the bank he was at before I started working for him, another guy just out of college had taken his spot, then gotten a promotion, then his boss left and he got made a VP and then managing director, then moved to another firm (good middle market firm) as a managing director, at probably about 26. Hearing about that, and knowing that he was a better quality analyst, and knowing that he was being stiffed, had gotten my boss to look for new opportunities.

I have been at the new bank for a little over 6 months. I got bumped up from associate to senior associate, salary from $105k to $120k, and got a signing bonus of $25k and an additional bonus in Feb. of $20k, which I am assuming was because the firm had a blow out year.

A few months ago I got together with my boss and he was talking about how the guy who had left, who we had taken the position of, had been offered $6 million to stay on another year, but got a better offer elsewhere, hence why he left. That guy also wasnt very good at his job, which I know because we took over his models, and they were full of errors and just overall trash. However, we cover a very hot space, so they needed to fill the seat. My boss also talks semi regularly about how he is making so much more now, and how the money only really starts coming in when you hit MD. So I'm assuming he got massive upside into the millions at our new bank from what I'm guessing was &lt;$250k. 

We are hitting all our goals production wise. We’ll have initiated on 14 names in the near future, and will be at 20 within a couple months, so we’ll be at around a full load in well less than a year. We’ve done multiple very successful KOL calls, we’re putting out a massive white paper that’s very good in my opinion, we’ve got super high client engagement, and theres a lot of banking activity in our space. I handle most of the production of new material, allowing my boss to focus on the client engagement. I think I’m a major asset to the team, and that my boss would have more than 10% less productivity if I was to leave. I’ve been loyal to him for years, and think I deserve more upside. I would’ve asked before but I thought he would be making less than a million. Having him make 30-40x as much as me makes me feel unvalued."

v2kp7x,1,2022-06-01,Question on switching discipline during degree,FeistyEchidna1086,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/v2kp7x/question_on_switching_discipline_during_degree/,"I’m just after finishing my third year of a 4 year BE of Biomedical Engineering course, but for a while Iv been regretting my decision to pick the biomedical pathway and wish I did mechanical or structural instead. I’m drawn to these as I’m currently doing a summer internship as a project engineer, and being exposed to the technical side of those said disciplines really interested me. Iv also worked for a summer in a medical device manufacturing plant as an operator and I know I don’t want to be in that industry as an engineer. Iv spoken to my course chairperson and they said switching to another discipline offered by my college would mean doing an extra year to catch up on the modules I didn’t do in 2nd and 3rd year. They suggested an alternative could be to do a 1 year ME in either of those disciplines, but I’m concerned I’ll find it difficult without the same BE degree. Has anyone any experience in this?"

Ever since middle school after I was bullied a lot I promised myself I would turn out better then them in the long run. I wanted to ""prove them wrong"". It turns out that I actually did make that dream come true (on paper).

 You see I am not the brightest individual. In grade school I was in the most basic classes possible. The people I graduated with that had the same classes with me in grade school went for simple jobs like a retail worker. The people that were ""average classes"" went to some post secondary like community College or a trade school. The people who were in the honors classes went to either college out of town or to the military. Those were the people I wanted to be like because they seemed so happy.

I did literally exactly what they did. As of now, I am becoming a Junior in college majoring in MIS. This summer I got a professional internship working for a respectful company and finally got what I always wanted. At the moment I was happy that I finally was starting my career goals in life. Today is my second on the job and I already feel missed out of place.

I am working for a manufacturing company and there are a lot of different roles within the company. There are the engineers, business people, IT people, the managers, and the trade people like welders. Today I was task to learn how each station works. I met the welders and for the first time working there I felt comfortable.

Up to that point, the only people I was talking to were the business people. I was always so nervous around them and felt alien. At first I just thought it was because I was an intern but that's not the case. It's just because I can't relate to them. A light bulb came to me and that was I am faking my life.

It's just not here either, it's also in college. As for the last two years in college I never felt any connected to anyone expect for a couple people. 

For people out there reading this, I just want to tell you this. Just because you have an impression career that doesn't mean it makes you happy. I'd say staying true to who you are is more important then to be impressive to others.

As for me, I wish I could go back and tell myself that it's not worth it. I am at a state of life that if I dropped out if college I would be devastated. For the last 8 years that was the only thing that was on my mind and now I feel stuck."

There are the engineers, business people, IT people, the managers, and the trade people like welders. Today I was task to learn how each station works. I met the welders and for the first time working there I felt comfortable.

Up to that point, the only people I was talking to were the business people. I was always so nervous around them and felt alien. At first I just thought it was because I was an intern but that's not the case. It's just because I can't relate to them. A light bulb came to me and that was I am faking my life.

It's just not here either, it's also in college. As for the last two years in college I never felt any connected to anyone expect for a couple people. 

For people out there reading this, I just want to tell you this. Just because you have an impression career that doesn't mean it makes you happy. I'd say staying true to who you are is more important then to be impressive to others.

As for me, I wish I could go back and tell myself that it's not worth it. I am at a state of life that if I dropped out if college I would be devastated. For the last 8 years that was the only thing that was on my mind and now I feel stuck."

Ive passed the case interview rounds and if I pass the last discussion round I will be offered the position. The tasks would involve:


- Coordinating with Country Managers, Regional &amp; local Heads of Sales reviewing actual vs budget KPIs


- Discussing and executing initiatives that would improve KPIs and financials


- Etc


In terms of comp, currently I would earn €60k (+10% bonus) as an Associate at the corporate VC Im at, no carry. For the Finance Business Parner position I'm not sure what I should ask for but Im targeting €75k base.

I have struggled to look for work since graduating from college six years ago. A large part of it was my own fault. I was afraid to even so much as apply to someplace. I think a part of it was fear of rejection and failure, part laziness, and partly fear over actually holding a job. I have done multiple internships, went back to school to get my master's degree, and now, I am six months into my recent job search. Between COVID-19, losing a family member, and my own issues with anxiety and depression, at the end of last year I finally seemed to get into the groove of looking for work.

Most of these jobs are white-collar or civil service positions. For several, I have done several interviews, but in the end, rejected. Few I have not heard back from, and I am scheduled to do some more civil service tests in the future. However, six months is a very long time. I know some people who got a job in the first few weeks. For others, it took much longer.

Since January 2022, I have had the mantra in my head to keep applying, interviewing, and putting my best foot forward. If I do it enough and learn from each interview, I will hit a home run. Every time I fail to get a job, I always hear some type of variation of ""You did really well, but you just aren't the right fit"" or ""Everything looks good, but we found someone with better experience."" 

How do you get through this? I am going through the emotions of feeling inadequate, that I am freeloading off my parents while I fail to actually find a job. Have any of you had similar experiences? If so how did you deal with it? It is bad enough that my parents suggested I look for something in retail or anything of that sort just to bring in some money.

I appreciate any responses."

My contract is ending soon but they want to rehire me over the summer to do other work for them. I accepted but they're having me go through the employment process again. This time they're making me sign a drug-free workplace form. I haven't signed anything yet but does this mean I will be drug tested? I live in a state where marijuana is legal recreationally but I do not possess a medical card. I use marijuana recreationally every day (mainly to combat depression and anxiety)  so I'd need to quit for 30+ days in order to pass the test... When I received this internship, they never tested me but I think it was because at the time I wasn't an official employee of the university. 

I don't think I have enough time to sober up if I do sign it and they test me so would it look wrong if I deny the job? I don't need the job; this job would just look good on my resume plus I made really good connections there. 

I'm also afraid that if they do test me, I would lose my connections there so I'm wondering if I should just bail and tell em I found a better job or if I should take this job and pray they don't test me.

Everyone is cool but they're all busy with their own things that I can't see a way of me being able to support anyone, and I don't blame my team members for not having tasks I can do because they have years of tribal Knowledge that is basically necessary. 

Things tried:
- messaging team members and letting them know I can help with anything.
     ° I get the feeling it's easier to handle the issues themselves than explain the situation, so I never really get given tasks.
- looking at unassigned tickets which I was able to get 1 ticket done at least

v2q5mt,1,2022-06-01,Coding test for an internship?,CannotStopMeOnReddit,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/v2q5mt/coding_test_for_an_internship/,"Hi,

I applied for an internship and they asked me to do a coding test where I have to make an API within a time span of 20 hours.

I know that it's totally normal for a company to ask their applicants to do a test to prove they possess the required skills to perform well for the job, but what if it's for an internship?

I can understand that even internships have requirements, because if you don't have enough skill, you will struggle. But still... it's an internship, the main goal should be gaining work experience, right? To me, it seems they're rather looking for a cheap employee than an intern (atleast, I fear this being the case, but I could be wrong ofcourse).

In the past, I applied for internships and they didn't require me to make coding tests at all. I was hired and they gave me the space to develop my skills during that time.

How normal is it for internships to ask their applicants to do a coding test (like the example I provided)? Do tests like these given to their applicants indicate a red flag or is my assessment wrong?

I have absolutely no experience with matters like these and I'm trying to assess my judgement.

I'd like to know.

Thank you."

Do you think there are overwhelming negatives to doing a pure-frontend co-op, with only previous full stack co-op experience? (**points brought up to me**: negative impact on resume compared to less UX-oriented roles, as employers may see it as merely implementing Figma designs for the term; seemingly less transferable to other CS domains; smaller barrier to entry; the stigma that FE dev isn't *real* coding)

What was the work at Faire like? Faire hires dozens of interns (and plans on 14 interns just for FE this term) but does this impact the variety and depth of work available?

Was the Faire team as friendly as they present themselves in the info meet?

Any other thoughts on frontend co-ops?

v2s76c,21,2022-06-01,I got a free house from a mysterious letter in the mail. Now I'm dying for your company.,dotdeeron,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v2s76c/i_got_a_free_house_from_a_mysterious_letter_in/,"Hello sir or madame, I am writing to you to in order to tell you my account of events most suspicious. I hereby declare that everything in this letter is a factual account of my experiences over the past week regarding case no. 1238 in Shelby Falls. If you have any questions regarding the case, please contact Dwanye Conye at Shelby Falls Central Police Station. Though, truth be told, you aren't going to get any better information than this:

It all started a week ago. At first, it was like any other Monday morning. I awoke at 6am, dressed up in my uniform, and headed downstairs for a quick cup of coffee and a few biscuits. While sitting at the table, I performed my own personal little morning ritual: studying my officer badge intently and repeating my name mentally as I read it over and over again. It was a habit I picked up when I first joined the force in order to calm my nerves before the day began. ""Officer Albert Rogers,"" I almost said aloud. Seeing my name on the badge made me feel proud. I'm one of the few people who can say that they actually grew into the person they wanted to be as a child.

Once my coffee and biscuits were extinguished, I made a trip to my mailbox to see if anything had come in from the weekend. I'm naturally a disciplined person, but I must admit that I often forget to check my mail regularly. Honestly, knowing what I know now, I wish that I had completely forgotten that I have a mailbox at all.

Inside the mailbox was the usual assortment of spam and advertisements. Great. Maybe this is why checking the mail is such a hard habit to form. It rarely pays off. Initially I was just going to donate all of it to the recycling bin, but there was one letter that stood out. It was a plain letter addressed to me, but oddly there was no return address. It had an old-timey wax seal that was pitch black in color and had a mansion depicted on it. For a few moments, I was actually a bit excited. Was I about to be informed of the death of a long lost relative whose fortune I was to inherit? A few seconds later and my excitement turned to private shame. What a foolish thought. Life couldn't be that stereotypical, could it? But still, I found the mystery too tempting. This is the problem with detectives -- give us even a hint of a mystery and we're hooked. A character flaw really, but a profitable one with the right resources.

Grabbing a pocket knife out of my jacket, I carefully peeled the seal off the envelope. Seemed like a shame to break it. Inside was a standard A4 paper folded twice to fit in the envelope. The contents of the paper appeared to be a shoddy advertisement for a housing development project called Shelby's Retreat. Another one of those all-too-common garden home suburban projects. The ad had an amateurish picture of a happy family in front of home. It honestly looked like it had been clipped out of a magazine. The letter read, in sloppy, weak handwriting, ""We welcome you to Shelby's Retreat! We offer brand new, affordable, quality homes that are perfect for first time buyers or those looking to make their pension go further! Act quickly, houses are selling fast and you won't want to miss this opportunity!""

Below this was a date and time written for an open house: today at 1pm. 1366 Waverly Drive was the address for the showing. I did not see an agent to contact about this viewing, but at the bottom of the page ""Shelby Real Estate Co."" was watermarked. The whole note had me intrigued. Why go through the trouble of adding a wax seal and making the letter look fancy when the contents were so.....unprofessional? Perhaps I was overthinking it. Anyone can buy wax and get a little stamp these days. The note was amateur quality through-and-through then. Though the unconventional nature of it did make me want to open it. So perhaps it was very effective marketing after-all? I chuckled a little thinking of some poor intern at Shelby Real Estate's offices having to play 4D chess with this advertising campaign.

I discarded the note and envelope with the rest of the trash and proceeded to have a completely uneventful commute to my station. Once at my desk, I began looking through the reports for the day. Several immediately caught my eye. People had been reporting receiving ""creepy, unwanted mail"" in their mailbox. One report included a picture and, as I had begun to suspect, the envelope they received had the same black wax seal on it. The contents of their letter was different from mine. Seemed like the letter was trying to invite them to a birthday party. It had the same crappy graphics that were clearly pasted from a magazine. There was also a date and time, which was illegible, but I was able to barely make out the address: 1366 Waverly Street. Other detectives in the force probably wrote these reports off as some prank by kids, but my gut told me that there was something more...sinister to this.

I booted up my computer and typed in '1366 Waverly Drive' and 'Shelby's Retreat'. No hits for any articles on Shelby's Retreat, but it seems that the neighborhood did exist on Google Maps. I called Shelby Real Estate and inquired about the open house. A sweet voice on the other end of the line told me that they had no recollection of an open house for that address, if Shelby's Retreat did exist, it was not in their files.

This was beginning to look suspicious enough to investigate further. I entered the new case file into our system for the letter I received (case 1238) and began driving towards the suburb to do an initial investigation. The sky was completely dreary when I left. What started out as a sunny October morning became a gray, cloudy mess with an annoying drizzle of cold rain. The kind of drizzle that made you turn on your windshield wipers for one swipe before waiting three or so minutes for it to accumulate enough to justify another.

Once I had gotten to the periphery of the suburb, I slowed my vehicle down to a leisurely crawl so I could absorb the details of my surroundings. From the outside, the suburb looked mostly complete and built. However, there was no sign at the entrance giving a name for the neighborhood. Who knew if this was even Shelby's Retreat. Well, if Shelby's Retreat even existed, of course. Driving into the main arterial road for the suburb, I noticed that most of the houses had well-kept lawns and their exteriors looked freshly built, but there was no sign of inhabitants for any of the dwellings. No cars in the driveways, no lights on in the house. For such a grey day, they should have been visible from the outside I thought. I began driving down the minor streets to check more houses, but it was all very much the same. New houses, no inhabitants. Perhaps the letter was correct? These houses were so newly built that no one had even moved in yet. Going to the 1366's open house might provide more answers, I thought.

It was on Waverly Drive that I saw the one and only sign of life in the neighborhood. In the driveway of 1364 Waverly Drive, the neighbor of 1366, was a beaten-up looking car. There were still no lights in the house, however. Whoever lived there must of had two cars and took one out for some chores, I thought. Then, I noticed a peculiar string of yarn hanging out of 1364's mailbox. It was tethered to the inside of the mailbox and it went all the way to the front door of 1364. I couldn't help but think ""God Bless America"". Here was someone so lazy that they devised a system to get their mail without ever leaving the comfort of their home. Perhaps I could use such a system to check my own mail? Would make it less of a hassle. Funny thinking that with one pull of a rope I could dump all of those ads while drinking my morning coffee.

Turning my attention back to 1366, I noticed that there was a distinct lack of guests or even a real estate agent waiting outside of the house. As I began to approach the main entrance of the house, I experienced the all-to-familiar tingling of adrenaline. Something about this seemed so...off. A neighbourhood with only one inhabitant, an open house with closed doors and no welcome party. It did not feel right. What if this was an elaborate set up for a mugging? The more I looked at the facade of 1366, the more hesitant I became. My mind started playing silly tricks on me in order to get me to turn heel. It tried to convince me that the two front-facing windows, dark from the lack of lighting, were actually windows into the abyss. Or the cold, dead eyes of predator that feels no remorse as it sinks its teeth into its prey.

The wind was starting to pick up now and, combined with the freezing rain, I had to make a decision. This was supposed to be an open house (or a birthday party) after all, so there should be no harm taking a peek inside. And I should be safe, I had a gun with me after all. If this whole suburb was some den for crackheads or thieves, at least I had some protection. As I began walking towards the front door, I saw some movement from the corner of my eye, but it was not coming from 1366.

I looked to the left and studied a window from the side of 1364. There was an elderly man with his face pressed into the window glass. When I moved my hand to the doorknob of 1366, I saw his hands move to the front of his face. At first I thought he was to shout something, but it seems that he was...praying? Though it was hard to tell from a distance, I could of sworn that a uniform trickle of tears were rolling down his face. Was my mind just playing tricks on me once again? I yelled out to him that I was an officer and asked if he needed assistance. He looked wide-eyed at me and ducked below the window. I walked up to the window, but it was too high for me to peek down into his house. I knocked a few times asking if the old man needed my help, but I received only silence. I continued to listen. Silence. Silence. The wind blowing between the houses. Rain drops hitting the vinyl sidings of the house. Silence. After about a minute I turned around to return to 1366, but as I did so I heard weeping prayers to Jesus and Mother Mary coming from the window behind me.

""Christ, that's sad."" I thought to myself. The man must of had dementia or some other illness and was probably abandoned by his caretakers for the day. I breathed deeply and returned to the door of 1366. Exhaling, I opened the door and took my first step inside.

The inside of the house looked...impossible. It was much larger than the outside would imply. And the interior decoration looked...ancient. Like an old mansion you'd see in fairy tales or on Disney rides. It was also completely dark save for a few candles that lined a grand stairway in front of me. At the top of this staircase was some kind of altar flanked by smaller staircases that led to the second floor of the house. A house that was clearly only a single floor from the outside. I thought it might have been the darkness playing a trick on me, but this was far too elaborate to explain away with the mere movement of shadows being processed by an anxiety-laden mind.

I did not go back. I could not go back. There was something compelling me to look at the altar on the stair landing. Step by step, I walked up until the altar's contents came into view. It was another letter with an identical envelope to the one I and so many others had received. I did not take time to carefully open this one. I hastily ripped its contents out. Unfolding the paper, I saw a message in rather fancy cursive writing:

*In this house full of dread*

*Not many are willing to tread*

*But you have entered instead*

*Giving me my daily bread*

""All this for some high school poetry!?"" I shrieked out in anger. My voice bounced off the far walls and ceiling of the foyer. I threw the paper on the ground in frustration and stood there breathing heavily. Once the echoes of my anger had subsided, the only sound to be heard was the whispering of the wind and the plip-plopping of rain outside. The rain seemed to get louder. And louder. And louder still. Until it was no longer rain. It was the sound of heavy boot steps coming from the stairs beside me. I could not make out much in the darkness, but each step was getting louder and louder. Like a body being slammed to ground with each step of some unseen being's gait. I pulled out my gun and pointed it into the darkness.

""I'm Officer Rogers, a member of the Shelby Police. Lay down on the ground and identify yourself!""

There was no noticeable change in the rhythm of footsteps. They continued until suddenly I saw it. Two feet wearing a familiar set of shoes entered the dim candlelight of the staircase. As they slowly shuffled down the stair case, their torso was revealed and, in two more steps, I saw its grotesque face. Only, it was my face. And my body. Except my eyes were not my eyes. They had been replaced by two of the black, waxy seals as seen on the envelopes. They were halfway melting, with the resulting black drip giving the beast a weepy appearance. It raised its hand and from its index finger grew a long, curved blade. It was probably half a meter in length. Its steel glowing a pale orange from the candlelight and casting a long, serpent-like shadow on the wall.

The sight of my armed doppelgänger was too much, and I fired two shots without hesitation. Both went through the chest, but the monster did not react. It kept its slow pace and continued plodding towards me. I breathed in deep and honed my sights for the creature's eyes. Those damned black eyes that made a mockery of my visage. With one shot I popped off the seal from the left eye of my worse half. Instead of staring into a bullet wound from where I shot the creature, I found a glowing red eye staring back at me. This unblinking red eye that pulsed like the embers of dying fire had me so completely entranced that I did not notice that this crazed version of me was within arm's reach. It was too late. I looked down and the creature's silver-orange blade was sunk deep into my belly. I saw my blood trickle out from my sweater and jacket. It seemed to follow its own path rather than the one dictated by gravity. Running down the blade and then up the arm and body of the creature until it flowed into that red eye.

Then, it simply retracted its blade and disappeared. I looked down at my stomach and the wound was gone. I felt weak, but I could still stand. Looking at the altar, I noticed a new letter sitting upon it -- tempting me to give it another read.

""Oh fuck this.""

I ran to the front door and yanked it open. The outside all looked the same -- except that the car in front of 1364 was now gone. I guess the old man was capable of leaving by himself after all. Using the remains of my might, I dashed to my own vehicle. However, the further away I got from the house, the greater a pressure I felt in my chest. It became harder and harder to breathe as I approached the handle of the car. Nonetheless I made it inside. Looking into the rear-view mirror, I made a sick discovery: my skin look parched and my hair was graying. It was as if I had aged 10 years. Perhaps that's also why I felt weaker.

I fished the car keys out of my pocket. I was about to stick them in the ignition when suddenly I had a premonition of the car blowing up as soon as the metal connected. My heart starting palpitating harder. I would need to run instead, but outside the car stood two ravens in the street. If I tried to run, they ARE going to dive into my eyes I thought. I knew. Chest pounding more frequently now. I could see it clearly. Those birds would fly into the sky and then dive bomb directly into my eye sockets. I hear a crash coming from the rear window of the car. Chest was practically collapsing now. A hooded man man with a trench jacket broke through the window and is connecting hundreds of pipes to the car exhaust. I will suffocate in this car.

I looked to my badge. It has always been my saviour. My soothing ritual. ""Albert Rogers Officer"" I repeat over and over, but the heaviness I feel in my chest is no longer bearable. My only hope is the house. It just \*has\* to be. I quickly discard the badge and explode out the car and towards the house. Ripping the doors open and slamming them shut behind me. My chest eases. I can breathe again. I look out the window. There is no sign of my earlier assailants.

Taking a few moments to breath and let it all sink in, I realized that there is nothing more for me to do than read that expecting letter. Thump, thump, thump. I drag my feet up the stairs, mimicking the menacing mimic who had assaulted me minutes earlier. I put a heavy hand on the altar and, with the other, picked up the envelope. This time I opened it with diligent care. Inside I found a set of rules and directives:

*Come to me, sweet lamb*

*Feed me and sustain me*

*You are one of my prisoners*

*In a jail with but one escape*

*Bring me another to the dreary home of 1368*

It's been three days since I've read that directive. In that short time, I have become a shadow of my former self. Every night at midnight my red-eyed doppelgänger takes another piece of me. My body grows more frail with each feeding and my skin is starting to dry and flake off. I've tried hiding, but it always finds me eventually. In desperation I asked it what would happen if I chose to rot away, and it simply responded that it knows how to ration and that my suffering would last a very, very long time.

I've tried going outside, but I am only strong enough to get to the mailbox before the hallucinations begin and I start wheezing. I have a strong feeling that if someone were to drive by and rescue me, the wheezing would not stop. I do not know what would happen if I were to invite a guest to stay with me, but I shudder at the thought of my shadow feasting on them as well.

Outside of the feedings and my fruitless escape attempts on foot, I've been spending the last three days thinking about that directive. It is clear that my tormentor needs fresh meat, and inviting one person to the neighboring house will release its hold on me. That's why the host of 1364 sent so many letters. His desperate attempts at freedom, exchanging his life for mine. But there are two big differences between me and 1364: I've got morals. And a phone.

You see, despite all of the feedings, the anguish, the despair, I've managed to hold on to my sense of justice. There's no way I could reach out to someone knowing full well the trap that lies in their wait. This has led me to where I am now: writing a full report of my experience and scattering it to the internet with not but a scant few hours left on my phone's battery. If there's anyone in the world crazy enough to visit 1368, I'll find them online. So, come on all you paranormal investigators, puzzle solvers, and wannabe Witchers...

Won't you be my neighbour?"

v2slok,1,2022-06-01,Questioning My Future,Carter2k20-,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/v2slok/questioning_my_future/,"I'm going in to my third year of college. I've changed paths from pre-dental to now CS, but it's brought about some interesting decisions. 

First, I've learned that CS is a field where you can make it pretty far through use of self-learning. This leads me to assume that student-interaction and being in a physical classroom is not as important in CS as compared to other fields. I am trying to decide if I will attend a physical university, which will take me 2 full more years (67 credits) OR if I will attend an online university. I've learned that WGU is a popular choice among CS students and it is enticing with its low price and move-at-your-own-pace layout. Although I only have one basic coding class under my belt, all of my gen-eds are completed, so I am assuming that I would be able to finish my degree at WGU in less than 2 full years. For me, there are seemingly many advantages to completing this degree online, but I am unsure how important a physical university environment is. Am I going to miss out on anything important by attending college all online? 

Second, I'm slightly concerned about my ability in the field of CS. While the schools I have attended have not been competitive by any means, I have done well, maintaining a near-4.0 GPA throughout high school and community college. My issue is that while I do enjoy math, it is my weakest subject. On the ACT it was my lowest category. In high school, specifically pre-calculous, I found myself to be the only one showing up an hour early to school to grasp an understanding of certain subjects before tests. I did make a foolish mistake in my freshmen year of community college while taking calculus I and II. I did not think math was going to play a significant role in my field at the time, so I slacked off. I ended with an A in both, thanks to them being online, but I did very little of the ""extra"" work and did not attempt to apply myself and really learn the material. I may have to teach myself or even re-enroll in calculus I and II. I just question if I will be successful in this field given my math abilities, or lack thereof. 

Lastly, I fear I may be ""behind"" my counterparts. I understand that 80% of college students switch their majors, but I can't help but feel I am significantly under-qualified in comparison to other CS students of the same year. At my point, sophomore year summer going into junior year, it seems like many students already have internships, projects done, etc. I am sitting here with the slightest knowledge of coding and nothing else. This summer I have pledged myself to 15-20 hours of learning per week to gain a foundation of knowledge, but I still fear that I will be way behind. 

If anyone has advice to leave or stories of personal experience, I look forward to reading and replying. Thanks!"

I just finished my second year in college for comp sci bachelor. I didn’t code before college, and my grades right now are fine but it seems to me like I’m so much behind everybody there, it feels like they already know everything and got into college just for the degree. Most of them already did projects while I only found out that I need to do projects outside of college half a year ago, most of them already have internships. I don’t know even where to start, what projects are good enough for internships, where all those people learn from? Which books do I read or what do I do? Because at this point it fells like I won’t be able to even get a job because everyone around me is in the different level."

v2v7ou,18,2022-06-01,My mental health is horrible.,cabronofamerica,AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/v2v7ou/my_mental_health_is_horrible/," Hello. I apologize if this is not the right place to ask these kinds of questions. I'll start off by trying to give a quick summary of what has been going on in my life as of late.

I just finished my 3rd year in my computer science program. At the end of my second year, April 2021, I had horrible grades in my courses as compared to my first year. There are many reasons, but to bring up a couple, covid turned my life into chaos, and studying from home was extremely difficult. However, the worst part of it all, and it is still so physically and mentally paining for me to even write this, is that my older brother, the person I love most in my life, passed away just days after my exams were over. Since then, many more things out of my control have also gone extremely wrong, but my brother passing takes the cake.

Due to all of these things, my learning and development as a student pursuing a career as a software engineer has been totally stumped. My mental health is so horribly bad. My plans for summer 2021 (before my brother passed) were to spend the summer trying to go over the courses that were taught in my second year because they went over very fundamental topics such as data structures and algorithms, important logic courses, and more. I also was actively applying to coop positions at that time. However, I knew that my resume lacked heavily in quality. Another plan was to make highly detailed projects to make my resume amazing and impossible for a recruiter to turn down. However, as you know, these optimistic hopes were shattered. Since my brother passed, my mom got cancer for the 3rd and 4th time. We found out about the 4th one just today.

Essentially, as of today:

\- I am now lacking heavily in my understanding of key things such as graphs, data structures, operating system fundamentals, advanced understanding in languages such as Java and C, and more that I can't even think of right now.

\- My resume is garbage, and chances of landing any coops or internships are extremely low.

\- My financial situation is not horrible, but also not very good. My brother was a big help in providing for us.

I want to mention that I have not given up on learning or studying or anything like that. It is just that it is very difficult for me to be able to learn and do things like the average student in my year. I am working on projects for my resume as well. I realize that I might take an extra year, two if necessary, to get my degree as I am also behind in credits. Although I have made many efforts to better my mental health and still continue to do so, it is still so horribly bad.

I apologize if this post seems like it is all over the place, I am just feeling so overwhelmed right now. I wanted to know what anyone might have to say that may help. Thank you."
v2vcyc,1,2022-06-01,Work,Sea_Zebra_7431,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/v2vcyc/work/,"Out of all the people in my  team I can only count on 4 others. One is useless and has been put to do menial tasks because they don't want to fire him (bit of nepotism involved). The other is slightly better but still way below where they should be. My manager trusts me to do my work and has given me more responsibilities because of it . I guess it's good for my progress but it sucks sometimes that we don't really operate like a team that has this many people. 

On the other hand I've been feeling like a major imposter lately. Like I can't believe I'm being trusted with these projects 8 months into my time here. It's kinda a blessing because I get to progress quicker but also a bit of a curse because there is a part of me that wants to push the breaks but I understand I gotta grind a bit before anyone gives a shit about what I want. I feel like im juggling shit lately and there's a part of me that envies that person that barely has to do anything.

But also wtf. There is literally no one else you could have got in the entire company to do this? I'm concerned that they wanted to have an intern on this project before they brought me on. I guess the guy that was 5 months in(me) was better but I'm learning to swim by being thrown in to the pool and they are trusting that I won't drown. Except if I drown I bring some others with me. I would've liked some floaties at least.

I know I kept things as vague as possible lol don't want to provide specifics on the rare chance they see this."
v2w4de,3,2022-06-01,My ADD keeps pushing me into changing careers,Alternative_Emu_2907,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/v2w4de/my_add_keeps_pushing_me_into_changing_careers/," I already asked this in r/careerchange and they advised me to focus more on my ADD, so this is a slightly modified version of the previous post.

For context, I(31M) have been plagued with career indecision for a WHILE. I've been diagnosed with ADD last semester and it opened my eyes to a LOT of behaviors in my life. I'm medicated now on Ritalin, I was hoping it would fix my problems, and while I feel so much better in my daily life, no change in my professional behavior so far. And now, I'm struck once again by the need to change careers, but I don't know if that's because I'm bored, struggling, or just trying to escape difficulty.  


For some background, here's what I did

\-Got an english degree after high school, lost interest in teaching or translation  
\-Got into acting school, bailed after too many casting rejections  
\- Tons of small gigs as a daycare worker and camp counselor, including two full years in the same spot. Fun, but very small pay and mentally taxing, I couldn't handle kids anymore.  
\-Internship in a zoo, wanted to work with animals. Loved it, but very, very few entry opportunities even for people with certifications, which I don't have.  
\-Salesperson for an e-commerce solution in Ireland. The most corporate job I had, nice learning experience but I jumped ship after getting bored, and i was getting some weird vibes from corporate, I was already struggling to push myself further and there weren't a lot of growing opportunities.  
\-During the first year of covid, I passed a coding course and got a degree, but it doesn't feel complete since many lessons got cancelled or were barely done due to remote learning, and I lacked a tons of skills.

And that leads us to this year :  
I'm currently a junior web developer working part time in a small firm specialized in softwares for libraries. I'm also supposed to be attending a second coding school to prepare for a certification in two months, but I've been extremely put off by their teaching methods : sink or swim mentality, work overtime, ""just google what you're looking for"" for any questions, etc. It didn't help that during Covid, they didn't enforce any restrictions and I got it twice from just going there, and since I got a serious health condition on top of that, it was wiser for me to stay home and learn from there. Unfortunately, they pretty much gave up on me and don't even bother answering my mails or sending me ressources.

So now, I just got a lot of free time, but coding is semi-traumatic for me because while I don't have a lot of pressure at work, i tried my best in this school and they left me behind. I've been forced to take a small medical leave to avoid a messy burnout, and while I feel better and have pretty much given up on passing the exam for this stupid school, I'll be terminated by the end of August and I don't know what to do.  
I like some aspects of coding but I'm just put off by the whole money and start up mentality. I feel like I need to feel directly useful through my job, like i'm contributing to something I believe in, like environment, animal rights and stuff like that. I need to have input from the people (or things) I help. But I'm tired of starting back again from nothing. I desperately want to be passionate.

I just... need advice on what I could do. Ideally, I'd love something that could combine coding and working with animals, but I don't really see it. Or a way to get interested again.  


TLDR : I keep switching careers and starting back from the bottom, giving up as soon as I get bored or struggle. It's becoming a real problem. My current dream is to work with animals but I fail to see how to combine that with programming."

v30epw,63,2022-06-02,I'm scared that Doctors will say I don't have ADHD and that my parents will be proven right,okai24,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/v30epw/im_scared_that_doctors_will_say_i_dont_have_adhd/," So for a really long time I (20F) have suspected I had ADHD, technically since I was like 11 but then more seriously when I was 14. I never really seeked out a diagnosis in the past because I grew up in an Asian country and honestly no one talked about these type of things at all at school or anywhere and so I didn't know where to start (I was only familiar with ADHD from American media and later the internet). I moved to the US about 3 years ago and now I'm a second-year college student and I'm struggling even harder than before. I know I'm going to fail a class this term (not that my parents know) because I could not physically will myself to do the work (executive function maybe?).

That being said, as I child I actually did really well in school and got good grades because I just really liked school and found a lot of topics interesting. I still procrastinated on every single assignment but was just 'smart' enough to coast by doing everything last minute (even though it always caused me stress and mental anguish that I could not start work even when I wanted to). Even for the class I'm going to fail (computer science class) I initially did the first assignment which was given 2 weeks in advance 24 hours before the deadline and managed to do it well but by the second assignment I started it even later and then failed it and from there I just gave up cause I was tired of not being able to do work and literally stare at the wall the whole day not doing anything just to suffer later wishing I started sooner.

Anyways that's not even the reason why I finally decided to maybe tell my parents about it and ask to get diagnosed. Essentially a TA gave a college career talk and since I'm going to be a third-year next year I knew there was a lot of stuff I needed and heck, even wanted to do (eg internship stuff, portfolio, resume ect) and it just dawned on me that I didn't want to spend the rest of my life unfulfilled or unable to do the stuff I want to do (like I had so many personal projects that I never finished. I'm an artist, a writer, an animator ect except I'm not because I have all these ideas and desires but just can't do or finish them) and a friend of mind said ""Oh you know Asian parents are like that and there's things they don't understand but they do come from a place of good intentions and they do love you, you're their only daughter"". And despite my misgivings (I'd interviewed them about their thoughts on mental health and ADHD stuff beforehand under the premise that it was for school cause my major has some psychology classes lol) and it was not looking good. They think ADHD is just being hyper or whatever.

Anyways I told them about it and I regret it so much. For one thing my dad just started laughing at me. He then muttered something about how ""America's just like that, they like to put labels on everything"". When I tried reading out the symptoms I felt I had they essentially tried to justify every one as not being 'that bad'. Even though I'm always very impulsive and make so many careless mistakes in assignments my mom said ""Well obviously you don't make that many because you got good grades at school"". When I say I fidget around a lot they say ""All kids do that, even your cousin did!"" even though they always scold me for said fidgeting. I'm forgetful with things and misplace stuff every single day they say ""Well we do too!"" or even the procrastinating thing ""Your mom procrastinates work too! And you can still eventually do your assignments if there's a deadline! You just need the right motivation and if you really wanted something you'd do it"" (Except I can't. I really wanted to talk to my friends in the past but for like 3 whole months in the past I couldn't even physically make myself to text them) or even the fact that daily routines like taking a bath, washing my face, brushing my teeth I just could not do. Since I was a kid. Yet they explained that away too saying the previously mentioned cousin was like that as a kid (Well I'm not a kid anymore and it's still happening and they (I guess righteously) scold me for it).

So yeah I cried and then they get upset that I cried and said I was painting them like the bad guys. And truthfully my mom said they would get me diagnosed anyways if I really wanted to before everything they said so then my mom was like ""If we were really evil we wouldn't let you get tested yet you're still acting like we're the villains?"". And yeah that was a few days ago and the past few days have been horrible. When they're not making jokes like ""Oh no I can't remember where I left the TV remote I guess I have ADHD then!"" we're having screaming matches over the symptoms and what they've read about it and how I feel invalidated whenever they tell me I'm 'overthinking it'. It's got to the point where sometimes when I don't follow tasks my mom loudly yells that she things I'm just using ADHD as an excuse to not do work/excuse my bad attitude (I'm not. While the thought has crossed my mind for some character traits I don't want to be those type of people who use ADHD for an excuse for everything and the main reason I wanted to get diagnosed was so that I could stop feeling like a piece of shit for not being able to do anything). When I was being particularly loud my parents they started saying ""Oh wow you're really trying to act like you have ADHD huh"" when they've scolded me in the past for being loud and it's not new! They're even now trying to get my to second guess myself and said ""Maybe you don't bother calling the doctor? Maybe try all these behavior hacks on websites about ADHD first instead"" when I've been trying them for years to limited success.

So at this point I'm just terrified of the idea that maybe I am faking it. That I don't have ADHD. That I've just always been lazy since I was a kid (my parent's words) and that when I go to the doctor that the results will come in that I don't have ADHD. (I'm on my parents' Kaiser insurance and not gonna lie the horror stories from reddit about them have also not dissuaded my fears). So I guess I'm here to rant but also ask for advice of what to do if that's really the case? Like how to move on with my life and figure out what the heck is wrong with me and why I have what kid me called the 'Do-Nothing Disease' (Funny tangent but I wrote poems as a kid and like a good 20% of them is literally all about procrastination and how I'm a 'slave to my own body' like wow yikes). So yeah I don't know. Are my parents right? What if the doctors prove my parent right? What then? I don't know.

TLDR: Suspected I had ADHD for a long time. Scared to diagnose previously cause Asian but caved in when I realized I didn't want to live my whole life like this but now my parents are trying to convince me I don't have ADHD and I'm scared when I go to the doctor they'll say the same thing and that I'm just inherently flawed."

I was first hired as an intern for 6 months where all my friends were earning decent pay. I was converted to full-time after that, and the pay was very average, around 1000$ per month( I am from India). The work pressure wasn't there, this was a bonus since I didn't have to deal with clients and deadlines. So I decided to put to use my coding skills. I was very much inclined to open source and have a few projects of my own which took good traction. Luckily I was hired by someone who aligned my mission on contributing to open source.  The intense amount of coding and responsibilities of coding in open source is sheer excitement! And I was the only engineer who maintains their products, which made me learn the ins and outs of everything .

&amp;#x200B;

I would advise every data scientist to have an inclination towards open source, this will not only make you contribute to code and develop your skills, but also helps you learn the market standards and innovations which happens in the industry. When you're on the search for a solution, that is when you learn the most. And open source has a lot of tasks where you can surely make an impact in the industry and the community."

However, the company is not relevant to my major, nor will push me further in my professional career, in my eyes. I feel that doing the on-campus job, while it doesn't sound as sexy as the well-known company, will help me add to my portfolio and gain more experience in programming. On the other hand, the company can help me network and gain more experience in a different field, that is not necessarily what my dream job entails. But that could lead to more doors in the future.

v32jcw,6,2022-06-02,The Nest,HorrorThrowaway69,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v32jcw/the_nest/,"  

Today was a day like any other – just another part of mundania. I woke up, showered, ate, and walked towards the train. I felt distant all morning, just barely human. I have found that that tends to happen when I skip my morning coffee, but there will always be another pot tomorrow. I gripped tightly onto my briefcase, feeling it gently bump and rub against my leg with every other step. Today was going to be a long one, I thought, knowing that I had a big presentation. In hindsight, I’m not entirely sure how I ended up as a lawyer for a big company – When I went to law school, I wanted to fight for the environment. Debt is a bitch, and an expensive one at that, I continued to think. I neared the train station and gazed at the sky. Dark slate-colored clouds covered the sky, drifting slowly. When was the last time that I saw the sun? At this point, it must have been at least a week. It seems that with every passing week, the sky is less and less visible. I knew that this was just a bias, though. Growing up in San Diego, I spent many days in the sun and on the beach letting the sun kiss my skin. “Maybe, that’s why I’m depressed.” The words slipped from my internal monologue, into reality, and I prayed that no one heard. I could hear the cynical, almost mocking tone in my voice, and I felt relieved that the people around me were all wrapped up in their own business. That’s just this city, I’ve learned.

The train is uneventful. I sit across from a homeless man whose hair was matted into tight spirals, and his eyes were glazed over. He seemed even less present than I was. I laughed to myself, for I had envied him for the smallest moment. He doesn’t have to work, or fight for a cause that he didn’t agree with. He doesn’t have to fight with his wife every night. He doesn’t have to be sober, because of his own fears. He had the one thing that money could not buy, and yet it has the highest price – Freedom. I spent most of the train ride into the city daydreaming floaty thoughts about being homeless – Building a fire in a trashcan and falling asleep with a bottle of gin in my hand. I flashed back to last night, after Amanda went to bed. The taste of metal in my mouth, and weight in my hand felt like reality, again. I entertained a thought – Better a bottle, than a gun. I was jostled from my cynicism, as I heard the train bell ding. It felt like an hour, but the train ride lasted no longer than the 15 minutes it always did. 

I meandered towards the outside, on my typical route to work. The moment that I stepped outside, I reached into my coat pocket and pulled out a small rectangular cardboard pack and removed myself a cigarette. The same thought that I have had every day, for the last 20 years rang through my head. *It’s about time that I quit.* I reached into my pocket and pulled out the flip style lighter that I had gotten from Amanda on our first anniversary. **Do It For The Fish, That Cannot Fight For Themselves.** Every time that I have looked at it, in the last 6 months has hurt. I lit my cigarette and took a deep inhale. Exhale. The menthol on my lips raised the craving for coffee, again. I checked my watch, wondering if I had time to grab a cold brew before work. 6:55. *Shit.* My gait increased, trying to ensure that I was in the elevator for the building before 6:59. When I reached the building, I stopped, momentarily, and gazed at the dark monolith of a corporate office. The windows, frequent – yet dark. The scale of the building had an imposing presence and gazing up at it gave the impression that it would crumble down on top of me at any moment. I stomped the cigarette out the bottom of my sole and strode into the building. Ready yet, for another day of soul crushing work. 

**15 Hours Later, 9pm.**

My feet fall out of the elevator, struggling to carry my exhausted frame. My hand no longer clenched the briefcase, and instead, the leather handle barely hung from my fingertips. As I slowly made my way to the train station, I cursed under my breath at every inconvenience of the day, every project manager, every executive. The only respite in the entire day, was the brief conversation I had with Erica, the new intern. I found myself thinking about her auburn hair, shimmering under the florescent lights. I wondered how things would be if I were to approach her, in a different light – one far less professional and a hell-of-a lot more carnal. Once I realized the adulterous thoughts that I was considering, I turned my scornful thoughts inward.  *You pig. You’ve been married for 15 years. You and Amanda have been through... So much. You love Her. You love Her. You. Love. Her… Right?* Before the thoughts started to spiral too terribly out of control, my hand reached into my breast pocket and pulled out a small pill bottle. *One for the anxiety.* I excused, knowing that the emotional numbing from the pills is exactly what will make me feel better. I reached the bus station, and the air felt... strange.

Other passengers were around, but none of them looked up from their personal distractions. None glanced away from their books, or phones. *It’s remarkably quiet*, I thought as I descended the stairs into the station. After a few minutes of idle waiting, my train arrived precisely at 9:20. I stood up to get on the train, and none of the other passengers got up. It’s not the last train of the night, but I would’ve expected that at least one other would be departing. *Bizarre.* Once I got on the train, I looked out the window and slowly, one by one, the passengers in the station raised their head to make eye contact. They all made a smile, a disingenuous, hollow, rotten smile. I felt uneasy, and straightened the collar on my suit jacket, and looked away. The train doors closed, and I immediately smelled something bizarre. As the train departed, I tried to place the smell – familiar, yet distant. Not one strong enough to decode memory, but one distinct. I gazed out the window and watched as the orange lights of the tunnel raced by. *TV Static. The static of one of those old CRT TV’s, that’s the smell.*

*The air doesn’t feel ionized,* I thought. My memories brought me to a time when I was helping my grandfather weld bars for windows, using an arc welder. If I think hard enough, I can still feel the distinct crackle along my skin and the taste of ionized air. This wasn’t like that. I started to feel like I was being watched, but looking around the train car, there was nobody else present. I stood up and walked to the nearest car-door. Glancing through the window, I don’t see any other people on the car behind me. I started to get a little nervous. *My pill hasn’t kicked in yet.* I walked to the front of the car, and glanced into that car, as well. Empty. “Where is everyone?” I asked myself, out loud. I realized that the train was still underground. *Still. Underground.* I know that by now, we are usually speeding across the countryside, between the big city and the smaller town that I commute from. I watched as the orange tunnel lights continued to speed by. I looked at my watch. 9:30. *What the fuck?* Something wasn’t right. *Maybe I got onto the wrong train?* I made the decision to move further up the train, to ask someone else what train I was on.

The first car door was heavy, and it took most of my effort to open. After sliding it, I picked up my briefcase again, and started to trot down to the next car. It’s also empty. I can’t be too far from the conducting car, as this train usually only has 10 cars in total. I pushed forward to the next one. Empty. I continued this process, until I saw the conducting car in the window in front of me. Even from the back of the passenger car, I can see the lights and dials of an operating train, and a wave of relief came over me. *I’ll just ask the conductor what train I’m on, and what the next stop is.* I took a deep breath, feeling the warmth of the anxiety medication in my bones. *Finally, I can relax.* I walked calmly, to the conducting car and knocked on the window. Out of the front of the train, I can only see more tunnel. Speeding towards endless dots of orange light. There was no response from the conductor, and I knocked again. After another moment of no response, I pressed my face against the window. *There... Is no conductor?*

I lurched back from my discovery. This didn’t make sense, and in that moment a slew of questions came over me. *Who’s driving this train? Where am I going? How will I stop? How will I get home?* My thoughts raced in a panic. I dropped the briefcase and turned around towards the back of the train. I immediately noticed that the car doors behind me were closed. It didn’t take much more than a second for me to realize, but when I did, I flinched. *I... Didn’t close the doors.* I approached much more slowly and peeked through the glass into the second train car. Empty, with a closed door on the other end. Opening the doors still took a remarkable amount of force, and I briefly mentally chastised the maintenance workers. Before entering the next car, I shouted “Hello? Is anyone there?” My question was met with silence, except for the gentle grinding of wheels on metal, and the ambiance of the train. *This is a dangerous position,* I realized, *I can’t let my thoughts get ahead of me. The moment that I lose my control, my resolve, I am basically dead. Calm. Collected. I will find a solution.* *I will have plenty of time to reflect on this later, and later, I can smoke a cigarette and freak out as much as I need to – but for now, I need to remain calm.* I paused for a moment and realized that I had no game-plan. I thought for a moment and decided that I needed to go to the other end of the train. *Perhaps the conductor is on the rear of the train, for some reason*.

I pushed through the first few cars slowly, announcing my presence before walking into each one. Once I got into the 7th car, the lights flickered. Just once, but enough to make me pause and look around. The uncomfortable, cloth chairs covered in a hideous pattern seemed normal. The storage racks above the chairs, the lights. It all seemed fine. Once my composure was regained, I pressed forward. *Just a few more cars*. Pushing through these doors was starting to become strenuous after the exhaustion of the long day that I’ve had. I get to the last car and see the conduction car at the rear of the train, watching the orange lights whizz by at incredible speed. *Are we still accelerating?* I stared out the window until it became frightening, the lights are moving faster than they were. And that’s when I noticed. A moment of terror. I saw something on the ground. My briefcase. “But, that’s... that’s impossible! I left that at the front of the train...” The words frantically falling out of my mouth. With every revelation, I can feel my sanity fraying – bringing me closer to the edge of hysteria. I reached into my breast pocket and popped another pill. I collapsed next to my briefcase, and held my hands to my face, in a fetal position leaned against the wall. Hesitantly, I checked my watch. 10:32pm.

There was nothing I could do to stop it, the tears came, and I relentlessly cried. I felt alone and trapped and claustrophobic. *I miss Amanda.* *After this whole... FUCKING day, I just want to sit down and watch a shitty movie and bitch to her about all of it.* I wanted a cigarette. “Who’s gonna stop me” I choked out the words with a sad laugh. Pulling out the pack, I realized that I only had 4 cigarettes left, and I pulled one of them out. I wanted to relieve my stress, so I smoked slow and calmly. Leaving my ash on the dirty carpet of the train car brought a disgustingly satisfying feeling, like any cigarette smoked indoors. After I rubbed the butt into the metal and discarded it, the lights flickered three times. During each flicker, the train car had an ominous look, illuminated solely by the haunting orange lamps.

Then, I heard it. *Tick, Tick, Tick.* The sound was reminiscent of metal, on metal. I jolted my head up and listened closely again. *Tick, Tick, Tick.* The sound seemed to originate from under the train, and I wasn’t prepared for what happened next.

“LAST STOP. PLEASE EXIT THE TRAIN, ONCE THE TRAIN COMES TO A COMPLETE STOP.” A robotic female voice announced over the intercom. *Tick, Tick, Tick… Schunk.* The brakes on the train engaged, and it quickly reduced in speed, and rapidly slowed down. I watched the orange lamps as they slowed down, and for a very brief moment, the light seemed to distort to the image of a human skull – screaming in anguish. I stood, and held on to the seat next to me, and prepared for the train to stop. The train stopped, and I glared out the windows as the doors opened.

On the far side of the train, the side with no open doors, is the close edge of the tunnel. Separated every 10 or so feet, are the large orange lamps that cast an ominous glow across the whole space. On the near side of the train, is a platform. The platform stretches out a couple hundred feet, and there is a bright white light hanging over a single, black door. I pulled myself to my feet and checked my watch (10:35pm) and I cautiously made my way down the steps onto the platform. 

Much to my surprise, I was not the only person who stepped off the train. From the car to my left, and to my right, stepped out a man and a woman. They look equally surprised to see me, and before I could retreat onto the train, the door slid closed. Moments later, the train started to roll off, in the same direction it was headed. All three of us were frozen, not wanting to be the first one to say something. After an uncomfortable minute, the man spoke up.

“So, uh... I didn’t see either of y’all on the train – and trust me, I looked.” He says while scratching his head. He’s slowly stepping away from us, casually moving towards the black door. He’s wearing a black tee-shirt with a white skull on it, with his hair pull into a tight knot on top of his head. “I’m Eric.”

The young girl speaks up, “Amber.” She says with a stern scowl on her face. Her pink hair, catching the light and sparkling gently. 

“What about you, old man?” Says Eric.

“Steven... Steven Gray.”

“Where are we, Steven?” He says interrogatively  
 “How am I supposed to know?!” I paused “I just got on the train to get home – Or so I thought. I just want to go home to my wife.” 

Steven pauses, as if he is processing.

“Hm. Okay. What about you, *Amber*.” He uses a mocking tone. 

She rolls her eyes and crosses her arms. “Fuck you, why don’t you tell us where we are?”

They start bickering, calling each other nasty names. Just as I was about to step in, Eric says “Alright, I like ya. So…” He pauses and looks at me “What’s the plan?”

No one responds. He points at the door, “So, are we just gonna go into the creepy fucking black door? I don’t think there’s anything else within miles of here.”

I shout “Hello?” and the echo responds again, and again, and again. While we are standing there, the orange lamps seemed to be getting brighter. In the distance, far down the tunnel, I hear a noise. *Skitter.* “No matter what our options, we best make a decision soon. I have a really bad feeling about this place.” And, with those words, Eric pressed forward towards the door.

Amber is in the middle, so that in an emergency she can be protected by either myself or Eric. He opens the door. Just on the other side, as a contrast to the dark, ominous orange glow, is a room filled with florescent light. As we step through the threshold, I realize that this room is an operating theater. There are plexiglass panels separating the operation area from the seats, and there is a semicircle of empty chairs ascending above us at an angle. In the middle of the room, is a metal table, with leather restraints built in. There is no blood, or instruments, just a cold metal table, with a set of double doors on the far side of the theater. As we walked in, no one said anything – We just looked at each other bewildered.

Eric, continued with the lead, moved towards the doors as he realized that there was nothing helpful in this room for us. He pressed his hands to the swinging doors, and as he applied pressure, a small hypo-needle fly’s out from some place unidentified and stabs him in the arm. I catch a glimpse of a black fluid being deposited into his body as he shouts, “What the fuck?” He continues to push the door open and reveals a dark hallway.

“Eric... Are you okay?” I asked, sheepishly.

“This shit burns.” He scowls, as he removes the needle from his arm, throwing it to the ground. The tubule shatters as it lands.

“Let me look” I say as I approach him, pulling the sleeve of his shirt up his arm. I was not prepared for what I saw.

The black liquid had spilled out on his skin, and there were black droplets that were dripping down his arm. In their wake, are fleshy lesions, starting to bubble with pus. His entire arm is discolored, at this point, carrying a sickly gray hue. The black droplets run down his elbow and drop onto the floor – and disappear entirely. “Put your shirt over your mouth, now!” I say as I untuck my shirt and pull it up “That shit is airborne”.

90 seconds after this injection, we realize how dire the circumstance is. Amber and I just stand back and watch as tender patches of skin flake off, revealing the infected muscle below. The muscles are twitching, and writhing, and small, peculiar growths are appearing between the muscular edges. Eric falls to the ground and is grasping at his arm. *There is no blood.* Several of the small growths on his arm have grown to resemble small black spheres. *Sacs of black pus, maybe?* From under the muscle, there is a spray of a coagulated dark goo, as animated tendrils writhe in the air. Eric is screaming and pulling at the infected muscle. The tendrils latch onto his hand as he grasps the muscle, leaving acidic burns on his hand. 

Eric’s eyes roll back, and he begins convulsing. The convulsions have caused his shirt to ride up, and you can see black veins spread across his stomach. Blood is pouring out of his mouth, and several of the tendrils have emerged from the infected muscle. *Pop!* The muscle has severed itself and fallen to the ground. The tendrils continue to move. The muscle rises, held up by them, and it flips over to reveal a black mouth full of... *Teeth?* I stagger away, pulling Amber behind me. The creature runs on its tendrils, charging quickly at me. I use all my force and kick it as hard as I can. It hits the wall, across the theater. The damage seems that it was sufficient, as the creature stopped charging and is sitting on the floor twitching. I fall to my knees, keeping a careful eye on the creature, and try to help Eric.

As soon as I lay my hands on him, he stops convulsing. His body is incredibly hot, and he is entirely unresponsive. His skin feels like melted rubber, and it’s sloughing off his body. I pull up his shirt and jump away when I realize what I see. His stomach has been ripped open, and his entrails are floating in a soup of black fluid and gore. His ribs have been shifted lower and rotated 90 degrees, and now his eviscerated stomach looks like a grotesque mouth. I stare agape at the horror in front of me. I hear Amber shout and turn to see the creature wrapped around her forearm. Her face is distorted into pain and shock, and she screams for help.

Reacting on adrenaline fueled instinct, I wrap my hands around the muscular creature and pull it off her – throwing it at the wall. It hits with a *splat,* and I run over and stomp on it, again and again and again. After a solid minute of stomping, it stops writhing. I can feel the black fluid on my hands, and it burns. Immediately, I start rubbing my hands on my pants and shirt, trying to get the fluid off. I look at Amber, and her forearm is raw, with some muscles being visible from the surface. She’s bleeding profusely. *She’s bleeding, that’s a good sign, at least.* I wrap my overshirt around her wounds – my hands are in much better condition than her arm is, but she looks like she will be okay.

We both take a moment to breathe, and I ask her “Do you smoke?” She nods, and I pull two out from the pack. I light them both, and we both get a deep breath in. “Thank god we are both okay.” I say, just trying to fill the silence. She nods and lets a couple of tears fall on her cheeks. We both sit in silence, for a few minutes. From Eric’s corpse, I hear a quiet noise. I put my fingers to my lips, and point at Eric, and we both listen. He’s making an atrocious gurgling noise. *My god! What happened to his eyes?* His eyes are just visceral remnants of the life that they once held, leaving gaping black sockets in their wake. “Let me see your wound, so I can make sure you’re not infected.” I whisper, and when I look back at her, her eyes are filled with fear. 

Slowly I turn around and recoil at what I see. Eric – or whatever was left of eric – was standing. His back, and torso was contorted behind him, like he had been broken in half, dripping black fluid out of his eye sockets. The gaping maw now has two thick tendrils with his eyeballs attached to the end, which are slowly scanning the room in an unending gaze. There are a multitude of other fluid covered tendrils and tentacles emerging from in between his innards, flailing wildly above the corpse. Neither Amber or I make a move, or sound. Watching this beast, shuffle around the Operating theater. Eric’s arms drag on the ground, smearing the black fluid behind it. The smaller creature, the muscle, starts to skitter again. As soon as the larger creature senses the movement, it lunges with its tentacles forward and grabs the muscle. It holds it in its grim mouth, and tears it to shreds, swallowing the remanent pieces.

Amber and I are unsure what to do, aside from keeping perfectly still. The beast is slowly walking circles around us, its tentacles getting ever closer and closer. My eyes go wide, as I notice that amber’s cigarette is getting dangerously small – closer and closer to burning her. *Is... Is that the only way to get out of this?* I am weighing my options. *I just… I just want to get back home to my wife.* I look Amber in the eyes. *I am so, so, sorry.* And I push her off the operating table.

The beast reacts with fury, and incredible speed, it’s tentacles almost catch her before she hits the ground. I’ve never seen such a look of pure shock and betrayal. Her arms splay out in front of her, as she falls to the ground behind. I watch, for a moment, to see the oozing tentacles wrap around her and the beast starts chewing. As soon as it is distracted, I make a break for it and start running as fast as I can into the darkness in front of us. I take once glance behind me as I run, and see her pleading for help and for God, as one of the beasts’ eyes spins on its axis to follow me as I break into the darkness.

*Oh my god, I can’t believe that I did that. I’m… I’m a murderer! I should’ve been the one to take the fall.*  I was in tears, as I ran further down the hallway. I’m not even sure how far I made it before I fell, but it seems that this tunnel just goes in a straight line. Eventually, the tears and exhaustion broke me, and I hit the ground hard. I was too exhausted even to try and catch myself, and I lost my breath the moment I landed. Looking behind me, I don’t see the fluorescent light where I left Amber. *My God, Amber… I am so sorry. It was either me or you, and… I can’t let anything stop me from apologizing to my wife. I love her, and I need to quit my job. I need to make everything right again.*

It took me several minutes before I could stand again. I feel like a broken man. *What did I do to deserve this?* Eventually, I pulled myself to my knees. From my knees, I was able to pull myself up. *Where am I?* *Where does this tunnel go?* I must push on. I reach into my pocket and pull out my lighter. I flick it, and the light is scattered across the walls. The little fire throws it reach over the wall, catching shadows on chips of paint. I take my first step, and that leads into the next. After several, I was walking in a cadence regardless of the pain in my limbs. *Nothing is broken, and that’s important.* As I take slow steps, pushing forward into the darkness. It is near silent, with my own shallow breaths and limping footsteps creating a deafening symphony echoing down the hall. I stop – something caught my eye. A brown splatter, on the floor in front of me. *Dried Blood? What the hell is this place?* And that’s when I saw it.

Amanda and I met, in an environmental protection group, many years ago. When we first met, I had a splattering of mustard, from a hot dog incident, all over my shirt. I never forgot the way she laughed at me. We shared our first kiss, under a full moon on one of the beaches in San Diego – The air smelled like sea salt and roses, on our first date. Our wedding was a beautiful naturalist display. Flowers, ferns, and even feeders for natural wildlife deep in the wilderness. Our wedding night, we spent searching each other for ticks. We never had children, we were always waiting until we had successfully saved the environment and staved off global warming. We’ve lost pets, friends, and family. Anymore, Amanda and I only have each other and the love that we share is pure and true. I will never forget the hardest and the easiest times with her. Her love keeps me going, and even in this… hellscape, her love pushes me forward, so that I can come home to her.

The flickering rays cast by the lighter, danced and hesitated to show me what was in front of me. It took all my strength, all my willpower, not to scream and drop to the ground. The first thing that I noticed, were a half dozen skeletons, pressed against the walls. This tunnel had become their tomb, and even in various states of decomposition, you could read torment on their faces. They each have a hole, the size of a fist in their foreheads. *I wonder what that is?* The smell was overwhelming, and I instinctively pulled my jacket over my nose. Following the image upwards, I noticed fleshy *strings* wrapped around the corpses. Tying ribs together, stretching across some of the more decomposed areas of the remains. Thicker strands of this beige flesh stretch from the corpses, and further down the hallway beyond my sight, meaty ribbons tautly stretched into obscuration. I take a small step forward, and I recoil with the sight.

I see a fleshy node, like the shape and structure of a neuron, suspended in the middle of the hallway. Meaty appendages reach from the node to the walls and floors, suspending it perfectly in the middle of the hallway – cast in a net of viscera. This nucleus had the same flesh-colored tones, but under its transparent skin, you can see bubbles of black fluid between layers. This distorted visage wrought the smallest scream, smothered hastily by my own hand. The entire structure shivered. Additional length of tunnel continues behind this node but continuing without touching one of the lengths of flesh would be a challenge for the most accomplished contortionist. On closer examination, even in the areas without the larger growths, there are thin hair-like strands that stretch from the thicker appendages to the wall. 

*Shit.* Shuffling noises, the sound of feet being dragged across the ground are behind me in the distance. *It’s now, or never.* I knew I had to go. I pick the area with the smallest number of threads, in between two of the larger appendages, one reaching above my body, and one reaching below. I back up and prepare to throw myself through. *The faster I get through the web, the less harm it can do*. My logic felt sound, as I ran and dove. The threads felt like razor blades, made of fire. They cut my hands, but fortunately, they broke before my face. I felt cuts across the sides of my hands, and I could feel a few of them that had reached the bone. It feels like slow motion, and I realize my most foolish mistake. I didn’t dive far enough. Just above the ankle, my leg brushed against one of the larger tendrils. On the contact, it swells with black fluid and detaches from the wall, wrapping itself around my leg. The pain is immeasurable, and I instinctively scream in agony. Carefully, I use my bloody hand to try and unravel the constricting tendril. It brings more pain than I believed possible, but I managed to detach it from my limb. The tendril immediately buries itself into the tile floor. I hold the lighter above my wound to assess the damage. I see no black fluid in the wound, and through the arterial bleeding, I can see an acidic ridge cut into my tissue. *Fuck.* The pain is agonizing. I have no choice but to press forward. My bloody hands, leaving streaks of my sprawled body across the floor, with a spreading puddle following my leg. I reach into my breast pocket, and remove my last cigarette, and with bloody and nervous hands, I light it.

I am so disoriented, that I almost don’t hear it. A rhythmic *tick, tick, tick*, slowly approaching me from further down the tunnel. Survival instinct takes over, and I press myself against the wall, and get ready to defend myself. Slowly revealing itself in my candlelight, is a human brain, suspended on black legs resembling a spider. Like the beast, earlier, the optic nerves have been stretched, and two unblinking eyes examine me from head to toe. Small reservoirs of black fluid are visible inside the white of the eyes. It approaches, and trying to scare it off, I swing a delirious fist at it. It takes one small step back, and while my hand is recovering from the swing, it leaps. Two of its legs, land on my arm, burying themselves like needles into my muscle, while two fangs dig into my hand – just above the knuckle. The pain almost immediately goes away, but with the loss of feeling comes the loss of control. I can no-longer move my hand.

The paralysis spreads deeper into my body. First, my hand. Then, my forearm and elbow. Bicep. As soon as the feeling reaches my torso, I can no longer move any part of my body. The pain washes away, and I am given the blessing of painlessness. I am almost absorbed by the tranquility, the beautiful oceanic cloud that I have been given to rest upon. I barely notice, as the “spider” slowly positions itself over my face. I watch, barely present, as a long and hollow stinger emerges from the brainstem of this “spider”. Every move calculated; it slowly slides the stinger into my eye. I smile, just a little bit. I go blind in my right eye, almost immediately. I feel a lump being deposited, just behind my eye. The stinger retracts, and the spider disappears into the darkness from whence it came. 

Some time later, it could be minutes, or hours, my lighter extinguished. I am left, cold and alone in this bloody broken hallway. *I am now a living host. I have a parasite, in my brain, a spider egg. My purpose is to become the home for a new spider. I love spiders. I love all living things. I love my wife. I love the train. I love cigarettes. And now, I must wait for my baby to come out. I hope that you are big and strong, baby. I love you.*"

I took PCBME during my class 12th and scored pretty decently and did equally well in maths and biology. I faced some health issues while preparing for NEET and ended up dropping two years after 12th. I qualified for govt engineering colleges, veterinary and central universities for my bachelors but I thought of joining a mediocre govt college near my house so that I could prepare for NEET. I scored well but ended up missing the govt college cut offs every time and last year I could not appear because of undergoing a surgery. I have decided not to appear this year because I need to get a well paying job as soon as possible due to financial issues. 

I had taken up computer science courses on Edx but could not complete them due to other commitments. I am interested in learning programming as I had planned to go for bioinformatics and related fields because pure zoology did not interest me. 

———————————————————————————-

Now I’m in a dilemma if I should take a programming diploma from a reputed college, build my cv by doing internships and projects and simultaneously prepare for masters or should I prepare for CAT/MAT instead of masters in biological sciences. Or should I take up masters wherever I get this year.

Tl;dr : I’m completing my bachelors in Zoology this year and do not wish to go for masters in this subject. Instead I want to go for job oriented courses in computer sciences and prepare for CAT simultaneously. I need inputs on other options that I should consider to score a well paying job. 

Please suggest some options because these are the best I could think of."

I am doing a Deep Learning internship at a small startup (lets call it ST). Last year, I had done a two month full stack (Angular + Spring Boot) internship at a big company (non-FAANG, lets call it MNC). The year before I did a 2 month project internship in Deep Learning (not related to MNC or ST). ST doesn't pay well (I'm 22 in my parents house, so salary doesn't matter much to me) but MNC doesn't have many projects in Deep Learning. I have a full time employment offer from both companies.

&amp;#x200B;

I find that Deep Learning is extremely challenging and forces me to think and learn every day. Whereas, Full stack seems to be easier and more copy-paste friendly, but most of the thinking is done over versions or other tiny details.

&amp;#x200B;

Also I'm not sure whether I want to do higher studies. If I do, it would certainly be in a Data Science stream, after working for a few years. My GPA and college achievements are pretty mediocre, but I'm hoping my GitHub projects, my one published research paper (a few more in the future), some coding contests and the entrance examination (GRE/GATE (the Indian equivalent of GRE)) will help me with the admissions. Taking this into account, I believe that Data Science experience for 2-3 years would help me more than the equivalent Full Stack experience.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I also think that working at a startup may make it harder to join a large corporation (like FAANG) in the future. I'm in a bind. Can you guys help me make a decision? Which job do you feel is more rewarding in terms of satisfaction and salary? Which one would last further into the future (future-proof)? Which one is more lucrative on a Resume?"

background: 4th year undergrad computer science student with good fullstack internship experience/part-time.

I am looking to break into the Data Science/ML field, I understand (correct me if im wrong) that in general it doesnt matter what you take at uni, it matters more what u learn or focus on in your personal time. After graduating I have the chance to get my masters degree in only 6 months, at this same university. I would have taken courses such as ML, Data engineering, Computer Vision, AI, Computer and network security, Data Mining and other courses that arent so relevant to the fields. It's a master's degree in Computer Science with no specific focus on ML/DS. I feel like this is a good opportunity as it will be much cheaper and much less time consuming than other masters courses.

My 2 main concerns are

1. I may be overlooked by someone who has a more specialized masters degree (Masters in DS/ML), as I understand its difficult to get a good job in ML/DS without a masters degree or even a phd
2. The uni name is one of the best if not the best in my country, however it is much worse than other universities worldwide, im worried that a masters from a somewhat not widely recognized uni is not worth it as I plan to move abroad

My other option would be to wait for a scholarship or throw a ton of money away, and spend 2 years doing a masters at another uni, which may have a better name, but it definitely wont be of harvard/mit level since my GPA isnt the best and may also be a more specialized masters program.

background: 4th year undergrad computer science student with good fullstack internship experience/part-time.

I am looking to break into the Data Science/ML field, I understand (correct me if im wrong) that in general it doesnt matter what you take at uni, it matters more what u learn or focus on in your personal time. After graduating I have the chance to get my masters degree in only 6 months, at this same university. I would have taken courses such as ML, Data engineering, Computer Vision, AI, Computer and network security, Data Mining and other courses that arent so relevant to the fields. It's a master's degree in Computer Science with no specific focus on ML/DS. I feel like this is a good opportunity as it will be much cheaper and much less time consuming than other masters courses.

My 2 main concerns are

1. I may be overlooked by someone who has a more specialized masters degree (Masters in DS/ML), as I understand its difficult to get a good job in ML/DS without a masters degree or even a phd
2. The uni name is one of the best if not the best in my country, however it is much worse than other universities worldwide, im worried that a masters from a somewhat not widely recognized uni is not worth it as I plan to move abroad

My other option would be to wait for a scholarship or throw a ton of money away, and spend 2 years doing a masters at another uni, which may have a better name, but it definitely wont be of harvard/mit level since my GPA isnt the best and may also be a more specialized masters program.

I started learning about Devops/IT about a year and a half ago through self-hosting a number of applications. I started with a raspberry pi as a bare metal nginx server where I hosted my first website. I eventually migrated to an old desktop where I now run proxmox and started using docker inside VM's to run my services; then expanding to other applications like gitlab, nextcloud, uptime-kuma, the grafana labs stack, etc. Within recent months I've scrapped the docker setup and migrated everything to a virtualized k8s cluster (install-able completely via ansible script) where I use traefik, cert-manager, and metallb to expose my workloads. I'm using kubescape to maintain best security practices and I've even started integrating technologies like ArgoCD and Crossplane to create my own internal developer platform (myself being the developer to consume such). I'm also an incoming junior-level transfer to UCLA CS Engr. so I'm no stranger to programming in general.

I suppose my biggest question is how this knowledge translates to workforce positions. Is this level of understanding typical for an intern or entry-level employee?

I'm a 17 y/o student that just graduated from my local high school.

Moreover, I'm not entirely sure what to look. I have relatively decent fullstack portfolio projects that exhibit all of my skills.

Any tips or advice? Also, should I undersell myself given my age? I'm aware for a summer internship / job I wouldn't exactly be paid as if I was a full time software engineer, but I also don't want the measly $15 / hr minimum wage for work that would normally be $45 / hr.

Earlier today at work, a product manager messaged me and asked if I could explain how to do the current project I'm working on to a new intern. My coworker who was working on the same project has been out sick since 2 days ago. So, the manager thought extra eyes and hands would help move things along.

I told him ""Sure!"" 

But I died inside. 

A teams meeting with someone new? I have to EXPLAIN things? I have to make sure this new person understands what I'm saying without making a fool of myself????

I messaged the new guy, introduced myself, welcomed him to the team, and asked him if he would like to set up a meeting for today or tomorrow. 

In my head I was like, ""Please say tomorrow. Please say tomorrow. Please say tomorrow.""

He told me his availability for today and added that if those times didn't work, we could set up a time for tomorrow. 

I remembered that the Slack channel I was in was shared with the manager....

I told him today would be fine. 

I found myself entering incorrect data on the excel sheet I was working on. I did the same row twice without meaning to. I clicked play on a video, but I zoned out throughout the whole thing. I had to watch it all over again.

I was wearing Loop plugs in my ears to block out noise, and all I could hear was my heart thumping in my chest. Listening to my heart beat so fast made me even more anxious. 

Coincidentally, I had a meeting with my therapist set up for today. An hour before my meeting with the intern.

Talking to her about my insecurities made me feel so much better. She helped me to realize I could do quite a few things:

+ Have my camera off during the meeting
+ Share my screen so he could see the excel sheet and any additional documents that could help explain
+ Ask him if what I'm saying makes sense or if he's confused about anything so I can clarify


My therapist was a great help.

My meeting with the intern came around and after breaking the ice a bit (""Hi. How are you. Nice to meet you. Do you prefer to be called this or that? Welcome to the team! etc.) I got right into it. 

My cam was off. I shared my screen. I switched back and forth between the excel sheet and a word document to help me explain and to help the intern understand using visuals. I was basically giving a presentation on how to do the work. 

I realized during the meeting that my voice was shaky and becoming weaker and weaker. I don't usually talk that much. My throat was started to hurt, and it felt like I was losing my voice. I silently hoped he wouldn't notice or that if he did, he wouldn't mention it.

He had questions. I answered them. He confirmed his understanding, and before I knew it the meeting was coming to a close. I told him if he had any questions or needed any examples then he could Slack me or refer to the engineers if I can't help him with his question. I emailed him the documents he would need, and that was it.

I did it.

I made it.

My throat hurts and it's all over.

But seriously...

I hate having bombs dropped on me so unexpectedly like that. I'm the sort of person that needs lots of prep time before speaking to anyone to gather my thoughts and organize what I'm going to say. I need time to adjust to the changes because changes/transitions are not my cup of tea. 

I have autism and adhd, so communication is NOT my strong point. I don't care how many people express surprise when I tell them I'm not good at communicating or socializing. (""Really? You seem like you communicate fluently to me.) No! It's a struggle. They may not see it on my face, but inside I am in crisis mode. Literally, I'm in fight or flight mode. Mostly flight mode. 

I'm using up all of my energy. I'm tense. I'm stressed. I'm fighting an entire battle you can't even see. 

During the meeting, I swear it felt like my brain was on fire. 🔥

😮‍💨

That wore me out. 

And to think I liked my job at first..."

In terms of job prospects, is it better to be a top student at a lower tier school than in the &lt;50th percentile at an ivy/T10 for CS?

For example, you’re a student at MIT. You’re competing for FAANG internships with all the genius kids at MIT and other comparable schools. However, FAANG isn’t going to hire kids from only these schools so isn’t it likely that those not at the top of their class will have a more difficult time getting one of those internship spots? 

In the other scenario you’re a student at a school not well known for CS but you’re a “big fish in a small pond”. Wouldn’t this mean that you’d have a much better chance of securing an internship at those companies? 

Of course there’s lots of other well-paying companies, I’m using FAANG only as an example."

I'm a Junior right now and my sophomore year was....less than ideal.   
I mean, I was a solid A student, then in Sophomore year it just didn't work anymore. I mean, I got 3 C-'s (one in AP Chemistry, although somehow I got a 5 on the AP test??) I only got one A (In PE) and everything else was a B-. I don't even know how I can explain it away in college essays. I had genuine emotional abuse going on from my mother to the point where my dad literally had to make sure she wouldnt talk to me when I was at home, but even then there was so much shit going on outside and even though my dad was trying his absolute best to keep me without stress I was still taking care of most of the mid-sized house chores and helping my siblings with school, stress, and just general everything.   


I mean, my GPA is currently a 3.8 (Or at least it will be once Junior Year finishes.) However, I have some things to back it up....  
I had a ""mentor"" at NASA who helped me to work on a project indirectly with the people at NASA. I worked the astrophysics area, and I've been working it since the beginning of sophomore year. I had the chance to do actual, genuine, research as well as learn how to code and use tools that people normally learn to use in undergrad.   
I am really into physics, particularly astro and quantum, so I had an internship between sophomore and junior year that had to do with Quantum Physics. I worked with a PhD and I'm really happy with how my report and research came out.   
In the same summer, I took a quantum computing course by a leading company and learned to work with quantum computers. I really liked it, and I have a lot to show for it.   
I'm currently working with a friend on a product to help deal with agricultural air pollution. I'm not sure how far we will get into it by senior year, but we have an idea and I want to see it fly.   
This summer, I will intern with NASA, and I'm looking into doing another research project next year in quantum.   


My GPA though....Is not good. Also, my counselor genuinely hates me. She isn't good and shes almost gotten fired 6 times because of how stressed she can make students, but I'm stuck with her so the colleges that require a counselor reccomondation i'm screwed with   
Oh, also, 1580 SAT, 36 ACT  
I've taken 5 AP's so far, and my weighted is still a 3.80. I think I'm screwed for academics, but does anyone still think I have a chance for any top 50 school? I don't know if i should talk about my issues for college essays since theyre pretty normal. Its just the ""I'm the eldest daughter and so my mother hates me yada yada she used to gaslight me into thinking when I was sick i was making it up because I was stressed and to just push through it and when I was dying from pnumonia from covid she ranted to my dad about how I can't bring anything to this family because of grades and i also help out around the house a lot because im the oldest of three kids"" its like the same thing theyve heard from countless other eldest daughters or just people in general  
Oh last note, I am a year younger than everyone in my grade (by a solid amount, my best friend is in the middle for the grade and he is a year and a half older than me) and I have no academic outside clubs. I'm one of only 5 girls in my physics club which has 40 other guys and thats kinda it.   


Now, can anyone give me any advice on how to add to my application because I know I'm not goint to make it in anywhere like T20 or T40 because of my grades but at least T50 or T60 I'm aiming for. Even then, I have nothing against a solid state school, people are always so mad about how they have higher gpas and theyre better than everyone and its like stfu I could get the same education as u in a state school for less money okay it only really matters when u get into graduate or masters so stfu. But, I do want to know what I can do to better myself in the eyes of colleges."

v3qtli,58,2022-06-02,Scared of future career prospects,mohinem_2,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/v3qtli/scared_of_future_career_prospects/,"Hello guys ! I am currently pursuing my masters' in computer science from a university in Europe (Switzerland) and about to graduate. I am in a huge trouble regarding future career prospects.

I have good problem solving skills via competitive programming (cp) and doing recreational mathematics. However, I wasn't able to build up on my base and improve my software engineering skills. I have a few years of experience, but its all garbage. I was a mainframe developer in my first job. In my first job, I thought I can safely ignore my daily tasks and focus on arbitrary internet points solving strange problems on platforms like Codeforces. I was obssessed with codeforces ratings and thought, its now or never. I started ignoring my work and used most of my office time to solve such problems, while being paid. However, I soon started to see an impact on my career. I was being shuffled across teams, and finally put into support role. I used to rush from my office to home, to compete in codeforces contests without distractions, and felt tired and exhausted. I decided to quit my first job and focus solely on competitive programming till I get exhausted. I did it for 6 months, but soon landed a new job with a hefty pay raise. I was already feeling tired of competitive programming, and decided to finally focus on job. The pay was too great hehe.

However, I was doing bad in my second job as well. This time, I had stopped cp. My work involved frontend development using Angular. I was doing bad again, and there were lots of performance issues. Soon, I was involved in e2e testing using Cucumber and protractor. It was absolutely terrible, and I was annoyed. I started to skip scrum meetings and even skipped a one-on-one with my manager. Needless to say, I was fired.

However, within 2 days of getting fired, I got an offer to study masters' in computer science in Europe, with scholarship. It was fun and looked a good opportunity to explore Europe (I am from India). So I joined.

I did well in one of the courses involving object oriented programming and problem solving. I found studying machine learning fun, and I had an unpaid internship involving comparing performances of object oriented models, which was ok-ish. However, I still sucked big time in actual software development. In my capstone project, I required a lot of intensive support from other students to do my tasks. We used django for backend and react for frontend. Right now, my masters' thesis involves engineering work on an esoteric programming language. It's again going so bad that my advisor has started doing the work for me, just so I can graduate. At this point, I have a PhD offer in array databases. I am now quite concerned about my future. The work will pretty much involve software engineering, and given my history sucking big time across companies, environments and technologies, I am scared. At this stage, I might even fail the masters' because of thesis work. I just hope I somehow complete my thesis and barely pass.

Its kinda strange, on one hand I get new offers, on the other hand, I do really bad at every place. I am bad in actual work. I don't have a good command over git. It looks like I am more suited for theoretical work with some dose of math. I am not sure if I join the PhD. However, I am unwilling to let it go, because its a good opportunity to earn a German visa (yes, its in Germany). Also, I suspect of having ADHD, so I can get a diagnosis and treatment from the German healthcare (can't afford Swiss ones, they have minimum amount which isn't covered and stuff). I had really bad grades in my bachelors' and failed in 6 subjects (yet somehow managed to pass). I have a fucked up routine, and my workout schedule is erratic.

I talked to one friend, he said I don't have experience and just need to intern somewhere. However, with so many opportunities, I doubt if that helps.

Anyway, I require your advice on what to do in this situation."

v3r3gx,4,2022-06-03,The Dilemma of Transferring,Rxlentless,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/v3r3gx/the_dilemma_of_transferring/,"As a rising junior CS major, it’s common to see all of your classmates drop out, change majors, or transfer to a different school especially if yours isn’t known for CS. I’ve run in to this problem. 

The CS program is very small, but there are lots of networking events, internship opportunities, and ways to get jobs that the school will help with, even though it is a liberal arts college.

Before anyone opens the gates of hell and unleashes their condescending fury about how I went to a liberal arts college for CS, I’ve heard it all already. I went in as undecided.

Anyways, back to my problem. I don’t want to transfer. I’ve landed a job as a community advisor which gives free housing, and I still have my HOPE scholarship (state scholarship, pays like 85%?) 

Point is, graduating from here with a CS bachelors degree is not bad, but I am tempted to transfer to somewhere like Georgia Tech. I don’t really have friends here, as almost all of them have transferred. There are very few students in the CS program and as a result there are really no tutors besides the professor office hours. I don’t know what to do.

My main goal is to just get the degree and not be a burden on my parents, but it is insanely demoralizing to feel like the only computer science student at the college, since those above my level are clearing assignments in a day and those below my level switch majors or transfer. It just feels like an entirely solo journey and it’s hard. I failed one of my computer classes and that sets me a semester behind so I probably won’t have any classes with my last two friends again. 

If anyone has been in a similar situation, what did you consider when making your decision? And do you regret it?"

Let me preface by the fact that I’m a rising senior, first gen low income immigrant attending an Ivy League school and set to start an internship in nyc this Monday. Boo hoo so sad for me I know. 

The thing is, I don’t want to. Last summer I interned at another bank in another back office non finance job and while it was fine and the people were nice it wasn’t anything I wanted to do and told myself I didn’t want to work at a bank again. For context, I’m an econ major and marketing minor. My gpa is 3.6 and I have club/leadership involvement. Because I really enjoyed my marketing &amp; data classes I applied to a lot of those relevant jobs. I didn’t get one interview.

As a safety and to give a different role in another bank a chance (I.e. explore my options) I had also applied to positions that seemed interesting (think compliance, operations, risk). I got interviews and multiple offers from top us banks. I accepted in October as a safety since I hadn’t heard back from the companies I actually wanted to work for. As I said before, I didn’t get a single interview and the rejections slowly came in around March and April. 

Well now it’s really setting in that this summer I’m not getting closer to any goal. I don’t know what I want to do career wise and I’m doing an internship that I know is irrelevant to my interests. I feel so fake chatting with my managers and peer mentors and feel like I’m wasting everyone’s time considering I know I don’t want to work there full time or in the industry at all (which is obviously the point of the internship). 

I feel so defeated because I feel that instead of exploring another career path I may like and enjoy (marketing or literally anything else) I’m going to be doing a job that I know I probably won’t like enough to commit to and also took this opportunity from someone who would want it.

I also feel so guilty because I feel like I’m wasting the education I worked my whole life towards and the sacrifices my parents made to come to this country ( who btw aren’t pressuring me or really even know what I’m doing career wise; for other reasons LC). 

I just wish I was passionate about something and could thus pursue it instead of feeling so lost and guilty all the time because I feel like I’m wasting this time. It makes me want to just quit and run away to a small town where no one knows me and just work enough to get by. LOL.

I am an international student planning to do CS in Australia and considering masters in the states. I have been offered both unimelb and usyd CS courses. I am really struggling to choose..

I'm planning to perhaps go into quant although it's just a thought since it's really competitive.

Unimelb Pros:

1. I love the city, the vibes, friendlier people and more activities
2. apparently, unimelb CS is more theory based..? which may be more helpful if I wanna pursue a master's degree
3. Cheaper

Unimelb Cons:

1. 3 years degree (States normally need 4 years to be eligible for masters)
2. students don't really get as much practical experience
3. internship, networking and job opportunities are behind compared to sydney

USYD Pros:

1. Sydney is the hub for Tech; all the HQ of big tech firms, which means easier networking and intern opportunities
2. 4 year program (3yrs + 1 yr honors)
3. More structured program compared to melb and I can get to major in statistical math or another math-related major at the same time.

USYD Cons:

1. A lot more expensive, and city life isn't as great as melb imo
2. according to most rankings, melb is higher and more recognized internationally including in the states? (but idk if rankings are trustable)
3. I have heard that the usyd course isn't that well taught (by word of mouth though)

Please do share your thought! Thank you"

v3ufgr,178,2022-06-03,My job search was humiliating and now I advocate for major flexibility at UIUC,depresseddais,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/v3ufgr/my_job_search_was_humiliating_and_now_i_advocate/,"If I told my high school self that I would be making below 45,000 working in retail after 4 years of college, I don't think I would've invested just above 6 figures to go to school again. I knew this was a possibility as a history major but advisors and humanities career services kept pushing me to continue studying what I liked instead of what makes money. I guess I am now paying for it. Even a perfect GPA and internships couldn't save me from this fate. Rejection after rejection from jobs that I thought I would at least land an interview for makes me feel like my degree and time spent is worthless. I feel like what could save many others from this fate is increased major flexibility at UIUC.

The lack of major flexibility at UIUC is pretty sickening for a school with a liberal arts and science school. The engineering and CS majors are quite far apart from everyone else in terms of post graduate outcomes, resources, and tuition (which is a good thing). I personally knew many humanities majors who wanted to double major in something like CS (+X) to have some backup in the job market but the school's structure of declaring/applying to the CS department makes it very difficult for humanities majors 3 semesters into college. I even have friends in more technical majors such as information science, finance, and stats who are having a tough time finding a job after being turned down for double majors/transfers with CS. 

This is just a rant from a salty jobless guy but I feel like the lack of major flexibility screws over way too many humanities majors in the job market and continues to promote elitist CS culture at the school. I personally think that UIUC should implement a system similar to Cal Berkeley for the Liberal Arts and Science school where you can explore a variety of subjects before declaring a major. This would help humanities majors significantly and turn the image of UIUC to an well rounded school instead of a CS and engineering school"

Basically, life has thrown me a bunch of curveballs and because of that my mental health is lower than it has ever been. I'm thinking of going back on medication but I am wondering if taking this alternate path might be better for my mental health. It's been getting harder and harder to get out of bed to slog through the day and I've been falling behind on my deadlines because of it. I get anxiety as I am worried that I might fail my honours project at the end of the year and I end up just feeling so exhausted at the end of every day. I'm thinking of taking the next few months off and work on small side projects in my downtime so I don't regress on my technical abilities.

I was hoping to get some advice regarding getting onto a good grad scheme in England.

I'm a second year student at a top 10 CS university, and I'm graduating next year.

Due to some mental health issues, I was not able to put in the effort to get an internship for this summer, and I haven't done one before. However, I plan on working as a freelance web developer over summer and I was accepted onto a scheme my university runs for start-ups and freelancers. That will help with some funding and will also involve workshops and networking opportunities.

I have a lot of development experience through my own endeavours. I've pretty much tried everything, and from working with my peers and also talking to those at other universities, I would say I'm significantly more experienced than most students. I don't mean to brag, it's just what I've observed.

However, I don't have many presentable projects. I have ADHD which makes it very easy to switch between things, though I do always get a good understanding before moving on. This was great for learning new ideas and technologies, but I'm worried about adding things to my CV/GitHub. I do have some coursework stuff up there at the moment. Over summer, I'm also planning on making one very solid project which involves a text-based multiplayer online game that uses web sockets. I will use Go to make it concurrent. 

I'll also be doing two unique projects next year as part of my course, so I'm sure those will help too.

The websites I'll be making will primarily be brochure sites with a contact form. Though, some will need a headless CMS which will involve setting up AWS S3 and AWS Aurora. I'll also be hosting them all myself using a commercial control panel, and everything is powered by SvelteKit.

Anyway, I'm wondering if anyone knows what I should do about getting a good job lined up for after uni. To be honest I don't even really know where to look, or when to start.

I'm sure people will recommend the LC grind as well. I have started reading Introduction to Algorithms and I have completed two related units. Perhaps I should read Cracking the Coding Interview as well.

I like the city I'm in now and it's pretty big so I imagine there are opportunities here. I would consider London but I'm less keen. Fully remote also wouldn't be ideal.

Thanks."

v41alr,1,2022-06-03,Need help Making a decision that will advance my career or put me 180k in debt!,Bulltothemax753,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/v41alr/need_help_making_a_decision_that_will_advance_my/,"
So this is gonna be a longish post because I need to provide backstory. First off, I am a college student and I go to a good school that is unfortunately expensive. I’m great full everyday my parents are covering the bill for it, but there are conditions in which they will no longer do so. One is if I start failing out, which I’m not. Or if I am caught using any drugs other than alcohol (yes this means weed included as they think it is the devil). 

I do smoke weed and have cut down a lot the last three weeks over summer break (funny because a lot of people go the opposite way over the summer). I want to be a banking consultant and was not able to get an internship over the summer because I am not a junior yet (I personally think this is so dumb but it’s out of my control). 

One of my parents has a role at a local bank and they need tellers badly. My parent was hesitant to offer me any job their because of a potential conflict of interest. My parent is in a role where they can know about pretty much anything that happens there from the ground level all the way to management etc. The thing is I was offered a job as a bank teller there which is the next best thing to an internship, the problem is that there is a drug test and I don’t know what to do. 

Yes there are detox drinks and stuff like that but they do not work 100% of the time and I cannot risk getting caught and having to pay the rest of college. How do I go about this? Do I go for it and try these drinks or do I deny the job? How do I tell my parents I don’t want to work there without making it obvious that I can’t pass a drug test there? 

Anything helps thanks so much!! If I end up paying for college I will dig myself a 180k hole for the remaining two years I have. Also I live in a legal state."

v41mig,1,2022-06-03,Should I reject a 14 L(base) paying job at an MNC for a 9 L (base) paying job at a start up??,3paintingsandlove,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/v41mig/should_i_reject_a_14_lbase_paying_job_at_an_mnc/,"Hi, 

For context, I am from India and I am staying with my parents since the global tragedy of 2020 to complete my post grad. I have been offered a 14 L base salary job (J1) at a well known MNC from college. This job is at city A This was offered more than 5 months back. And I have joining date in 2 months for this.
I had taken up an internship around 4 months back in a product based role in a young start-up. I have been working there ever since. They have offered me to join them at 9LPA (base) (J2). This job is remote. Hence I can shift to city B which is my preference.
There are two main factors:

1. I have more interest in a product based role as compared to a process based role which J1 is offering. And if I go for J1 I think I will have a hard time getting into product again, since I will be abandoning the profile I have built in product in last 4-6 months. 

2. I have had pretty rough past two years and have been dealing with depression and anxiety. And after all this I am tired of being constantly miserable and ideally don't want to waste another year of my life being unhappy. To me, answer to all of this is moving to city B. So much so that even if I accept J1 I will still keep looking for jobs in city B.

City A and City B,  neither of them are where I am right now, I.e my parents place. And overall it is vital for me to move from here.

Also even if I take up J2, I am going to keep looking for better paying jobs. As a matter of fact I have been giving interviews since past month, and I will be continuing that till I find a better paying job.

Both city A and City B are metro cities with lot of job opportunities, so that is not a concern.

The main comparison is
1. Brand/well-known-ness of companies
2. Safety factor
3. MONEY

I have one decision made in my mind but I am writing here due to, well, anxiety and fear mostly.
Hoping to get responses from well meaning people."

I only worked 1 year as flight attendant but I lost my job after COVID-19, so I needed to find some alternatives.  
I was self studying for my CCNA certification without any prior experience and at the same time I decided to start looking for jobs.  
After some months of studying I applied for a Junior network engineer job and they offered me an internship.  
They offered me 6 months of payed internship with the goal of helping me to get the CCNA.

The internship was mostly remote and I was only going to the office once or twice per week.

They didn't teach much and I only installed and configured a switch or two. For the most part I was at home studying for the CCNA.  
After 5 months of work/study I got my CCNA and honestly it didn't felt great.  
I didn't really like the exam, it was exhausting and full of stupid questions.

After the exam I expected some positive feedback from the company but instead they decided not hire me. They told me that I was too slow in catching up the things, that I didn't asked enough questions and that the job would be very demanding for my current skill level.

I left the place two weeks ago with huge disappointment and now I really don't know what to do.

Honestly I'm starting to doubt about the choice I've made, maybe networking or IT in general is not for me. Maybe I just forced myself because I needed to do something with my life.  
Or maybe I just need to find another job and explore new fields.. I'm very confused at the moment.

But anyways I'm almost 30 years old and I desperately need to get into a decent career.

and sorry about my English, is not my 1st language

TL:DR got my CCNA, failed an internship and now I'm not sure if I want to continue to this path"

When I told them that I'm in college in September they assured me they can work around the dates to make it work

The phone call interview with HR went very well, the chappy on the phone seemed to be keen on potentially taking me on and said that the head of engineering will be in contact with me in regards to taking an aptitude test, which would be followed by a technical interview

I began looking up the interview process to get a head start for the interview while I waited to hear from them and I noticed a hape of bad reviews on glass door in regards to their interview process

Some reviews said the interview process was very swift and they had the job within a week, but most said that they conducted the interview and never heard back, which I thought was strange. It didn't specify which location these people who were giving the bad reviews where from, but I did notice the good ones were all American based.

It's now June and I still haven't heard anything (I gave up hope around mid May). I followed up on them, emailing the HR chappy that did the interview with me, but nothing. As I said, they mentioned that I will be going onto the next stage of the interview process, so why say that and then blank me?

Just wondering if anyone else has dealt with this company and if this has happened to you. Seems very unprofessional for a world wide company with an esteemed reputation."

This past cycle I applied to UCs and other reach schools and was rejected everywhere besides a waitlist at NYU. Although college is a very big financial decision and I’m fortunate to be paying so little, I am considering transferring to a t20 even though my parents and I likely have to pay full if admitted, which isn’t necessarily a problem but it is of course a ton of money.

I have a 34, 1530, 3.94UW and 4.7 weighted gpa for stats. My high schools ECs were decent (basketball, tutoring business, research no publication, internship, etc.) so I was quite disappointed to be rejected everywhere.

I don’t necessarily PLAN to transfer right now, as I want to give UCF a chance despite the negatives I’ve heard about it socially among other things, but i want to be prepared in the event I want to transfer after my freshman year. I’m going to be a CS major at UCF although I will likely not apply as a CS major transfer (I know nothing and am chasing money rn, and I don’t have ECs so it’ll be more difficult). 

When should I start focusing on ECs and activities? If I apply as undecided, how does this affect what I should do for ECs? I know people say do what you’re passionate about, and I plan to, but I’m looking for a little more insightful advice than that. So any advice is great and I’d be extremely thankful."

He then told me the terms and conditions that made me laugh and cry at the same time.

First condition was that there was a bond of 2.5 years meaning that he cannot leave that place for at least whole two and half years otherwise he will have to pay certain money to them and will not get any experience letter.

Second was the pay. He would be working as intern for first six month and will NOT get paid. After that, 8000 Rs(Indian currency) per month. If I convert it into USD. It makes 102.98 USD/month. It's a six day week/ 9 hours per day job. And why would company give him yearly increment when they know that he can't leave for 2.5 years?

Third was that he would have to give them a blank signed check. I asked my dad what can happen if he does that and he straight up told me that it's a fraud and company can write any amount and give it to the bank and can even use it for blackmail by making up the story that he gave them a check with a written amount and he doesn't have that money in account so he has to pay them no matter what.

There were no benefits or leave policy.

And still with hope in his eyes he asked me, should I join it? I told him no.  


It made me real sad and furious from inside as how as a society we have failed him and countless others and this is how companies are straight up taking advantage of actual human beings. Because they know the fact that if he don't join it, there are million others who are ready. Just how selfish can one be?  


It makes me sad that companies like this exist and there are actual people that are working there right at this moment when I'm writing this.  


I love anti-work and it makes me so happy that workers are finally taking a stand for themselves including myself. But at the same time there are people who don't have this luxury just because there are already millions ready to take that position if they quit. And this is not an Indian problem, it's a world wide problem. And just how pathetic asshole that owner of company is when he would be getting richer due to my friend's work and my friend will not even get money for a one time meal. This makes me sad and makes me cry."

Ever since middle school after I was bullied a lot I promised myself I would turn out better then them in the long run. I wanted to ""prove them wrong"". It turns out that I actually did make that dream come true (on paper).

 You see I am not the brightest individual. In grade school I was in the most basic classes possible. The people I graduated with that had the same classes with me in grade school went for simple jobs like a retail worker. The people that were ""average classes"" went to some post secondary like community College or a trade school. The people who were in the honors classes went to either college out of town or to the military. Those were the people I wanted to be like because they seemed so happy. I also was diagnosed with OCD and ADHD as a young lad.

I did literally exactly what they did. As of now, I am becoming a Junior in college majoring in MIS. This summer I got a professional internship working for a respectful company and finally got what I always wanted. At the moment I was happy that I finally was starting my career goals in life. Today is my second on the job and I already feel missed out of place.

I am working for a manufacturing company and there are a lot of different roles within the company. There are the engineers, business people, IT people, the managers, and the trade people like welders. Today I was task to learn how each station works. I met the welders and for the first time working there I felt comfortable.

Up to that point, the only people I was talking to were the business people. I was always so nervous around them and felt alien. At first I just thought it was because I was an intern but that's not the case. It's just because I can't relate to them. A light bulb came to me and that was I am faking my life.

It's just not here either, it's also in college. As for the last two years in college I never felt any connected to anyone expect for a couple people. 

For people out there reading this, I just want to tell you this. Just because you have an impression career that doesn't mean it makes you happy. I'd say staying true to who you are is more important then to be impressive to others.

The job title is project coordination and Reporting Analyst pay $20-$23/hr ($1 raise every quarter)

My expectation going in was this was not going to be an engineering role but had some technical edge which is what I wanted. But it seems that the scope of my work and workload is way more then what an intern should be given. Not necessarily complaining, this is all work I can do and I think it provides me with a lot of versatility going forward. But I am looking for opinions regarding the normality of this and my ability to ask for a pay raise due to this large workload. 

I am in this interesting situation where my boss in theory works under a manager and I think his title may even be an analyst. But in reality primarily reports to the director of our division (~130 employees), I guess this makes sense as me and my boss are labeled as governance, which I now understand is just a blanket statement. But basically my boss provides advice to the director and does pretty much everything under the sun. Whatever the director needs he gets done. This is great for me as I am getting a lot of face time with the managers and director. But it’s putting me in a position where most of this work doesn’t have a process and is fully a figure it out type of role. 

Also to note I have a lot of guidance but only from the intern I’m shadowing and will be there to assist me till he leaves at the end of the summer but here’s a list of my current tasks:

Reoccurring Task:
- Daily AdHoc Request Reports, I send these every morning doesn’t take a ton of time but inputs are from a bunch of sources and old tech. I have almost fully automated this task.
- Weekly revenue/forecast/costs tracking for each department within the division, requires chasing of people to get stuff
- Monthly revenue/forecast/costs report, take files from finance and adjust our models and chase people for numbers 
- Weekly VP PowerPoint update 
- Monthly management of “Project” our tool to track employee’s progress on projects. Project and the Power Bi dashboard was created by previous intern requires large overhaul.
- Chairing Monthly Business review for the division, I think chair is right word not sure but basically I create most of the 60 page PowerPoint deck and run the meeting, I also have “actions section” where the actions from the previous meetings I give updates on roughly 20 of these actions. Meaning I have to chase to produce updates on these actions. 
- Creation of quarterly forecast workbook that’s sent to head office. Meaning I create a workbook and collect all updated forecasts and costs associated with the division. 

Larger Projects:
- Convince and migrate the remaining 5/7 (100 employees) departments onto “Project” system 
- Train ~130 employees in our new payroll software Kronos 
- Develop a system/protocol to make all employees actually use LinkedIn learning 
- Hold a 50 person pot luck at a park??? (This one is strange)
- Back to work seating plan for all offices.

Miscellaneous:
- Fix IT problems for people
- Fix Payroll problems 
- Fix stuff I guess is a good descriptor 
- Odd bit of training to people who don’t know how to use software 
- Train interns in departments to do their revenue 

The problem:
So here’s the real problem, starting in the fall I have to hire interns for the entire division + some who are not. Which equates to roughly
30 heads. 
- Talk to all supervisors and managers on what positions they are hiring for and get job descriptions 
- Reach out to all university’s Co-op offices to get jobs posted
- Collect all applicants information and deliver to supervisors/managers 
- Request interviews for all the students they want to interview 
- Schedule and sit in on all the interviews 
- Notify student/school that we would like to extend them an offer.
This is a lot of coordination if you ask me but still not the biggest problem in my opinion 

Biggest problem: on boarding interns 
- Have all interns hired, need to individually request each item of software/hardware/ and account creation for every intern. 
- Run orientation day
- Help interns configure their computers and accounts 
- In reference to point above become IT once everything breaks 
- Here’s sorta the problem I’ve seen with my intern I’m shadowing, through the entire hiring process the students have only interacted with him for everything so since then (it’s been roughly a month) they come to him for everything. And I mean everything any problem/question he has to deal with. Just a constant stream of students asking for help because IT won’t/can’t help or HR can’t/won’t help or their supervisors can’t/won’t help. He’s sorta like their parents it’s weird but a ton of work.

TL;DR: I am an intern with a large workload with little guidance. Wondering if this is normal and if I can ask for a raise."

v4dkgk,6,2022-06-03,Anyone Second Guess Starting a PhD?,GradAnxiety100,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/v4dkgk/anyone_second_guess_starting_a_phd/,"I recently graduated from undergrad with a degree in bioengineering and this fall I will be starting my PhD in biomedical engineering. I participated in research for 3 years of undergrad with additional research internships so I have a good understanding of research and what it entails. However, I have been a bit uneasy with my decision to pursue a PhD and I would love to know it this is normal and just out of slight fear? 

Growing up I always had getting a PhD pounded into my head with not a lot of thought as to why. Up until a year ago, I was pretty set on going for a MS at the same university as my undergrad (direct enrollment). Then I switched 180° in April 2021 and decided that I was going to just go ahead and get my PhD at my undergrad university instead (direct enrollment as well) and apply for top programs for fun. My GPA was low for the top 25 schools so I didn't have any expectations when applying especially since they are so competitive in the first place. March 2022 comes around and I was accepted into one of the top BME PhD programs in the country which I obviously accepted, but now I am starting to ask myself if I'm ready and able to do it. 

I know that I will require a PhD to be able to have the jobs that I want (both in industry and academia) and I love research. I know myself though, I tend to not keep deadlines and I started to really feel burn out this past semster. I don't want to say that I'm too burnt out for a PhD program, but I'm worried that I won't hold myself accountable like I should. 

I am a bit young, just turned 21, so I hope to develop my work habits more in time. I was extremely excited when accepted to the program, but recently I've had a pit in my stomach at the thought of developing a full project worthy of becoming a dissertation. Granted the average length to complete is 6 years in my new department so I have plenty of time and the time required doesn't concern me that much. I also have worried that I won't get a high paying job after graduation making the investment pointless which seems trivial due to the fact that it's a engineering degree, but still weighs heavy on my mind. 

I would love to know if anyone else has ever felt this way and how they went about correcting themselves/ putting their mind at ease? I am an anxious person which makes me believe this sunken feeling is just fear so I hope it fades once I start."

Does anyone have experience with working as a consultant or can anyone share their experiences working in this area?  I am new to DE with very limited experience (1 internship last year).

Under the list of responsibilities it says I will be tasked with ""Undertaking preprocessing of structured and unstructured data"", ""Asses the effectiveness and accuracy of new data sources and data gathering techniques"", ""Other associated duties as needed"".

v4g14s,0,2022-06-03,About to become self employed and scared &amp; confused about taxes,[deleted],PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/v4g14s/about_to_become_self_employed_and_scared_confused/,"Hi everyone,

I had worked as an intern at a company for a couple months this year, and I have earned about 10-12k in an honourarium. Tax hasn’t been taken off.

I did a good job at the internship, so they offered me a 6 month contract. They have also asked for an hst number, since I will be a contractor.

My problem/concern, is that I don’t know how any of this works.

I have never had to pay tax at the end of the year before. I usually earn about 20k, and get a refund of about 1k.

I think at the end of the year, I will have made about 30-35k in self employed income (as a contractor and an intern).

I know I will have to pay at the end of the year, but how much? Some calculators say $4k, some say $8k.

I find it hard to believe, that almost 1/3-1/4 of my income will be taxed, when I only earn about 33k, and I live in Toronto, where my bills are like 18k per year. 

Anyone have a ballpark range of what I will pay? I just want to know how much to save each month so I’m not scrambling next April."

Now I’m struggling so much in all of my classes. I’m not good at this major. I’ve never been good at math or physics and I hate coding with a passion. I haven’t even managed to get a single internship. I can’t do this for the rest of my life. I want to stay as far away from STEM as possible, but I don’t know what I can do. I can’t become a lawyer or work in finance because my people skills suck. I struggle to do basic things such as send an email. I have no passions because I’ve been depressed since I was 10.

There's a huge asterisk here though. I have gotten into several battles with him over newspaper-related things. These disputes have gone to his boss's boss. Think of these like spy movies but if the stakes are super low. Like, he'll sometimes pull my staffers out of class to try to get them to act as double agents. He'll ""chat"" with me and try to gain intel. So I'm nervous. But he respects me and I respect him. 

Journalism teacher: 10/10. I've had her since I was a freshman. I TA her freshman class. I spend often half my day in her room. She's the best teacher I've ever had. I once had to send in a rec from her for a scholarship and it brought me to tears. 

Physics teacher/student council teacher: 5/10. I've only had him for one period of junior year, but I'll have him for two (science and student council) next year. He likes me I guess, but he finds me somewhat annoying I think.

I applied to new jobs every week and after not hearing back from places for months on end I managed to get my first interview in December. Unfortunately, I didn’t hear back afterwards. 

The search continued, and it wasn’t until spring break where I found myself with another interview. Once again, however, I never heard back. I was pretty sure it was a done deal for me at this point, it was the middle of April and I hadn’t gotten any more responses from any applications I put out there. 

On a final Hail Mary attempt during finals week I scoured LinkedIn and managed to find one last position I could apply for. I didn’t hear back from this job either until two weeks later, at which point I had reluctantly signed back on with my part time summer job I’ve had since high school. This time I could tell it was different. I didn’t feel nervous for the interview, because I knew I didn’t have much to lose at this point. I went in and just gave off this aura of confidence I’ve never had before, and was able to answer every question asked with precision and passion. I knew I crushed it, but I didn’t know how much until I got offered the position two days later on June 3rd. 

For all you engineering folks out there who are just starting out or weren’t able to secure a position this summer, never give up. Your time will come and you will succeed. We are all here to support you! Don’t listen to the people who tell you to have a position secured before the end of the fall semester they have no idea what they are talking about.

v4llx5,0,2022-06-04,Can someone help poke holes in my plan for automating software updates?,dota2nub,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/v4llx5/can_someone_help_poke_holes_in_my_plan_for/,"I'm an intern at a small IT company. We do Business software and only have a small team of less than 10 people. 2 programmers, 1 IT technician, a sysadmin, the boss who does a bit of everything, some non technical people and me. I'm pretty new at all of this and people at work don't have much time to spend teaching me and some stuff I plan on doing is hard for me to explain to them.

I was tasked with handling software updates and installation for our clients. This means finding the newest software, keeping it up to date, and using Atera (RMM system) to deploy and patch things.

Atera doesn't offer good functionality to handle this. They do have some very common software packages to install, but they can't check for updates. At most you can use Atera to handle Windows patching.

So after a lot of fruitless trial and error (winget sucks!!) I came up with a plan of action:

1. Use Atera to install Chocolatey on client PCs (can't install it any other way since Atera internally uses Chocolatey which messes up any other attempt at installing it) Make sure to take the public repo out of the sources.

2. Build Chocolatey packages for all the software we want to supply. 

3. Host the packages on azure DevOps Artifacts. Supply the client installs with a read only access token to the repository.

4. Run chocolatey installs on all client machines. We still need to test this as I don't know how already installed software will handle attempts at running an installer again. Mostly it should be fine but this step makes me a bit anxious.

5. Use Powershell scripts with Atera to make sure clients stay up to date with their packages

6. Automate the process of creating new chocolatey packages. This involves web crawling with powershell scripts to find download links, version numbers, and checksums for all software for which we want do make self updating packages. This is tricky, but I have a skeleton running that works for a few things, even tricky stuff such as navigating Adobe's javascript based download page. These scripts will break, but I had a basic version of it running for a year now that's surprisingly stable with only a few sources breaking after 6 months.

7. Automate the upload of new packages to the repo

8. Clean up the whole mess and document the whole thing.

I have a feeling that I'm missing large amounts of security holes and problems I might be generating with my approach, but I don't have the experience or know how to be able to catch these ahead of time. Can you people give me some pointers for what I need to watch out for? This is a very fun project but it's probably a bit mich for a second semester CS student who hasn't done any programming before in his life."

I wish I knew how to write one of these, but I don’t, so I guess I’ll just have to say what I’m thinking.  I have been a teacher for over a decade and have not had any disciplinary problem.  Nearly two months ago I was approached by a parent of a senior intern of mine claiming that I had some fixation on them and was stalking them, and that the intern and their friends brought it up to the principal. I didn’t act defensive, just that I was shocked as this was the first time hearing that.  I was never aware that there was a problem and was given the impression that they wanted to stop interning due to being overwhelmed with college stuff and final senior projects, which I of course granted. I tried to talk to the principal immediately after about the parent approaching me and he dismissed it, telling me he couldn’t talk at the time when I mentioned the matter. I went to my union rep, told him everything and told me not to talk to the principal again about the matter without him.  Principal texted me later telling me not to engage the student and that we can talk more the next day.  Union rep was suddenly sick with COVID, but called the principal and the principal didn’t want to get into it but said there would likely be some formal meeting.  A month and change later, I’m reassigned to a central office as the subject of an investigation. 

Something that could have been taken care of within a day or two has now blown up and made an impact on my livelihood.  I was given a letter telling me that I cannot enter any school building in my district, cannot contact students/parents, and cannot do any pedagogical work for my school.  Found out that they couldn’t even get a sub to replace me these last few weeks and turned my class into a study hall.  I got emails from concerned students and parents hoping that I’m okay and it sucks that I can’t even respond.  All they were told is that I’m out due to unforeseen circumstances.

When I got reassigned, I immediately contacted my district union rep and they said all I can do is wait until im approached by an investigator, to not speak to them other than to take their card and get union counsel to be in touch with them.  It has been over two weeks and I’ve heard nothing.  I only have an idea of what the matter is because of that parent, but I do not know any specific allegations on their end or whatever statements were made.  Many people in my city have been reassigned, some lasting weeks, some months, and some even years until their outcome is settled. I know I do not have anything to hide regarding this matter, but I fear the unknown.  I hear stories about other people reassigned, that investigators shoot first before hearing your side of things, that they treat you like dirt and try to find any reason to make you feel like you’re a monster.  When this is over with, and hopefully as painlessly as possible, I am not sure if I want to continue with this profession because I have lost my trust in people at my building and likely any other school for that matter, but I fear I wouldn’t know what to do otherwise and lose my benefits on top of that.

I had to increase my anti depressant dose, be prescribed an additional medication to help me sleep, and have been increasing my therapy visits.  As much as I appreciate the support, I feel that this is not really helping.  I’ve been crying everyday, praying, and hoping that this will all go away soon and imagine that this never happened, but I’m not too optimistic about it. I’ve been staying at my parents house more frequently because I’m afraid to be alone and cannot trust myself to cope with everything without doing something drastic.

I just want to live and be happy, and this situation has been pushing me to the edge making me wonder if life is still worth living.  I appreciate the support my family and friends have provided me, but at some point I fear that enough is enough and I will be pushed to that point of no return.  I am sorry."

I was really unmotivated for a while due to all the rejections I had been getting during the last 2 months of college, but I picked myself up in May and started reapplying.

I now have two offers I'm debating on taking, as an IoT Specialist at Cognizant or a Software Engineer at Collins Aerospace.

My offer from Cognizant is 73k base, 10k sign-on, and no relocation assistance, with additional 7k for two year retention. On the other hand, my offer from Collins Aerospace is 75k base, 5k sign-on, and 6k relocation assistance. The work locations for both these companies, Georgia and Iowa respectively, have similarly low cost of living.

I'm also at the final interview stage for a Software Tester Developer position at Milliman in Illinois, and I'm fairly confident I will get an offer there as well, though the offer won't come for at least another week or two. I'll update this post accordingly when I get the news.

If you worked for these companies before, how is the work? Which would give me the best opportunities to grow my career afterwards? Should I just keep applying for other places?

Honestly I'm kinda exhausted from all the interviews and applications. I'm personally happy with the salary options, I'm mainly just looking to get foot in the door and get experience to grow my career. But if these aren't good offers, I'm willing to put in the work and keep applying.

And for my fellow new grads, it really is just a numbers game; keep your heads up and keep applying. We'll all make it."

Personally this year as has sucked for me. The best way I can describe it is “moments to remember in a year to forget.”

Last night was one of those moments. I hemmed and hawed at going to graduation and finally buckled after a few of my seniors whined enough. I’m glad a did. I got to see proud graduates, proud parents, and joy in our school community. 

But most of all a student who I had the fortune of having in my class 3 out of her 4 years a while back was there to see her baby sister graduate. She was and still is my favorite student. We laughed and joked and talked about this and that. She’s about to start nursing school and her boyfriend (who I had 2 out of 4 years) just started an internship in cyber security. We spend so much time with so many students who we likely won’t see again once they leave our classrooms. But to see these two young people doing so well really gave me a sense of pride.

WHAT WE DO MATTERS.

I just got a Summer 2023 internship offer for both EY and Deloitte Toronto in Audit and was having a hard time choosing between the 2. I know most people advised to choose based on the people, but how big of a chance that the people I get to talk to in networking events will be in the team that I eventually end up being in? **The fact that I will only know my specific team after I accept my offer makes it impossible to gauge the ""actual"" people that I will interact with, hence why I find it really tricky**. Would really appreciate it if somebody could share their experiences in this aspect?

Alternatively, I am leaning towards making my decision based on the benefits that I am offered (as my internship will 99.99% lead to me being a full-time staff at the firm post-grad, so I think benefits play a huge factor here). Specifically:

**EY:**

* 54000 gross
* vacation pay 4%
* 75% wellness funds up to $1000 (i.e., to claim $1000 I must incur an extra $333 of personal expenses)

**Deloitte:**

* 52000 gross
* vacation pay 6%
* wellness funds (My Benefit Dollars) of $1300 (100% covered)

For those currently working at either EY or Deloitte, which one do you think offers better benefits? And are there any other benefits (for full-time staff), both monetary and non-monetary, not mentioned here that I should be aware of?

Finally, I might base my decision on which firm has **better client portfolio and is performing better in Canada and Toronto, specifically**. Therefore, I would love to hear your perspective on how your firm performs in this market just to assess any future career opportunities that I might get by being its employee. I was trying to find this info online but nothing shows up.

Thank you so much for your help!"

And I will need to prepare for summer internship next year so the next school year is going to be absolutely hectic for me.

I would like to become a SWE or something like that when I graduate. So is it worth going to school for an extra year just for an engineering degree?

v4so4l,1,2022-06-04,[TX] - HELP! Manager Retaliation in Written Review for HR Complaint,LogVegetable,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/v4so4l/tx_help_manager_retaliation_in_written_review_for/,"I need help with my next steps.  I have been having issues with my manager for over a year now.  In June 2021 I filed a complaint and two retaliation complaints against him.  The complaint revolved around a discussion about my work history and resume when I brought up my time in the service.  He began questioning if I had PTSD and if I had received treatment for it.  The retaliation complaints (1) came after he neglected to inform me of a high priority meeting after I returned from a 2 week vacation, but he did manage to confirm everyone else in my group was aware and prepared.  His claim was that he didn't know I wasn't aware.  The next (2) was his conduct towards me in a meeting.  While the company paid ""attorney"" (entirely different matter I completely disagreed with) did not find any intention on my managers part somehow, I told my HR rep at the time I fully expected this to blow back on my review on more than one occasion.  And that is exactly what happened.  

My review was on a Thursday afternoon.  My manager and senior manager (SM) were in attendance. It it supposed to be a compilation of 4 quarterly reviews so there aren't any ""surprises"" at final review time.  Well it was full of surprises to say the least.  He used both of my retaliation complaints against my performance.  

(1) He used the event around my vacation against me. He stated that ""in my Q2 review that by informing him I did not need his assistance while on vacation, I caused delays in my project"" (which is still ongoing and on target).  This Q2 statement he is making is not true.  We had a 7 minute conversation about it where I informed him my team had things covered and he stated ""if you need my help just let me know, or if you want me to back off just say back off and I will.""  My response ""yes, I would like to handle this on my own.  I understand you are trying to help but I have it covered"".  There is no data that can support this theory.  It hadn't even been approved for our budget until April of 2022.  

(2) He used the issue around this complaint against me as well.  As stated above, it was in regards to his conduct towards me in a meeting, more specifically, me being invited to a discussion as the lead and him bulldozing over me with every single question.  I was only allowed to speak after the organizers of the meeting, realizing what was happening, posed a question directly to me.  My complaint was that he is not giving me an opportunity to lead my projects.  He asks if I want him to back off which I say yes, and then he bulldozes over me in my meetings.  He stated he misinterpreted the meeting as being a manager approval discussion but there is zero indication that was the intent of this discussion in the description *Purpose of Discussion.*  Well this event was labeled in my review as ""you need to understand that being the lead of a project doesn't mean you do it by yourself"".  Again, I have a team I have been using extensively and should have been known to him.  He was on every meeting invitation but never attended.  I even requested permission to use our intern for help because our team was too busy, which he approved.  

As soon as I saw this information in my review I stated I didn't agree multiple times. The company policy when an employee disagrees: it is supposed to be handled prior to being submit.  2 minutes after my review concluded he submit my review.  I immediately contacted HR and confirmed the procedure and she said I needed to work it out with my manager.  This all occurred on Thursday afternoon.   On Friday morning I sent a detailed email to my manager and SM pointing out all the areas I disagreed with.  I received no response.  At end of business Friday my manager left for a planned medical absence.  Nobody in our group was ever informed he was going to be out for an extended time.  I received an email from my SM a week later stating that he received my email.  I followed up two weeks later and he stated I had to wait, at a minimum, another 5 weeks until my manager returned.  I replied to both him and HR that I was not comfortable with this as it is public and others can review it.  My SM replied that they would look into seeing what could be done and get back to me.  After two more weeks I followed up again.  Now I just have to wait until whenever it is he returns.  

During all this, I have been attempting to move departments.  I made a tremendous amount of progress with one, to the point that they were informing me of positions that would be available in the future and asking if I would be interested, a job I had already performed in the past.  My reply was yes, every time they asked.  They then sent me a notice that the posting would be coming soon and to be on the lookout.  I applied, called and spoke with the manager.  Everything was going great, finally.  Then nothing.  After about 7 weeks I got a call from the hiring manager stating that I had great qualifications and experience but they had a lot of applicants and reviewed things like qualifications, experience and, wait for it, work performance.  When I asked specifically what I could do to improve my chances he said for qualifications nothing it is all exceptional.  And that was it.  I was afraid to push too much further as I didn't want to damage any future chances.  But I strongly suspect given his statement about reviewing work performance that this why I didn't even get offered an interview.  

What are my next steps here?  Do I have any recourse in this at all?  It seems pretty clear to me he did this intentionally, knowing he would be gone, knowing the information contained in the review had never been mentioned until the final, failing to utilize the information from my quarterly reviews (he also left a bunch of activities I was involved in out), knowing I disagreed and submit regardless, despite company policy. 

Please help.  I am not sure what else to do.  Do I file another complaint?  Can I file it with someone else other than my employer?  After that sham investigation previously, it's clear the only interests that company paid attorney had in mind were his and the companies.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

I’m an IE looking to potentially work 16-20 hours weekly this fall and would like to know if it’s feasible…any input is appreciated (especially from other STEM majors). Thank you
v4toqw,6,2022-06-04,Don't be afraid to make the change!,American_Machine,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/v4toqw/dont_be_afraid_to_make_the_change/,"Ever since I started thinking about making a career change, I was nervous as hell. I see a lot of people that are the same way and hopefully my two cents will help you. I'll give a little back story to show anyone can do it. 

So for 4 years prior to starting my degree, BSCIA, I worked as a Correctional Sergeant and Sherriff's Deputy in a jail. Deputy was for 6 months and DOC was for 3 and a half years. Before that I drove a 30 foot semi truck doing local deliveries. I received my Associate degree in Social Science, that was the degree for a transfer agreement to a California State University. After my AA degree I went to Arizona State to purse my BS in Exercise Science, was a Division 1 Athlete (plug to make myself sound cool). While at ASU I had a 1.3 GPA and dropped out of college. Great party school.

I see a lot of people worried that they do not have an IT experience, which hinders them from getting their degree and making the switch. I went from working at a prison, an extremely un-tech environment, to getting my Cybersecurity Degree in 14 months making the same money. I was dealing with prison gangs, watching people cut/hang themselves, getting attacked, and watching people ruin their lives. Now I work as a Cybersecurity Associate for a huge hospital chain, 60,000 employees, making the same money and WAY better quality of life. I went from working 56 hours a week, I was averaging 16 hours of overtime a week at the prison, to working ""40 hours a week"". I maybe work 30 legitimate hours, due to meetings and down time. I didn't work for 7 months, focused on school, then got an internship at the hospital. Three months into the internship I got brought on full time making $11 more an hour. I'm Tier 3 support and Identity Access Management.

I graduated last week from WGU with my BSCIA degree. I started with ZERO IT experience. I built a gaming computer prior to starting school. YouTube showed me how to do that. 14 months later I have a degree, decent cybersecurity/IT foundational knowledge, experience, remote work, and work with an awesome IT team. This week I have applied to 3 jobs I would need 3 to 4 years experience if I did not have a bachelors degree. These jobs start at 70k and a couple at 80k. Even if I do not get these jobs, with another year of self teaching (kali linux pen testing tools) and work experience I will be able to apply to jobs starting around 100k.

Hands down a WGU degree is worth the investment! It has changed my life for the better. I have less stress and the future only looks better. The hardest part is deciding where I want to eventually work. The money will come no matter what.

Side note: If you can't afford school, this doesn't include Pell grant or FAFSA, go in the military. Go look at the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard. I have been in both. You will get money for school AND a security clearance. In some cases the clearance can be more beneficial than a degree.

Don't be afraid to make the change. Put in the hard work, it will pay off!

Since this is the CompTIA reddit I have: A+, Network+, Security+, CySA+, Pentest+, and Project+."
v4ua4c,0,2022-06-04,Should I include a 3 month job as a recent grad or leave a gap?,slizzy12j,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/v4ua4c/should_i_include_a_3_month_job_as_a_recent_grad/,"Hi everyone, so this is my current dilemma. I live in NC and accepted a job opportunity in OH and start later this month. This will be my first job out of college and seems like a great career opportunity for me with good benefits and salary. However, I already know OH is a place I don’t want to live long term and would ideally want to stay there for a year or less and move back to NC.  I have a 4 year work experience as a sales associate at a retail store that isn’t relevant to my career (IT) as well as an internship I did last summer that is somewhat related (using PowerBI software for the Supply Chain department). I originally planned on staying for at least a year, as I thought it be enough time for me to get experience and won’t look as bad on my resume. Although now the more I think about it, I would prefer to be back in NC by January or May, so I can be with my family as I have a sick relative and want to spend more time with them. From my experience it seems like August-Dec there are plenty of job opportunities focused on new grads or soon to be grads, and these are the ones I plan on applying to. However, this would mean that by the time I apply for these positions I would have only 3 months or so of experience at my new role,and I’m worried it would hurt my chances as potential employers would see it as a red flag. Would it be better to leave a gap in my employment history and just say that I’ve been traveling/earning certifications or given my limited work experience should I just go ahead and list my current role ?
Any advice would be appreciated"

Also got offered IT from Monash. 

Trying to decide between the 4 schools and would love some advice from the professionals and alumni.

Is there any merit to picking Monash because of their ranking and Go8 status even though it's a IT degree? As for the CS degrees, is there any uni that stands out in particular? Swinburne has a 6/12 month internship integrated into their course structure which is kind of nice for the guaranteed experience. Would appreciate your thoughts and insights on this!"
v4xh5l,35,2022-06-04,My oral surgeon chipped my tooth/filling during wisdom teeth extraction? Emergency dental care is suggesting I seek out private dentist and pay out of pocket for immediate help,lissaJazzy,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/v4xh5l/my_oral_surgeon_chipped_my_toothfilling_during/,"I am 20 F and I have no idea want to do. 

I am in college and my internship out of state starts in one week. 

Early this month in May I had my wisdom teeth removed, all four. During the procedure everything went OK until about a few days later when I was finally old bowl to open my jawline I noticed my tooth was chipped. I noticed this because of the pictures I took of my mouth the night before my surgery look different from the pictures I recently took. 

I made an appointment a week later for the pain I was experiencing on the left side of my mouth which is the same side as the tooth chip. 

At the time I thought it was just extra sensitivity I was experiencing from the extraction. Looking back I believe it might’ve been a mixture of both pains (fracture and extraction). 

I was prescribed a rinsing solution, and the dentist completely dismissed my fractured molar. Even though I insisted that it was bothering me. 

A few days ago I went to the emergency clinic that is associated with the medical center I had my procedure at because I’ve started experiencing excruciating pain where my fracture occurred.  

They basically told me that with my health insurance, they would have to make separate appointments for the following:

- an evaluation
- A meeting where they match me with a student dentist (I have state health insurance, ugh)
- an appointment where they do x-rays and come up with a treatment plan
- Lastly, an appointment where they finally do the treatment


These 4 appointments contact up to a month to two months to finally get treated for my fractured filling.

From the test and x-rays we did at the emergency clinic on Friday the dentist recommended that I do not get a temporary filling because the tooth isn’t a very vulnerable position, blah blah. 

They basically advised me to either seek out private practice to get a same-day crown, or as he put it “tough it out”. 



Later that day I reached out to the oral surgeon office of the Doctor Who fractured my tooth and I made an appointment with him this coming Monday. 

However on the phone the resident said that she believes he will most likely give me an evaluation again. I keep wasting time spending money on Transit going into the city just for the stupid doctors to keep telling me the same thing while I remain in pain.

Is there anyway I can get service on my tooth within the next week? 

I’m in a lot of pain, they did prescribe me oxycodone but again why not just fix the fucking problem I don’t wanna pop pills indefinitely for two months. Or put so much stress on my tooth that I end up needing an extraction or I lose the tooth. I’m very young and very disappointed at the service I received from this Medical center.

I do have $10,000 saved up for school etc. would you recommend I find a dentist when I moved to the south and pay out of pocket(~$1,500-3,000 for a crown)? Should I try and fly back home for appointments?

I did find a free dentist office that is willing to be see me Monday night for a temporary filling/crown, however I was advised (by the emergency clinic) against temporary fixes/a temp. fill it as my tooth is very vulnerable. 

Also from my research it seems like a temporary fix wouldn’t even get me through the entire summer. 

Please let me know if you have any advice."

Long term, I'm looking at pentesting in the appsec field as my dream job.

Some things I'm doing right now are mastering or learning languages (Java, C++, Go, HTML, CSS, SQL, Python, Powershell, Bash), being active in my region's OWASP chapter, learning/practicing pentesting through THM, and getting my Sec+.

v52jr3,16,2022-06-04,Dilemma about caste acceptance,QueenCynical13,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/v52jr3/dilemma_about_caste_acceptance/,"Hi,
This is gonna be a long one. 

About me: 
I belong to a liberal Dalit Hindu middle-class family in India. I’m 26 F in the US studying at a prestigious university in a very competitive program that’s entirely sponsored. Recently got a job offer at one of the FAANG companies with a life-changing salary. Throughout my childhood, I knew I was intelligent. I was exceptional at Science and Math, very artistic, and performed brilliantly in everything that I tried. I got a 97% in CBSE 12th grade (was the female topper in my state) and went to IIT for my undergrad. Did very well in my undergrad; won a national level academic award, went abroad for research internships and international programs, finished 2nd in my class, got into the graduate program of my choice in the US. All in all, my career profile has been great. 

Backstory:
Growing up, I didn’t know what caste was until the 6th grade, when there was a survey that made me understand the terms SC, ST, OBC. When I was in 10th grade, for the first time in my life I faced conspicuous caste-based discrimination by my tutor. Even during my school days, I now realize how rampant Dalit-phobia was among my teachers in school.. where students with specific upper-caste surnames were chosen over others.
All throughout 11th and 12th grade, I would hear students at my coaching institute talk derogatorily about the so-called lower castes, evidently due to the existence of reservations in competitive exams. I performed very well in the overall general category  in JEE Mains (for Admission to NITs etc); I could easily get the hot branches in the top NITs without using my quota, which I initially wanted. But I also got a rank of 1400-ish in my category in JEE Advanced (for IITs). My family insisted that I get into IIT. After stepping into IIT, for the first couple of years I faced a crippling amount of caste discrimination from my peers. I felt like I was judged heavily for belonging to the Dalit section of society and my toxic insecure bf at the time made me believe that I was not good enough to belong to an IIT. I proved them all wrong very soon (also broke up with this half-man). 

Current: 
I have a large group of Desi friends in the US. All of them respect me; none of them know I’m a Dalit. Most of them are upper-caste and casteist, and most of them believe that Dalit people are uneducated and ignorant and fickle who take advantage of the reservation system. I actively try to avoid such discussions. 

Dilemma:
Though I never had caste as a part of my identity, I feel like I’m wronging my Dalit community for not talking about caste-related ignorance among my friends. Internally, I fear that I may lose the respect and admiration of my peers that I have had for so long. 
Should I let things be the way they’ve always been here? Life is convenient, and caste is latent anyway. 
Or should I own up to the truth that I’m a Dalit at the end of the day, and that it’s awful for people to think that Dalits are undeserving? 

TLDR: I’m smart, a Dalit and have faced lots of discrimination for being Dalit. My peers in the US are casteist. Should I tell them I’m a Dalit? Does it matter?"

I’m already in my early 30s and am having a bit of a crisis. I’ve been looking into product management, as not only a job that pays well, but I’m also interested in.

I’ve been reading a lot of articles, watching PM tiktok advices, YT vids etc. and still have a lot of mixed feelings about how to start this off. My biggest fear is wasting my money on a course/certification that will not help me get my foot into this industry at all. From all my researching, I’ve gathered that:

1. Certifications are pretty much useless and hiring managers/interviews often ignore certifications

2. To look into other tech things first such as data analytics, UX, digital marketing, etc

Should I network? Can I even do an internship with absolutely no experience? I completely understand this won’t become a PM right away, but any advice is appreciated!"

Hard skills strength is writing, qualitative and quantitative analysis/research, stakeholder management, database management. Proficient in MS office suite and SPSS. 

In less than one year I have worked my way from an internship in HR &gt; business planning &gt; an operational project role responding to an emergency &gt; EA to what is the equivalent to my orgs CEO. 

Moves were short contracts and the business wanting to keep me but backfills etc kept me moving. 

Hoping to secure permanency in this role ASAP because I’m worried the movements will look bad, but I’m also scared I’ll get typecast into the admin-type role and struggle to get out. Especially as I am a woman with a baby face/friendly demeanour. 

I have already shown my “CEO” and line manager that I can far exceed the capacity of the role (whilst still maintaining my responsibilities given by my job description) to prove myself. I just don’t know where I want to go next

I think I have potential to be C-suite material one day… but I am very young and early career. I don’t know how I can better equip myself for my next move. I’m also not sure what I should be specialising/choosing next to keep my momentum and increase my experience/skills to reach this goal. 

I’ve thought about consulting (although I’m not sure I’d enjoy the culture), policy roles (what I’m most leaning towards now), evaluation, executive management (I think the way my org does it is very different to elsewhere tho?) or leaning on my psych-science background going into data, performance etc 

I really thrive in roles that require team work and have found the EA role above all to be the most fulfilling because of that. I have loved being involved in very strategic/contentious issues -and I can’t lie, I enjoy knowing I have a very inside view on the entire org lol. The strategic element has been genuinely so fun to me. 

Also considering getting a MBA or a PhD but I feel it is overkill and not required until I enter mid/late career. 

What do you guys think? Appreciate all insights as I acknowledge that I am still veeeery green"

I am a recent graduate passionate about CS and looking for a job where I can put my technical skills to use while at the same time learning how a business operates and grows. I've done 13 months' worth of full-stack development (3-month internship followed by part-time remote work), but I feel like I was too far from the business side to soak any of it up.

Full-stack development is nice, but I feel like I'm missing out on business knowledge to maybe one day use for my own startup in the long term. I've heard many stories of people working at a smaller start-up company and picking up the knowledge as they grow with the company. My company on the other hand is a lot bigger, and I'm sure I can probably pick some things up, but I wouldn't know how to.

Doing some searching online, it sounds like some kind of IT or technology consultant seems to be the best way to go, as it might give me an opportunity to learn the needs of a business and how to tend to them.

NOTE: I will add that a huge part of the disconnect with the business was me being part-time and focusing on school, but since most of the workers went online, it's harder to find out what's going on."

**Letter of Recommendations:**

UW Seattle (cs)

Northeastern (data sci)

UIUC (cs + econ)

*WAITLISTS:* 

Cal Poly SLO (software engineering)

Loyola Marymount (cs) - waitlist -&gt; rejected

UCSD (data sci) - waitlist -&gt; rejected

UC Berkeley (SO CONFUSED ABOUT THIS ???)  


*Acceptances:* 

CSUF 

SDSU

UCR (most likely committing)

CSULB

**Takeaways:**

Overall, going through this application process has left me with a lot of regrets. I think my biggest problem though, was applying to reach universities with an impacted and competitive major, further reducing my chances of getting in. I was also banking on the idea they will take into account of my personal circumstances which caused in the decline of my GPA my first year. Anyways, probably going to attend UCR and most likely going to transfer to my dream school USC, GO HIGHLANDERS !!!"

Long story short, I’m scared of entering grad school. My first year will be me taking classes to complete the MS requirements so I’m not worried about that part as much, but I’m anxious about the following &gt;4 years. For context, both my universities are in the US. 

I enjoy doing research, I feel comfortable in the lab, but at the same time I don’t think I’m ready to commit to academia yet, mainly because I don’t plan to be a professor (even though people have said I am good at teaching; have done tutoring and TA-ing during undergrad). On the other hand, I’m not sure I am cut off for the industry. I did an internship in consulting (not in the US) for a summer and I was so intimidated by the work culture. Maybe it would be different if my internship was in the US? I’m not sure. 

The thing is, I don’t know what I want to do after grad school. I’m pretty much open to anything, like if there is an opportunity given to me I’d take it (after considerations, of course). A research position like a research scientist sounds good to me, but I’m an international student so perhaps my eligibility for the job is limited. More openings shall be available for an industry engineering job, but as I said above, I’m not sure if I’m cut off for it and I haven’t had an internship in the US yet.

Another reason that makes me nervous is that when I enter grad school, my relationship with my partner will be long-distance. His MS will be done next year, and he might or might not go for a PhD himself. So our future is going to be even more uncertain. 

Should I keep going for the whole PhD program or should I stop after my MS? Maybe I’m overthinking too much before anything’s happened, but if someone could give me any advice or a word of reassurance, it would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

He and I were like copies of each other but we just drifted when getting to college. Anyways, he called me out of the blue. He and i chatted for a while and then he asked me to call his girlfriend (who I was also close with in hs). Basically the story is this:

He is in another state for an internship rn. Back in our home state his gf has been hanging out with this guy (I'll call him the psycho, and you will see why). The psycho and her got high and drunk and partied. My friend didn't really care. What became a problem is when the psycho started blocking all of her male friends on her phone, including my friend (her bf). The psycho would repeatedly block my friend and anyone else she knew that was male. She would unblock but he would always block again. He is rather controlling of her. Cause my friend was blocked, he asked me to call her to make sure she is ok. I called, got one ring, and then a hangup (I have no doubt i am now blocked). This guy has now threatened my friend multiple times (""i'll make you wish i had killed you"", ""i'll open your throat"", and such) and my friend is becoming increasingly concerned. My friend sent me some recordings of what this guy said. At first I thought it was like ""tough-guy talk"" but then my friend texted me today to say that this psycho has been arrested for armed robbery and is one of the few people he hangs out with who hasn't proudly claimed to kill someone. So if he didn't hurt my friend he knows people who could. My friend no longer really trusts his gf cause she has been lying a lot recently to the psycho and my friend, he thinks that she is scared this guy will do something to her family.

My friend is in serious shit and idk what to do.

My first thought was to call the cops. But here's the thing: all 3 of the people (my friend, his gf, and the psycho) are all black. Given that this story involves drugs and black people, and given the recent history of cops, I am not totally sure I trust the cops either. I don't want my friend and his gf to end up as another statistic or to end up on the local news as another black person killed by the cops. What if the cops try and go after the psycho but fail? Then the gf might get hurt. Or what if a shootout happened (the guy was arrested for armed robbery in the past so this is possible right)? What if his gf is caught in the crossfire?

What the fuck should my friend and I do?"

v5hs5e,2,2022-06-05,Internship starts tomorrow and I’m really nervous,hookup1092,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/v5hs5e/internship_starts_tomorrow_and_im_really_nervous/,"I’m a front-end &amp; UI/UX intern, and tomorrow is my first day of onboarding. I have a hybrid schedule so I’ll also be going in person on Tuesday

Idk, I’m just nervous I won’t do as well as my supervisor says I will (he says it in an encouraging way).  I haven’t coded anything in a professional environment, and I haven’t worked with programs like Figma before. 

Im also nervous to go in person, I plan on dressing up professionally and I’m nervous that nobody else will be wearing professional clothes and I’ll stand out.

I know tomorrow is just onboarding, but still nervous.

I’m excited and nervous and anxious and nervous. 

Anybody have any tips for managing your emotions? Anything I should do this first week to make a good impression?"
v5ia64,1,2022-06-05,Accounting Internship Course,vyxoh,ucf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/v5ia64/accounting_internship_course/,"Just wondering about this class, I hear it’s not a typical class where it’s as stressful so I was considering adding it as a 5th class.

I’d be taking:

Fall
ACG 4803 Adv Issues 
ACG 4840 Acc Analytics 
ACG 4671 Int Audit
Elective
Internship Class

Spring
MAN 4720 Capstone
GEB 4223
TAX 4022
(If I take a 4th this semester instead, Elective)

Would it be better to just make it a 4th and leave at 4 classes for Fall? I was thinking I can do 5 in Fall and 3 for my last semester to finish up. Thoughts?"

I've been looking for a bit now and i don't know why i feel like its gonna be hard to find jobs later (not specially in UI UX but more in general CS) , i mean i can already feel the competition, and it feels like reality is just facing me like "" you'll never be special and you'll always struggle to do better than others"", and i have to admit that its kinda making me feel bad.
I'm a really motivated person and i always try to do my best but i always get scared when it comes to facing others skills.

I know the main problem is probably my lack of self confidence, but i just wanted to hear people with experience about the subject.

How did you overcome that fear of competition ? is it really hard to find a good job in CS ? how can i ""stand out"" of others ? 

I'd also really appreciate any kind of advice about the field, studies, looking for jobs, or anything, thank you ! :)"

There isn’t much going for it there even if it isn’t bad for my major. The reason I’m considering transferring is that I believe higher-ranked schools would open more doors for me in the industry. The opportunities offered at career fairs, networking, and on campus resources still interest me despite my only solid performance in high level classes (3.3-3.5 GPA in freshman - junior year taking honors / ap classes, 3.8/3.9 this year taking just aps and music)

I was pre-med up until my 6th year of undergrad (3 years CC, 3 years uni) where I decided I wanted to stick with engineering in the medical device field. I'm concerned this gives me a disadvantage because I didn't do BME-related internships during my undergrad.

I have my eye set on CSUN because CSUs are cheaper and it's the closest school to me, but I want to know if I should be looking for more outside of it.

* BS Degree: Biomedical Engineering: Premedical (UCI, 2021)
* GPA: (UCI) 3.31; (CC) 3.64
* GRE: None
* Research: 1 summer project at CSUN on wirelessly charging medical implants, 1 research lab in bacterial genetics (cut short by COVID) Jan-Jun 2020, 1 research lab on fetal pH meter Mar-Aug 2021.
* Projects: 2 design competitions where my team placed in 2nd (we published a report for one of those projects with the school) (2021). 1 design &amp; prototype competition where my team placed 1st (2016). All design competitions took place at UCI. I'm trying to work on small scale electrical projects on my own, but I lack inspiration.
* Relevant Work: 10+ years working for my dad as a technician building and testing PCBs, 8 months in a contract job at a medical device company supporting medical writers (left on great terms due to housing issues). I'm currently seeking employment as a quality engineer at a medical device company.

I know people typically go from broad to specialization when pursuing grad school, but in this case, I want to build my EE skills. I didn't learn too much about it in my undergrad (most of what I've learned is either classes I took in college or hands-on learning), so I hope to use grad school as an opportunity to master these skills.

Schools I'm looking at so far:

* CSUN, UCLA, Purdue (online)

What I want from a school:

* No GRE
* Requires a design project so I can apply the skills I learn
* Connections to medical device companies in the Los Angeles area
* Small class sizes
* Does not cost more than a MS from a UC
* Preferably within California
* (Bonus) Ability to go part time, if I choose to work and go to school at the same time
* (Bonus) Hybrid learning (I learn much better when I can pause &amp; play a lecture)
* (Bonus) Job placement assistance

What I want to know:

* Assuming I were to get into every school I applied, why would I choose a more expensive school (UCLA) over a cheaper one (CSUN)? I don't care about prestige- education is education and they're both great engineering schools.
* Other schools I should consider that also have a master's in electrical engineering program
* What can I do now to give myself the best chance in admissions?

Thanks in advance for anyone who responds. I know it's a lot to read, but I just wanted to make sure I had enough information to paint a picture of my profile"

I am going to be interning at MBB in one of the west coast cities this summer but having second thoughts. I realized I really wouldn't like living here. The only reason I recruited for these offices was because of the access to tech projects. City wise, I'd much rather be at Boston/Chicago, but these cities don't offer the projects I wish to pursue. 

- how important is project experience in tech if you wish to pivot to the industry later on? I'm not 100% decided on pivoting to tech but would like to have the option. 
- how easy is it to transfer offices after finishing your internship?"

After this I'm going to aim for at least 2 full-stack deployed projects to have completed by the end of this summer, + start studying leetcode.

However, I can't help but feel very anxious about trying to get an internship, even though my friends tell me I'm on the right track. Aside from these personal projects, I'm also working as a coding instructor, but I haven't had any internship experience yet. I also feel kind of worthless for not being able to land an internship this summer (after sophmore year).

I am a PCMB student and although I'm going to appear for JEE and probably NEET too next year I don't think my heart lies in either of those streams. And the thought of spending the rest of my life doing something I am not even interested in the first place, really disturbs me.

What kind of questions should I expect to see? Also, the interview is going to be online. I have no idea what to expect any advice?

So I have only done my bachelors and I at least need to do my masters in my field to be taken seriously, which means I will be going to study further next year (2023). So anyway I am not looking at this job for long term, and their probation period is 6 months during which I am allowed to quit.

I am just so stressed because I need to do hunting for my masters, prepare etc and also finish my final year thesis. All this while working 10-6. I made a huge mistake by even joining and I should have taken these 6 months off and looked for an internship in Jan 2023, but it's too late to undo that now.

The catch is this is a great company with an amazing work environment and exactly what I want to do. Which is why I was hoping to even continue working with them in the future, post my masters. So if I quit I don't want them to blacklist me.

So my question is, since I am fresher and have no experience with all this, which is the period of time which would be appropriate for me to quit? I would prefer it to be as soon as possible but I also don't want to close off any future opportunities at the company. Is it alright if I hand in my notice for the last month of probation period or would that leave the company feeling bitter?

v5zr2y,68,2022-06-06,I changed careers to Nursing. I hate it. So much. And I’m almost 30. Now what?,throwaway62403,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/v5zr2y/i_changed_careers_to_nursing_i_hate_it_so_much/,"So basically the title. Here’s a quick summary of my background:

Graduated college in 2016 with a degree in international studies with a focus in German/Russian, also premed but decided against med school. Had no clue what I could do with it, but also never really had any great career guidance to begin with. Did an internship in PR that was alright and worked retail for my first year post grad. When I finally got tired of retail, I didn’t have any great job prospects. Nursing seemed alright: Seemingly decent pay, I could help people, healthcare seemed really fascinating. So I started taking prereqs, and 2 years later made it into nursing school. 2 years after that (Sep 2021), I became a nurse.

Nursing has not been what I thought at all, and I really hate it. More than anything I’ve ever done. I’ve had 2 jobs out of school so far. My first was a hospital job, which was a drain on my life, thanks to nights, psychotic management, and having no staff because healthcare is chronically short staffed. My current job is outpatient endoscopy, and it’s meh; the pay isn’t as good and I’m pretty bored in it. I’ve only been in my new job for almost 3 months, and I’m already at the point where I’m feeling burnt out and having to drag myself into work every morning. It’s not looking good.

I think the biggest issue with nursing for me is I just don’t feel like it’s what I’m meant to be doing; it doesn’t suit my personality and I don’t feel like it uses my strengths. It doesn’t feel natural to me. From a MBTI standpoint, I’m an ENFP, and this is a *very* sensor-oriented line of work. Routine, detail-oriented tasks with little opportunity to use my brain to creatively think. Were it not for patient interaction, it would be a literal version of hell for me.

At this point, I have no idea what to do. I’m seriously feeling burnt out with it, and I haven’t even been in nursing a year. I want another job, but I don’t know how to  leverage my skills and my first degree without going back to school. Does anybody have any suggestions? I guess I have no idea what my next steps should be.

I don’t really know what industry or job I’d like to transition into, but being an ENFP, something where I get to work with people like on a team and where I get to use my brain to come up with solutions. I also like the thought of a tech or IT focused job, and like to play around with programming in my free time. Any way to leverage any of that? Or figure out what might be a good fit?

All I really know right now is that my current situation is not sustainable and I’m getting to the point where I feel like I can’t keep going like this.

Edit: I also thought it may be helpful to list some skills I have:
* Fluent in German
* Intermediate Russian knowledge
* Good with people (I’ve considered B2B sales before)
* Extensive travel experience
* Proficient Linux user
* Python
* Java
* Some Rust
* Tech support experience (worked as a technical specialist at an Apple Store)
* Data analysis/statistical modeling (took some grad level coursework after graduating)"

I got a few months of internships as a Petroleum Engineer here and there when I came back to my country but those don't really count towards anything due to covid hitting and they laid off nonessential employees. Even after almost 4 years since graduating I have not given up on my dream to become a Petroleum Engineer. I am extremely knowledgeable in this field. I still haven't stopped applying, and writing follow-up emails.

I have tried different approaches, I have been able to prove myself time after time but for some reason I still struggle everyday.

Marunong naman akong magcode and semi confident na kayang makakuha ng full time role, the reason na iniisip kong mag internship muna ay para makakuha ng bagong work experience while not fully committed sa hypothetical company since usually time framed lang ang internships like 2-4 months so kung magkataon na toxic ang company culture I can go away safely after the internship, at least no need to explain sa next interview (siguro) kung bakit maikli lang yung work ko sa hypothetical   
 company na yun since internship nga. Plus, if ever naman na maayos doon, baka mas mataas na ang chance ko for full time or maabsorb if I want sa hypothetical company since naging intern na ako doon. Downside na naiisip ko is madalas walang sahod ang internship.

I am currently working on a tool using excel VBA to calculate and generate curves of battery ( 48V 72Ah battery module ) parameters from raw BMS data ! the initial files of recordings are as shown :

The table contains data for 5 days of the week ( 4 days discharge + 1 day charge ). in an attempt to trace the evolution of capacity during each hour i summed all the currents values for each second and divided by 3600 to get an average capacity value in Ah. My code generates the following table : 

[Average Hourly capacity evolution for 5 days](https://preview.redd.it/zht5sqh4uz391.png?width=805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bf9f21a7122d7ddd4bd0212cd8e8a5de35908c5)

I don't think this is the correct sway to find the evolution of capacity since the battery starts charging after doping to a low SOC which means close to 70 Ah must have been consumed but i always get a very low total capacity discharged vs the capacity charged.  

I am a freshly grad mechanical engineer and currently in an internship, my knowledge is not very solid in this field but I'm trying nonetheless to learn and develop this tool to help facilitate work for the team.

Can someone please explain to me how to calculate accurately the capacity from voltage and current recordings ?

1. I'm an international student and we aren't allowed to do Internships outside campus during our freshman year in college.

&amp;#x200B;

2. I've been selected for a CS lab research assistantship position for summer 2023 (i.e. the summer after my freshman year) so that's what I'll be doing in the summer next year. I plan to apply for internships the summer after that.

3. I'm going to a small liberal arts college for a CS degree.

4. I have almost ZERO prior coding experience (except that I attended an online python course for a week) but I enjoy math (I've studied Calculus 1 and 2 in high school).

&amp;#x200B;

5. I'm not really expecting to get into very prestigious internships like HRT, Google STEP, etc. Just anything to get my foot into the door will work.

I know a lot of people are going to ask me to just chill, AND I DEFINETLY WILL! But I also want to do something productive side by side this summer and in college.

v65a9w,10,2022-06-06,Is my master's in neuroscience more than useless?,1jfiU8M2A4,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/v65a9w/is_my_masters_in_neuroscience_more_than_useless/,"I got a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. For the longest time, I felt like academia would be the right career path for me, so I did a psychology research internship during undergrad and am currently working as a research assistant. I'm from a country in Europe in which you usually do a master's before starting a PhD, unlike in the US where you'd start a PhD right after undergrad, if I understand correctly.

I always dreamed of doing my PhD in neuroscience because I thought being in academia and working to advance human knowledge was infinitely more rewarding than working a soulless corporate job. Maybe I lost my idealism along the way, but recently more and more I feel like i should just do what everyone else is doing and just.. start working? I can easily get a cushy job as a software developer somewhere and it just seems like a much more sensible option.

After a strenuous applications process, I got admitted to a masters programme in behavioural and cognitive neuroscience, with a focus on computational methods and neuro modelling. It's a ""research masters"" which means a strong focus on research, that is, there are classes in writing grant proposals and 75% of the students go on into PhD programs (according to their website). The program starts in September.

I'm still interested in the neuroscience and psychology classes in that masters program. I also think it would be a good opportunity for me to grow and learn more about myself and the world, perhaps more than working as a SWE for 2 years? However, I know it would be an extremely intense program, and I'm not sure if I could find the necessary motivation knowing I would start working as an SWE afterwards. 

I started interviewing and I'm also confident I'll get a decent offer from a tech company with great benefits and (from the looks of it) a great office environment and ""corporate culture"", which would be extremely important to me. So that might be the alternative. Pretty much my question is: would having a masters in neuroscience be an advantage for my future career as well, or is the advantage ""limited"" to my personal growth and expansion of knowledge?

Thank you!"

I recently graduated from college and while in college I did my internship with the company that I am working for now. So I have been here for a little over a year and a half. I am a scheduling coordinator for an agency that places caregivers in the home of senior citizens. 

Recently I have begun to feel some major burn out. I am over worked, underpaid until recently (last week I received a $2 raise), the clients are rude and demanding, and the caregivers do not care what you do for them and they always want more. Not to mention that the owner and 2 of my coworkers are going on a ""work trip"" soon for a week and leaving me to run a whole office solo and I am completely dreading it. I had to cancel my own weekend trip so I can be on call and be in the office that weekend. 

I already filled out a couple of applications for other places weeks ago, before I received my raise. But now that they have given me a raise, I feel like an asshole for wanting to leave. I made my decision before the money came into play, because it's not about the money right now (it is but at the same time, the money does not matter for me).

I know I want to leave but I do not know WHEN or HOW to leave. I wake up every morning not wanting to go to work. When I get to the office I am immediately hounded with schedule changes from clients and caregivers and then yelled at by clients when I cannot get someone to cover that shift. 

I love my coworkers and if there was another position available in the office, I would take it, but I do not want the scheduling job. And I feel bad for even wanting to leave. They tell me all the time that my position is the hardest in the company. If I can do this job, I can do anything. I am the longest scheduler that they have had. The lady before me did not even last 90 days. 

I would just like some advice on what to do and how I can build my confidence for leaving. Thanks so much and I am sorry if it is confusing."

But it really is and I'm one of the lucky ones, not the super lucky ones the rich and the filthy rich, but I'm upper middle class. I'm at uni and I used to have an internship (I quit), about 6 hours of mind numbing work a day , boring one ofc since I do engineering but I knew what I was signing up for and now I'm trying to get one in the stock market to get the bonuses soo basically just for the money since I live in a third world country soo big inflation and all the other shit soo yea u need a lot of money to have a nice life and I want to maintain mine if possible, soo your choices in uni are basically engineering, business (what I should've done, cause its a lot easier and if your family has connections you are kinda set for life with a lot less effort), law or med school, all the others you are kinda fucked, right? Kinda, Brazil is oversatured with engineeriners and lawyers soo even that is kinda bad now, I would say med school is the safest bet if u dont come from a upper class family with connections. And my country will just go downhill after the elections anyways since both candidates are nuts and criminals, but thats nothing new in south america.

But even in the first world countries is just a shit deal, sure life has its moments, I have a bunch of friends, I go to parties, play games , go out with my friends, hook up , travel, spend time with family, and thats kinda fun, my family is great I love them. But at the end of the day u live to work and work to live soo u can have 2-3 days of fun and back to your shitty job, that will be life for 90% of us at least, and does it really have a point? Like honestly we just create excuses to think it has a point kids, family, friends, jobs soo we have the motivation to have 70% of boring shit life and 30% sometimes of kinda fun .  But ending it is out of the question, at least for me , I love my mom, my dad and my brother, my friends and I love me too soo I dont want to end me, and thats part of the shit deal u birth someone u love them, u make them love u back, u make them get friends, but u keep out that only the beging of their like is kinda great and it doesnt get better, its only downhill from there. We just spend our good years working and having great moments from time to time, to retire and do what? Boom u are 70 or 65 u are old af u wont do much. Here in Brazil the retirement ( I dont really know how to translate that?) salary or compensation? Is garbage soo most people that arent educated wont retire anyways. Yes we have it way better than earlier humans A LOT BETTER, soo we have to contribute to keeping that, but most jobs arent even doing that, like stocks u are making rich people richer and earing a lot more than people that actually make other people lifes better like construction workers, bakers, cops, cooks, medics (sometimes).Its a big scam. But we got scammed, I dont want to make anyone I know sad soo we just keep going.

You know I like drawing and painting (still do it everyday dispite having to do engineering) , I'm alright at it I guess not really good but not terrible. I wanted to work on game art, designing characters and concepts but geography kinda cucked me and my family wanted an engineer (like my uncle, thats makes a shit load of money and graduated in the hardest uni) , and it makes sense since to live a good life in Brazil you do need a lot of money the kind of money u dont make as an artist on Brazil soo they were looking out for me and I also didnt try to convince them otherwise, like showing jobs in other countries and they have point salaries here in Brazil suck, I just went with it. It has its moments but overall its a bad deal soo dont have kids, especially if u dont have the money to make them happy, and if I have one, sorry dude.

Nothing traumatic has happened in my life. My parents did everything right, them being the first generation in my family to break the cycle of trauma that has existed until now. They gave me everything I could ever wish for, from physical health, from financial to intellectual and emotional support.
And despite everything, I've managed to waste everything.


I WANT to convince myself that being dead is better than continuing to live in the reality I've created for myself.


I genuinely wish to put an end to all when I see teenagers younger than me having read more books than me (I have reasons to believe I had some sort of attention deficit problem when I was younger because I couldn't finish ANY book that I would start, despide my numerous attempts to complete them, resulting in me being insecure about my vocabulary, critical thinking skills, writing skills, public speaking skills, nearly EVERYTHING that requires me to actually make use of my brain and think on my own feet) and that invested more in their intellect than I did at their age. I'm genuinely thinking of putting an end to all when I see people my age that have lived their childhood and teenage years to the fullest having a social life, having adventures and making memories, while I had none of that because of my autism (my only memories of those times being me rotting in my room indulging in my escapist tendencies, gaming and daydreaming my life away to music), resulting in me now being incapable even in the present to maintain a single interaction with anyone. My teenage and childhood years have been the death of what I could have been now. I want to end it all knowing I will never get to have the job I want, while every classmate of mine got an internship to their dream jobs.


I'll probably never get into a relationship with someone because I've alienated myself so much from society that I can't handle spedimg time alone with someone for more than half an hour at best. And even if I could eventually start a family, my kids will probably end up having autism as well. Knowing too well I lack the smarts to offer them the advice and moral support I was given, and because my future job will probably not pay me enough for me to afford them the counseling and therapy they would most likely require, they are doomed to live an existence of even worse suffering than mine.


I desperately want to make myself believe that commiting suicide is my only elegant way of stating that I (like every other unfortunate soul that had to get to know me) reject everything about my being, and before you say that chosing to carry on and continuing to craft my own desired reality is a statement on its own, I'll just let you all know I've had to live through enough painful moments where I've humiliated and made  a fool out of myself repeatedly to remind me that I don't have what it takes to make my already pathetic life worth living.

And I will no longer let anyone be a witness to my pathetic attempts, by ending it with my final act of admitting my defeat."

UW/W GPA and Rank: **UW 3.95/4.0, W 4.89/5.0** (projected to 3.98, 4.92), school doesn't rank but if I were to guess, probably top 2% in my grade. **4.33 UC GPA, projected to go down slightly to a 4.29**

v6a0cz,9,2022-06-06,TIFU by disappointing my (maybe) future boss,Fragrant-Advice-879,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v6a0cz/tifu_by_disappointing_my_maybe_future_boss/,"!Obligatory happened a few years ago!

English is my third language, so please bear with all of the potential mistakes that I'm about to make.

So, I (m,14 at the time) had an unpaid internship at a toyota dealership. It was a school related thing, so the whole class had an internship at the same time. Not at the same place, of course.

I got the spot at the dealership through family connections and was actually super excited, because I always considered becoming a car salesman. They all greeted me very nicely and I quickly felt like I belonged. One of their sales apprentices took me under his wing and I nearly spent the entire workday with him, even though I got a glimpse at everyones everyday tasks. Me and the apprentice really hit it off and we also spent the breaks together, where we would go to the guys who worked in the garage, looking after the cars (gets significant later in the story). All in all, a pretty fun and educational experience!

One day, the boss of the dealership decided to visit, so I took the opportunity to meet him. He seemed to like me and my enthusiasm and I liked him as well. He was pretty old and I got extreme ""old mentor"" vibes from him.

Fast forward to the last day of the internship, I decided to bake some muffins for everyone, to thank them for taking me in etc. The boss decided to show up, to say goodbye to me personally and to give me a present. He gave me a rare toyota jacket. The design was old and apparently they did not make them anymore, which is the reason for it's rarity.

He told me that this was his last one and he decided to gift it to me, as a ""thank you"" for choosing his dealership. I was actually quite moved and happily accepted.

Here we get to the fuckup. I ran to the sales apprentice and proudly showed him the jacket. He then said that I should show it to the guys from the garage. So I did. One of the apprentices there told me how cool the jacket is and how he would kill to have it. He offered me a trade. A jacket for an, allegedly, very expensive necklace. I went through something like a ""I wanna be cool"" phase at the time, so I thought that a necklace did not sound so bad. Conveniently, he did not have it on him right now and only showed me pictures in which he wore it. It did look very cool. He told me that he would send me the necklace by mail and stupid, naive little me accepted the deal, after the other apprentices encouraged me to do so. They told me how this kind of necklace is in style right now and how good I would look with it. Thinking that they would not lie to me, because I've known the for a week, I gave away the jacket, only moments after receiving it in a very sincere moment, for a stupid necklace, that I did not even get at the same time. (The apprentices were all around 18-20 years old, by the way)

I actually never got the necklace. Through my family connecton, I heard that the boss was reaaaally dissapointed at how I treated his gift. My family connection (he works there, by the way), also told me how stupid he thinks it was from me, which is why he did not help me with establishing contact to the apprentice whom I tradet the jacket to. It seems like a small thing but it genuenly bothers me when I think about it today. I hate 14 year old me. 14 is young, but not young enough to be *this* naive, in my opinion. 

Now that I am about to finish school, I might apply for an apprenticeship at the toyota dealership. I'm kinda nervous about meeting the boss again, even though it has been such a long time. I was a kid, but I still left a negative impression.

Tldr: Was an intern at a car dealership. Had a wholesome Interaction with the boss who gifted me a rare jacket (with the car brand on it). Only moments later I gave the awesome jacket away for a necklace that I never even recieved."

I know that If I applied for this internship I'll get it quite easily and also they're saying it's internship leading to job. But the thing is, mostly software houses do scams like this and they don't hire u after the internship period. I just don't want to waste my three months.

I know Im still really lucky to get the opportunities that I have so this isn’t a “CS is easy money just learn to code” post or anything like that.
  
Im 22 years old and Im an SDE 2 at Amazon making $250k a year. I grew up to an elementary school teacher and someone who didn’t go to college and barely finished high school. I didn’t even know how college admissions worked until late in high school. I knew no one who was a software engineer.  
  
My state (WA) has a program called running start which allows you to go to community college when you’re in high school without needing to apply for anything or take any tests. I just signed up and did it, graduating high school with 2 years of college credit.  
  
I was really lucky to have a great CS state school (UW) and even luckier that I really enjoyed school and got in to the program with limited experience and barely any extracurriculars. It honestly was a huge advantage for me not because of career fairs (for me at least) but because they really emphasized getting internships. I had no idea that internships were a thing until I saw advisors talking about it.  
  
I had no experience and no major projects so my internship hopes were 0. I found Google Summer of Code where you work with an open source project and after finding a project I liked, I started to contribute before the applications started. With that as kind of proof that i could do something useful, I was accepted and got my first bit of experience.  
  
The next fall, I applied for 100 internships and got 2 responses that luckily led to offers. One of which was Amazon. I graduated and got a return offer so I continued to work there.  I worked hard and from that I got promoted about a year after I started as a new grad.  
  
I was extremely lucky to live in a state with the running start program. Lucky to have a good state school. Lucky to get into a good CS program. Lucky to find out about GSoC. Lucky to get into Amazon, and lucky to get a good manager that supported an early promotion. I also know that I’m lucky to be relatively good at CS stuff.  
  
Again I’m not trying to say “look at what I did anyone can do this too”. I’m just trying to appreciate that this is even remotely possible. I’m a huge introvert and I typically hate talking to people about work and especially networking. I didn’t have to deal with any seniority issues for my promo, I didn’t have to wait for 8+ years of school to start making money and I didn’t have to be family members with an exec or go to a target school to get a job.  
  
It’s not a perfect industry, but compared to many others, software is pretty nice."
v6bvlm,100,2022-06-06,Don't have an internship? What to do during the Summer:,PresidentCoolidge,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/v6bvlm/dont_have_an_internship_what_to_do_during_the/,"Despite what reading this sub might tell you, I would say the vast majority of CS majors have 0-1 internships, and end up just fine. This is especially true for underclassmen. But let's say you don't have an internship, and you have all the free time over the Summer -- what to do?

# 1\. Get rest

This one is obvious, but also something I think some of you forget sometimes. It can be easy to be burnt out — college is hard! Take care of yourself, hang out with friends, go outside, take long walks, exercise and workout, eat good, or sleep a reasonable amount of hours. You don't have to be working at 100% all the time, just make sure you are well-rested and prepared for the next year.

# 2\. Practice for interviews

**Technical:**

Practice and make sure you have your Data Structures and Algorithms down. Good places to start are [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.amazon.com/dp/3030542556), [A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1680502441), or just [LeetCode Explore](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn). After that, you can start grinding out [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) or [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) problems: [Blind 75](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions), [NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/) are good places to start working on that in a systematic way.

**Behavioral:**

Ask a friend to give you a quick practice interview, or just look up interview questions and imagine how you would respond to them. If you are lacking in social skills, make sure to shower and also try to put yourself out there more: [How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People ](https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034) is a good option for a self-help book if you're into that.

# 3\. Personal Projects

Personal projects are a big thing. Figure out how to make a GitHub repository, and work on some kind of personal project while maintaining a stable commit history. There's plenty of options: it can be literally anything. Ideally, you would be using a technology, framework, library, language that's relevant and related to the position you're seeking, but just making something cool that excites you is a good way to spend your time regardless!

# 4\. Work on your Resume

Start off with a nice template, such as: [GTech Template (Word)](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Industry/ece_upcp_resume_template_and_guide_spring19.docx), [FriskyHobo Resume (Google Docs)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q0ucm4M18PH4YRxGbAzyDNDK5KHrLLVl5JIwC2HLBbs/edit), [Jake's Resume (LaTeX)](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs). Basic information is: Education, Skills, Experience, Projects. But you can also add awards, activities, etc. Just succinctly type everything out while accurately describing your role, and I'm sure you will do great. See [195 Action Verbs to Make Your Resume Stand Out](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/action-verbs-to-make-your-resume-stand-out) and [How To Create a STAR Method Resume](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/star-method-resume) to enhance your desciriptions. Also: here's the r/cscareerquestion's  [Exemplary Resume Sharing Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nuynz5/official_exemplary_resume_sharing_thread_june_2021/) for some great examples.

# 5\. Learn

This one's pretty vague, but having free time is a great way to learn a lot of things. Go on YouTube for a tutorial on whatever technology excites you at the time. Look at the documentation for something new. Learn a new language, technology, framework: something else different. Maybe take a Udemy or Coursera course on whatever.

If you can't think of one, here's some random languages and technologies

Languages: Rust, TypeScript, SQL, Elixir, Dart, SASS

Libraries: React, TensorFlow, pandas, REST APIs, GraphQL, Serverless (AWS Firestore, Cloud Run), TailwindCSS, MongoDB

Frameworks: Remix, Svelte, Vue, Node.js, Next.js, Gatsby, React Native, Flutter, Firebase, Blazor

Tools: Git commit hooks, Docker, Kubernetes, Vim, Visual Studio Code (but with all the shortcuts)

# 6\. Start applying for internships

This isn't necessary at all to do during the Summer, but if you think you are prepared and you have an excellent application (and also start doing this around August), you can get a start on sending out applications for internships. If you know anyone with a company you like, you can ask them for a referral (or just randomly shoot your shot on LinkedIn with alumni). Some good places to look into: [Summer 2023 Tech Internships](https://github.com/pittcsc/Summer2023-Internships), [Underclassmen-Specific Internships](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15arh2xiWZ9noq_ogtD_IvfXZ-Np8ZnVdaKEbw0_g-Oo/edit#gid=1540676130), [2023 New Grad Applications](https://github.com/coderQuad/New-Grad-Positions-2023).

[Zero to Offer](https://pittcs.wiki/zero-to-offer/) by the Pitt Computer Science Club is an excellent guide on this whole process.

Anyway, hope this guide was useful in some way. Good luck in your future endeavors."

I hope everyone had an awesome weekend.

I'm in need of some guidance in how to approach this problem. I do not have career experience in this industry as of yet but somehow was given the opportunity for this internship. I am being asked to collect variables of data pertaining to temp. sensitive pharmaceuticals. In theory, I am a consultant and need to design a system containing a mobile app that relays data to both the company/customer for transparency and assurance. What questions do I need to ask the client regarding this? e.g. Budget? Time frame? Design a system or pull an off the shelf system and try to integrate with that? If designing, any data requirements? Storing data locally or via cloud?...etc \*Am i on the right track with those questions?

Additionally, what is the best approach to building a database to store the data? What tools should I consider/propose? I'd like there to be a dashboard with analytics tools available the owner's side of the system. For the customers view, perhaps a Map and tracker with a constant reading of the current temp at all times would be ideal. 

That data to be collected is :  
Temp of shipment (real-time data)   
Proof of delivery (signature)  
Order accuracy (% without complaints)  
Fuel consumption rate (avg per mile)  
Average service time (time to fulfill single order)  
Damage claimes ($ amount and % of total deliveries  
Time of delivery (avg time to complete single order in single day)   **\*\*\* should i ask if thats a 24 hr period or 8 hr workday period?**  
Total mileage  
Cost per mile  
Capacity utilization  
Number of stops, unnecessary stops, duration of off unnecessary stops  
Complaint details 

For the mobile app, I'm not really at all privy to mobile app development. The problem states that I should have the driver interact with the app as little as possible. In the case of signature and cost of fuel, is it obvious that I'd need their participation or is there a clear work around that I'm overlooking?

Lastly, what's the best route for creating a live feed of temperature data thats visible to all necessary parties? What kind of technology is best for achieving this? 

Could I use the GPS tracking data for the mobile app for the other requirement of logging the data for unnecessary stops? Like if the vehicle stopped unnecessarily, the system could trigger a notification via the dashboard?"

 I am currently trying to get three certs in the next three months. I'm trying to get my Net+ This month, Linux + in July, and ITIL maybe in August. I guess my question is do you think that this in tandem with this IT internship will help my resume stand out more?

v6d67o,7,2022-06-06,How can I efficiently use my summer for SWE internship applications next school year?,bellpeppercaptain,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/v6d67o/how_can_i_efficiently_use_my_summer_for_swe/,"Hey y'all,

I hope that this is tailored to the subreddit correctly and that I'm not posting this in the wrong place.

**The context:**

I'm a current CS major going into my third year of college, and I've taken a few CS classes that gave me the fundamentals of Algorithms and Data Structures, C, and Java (my most used and most comfortable language). I'll be taking some ML and computer graphics courses next semester, but as it stands those are the only skills I have at this point.

**The situation:**

At this point, I've missed the boat on the whole summer internship cycle (as best I can tell), and that's fine. I've resigned myself to working a boring summer job so I can pay for books, etc. next semester, but I want to spend all the rest of my time improving my skillset and making myself into a stronger candidate (and relaxing a little, of course).

**The real question(s)/uncertainties:**

I'm interested in game dev specifically, but I still want to build more general CS/SWE skills. I've spent the past couple weeks learning Unity and C#, and I'm hoping to participate in some game jams and to build prototypes and games that I can list in a portfolio for game dev internships next summer (which also means I'll be spending even more time to learn 3D modeling, animations, blah blah blah).

  
I currently don't have a personal website, and I've seen enough front-end internship posts on linkedin to think that learning CSS, HTML, and JS (and a framework or two) for the purposes of making a personal site is something I ought to do. I could use Squarespace or Wordpress, but I know some people who do web dev and I'm not too intimidated (perhaps I'm absurdly naive). In the process, I'd likely learn to build some smaller sites/projects on the way up, but I'm not sure if that would be enough for me to confidently apply for frontend work. Again, my main focus is on game dev, so I'm worried about spending too much time creating bland or stupid sites that don't get me anywhere near the skill level required for applying for those internships. 

  
In other news, I'm considering focusing on deepening my Java knowledge to a more intermediate level, but I'm not sure if and how I should learn awt, Spring, etc. (these are just words I've seen that is literally the extent of my knowledge). Likewise, deepening my C or moving to C++ (for later game dev as well, potentially) knowledge seems like a good idea, but I'm not sure what kinds of projects, etc. are a good use of time. At this point, I mostly have private repos and school assignments I can't show anyone, so I'd like to build things that can better convey my abilities publicly.  
I have some level of familiarity with python, but not to the point that I could confidently list it as a language I know, and I'd like to improve that, if only for leetcode.

As actual questions:

1. What recommendations do you have for how to focus/deepen the areas I listed as wanting to improve?
2. Is this too much for me to realistically tackle from now until the end of the year? I saw game dev applications well into the spring so I think the timeline might be a bit longer compared with FAANG, etc., but I want to have meatier game examples and demos for my portfolio
3. Are there (there are lol) any misconceptions or flat-out misunderstandings that seem evident from this post? How should I address them?
4. What kinds of projects are good demonstrations of skill, etc. that aren't simply baby's first steps or wastes of time that don't really teach me design patterns, skills, etc. that would actually be credible in the eyes of potential big name employers and interviewers?
5. Should I also add relational databases on top of this gargantuan pile? Will I collapse under the weight of a full stack? Am I just screwed? (yes, switch majors)"

So my ex and I broke up like 5 years ago already, and to this day I can't stop thinking about her. But not like in an in love way, different, not sure what way really.
But the thing is, she was awful to me during our relationship. Of course not always, but when she was, she was awful, she would say that I was a piece of shit. She would call me faggot, she would say that I was not enough, that I was not like her friend's boyfriends.
And it hurts because I have never put so much effort and love into something or someone, I would take a 2 hour bus everyweekend with the little money I had just to see her and be with her, I returned from the US to my country because I couldn't stand being without her. I really really gave her my everything, I was a better human being and my life felt better when I was with her, when things were right of course.
And I am not saying I was perfect by any means, but I never treated her not even a fraction of the way she treated me sometimes, even less said to her the kinds of things she told me, and of that I'm sure. 
The thing is, we broke up, not because I didn't love her, but because I couldn't anymore. She treated me like shit and it was too painful, but that was a decision I took against all of my desire to still be with her even how she was with me.

And our relationship lasted like 2 years. Now fast forward to 5 years since then, we have not spoken one bit, but I sometimes look at her Instagram profile, and see how she is with someone now that she clearly loves, he is French, she is living with him, traveling all of Europe, she is being an intern at the United Nations, she stopped following me even though I never bothered her, I was never the ex who still lingered. Nothing.

And me, I'm a loser whose life does not flow at all, I work at a customer service job that I hate, I apply to hundreds of jobs wishing to get something different but never hear back from no one. All my friends have moved on with their lifes, I try to reach out to those ""friends"" just to talk sometimes and I am always ignored. My days are always the same no matter how much change I try to implement to my life, I'm back living in the US, and I do not fit here, I cannot make friends because is hard for me and people are not specially friendly here.

I just keep asking life, why am I paying the karma when I did everything as best as I could? Why she doesn't leave my mind? Why do I loved someone who has treated me the worst anyone has in my life? Why life doesn't flow for me?
Why am I the one wanting to kill himself, when I try to be good to everyone. I feel like such a loser, and probably I am.

This will probably go unread but at least it helped release some emotion. Thanks anyway."
v6doy5,1,2022-06-06,Stick with IT/tech and tough it out or join a union trade while in the Army NG?,BigRedCole,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/v6doy5/stick_with_ittech_and_tough_it_out_or_join_a/,"Hello,

I recently graduated college with a bachelor's in information systems (Cum Laude, GPA:3.68) and live in a metro area near an important city. I also joined the Army national guard as an officer (Signal/Comms) as I was in ROTC, which paid for my degree. I also will get a Top-Secret Clearance once the paperwork goes through, as it is required for my Army job (Have a secret clearance currently). 

After graduating (and before), I had been applying to many different jobs and internships that had anything related to my degree in the description, which is anything from basic helpdesk/IT to SAP/ERP systems. But sadly, I either get rejected because of the little to no experience (I had to take classes in the summer to graduate on time) or after I tell them I am in the military, which requires me to occasionally take time off work to go to drill which is a turnoff to most employers (this can range from a weekend to a month).

Due to all these rejections, I've been looking into other avenues of work, like the skilled trades. Nearby me are many different Union trades (Sheetmetal, electrician, Bricklayer, and Pipefitter). I have no problem working in crappy conditions or working long hours as the military has already prepared me for that, so I'm not worried about the work and am definitely prepared for what kind of conditions they have to work in. Obviously though, many other people have had the same idea as me, but they didn't wait until after college to do it. 

For example, there are currently about 1000 people trying to go through the union electrician apprenticeship program where I tried applying to, so I would have to wait until that opened to even start working as an apprenticeship and still work 4-5 years to graduate. The other trades, in this case Sheetmetal and pipefitter, only start classes during two periods of the year (April and October) and I'm in between both of them.

The main issue now is what do I do? Do I wait around and keep applying for IT/tech jobs while studying for certs (Sec+, Net+, ETC)? Do I hope that the trades are for me and become a union apprentice? I am hoping for some advice from those who were in similar situations or who work in either environment."

The dilemma: I'm 3 months into a 6 month contract, which will most likely not lead on to an extension or new job within the team. I have therefore been applying to loads of jobs, mainly in marketing/comms. I have however landed a different role as support to an Executive Assistant/personal secretary in a 'Big 4' firm. The pay is bad but better than what I'm on now. The job is NOT something I want to do long-term. The job is however a HUGE step up in terms of company 'name'/prestige. I have accepted as it is the best/only offer so far, and I do not want to be unemployed in 3 months.

In the long-term, I aim to go back into marketing.

Is this move the wrong one? I would regret turning down such a big global firm, but I am uninspired by the job description. I also worry that I will now be stuck forever in a role I dislike, and won't be able to get back into MarComms. My heart says take the risk and turn the offer down, my head says do it for a few months/back up and keep applying elsewhere in MarComms.

Help! What should I do?

TLDR: Should I stay in my 6 month contract in a small charity in a role that I love, or should I take a stable role in a huge global company that inspires me less, with the view to move on quickly?"

It's so disheartening. It's like no one cares. Everyone here talks about switching jobs to get away from a horrible employer, but how do you guys even get a job if no one responds to your applications. 

I did everything right, I did well in college and did an internship pre-pandemic. At this point I'm not sure what to do."

I graduated with a bachelor's in computer science last month. I got a good grade, and it's from a good university. I have developed experience in so many topics, from web development to database management and have worked with several languages.

I have been actively job hunting for over 3 months now, and I have not even come close to finding one. I either get flat-out rejected or ignored, and the only ones that get back to me are the shady contracting companies that require 2 months of less-than-minimim-wage training and have confessed to me that they add years of fake experience to your resume to land clients. Everyone I know got their jobs through connections, yet each friend in the field tells me their company has no open positions. Any company I've managed an interview with tells me their other candidates have at least an internship, which I was unable to manage because of COVID complications.

By the end of next month, I will be homeless. I have spent the last year finishing my degree with the savings from my summer job keeping me afloat, and that is all but gone now. I have some time, but the fruitless searching is scaring me, and everything feels hopeless. This field is more than a little skewed against new players, and I am starting to regret all the time and effort I invested.

If anyone has anything hopeful to share, advice, or anything, really, thank you. I'm all ears."

my first internship was $20/hr which I’m def grateful for the experience, but I had to work 2 other jobs alongside it and I performed so horribly, I was working a third night shift for some time as well and I would oversleep standup sometimes or miss meetings and it was a horrible look for me.

v6g1el,1,2022-06-06,Questions about Google STEP and Meta University,codinggoal,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/v6g1el/questions_about_google_step_and_meta_university/,"Hello all, 

I am a incoming freshman into CS and I had a few questions about the Google STEP and Meta University internships, but I would love feedback from anyone with a CS internship in their freshman and sophomore years. I've tried to google these questions before posting, but I can find nothing concrete on the topics that I've researched, so I am here to ask for some insight.

1) I graduated from high school a year early, and I entered elementary school a year early. This makes me 16 entering college. I will turn 17 part way through the year. Can I still get internships in my freshman year, or will I need to wait until I turn 18? Will my internship search be limited by this?

2) I have knowledge of niche languages because of an interest in coding as a kid, this including Batch and TI Basic. Is this useful for building my resume, or should I leave this off?

3) I am Jewish and will be participating in Jewish community organizations on campus. Should I mention this to recruiters looking to build a diverse community in CS? 

4) I intend to a relatively heavy course load throughout the year and a few courses over the summer, as I am in a unique position where my courses are, for the most part free but I still have to pay full fees at the college I am going to. In your experience, did having an internship hurt your academic success, and if I need to choose, which should take priority?

5) If I want help building a CS specific linkedin or resume, should I refer to campus career services or a CS department advisor? 

6) How useful is research in pursuing an internship? My university allows students to conduct research starting their sophomore year, excluding a few exceptions. 

7) Bonus question, I know this is a matter of preference, but for those in Google STEP and Meta University internships, would you recommend leetcode or codewars? 

Thank you all, I have been browsing this community extensively and appreciate all of the help that people on here have provided me in my endeavors. Good luck in your searches to each and every one of you!"

Ive been having some financial concerns lately. My classes are going to get really intense next year. I'm continuing the math 30s series plus starting to take the physics 1 series and cs series next year. I feel like the course load looks pretty challenging to me so I want to stop working part time job to focus more on school and finding summer internship next year.

But I don't know if I can support myself. I've worked a lot during my freshman year so I have saved up a lot. And I'm gonna be working this summer too. I was thinking of using that money for the following years if Im not gonna have a job (not like Im rich or anything but I think it's enough if I spend moderately). But I still feel really uneasy. My parents cannot really support me. After going to college, I have been supporting myself thanks to my part time job and financial aid. Sometimes, if I have extra I would send the money back home to support my parents.

The thought of not having the part time job makes me feel so scared. I don't know if I can just live off my savings for the next couple years. But what if i won't perform well academically because I'm  burned out from all the commitments and I won't be able to find summer internships (this is my biggest fear).

I can't sleep well these days thinking about all the financial burden and academic responsibilities that I have. Not sure how others are enjoying their lives in college but my life is always about my part time jobs, future career, and academics. If anyone has any stories/ advice please lmk I would really appreciate it."

Degree: Masters Analytics  
Industry: Financial Services  
Role: Modeling/Data Science  
Lcol area  
Base: 83k  
Total comp (bonus + 401k matching): 101k 
YOE: 2 months as an intern and 6 months full time (been on leave for 10 months so total time in the company is 1 year +)  

I was hired on full time one year after completing a fully remote internship. They asked me if I was willing to relocate to headquarters and I said yes and relocated there. When I arrived I found that most coworkers had moved away and only my manager and one of the seniors remained. Then one week into the job they moved me to be on a sister team where the entire team including the manager were all remote. I felt a little baited but was still open and excited about starting my first role. They asked that I continue to come into the office even tho I would just zoom call my new team. In office interaction and learning was very minimal to none. I don’t like my new team/manager nearly as much as my old team and I feel like I’ve had less growth in the 6 months I was a full time employee compared to the 2 month internship with my old team. I went in to the office 2 days a week and worked remotely 3. After 6 months on the job I was called for mandatory military service with less than a week’s notice and have been on leave for 10 months since. 

During my time on leave the company paid me my full salary for 6 months and differential pay after that. They also gave me a 10% raise because I was well under market value (was at 73k base before raise) and a 3% incentive raise (current 83k base).

I am definitely extremely grateful for the company’s military leave policy and I don’t want to ruin that or paint a negative light on future service members. On the other hand I don’t feel like the manager, team, and environment are conducive to my learning and development as a new employee so I’m thinking about looking for other jobs . 

On top of this I’d like to go back to my original home after returning from military duty to be closer to family and friends. When I mentioned this and my lack of learning in the office environment to my manager, he suggested I go back to the office and “try it out” for another 6 months. I really don’t understand why because there’s no one in the office that has available time to teach/mentor me (mostly busy managers and senior execs) and no changes in office personnel have been made since I left. 

Ultimately I feel like it’s not the right fit for me but I also feel guilty for wanting to leave. I also have imposter syndrome about finding a new job since I’ve only gained 6 months of experience where I felt minimal growth and my life has been interrupted so greatly by the deployment. What would you do and what advice would you give me? Thanks for reading!"
v6inwv,1,2022-06-06,What do I do 2 years out of college now?,motivated_user21,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/v6inwv/what_do_i_do_2_years_out_of_college_now/,"Graduated in May 2020 with a degree in Marketing and still haven’t even started my career.  I went back home during the pandemic and worked my old summer job at a painting company. After about a year of that I made a jump and moved out.  Shortly after got a job working in a warehouse and have been here for about 9 months now.  It was a company/industry I could see myself wanting to work in so I figured it could present an opportunity to get my foot in the door.  And sure enough, it did. An entry level marketing role opened up and I jumped on it.  I had built some good relationships, got in front of the right people and… they went with an outside hire “solely because they had more experience”.  Which whatever, maybe they did just want someone with experience, but I’ll be honest my interview skills are lackluster at best.  It was basically a 4 round interview process with multiple VPs, a work sample and a wonderlic test and I feel like I blew the final interview.  I don’t know if I have crippling imposter syndrome or what but I thought if I had the relationships and they liked me and knew I would care a lot that would be enough. 

So now I feel like I’m back to where I was 2 years ago.  The Brand Manager says he  wants to talk about a seasonal role for this upcoming summer that would be a intern/temp position. But I’m not sure, I’ve already done an internship and the hours kind of suck. Not to mention I’m pretty devastated about not getting the job.  I didn’t realize how much relies on the interview trying to get your first job, because no matter what job, you basically have to convince someone to take a chance on you since you’re so unproven.  Part of me wants to move on from my current company and try and go get an entry level role and the other part wants to see what I could do with the potential intern job here. I’m trying to remind myself how young I am but it sucks with so much uncertainty and watching all my friends get promotions and raises at this point. Idk what to do"

* School prizes (sophomore prize for academic and extracurricular dedication, junior prize for academic excellence, sound character, and constructive leadership)

**Letters of Recommendation**

I believe that my LORs are the strongest pieces of my application. My US history teacher wrote one, and I am lucky enough to have her as a dorm advisor, meaning she has lived with me for 3 years. She and I have a tight relationship and I did extraordinarily well in her class—I’d rate it a 9.5/10. My calculus teacher wrote my other academic rec, and again we got along really well and I did really well in her class—8.5/10. My college counselor wrote my counselor rec, and he and I are top tier buds—10/10.

**Interviews**

Nah I literally don’t remember any of them… they were decent, I think. I had EA interviews for each school that offered them (MIT and Case Western), and I’ve done RD interviews whenever offered (Carleton, Grinnell, Cornell, Harvard, Yale, Harvey Mudd, URochester). I did not get an interview for Columbia.

**Essays**

I think my essays are really, really strong. My CA personal statement discussed how I’ve explored different aspects of my identity (namely socioeconomic status and sexuality) through shitty fashion; I think it displayed who I am (not only these named identifiers but also personality) very effectively. I also believe my supplemental essays were good. My college counselor is using them as examples for future students.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* Indiana University (CS, $11k/yr merit)

* Purdue University (CS)

**Additional Information:**

I started out high school very shaky. Right at the end of the first semester of my freshman year, my mom attempted suicide in front of me. My dad took custody of me (they divorced when I was 4) and I moved halfway across the state. She bounced in and out of jail that year. During my sophomore year, she jumped out of a window and broke three parts of her spine, landing her in a medically-induced coma. This same year, I applied to boarding schools and ended up repeating my sophomore year of high school voluntarily due to the educational gap between my past low-income high school and my new school. During my second sophomore year, she was sentenced to 6 months in jail and 18 months on house arrest. I don’t want to victimize myself in any way, and I don’t want sympathy, but these events heavily impacted my academics in high school.

**Reflections:**

My advice to everyone going through the app process is to not be afraid to be a fucking mega dork in your application. I wrote about fucking Naruto and robotics whenever I could, and I got some damn good results.

I wrote down some advice, if you so care:

* Go with your gut! There were so many times throughout the application process where I just didn't trust myself and my choices. My gut feeling was to go test optional at MIT, and I didn't—now I'm just left with the ""what ifs"". Also, it is totally okay to judge colleges for yourself based on vibes. You don't need some massive concrete, statistic reason to not apply to a school. If you get any bad vibe from it, then trust yourself.  It's maybe not an awful idea to go with your gut feeling when you choose a school to attend, either. You'll be spending ~4 years there; you don't want to be miserable.

* Don't doubt yourself!! I applied to a lot of reaches, but there were some schools I didn't apply to because for some reason I weirdly doubted I'd get in. I'm super happy with where I'm going, of course, but I wish I would've applied to Stanford!! I just did not think I would get in, so I didn't even bother trying.

* Don't fear rejection. If there's a school you really like, even if you feel like you have no chance at getting in, APPLY ANYWAY!

* If you qualify for fee waivers, use them! I did not pay for a single college application-related expense, and it saved my ass so much. Please don't feel embarrassed or shameful or anything—utilize these amazing resources.

* If you are an underrepresented applicant, APPLY TO FLY-INS!!! So many top schools have fly-ins (MIT, Caltech, Dartmouth, Columbia, etc. etc.) and they're super helpful with learning more about a school, especially within the lens of being from an underrepresented background. Also, I don't know if they necessarily *help* you to get into a school, but there is a correlation between attending a fly-in and being admitted to a school. However, if you get rejected from the fly-in, that doesn't mean you have no chance at that school. I got rejected from Columbia's fly-in, yet I got a likely and a special scholar designation. My friend got rejected from Swarthmore's fly-in but was accepted into the school RD. 

* Be YOU in your essays. Don't be afraid of being conversational, in a way. I write the way I talk, and I got a lot of notes post-acceptance from schools saying that the AOs really got to know me through my essays and that they really appreciated reading my voice. If you naturally write a bit less or a bit more personal, that's totally okay—just don't try to force yourself into a different writing voice for your essays. I feel like that is where a lot of students struggle.

* If you need financial aid, complete your FAFSA and CSS profile AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!! Colleges are pains in the ass when it comes to finaid documentation. The quicker you submit your shit, the earlier you can iron out any issues within them, and you can avoid issues with receiving aid due to time.

* STAY OFF R/CHANCEME. EVERY SINGLE COMMENTER ON THERE HAS ABSOLUTELY NO CLUE WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT!!! I was super anxious entering application season, and used r/chanceme more than once. I was repeatedly told I had no chance at MIT or Caltech and that my scores and GPA were way too low for any top school's CS program. Clearly, they were very wrong. That subreddit is nothing but toxic and just blatantly incorrect. Please save yourself the worry!

* Don't get caught up in comparing yourself to other applicants, especially in self-selecting spaces like A2C. Every single person is different, and there's no one type of applicant that is correct. If you have no research, or no work experience, or whatever, THAT'S PROBABLY COMPLETELY FINE!! You are yourself, and nobody else. Do what you love and do what you can do, because you are different from any other applicant. 

* Be kind to yourself. No matter what your application results are, you are worthy of love and praise.

I don’t know. Don’t take my advice. I’m 19 and stupid as fuck. Do what feels right to you!"

In need of some advice from you all. I am a current intern at a government job and received a job offer. 10 month's ago when I started I had disclosed my DUI arrest and date for amended sentencing to reckless driving because I received a notice asking for notification on anything that may pop up on a background check. I ended up getting the internship with no problems about the DUI. I am doing another background check with a different background check company and am unsure if I should bring up my old DUI again. The difference from the last back ground check and this present one would be that I am now officially charged with a reckless driving, so my concern is that this may look like a new incident to them. This time around I did not receive an e-mail notice asking if there would be any detrimental information that would pop up on the background check like I had received the first time.

Thank you all

I am still a community college student finishing my A.S., taking my first programming class this semester. However, I anticipate that I will apply to transfer to UT Austin/A&amp;M/Rice next year for the fall with a projected GPA of 3.82 on the low end, 3.89 mid-end, 3.95 at the highest (with 60 credits completed).

These schools and CS in general seem so hyper-competitive that I feel kind of soul crushed like my admissions chances are abysmally low and I am preparing for the worst. I am a disabled air force vet with a fairly sizeable list of credentials from my time in service (if that helps at all).

Anyhow, let's assume I have to attend my city state-school (UTSA) because I just don't get admitted to these schools (sadface). What will my career prospects/progression realistically look like? I practice coding everyday in my free time (I find it fun and it's nice improving), I want to start looking for internships fairly soon as well.

How much does school prestige/ranking really matter and are there any universities you all recommend I apply to that I haven't already thought of? I'd like to work for big tech at least once to experience it and see if I like it (preferably Microsoft)."

-APs
2020 freshman yr:
3 in AP US History, 3 in AP Physics 1
2021 sophomore yr:
5 in AP NSL, 5 in AP Chemistry 
2022: 
I took AP calc bc, AP psychology, AP physics c mechanics, AP biology, AP language &amp; composition 

I plan to major in linguistics (maybe minor or double major in film)

ECs
- captain of travelling skating team (we compete with other states and stuff)
- team lead of a project on mental health associated with a government organization (we're creating a national contest, but not sure how successful its gonna be)
- made several videos for organizations that got a few thousand views each, two of which are campaign videos for board of education candidates
- secretary/treasurer of french honor society, member of english and math honor society
- president of small film club at school, video production officer of several out of school clubs 
- ambassador for an international nonprofit, but I've been fairly inactive

Awards
- 2x north american computational linguistics Olympiad semifinalist (very very close to qualifying for alternate one year)
- national awards in documentary film contest
- official selection for all american hs film fest and gig harbor film fest
- proclamation from my county council

Recs are probably average, but supplemental rec from my skating coach will probably be pretty good

Since I dont have a lot of linguistics stuff on here, I applied to the cambridge center for international research, which is for profit but has a research mentorship for high schoolers, I'm not sure how reliable it is though, so I'm debating whether I should also cold email some university professors for research internships?

Sorry about the long post! What do you all think are my chances of getting into ivy league level schools (so t10 t20)? Also any advice on what I can still do now as a rising senior to strengthen my app?

v6krjk,41,2022-06-06,Socializing is important,happy_thots_only,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/v6krjk/socializing_is_important/,"What i realised a few weeks into my first internship is that socializing and being able to small talk is very important. I realised all the the people in the high ranks can small talk very well, even in technical departments like SWE.

I didn't know SWE was so social, i thought i came into the field to avoid interactions but there are actually a lot of interactions involving non-work topics especially for build working relationships with your colleagues. 

I am an extremely technical guy and am doing my intern projects without much guidance except for scoping of requirements and can mostly get my technical ideas understood and discussed with and have delivered the projects as per requirements. But i don't think thats enough, somehow i realised that small talk is important and SWE is an extremely social job somehow (anyone feel free to elaborate on this).

It kinda sucks because I thought i could live like a hermit (cringe word but best term i could come up with) and just do my work and not talk so much. But it seems to me that living this way would not get me far beyond mid level when i want to be a principal engineer. 

But im glad this internship made me realised that before graduation, and i guess its time for me to change. So I just want to share my experience here, in case anyone in CS thinks like me as well."

The first week the managers had us do plenty of orientation activities, including icebreakers. One icebreaker in particular was a “scavenger hunt”, where the interns are broken into groups and we race to take group selfies in front of local landmarks near the office.

My team was not interested whatsoever since they are local to the area. They discussed only going to 3 landmarks and then heading to a cafe for the remainder of the challenge. I thought to myself, well since no one cares about the race, I might as well explore the area and grab some bubble tea on my own while my team goes to the cafe. I poorly communicate to my team I’m gonna go get some bubble tea (with little explanation) and I headed off a bit too quickly. 

Because I left so abruptly, they got concerned and reported what I did in the intern groupchat, which I was unaware of at the time. When I was on my bubble tea run, I didn’t think too much of what I did. Once I returned to the office, my group confronted me and questioned why I did that (reasonably so). Word got around about what I did and now I am labeled as “the guy who ditched his group” across the office.

It is extremely petty, however, it is a pretty shitty reputation to have amongst people you see on a daily basis who don’t personally know you. I deserve no pity for what I did, my social anxiety did me no favors. This awkward moment will haunt me for the next 10 weeks as I get to relive feelings of high school."

I will undergo an internship (mandatory &amp; unpaid) next month which requires me being physically there (fully engaged/teaching about 8 hours a week) - the internship is 10 weeks FYI, and now the work is shifted into hybrid mode…

A bit worried things will clash in case they want everyone in the office once a week or so, because I don’t have that flexibility ): based on my observation, they love to meet physically on Thu or Fri

I’m an Individual Contributor (IC) so they basically know what I’m involved in, and so on, it’s like I’m somewhat being watched, and overall can’t think of excuses consistently either (it’s exhausting for me to lie) and because my manager and boss are rather the by the book type, I can’t say “I need flexi-work” without them telling me to take the whole day off (for 10 whole weeks? Yea like they’re gonna approve)

For context, before joining I did share about this but unsure if it’s something they remember - and I’m in a position where it’s weird to bring up again… cause in last week’s meeting, the big boss was just talking about how they chose me over someone who was more experienced because the other candidate “only want remote work” - he refers to it as fussy; too much excuses

I only have till next week before it’s too late to resign (should I do so) - but I need the money for rent… since the internship will be unpaid (stupid I know) - there are some savings but it means being on a strict budget for 3 months

Any advice is good, because I’m not sure how to work my way around this. Thank you 😞🙏🏻"

**Letters of Recommendation**

Counselor (5/10): Got switched to a new one my junior year and I basically blew up his email bc he never put me in the classes I wanted. Had to drop like 3 APs I wanted bc of him and the school. Outside of a 3-page brag sheet, it was likely a generic ""brilliant student with a bright future in medicine"" blurb.

9th grade English teacher (9.5/10): Absolutely loved me and gassed me up sooooooo much lmao. Talked a lot about my passion and drive for change (also beefed up some of my ECs?). Would never describe myself as well as he did.

10th grade structures and functions teacher (4/10): Loved her to bits but after reviewing the scholarship LOR she sent, didn't seem that she had a lot to say? Like one of my best essays was based on her class but I seemed to be a generic bright kid in her essay which sucked. Kinda wished I traded hers out for my AP bio teacher (wrote my scholarship LORs) or english teacher.

AP world teacher (7/10): Was the sponsor for my political club and we had a great relationship. Her LOR was very encouraging and sweet despite us being virtual when I had her class. Love her to bits.

**Interviews**

Harvard: (2/10) Interview lady was NOT impressed at allllllllll LMAO. Like we talked about my interests in nature vs. nuture and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance but she literally was like ""it's funny how you want to do neuro instead of just psychology"". Made me feel so freaking dumb lol.

Columbia: 7/10, No real spark but she was also a black woman so she talked a lot about the black experience on campus. Kinda felt like a teaching moment bc she talked a lot but she was super sweet!

Dartmouth: 10/10. Upbeat Interview lady who was super impressed and promised to write me an amazing recommendation and to email her if I wanted her to mention anything. My best interview I believe.

Princeton: 9/10; Interview lady literally said we would've been friends on campus lol. Lovely convo that ran overtime and said she would write a nice rec.

Also did interviews for Barnard (WOC in Stem program), Stanford (rlly boring), Northwestern, and Yale. So basically any school that had one gave me an option. (Wonder how they determine that bc some of my friends got none and applied to the same schools). I'd like to say I'm pretty good at interviews tho.

**Essays**

Personal Statement: 9/10; Spent the entire 1st quarter rewriting and trying new ideas but my English teacher helped ALOT. love her for it. Wrote about my dad's academic journey making it out of Nigeria and the parallels I shared trying to reach his level in America. Still proud of it.

My supplements were pretty good as I was always considered a great writer (book nerd).  I just took the UC application supplements (got it edited by like 3 ppl) and then shortened them to fit the other schools lol. Probably wrote like 6 original essays for like 20 schools. Led to a lot of last-minute submissions (Barnard, Dartmouth, NW, Pomona, Tufts, VT). I used a template essay for the ""Why Us"" supplements after a little research.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

All were RD except VT, USC, and UMD; no ED.

*Acceptances:*

* Columbia (LIKELY!!!, Kluge Scholar) Literally one of my dream schools
* JHU (Hodson Scholar, 41k/yr scholarship &gt; Committed!!!) My original dream school!
* Barnard (""Likely"" email, No Science program tho)
* Brown (rejected from PLME which was rlly dumb to apply RD for but wasn't willing to go without it)
* VT
* UCLA
* UCSD
* USC
* Tufts
* Spelman (No scholarship tho :( )
* Northwestern
* Northeastern (15k/yr scholarship)
* UMD (scholars program)

*Waitlists:*

* Umich (Came after JHU so immediately withdrew)

*Rejections:*

* Harvard (expected)
* Stanford (also expected lol)
* Yale
* Dartmouth
* Boston Uni (Very surprised tbh bc all my friends got in)
* Pomona (BSd all their optional supplemental lmao)
* Princeton

**Additional Information:**

I was very surprised at my luck at the Ivys and T10s despite not the best awards and my lack of luck at state schools other than the UCs. With my financial situation, I was kinda depending on them for scholarships but JHU literally saved the day!!! Took a while to turn down Columbia (AO literally handwrote a letter and the shirt was so cute) but I was not gonna take out loans to cover that 86k/yr bill lmao. So glad to have gotten into both of my top choices but I kinda got silver medal syndrome with the rejections. Really won though!"

I tried starting one last summer before I went into university. Turns out, it was harder than expected. I made a lot of mistakes, wasted a couple thousand dollars and even lost motivation. I made some progress but eventually I went into university, I wasn't able to continue it.

I can't do business on the side while studying. Computer Science is already hard and I constantly need to be active in my program to stay competitive. My program also provides great internships so my summer's gone. Additionally, I need a lot of capital to start a business, and it's hard when I'm buried in student loans.

On the other hand, my current degree has decent career prospect and is a good backup option, especially since a lot of businesses fail (realistically). But i still really want to run a business, and still wanna try be an entrepreneur (Just unwilling to give up a degree with good potential).

In liceu invatam de placere informatica, totul de la structuri de date si algoritmi la chestii de web, baze de date etc., ma pasiona absolut tot, eram fascinat de orice invatam, dar acum a ajuns sa imi fie scarba de tot. Tot incerc sa invat pentru sesiune la materii care in teorie imi plac, doar ca efectiv nu pot sa ma adun si sa invat materii predate de profi in scarba, pe care in mare parte le stiam deja (spre exemplu OOP, am tot lucrat dintr-a 9-a cu OOP, dar la examen au fost chestii fara sens si toti colegii mei care au ""invatat"" acum pentru prima oara OOP doar de la curs/lab nu stiu sa explice in cuvintele lor ce e aia o clasa si ce inseamna polimorfism). 

Am avut norocul (chior) sa obtin un internship pe o perioada de 6 luni la o companie destul de mare din Romania (cu posibilitate de angajare dupa). Planul meu era sa am full time la vara si dupa sa trec in timpul semestrului pe 4 ore pana in decembrie (o sa pot sa trec oricand pe part time, no questions asked) si sa incerc sa trag de facultate cum pot eu, sa am restante de bubui, eventual sa dau cateva examene pe an si sa lungesc facultatea daca nu reusesc sa le trec pe toate in 3 ani(am mai vazut posturi pe aici ca ar fi posibil sa faci asta). Tin sa mentionez ca probabil semestrul asta o sa am 3 restante pe care as fi vrut sa le dau in toamna. 

The question is, should I stick to my plan? De lasat nu vreau sa ma las in niciun caz, chiar vreau sa termin o facultate si sunt sigur ca nu as mai avea motivatia sa ma apuc de alta acum, sa o iau de la capat (stiu ca peste tot sunt probleme si altceva nu prea ma atrage, in afara de chestii gen psihologie/filosofie, dar e cu totul altceva si as vrea sa continui macar pe o perioada medie(8-9-10 ani?) cu IT-ul). Momentan ma gandesc destul de mult la inghetatul anului, sa am timp sa ma calmez timp de un an si sa revin in forta dupa. Problema e ca nu am certitudinea ca ma voi angaja dupa intern. Probabil imi va fi usor sa ma angajez la o alta firma sau sa imi mai iau inca un internship imediat dupa cu experienta dobandita. Banii sa zicem ca nu ar fi o problema, as putea sa stau 2-3 luni fara job (mai am si alte proiecte care imi aduc un venit mai mult sau mai putin egal cu minimul pe economie).

Also, daca ajung sa imi inghet anul credeti ca o sa fie vreo problema la intern? La requirements era sa fii student la o facultate deci nu stiu ce sa zic..

Sorry if I'm rambling. I'm stressed out, burnt out si am aproape zilnic caderi nervoase din cauza facultatii. 

Daca aveti voi alte sfaturi, idei le astept cu drag. Also daca ati trecut prin asta si voi va rog sa imi spuneti how you managed si daca va regretati alegerile. Multumesc!

EDIT: M-am hotarat intre timp sa mai trag de astia 2 ani cum pot eu si sa fac tot ce pot sa iau diploma aia cat de repede pot. Va mulțumesc foarte mult tuturor pentru mesaje! Chiar aveam nevoie de niste încurajare(si probabil de o pauza)."

I am about to start a 6 month internship and I am facing a complicated choice. I have the choice between two internships around cs. One in a very big company manufacturing sports goods in data science and another in a small luxury company in digital marketing (45-50 billion turnover for the first company against 60 million for the second).

The large company is internationally known and I would have no problem selling that name for future interviews, especially since that name would allow me to get many more interviews than I do now. However, the small company has missions that I like more and that I would like to develop, and the living environment/country is the one I would like to live in later (Switzerland). Also, the internship at the large company is in the middle of nowhere where it doesn't speak my native language, so I don't know if I could handle 6 months there alone.

If you were me where would you go? It should be noted that I have only had a few internships before in very small companies, so I don't have any big names on my resume if it can be useful for the future.

I thank you for your attention and I wish you a very nice day!"

However, I don't have that much pure maths in my degree. It's mostly focused on discrete maths (set theory, SAT, graph theory, etc) and algorithms (complexity theory, theory of computation, automata theory, etc).

I have taken some modules from electrical engineering such as Maths for Engineers I (Complex numbers, de moivre's theorem, matrix &amp; vector algebra, limits of a function, ODEs, basic integration/differentiation), Robotics (rotational, transformational and jacobian matrices, displacement equations &amp; vector loops) and Signals and Systems (signal processing maths such as Fourier analysis and z-transform).  I also have an A in A-level Maths.

For my final year some of the maths I will learn include Stochastic Processes; Game &amp; Utility Theory; Number Theory; Bayesian Networks; Delta Rule; Gradient Descent; Convex, Numeric, Constraint &amp; Stochastic Optimisation and Lagrange multipliers as well loads of algorithms.

In my uni, we are allowed to take a module from outside our course in a different area and some people from the year above me have taken modules such as Mathematical Methods for Physics and was wondering if I should try that too?

Also for a master's would UCL's Data Science MSc be good since it has a lot of stochastic calculus and modules dedicated to pricing derivates, black-scholes, etc?

There are courses like computational finance but if I don't become a quant or find out it isn't the career for me then it can be a huge waste of £10-25k while Data Science keeps my options open and is cheaper too.

I have an internship in data science and a research internship at my uni on macroeconomics using machine learning this summer. If this is relevant in any way.

**TL;DR - Lack of pure maths in CS degree except for a few modules from electrical engineering, ML, AI and optimisation maths. Not sure on MSc - is  UCL Data Science good since lots of stochastic calculus in course?**"

The ""another subject"" has been so stressful for me that It's hard for me to continue it too. So now my grad date will be extended by 2 semesters or 1 semester (if I just take a bunch of classes since the humanities major I am thinking about is more lightweight and definitely easier). Will they give me a return intern offer or does PwC not do that? I am too worried to ask my recruiter, so I guess I want to hear some of your advice before I email her.

For reference I'm going into my sophomore year for MechE

I started this mechanical/manufacturing engineering internship at an aerospace components company and this is my third week on the job. 

My task so far has been to write a new work instruction for this prototype machine that will be used on the floor. I spent the first week doing barely anything and the second actually learning how to use it myself and writing the work instruction.

Now I just have to get a software installed on this prototype so I can screencap myself using the GUI, but since we're technically a defense company I have to get IT to do it for me. No fault of their own, but they haven't been able to help me due to absence and such.

My supervisor wants it this way specifically, but I feel so incompetent at delivering. Is it normal for things to go this slowly? Am I doing something wrong?

I have a question about the amount of office work you usually see in the support roles, so any answer would be appreciated. 

I just started a new tech support job in a midsized company (25-30 people). I've been here for a couple of weeks now, and the amount of work i spent not actually doing tech support seems ridiculous. Rough estimate would be about 50% support and 50% case logging, license-management and general office work. 

Besides all of that, we're required to track our time, and it should be about 80-85% of our work week spent towards doing actual support work. This seems bonkers coming from someone who didn't have to track any time at all during my internship.

My boss also seems a bit heavyhanded with the micromanaging, which is having me feeling on edge at times. I honestly don't know how to feel about it. 

What i'm really asking is, what should you expect from these kind of jobs? I personally need a bit more autonomy and creativity in order to not feel smothered, and i might just not like IT in general. This job just feels wrong in a lot of ways, but i really don't have a plan B lined up. 

In any case, your experiences would be very welcome!"

At the time I thought it would be a great opportunity for me, the only downside was that it would require me to move 10 hours away from my family. My original plan was to stay during the entire rotational period which would be around 2 years and then use that experience to move back to my home state. Recently my parents health has been getting progressively worse, and I’m starting to think I would want to come back as soon as possible, hopefully by 1 year or less. As a recent grad, I don’t have any direct relevant experience in IT, I had a supply chain internship last summer and several years working for a sole retail store. I plan on applying for jobs around this fall, where I’ve noticed several companies post jobs catering to college students or recent grads. By then, I would have only a few months experience (3-5) when applying, but I’m worried if that would cause a red flag to employers for being employed for a short amount of time. At the same time though,my experience is limited.Would it be better for me to list this on my resume or should I just leave a gap and pursue certifications?

I’m trying to move to NYC to be with my significant other (med student) and have been applying for jobs in the area with no luck thus far. I graduated in 2021 from one of the bigger Canadian universities &amp; have completed 2 internships while I was in school. I started applying to entry level jobs around end of Aug 2021 until end of Oct 2021 — received a couple of first round HR interviews but nothing past that point. In November, I received a job offer from a company I did one of my internships with (in Canada) and decided to take the job as I thought it wouldn’t be good to unemployed for too long. I have been working at this current job since Jan 2022 and have recently started applying for NYC jobs again this past month (more specifically entry level product/project management positions) but haven’t received any interviews, even with my new experience. Unfortunately my lack of connections doesn’t help.

I’m at a loss of what to do — am I less likely to get interviews due to visa issues? Is it a red flag for companies to be looking for a new job only 5 months into my current one (I clearly state in my cover letter the reason behind my job search)? Do I need to get relevant certifications to increase my chances?

v71rrc,177,2022-06-07,PSA/Rant: Global Internships (London) is a Scam,rosie-thee-riveter,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/v71rrc/psarant_global_internships_london_is_a_scam/,"Feeling a little frustrated and disappointed atm so decided to share my experiences with other students because I could not find any meaningful information about the Global Internships program myself before I unfortunately signed up and would like to warn others about potentially doing the same.

A few months ago, I attended some information sessions about the program and was very interested in going to London this summer. I specifically chose this program because I wanted to gain work experience abroad and love the city. This program guarantees an internship placement in your field of choice and has a lengthy information form and interview process you have to complete to assess your desired placement areas. Additionally, students also get housing for the summer and are enrolled in two required summer courses (one online, one in person). Berkeley’s program provider partner for the London Global Internships is this company called Anglo Educational Services (AES). This program seemed very legit and was marketed very well, with slideshows and the main facilitators of the program answering student questions and the Berkeley program adviser (Breanne) there as well. Needless to say, it was hyped up as a great experience that could be used as a building block in forming professional contacts overseas and I, along with many other students, was excited to participate this summer. 

This was back in late February/early March. To put it mildly, this whole process has been a complete shit show and not at all what I signed up for:

•Visas: the people at AES took several weeks to issue the basic student numbers needed to begin the application process for student visas for the summer. Because of this, we have all been scrambling around to set up appointment dates for the visa process in time for the start of the program this summer. These numbers were issued so late that the program is supposed to start in a few days and not everyone has their passport back with their visa in it yet.

•Housing: AES doesn’t disclose anything about your living situation until you actually arrive on site. They give a building address and that’s about it. They won’t let you know in advance how many people you will share a room/suite with or who they are. They randomly assign roommates and don’t take into account living preferences while doing so, so it’s on you to find other students in the program that have similar habits etc. And even roommate requests are not guaranteed and are subject to change.

•Classes: at the outset of this program, we were told that our in person class (which meets twice a week) will be scheduled on Friday mornings and Monday afternoons, so that we could take full advantage of our location in London to travel during the weekends (such as other places in the UK or Europe). We are strictly not allowed to miss a single class or internship work day during this program, so this free time over the weekend is crucial to any other tourism we might want to do over summer. We could therefore travel Friday afternoon after class and travel back on Monday morning before class, giving us two full days on Saturday and Sunday to sightsee. Anyways, AES recently came out with the class schedule and they booked classes for early Monday morning, which means we only have a full day on Saturday to be anywhere else and will have to travel back on Sunday afternoon/evening. This is really disappointing to a lot of us since you can’t really do a proper weekend trip with only one full day to be someplace. When another student emailed AES about this, they said something along the lines of “sometimes life doesn’t work out the way you want it to.” Like what does that mean??

•Internship: Similar to the visa numbers, AES is taking forever to provide internship placements. The internship roles are due to start exactly one week from today, and there are multiple students that still haven’t had a single interview for a intern position. I received my first one just yesterday. This is totally not what they told us at the beginning, that we would know at the end of May at the LATEST what placement offer we would receive. They also said that we had the option to request an alternative placement up to two additional times (three total different offers) if we weren’t satisfied with the initial placement option. When I emailed them expressing that I respectfully didn’t feel that the nonprofit they put me in actually reflected what I said I wanted to do in my application, they said that “while we say we can give other opportunities, these are only if you reject the internship offer for legitimate reasons” and that they “wouldn’t be able to find [me] another opportunity at this late notice.” Wtf? Are my completely different interests not a valid reason to request an alternative? The only reason it is “late notice” is because they took so long to issue a placement offer in the first place, that’s on them. Like come on, the internship is the main sell of the program and you can’t even provide students with something that they’d like to do? Imo they should NOT go around telling students that they can request alternative placements if that’s not what they’re willing to do.

•Advising: another main sell of the program is that you would have access to advising and counseling from the program providers throughout the whole process. As noted above, they have been incredibly unhelpful this entire time, even responding to emails and questions a bit snarkily and dismissively. Everyone seems to be on their own with this. They flat out don’t disclose important details ahead of time.

Bear in mind that this costs over a semester’s worth of tuition and Berkeley Study Abroad refuses to refund anything after March 28th. This is extremely unfair given that this whole study abroad process had barely even begun by then. Had I known what I know now about this program, there is no way I would have signed up. If we are experiencing this many problems before the program has even started, I can’t imagine what the rest of this summer will look like. I have talked to other students in the program and we are all extremely disappointed at how this is shaping up to be. For the amount of money drained into this program, I honestly think that it would have been better to just sign up for two online classes that are at least related to my major and found myself volunteer work through cold emailing. All I can do for now is just go along with it so I don’t lose the thousands of dollars that they will not refund. What can I say, it’s incredibly frustrating and I feel completely lied to, given that they said one thing during applications and another during this whole process. Don’t make the same mistake I did by trusting these people."

However, I am a bit concerned about my GPA. Junior year was very rough on me, and my GPA took a great hit (it looks like I will still graduate with my honors program, though).

Profile:

GPA: 3.44/4.00

LOR: 1 solid recommendation, still have to figure out the other 2

Experience: 2.5 years in Space Systems research (focusing on Orbit Propagation and Trajectories using Numerical Methods/Algorithms), possible publication in December, 2x NASA intern, NASA Scholarship Grant, TA for a first-year engineering class, 2-3 Software projects in C++/Python/Java/R

I was originally looking at the Space Systems research for Graduate Programs (Aerospace Engineering Ph.D.) at CalTech and USC because their projects mostly align with my experience and interests. However, Junior Year at my home institution took a toll on me and I was not able to perform the way I wanted to. I have my final year to pull up my grades, but when I start my applications they will probably ask for the GPA I have right now. Are there other options I could possibly look at?"

Since I need to expand this cluster in the future, I need to build docker images. I also read about Apache airflow (have used Jenkins in past). I don't know how to use all the components i.e. Hadoop, Spark, Flume, Docker, and Airflow together.

v74m3a,1,2022-06-07,Certificate path guidance,NetGuy2002,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/v74m3a/certificate_path_guidance/,"**Background**

I'm currently in my 2nd semester of a 2 year (4 sem) IT diploma with a focus in networking. No certificates currently, I plan on applying for internships after this semester and entry-level jobs after I receive my diploma.

**Base certificate plan**

Between semesters 2-3 I plan on pursuing either the network+ or a+, I'm not too sure which would be more beneficial. Although I feel like I'd be capable of achieving whichever is more advanced/ sought after. After/ in my 4th semester I plan on studying for/taking the CCNA exam just before I start applying for roles in the industry. I feel like it might even be attainable between semester 2-3 however I've been told we will be covering a lot of the CCNA material in semesters 3 &amp; 4 anyways, and the CCNA expires so I might as well hold off until the end.

**Question**

Through my college I'm granted access to cisco's networking academy they offer a decent amount of courses on various technical topics, some that prepare you for different certs. I'm looking at trying to get one or two right now. I'm looking at the NDG Linux Essentials course, which allows me to take the Linux Essentials 010 exam, which would grant me a Linux Essentials certificate. The other course I'm looking at is the PCAP: Programming Essentials In Python, this allows me to take the PCAP-31-03 exam, which will give me the PCAP-31 certificate (Certified Associate in Python Programming). Would either of these actually be valuable/ recognized by an employer? At my college I'm in a python scripting course and a few other  courses that go over bash/ linux basics.

Do you guys have any recommendations for a better python scripting or Linux certification? 

The Cisco CyberOps Associate is also a certificate I could pursue through net academy's courses, however I suspect this will be the hardest (but maybe best?) and on a similar level to the CCNA cert. Cyber Security does interest me eventually, but I realize I have a lot of experience to gain before I can get my foot in that door.

The Linux Essentials cert is provided by Linux Professional Institute and the PCAP-31 is provided by Python Institute.

Any insight is appreciated!!

Thanks in advance. 

Edit #1: Added the Cisco CyberOps section."
v74wmh,59,2022-06-07,Review of all of my classes as an Economics student,purdue-econ,Purdue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/v74wmh/review_of_all_of_my_classes_as_an_economics/,"**Background**

Hello fellow Purdue people. I graduated the school this past May (2022) and I would like to review every one of my classes and professors to help students decide what to take. I graduated with a BS in Economics, concentration in Data Analytics, and Certificate of Applications in Data Science.

I noticed some of my classes, being in the business school, did not appear in many searches of the subreddit. I always looked up a class before I signed up for it but often I would have no other way of knowing how a class was unless I knew someone who took it or through ratemyprofessor.

Please use this however you'd like and message me if you have further questions about *ANYTHING* in this post. Be aware that many classes will change and professors will leave or change out with others. This is not a perfect guide, just a review of each class's difficulty, usefulness, and whether I recommend taking it. Difficulty is my opinion and usefulness is generally based on use for my career as well as whether or not it is good knowledge to have IMO. For recommendations, I assume you have the option to take it, though I know many of the classes are required.

**Tl:dr - Recent graduate discussing each class I took. Open to DMs and messages about details.**

**About me**

I want to do a quick section about my experience at Purdue as it's somewhat unique and I'd love to talk about each aspect if anyone is interested in info.

I'm an out of state American student and originally came in with an Atmospheric Science major. One semester of Purdue math made me change my mind and I switched to Economics (Liberal Arts) because my GPA wasn't high enough for Krannert. After my GPA was high enough I switched and would recommend most people do the same. Krannert offers more opportunities to business Economics students and is generally more prestigious.

I joined the Indiana Army National Guard in my first semester. I took 2 semesters off for basic training and advanced (job specific) training. After coming back for another semester I was deployed to the Middle East for 8 months and missed 1 semester. If you see gaps in my classes it's because of these events. I joined for college benefits and have had my tuition paid for by Indiana and the federal government leaving me with no student loan debt. I am a helicopter mechanic in the army and work once weekend per month. Generally, when I'm not actively doing Army work, the military does not affect my school work. Again, happy to answer any questions for those interested.

I got a job after going to multiple career fairs in the fall of 2021 and accepted a job as a technical consulting analyst at a Big 4 company (Deloitte, PWC, EY, KPMG). I was in a consulting club and worked with some companies, but otherwise had no true internships.

I also joined the Data Mine, which I highly recommend, and I will talk further about them later in my class review.

I assisted with the Experimental Economics lab at Purdue, so if you participated in an economics experiment you may have seen me. This was good to meet PhD students and to put in on my resume, but it was unpaid and mostly menial work.

My final GPA is 3.36, so not exactly Sum Cum Laude. If you put in a decent amount of effort most classes should be easy A's and B's. Also be aware that companies do actually care about GPA. I was under the misconception that college GPA didn't matter. It was not until my Junior year when I started applying (unsuccessfully) to internships that I realized companies look at your GPA and have minimum requirements. Also if you want to go to grad school your GPA will definitely matter.

**Tl:dr - Out of state student who transferred into Krannert. Soldier in the Indiana Army National Guard to pay for tuition. Incoming consulting analyst at Big 4.**

**Classes**

FALL 2017

**AGR 122** **- Intro to NRES Program -** Not much to say about this class. Very easy 1/2 credit class that was for my original learning community. Explained various majors and was somewhat interesting. Difficulty 1/5. Use 1/5. Recommend? No.

**CHM 115 - General Chemistry** \- Classic pain in the ass intro to chemistry class. If you can use AP credits definitely do so. Includes weekly labs and homework that were both quite time consuming. Tests were hard but not impossible and the class was taught well enough. Not as difficult as Calc 1 but very annoying and time consuming. Difficulty 4/5. Use 2/5. Recommend? No.

**EAPS 117 - Intro to Atmospheric Science** \- Really interesting class with a great professor (Dr. Agee). If Atmospheric Science was more of this and less math, everyone would choose this major. The class is about various basic ideas of atmospheric science such as temperature changes over earth's history and provides a basic understanding of global warming. The class was easy, the B I earned is a testament to my stupidity and laziness I came to college with. Difficulty 2/5. Use 3/5. Recommend? Yes.

**MA 161 - Calculus 1** \- The class that single-handedly made me change my major. I took calculus AB in high school and got a 3 on the exam, so I wasn't worried about this class. Dr. Chen's fantastic lectures and an act of God were the only things that allowed me to pass this class. Very difficult (for those bad at math), large amount of work required, and very stressful. Tests were only a few long questions that had to be studied for hours. Weekly quizzes were surprisingly difficult and the TAs are hit or miss. Homework helped a little but was a pain. Difficulty 5/5. Use 2/5. Recommend? No.

**NRES 290 - Intro to Environmental Science** \- An alright class, amounted to a long powerpoint presentation about the environment, soil, climate change, water cycle, animal behavior, etc. Really just a general intro class. Tests were just memorization. Difficulty - 2/5. Use 1/5. Recommend? No.

SPRING 2019

**ANTH 205 - Human Cultural Diversity** \- Interesting gen-ed that requires some attention yet is well worth it. This class goes over various societal issues throughout the world and will definitely teach you something you didn't know. The professor said that she will say some things you agree with and some you don't, and this is why I found it so interesting. Many topics were covered that may make people uncomfortable but it's well worth it. Tests are easy, just memorization, and if there was any homework it was also easy. The one difficult part of the class was a book review we had to write at the end of the semester. Difficulty 2/5. Use 3/5. Recommend? Yes.

**COM 114 - Fundamentals of Speech** \- Basic speech class for people who did not test out. I do recommend you test out as you will get the opportunity to speak in many other classes. Class basically consisted of a few projects including a powerpoint presentation, video presentation, and group presentation. Easy for most but you definitely have to put *some* effort in if you are not a good speaker. Seeing some people speak from other classes, some people really do need this practice. Difficulty 2/5. Use 4/5. Recommend? Yes, only if you suck at public speaking.

**CS 235 - Intro to Organizational Computing** \- A class that cover the basics of Microsoft Excel. Very easy to follow for those who have never used it beyond shitty data collection. Introduces you to formulas, formatting, general excel basics. Very useful and my first introduction to technical classes. Teacher and TAs were good and tests were fair and not too difficult. I recommend this class for anyone going into business. Difficulty 3/5. Use 5/5. Recommend? Yes.

**ECON 251 - Microeconomics** \- Basic economics class many will take as a gen-ed. Pretty boring, even as an econ major. Topics are focused on interactions within a market and incentives. Professor Blanchard is a good professor but it's very hard to get yourself to go to every lecture. Homework is easy, tests are harder but not unfair. The topics are interesting and good for anyone not familiar with economics. I will say I don't recommend it because I personally prefer ECON 252 as a gen-ed and find it easier and more interesting. Difficulty 3/5. Use 3/5. Recommend? No.

**SPAN 201 - Spanish Level 3** \- I had to take this class while I was in the College of Liberal Arts so if I were in Krannert I wouldn't take it. I took some Spanish in high school and somehow tested into this class. Much easier than I thought and you do not need to know much Spanish to succeed. If you need an easy language class, this one is great. Homework/projects were easy and you can just memorize the (light) Spanish you need to know. Tests are harder but not bad with some study. Difficulty 2/5. Use 2/5. Recommend? Yes if you need a language credit.

SPRING 2020

**ECON 252 - Macroeconomics** \- Other basic economics class that covered more ""top-down"" economics including GDP, wealth inequality, and government policies. Professor Vargas is a decent lecturer but his accent is sometimes hard to understand. Weekly homework is easy but annoying due to its repetitiveness. Tests are mostly memorization. I recommend this class especially for those really bad at math as this class has less math than Microeconomics. Difficulty 2/5. Use 3/5. Recommend? Yes.

**POL 223 - Intro to Environmental Politics** \- One of the most boring classes I've ever taken despite the interesting topic. The class covers various lawsuits and statutes that define environmental policy and most of the class is just reading documents. I imagine this is what it's like to be a lawyer, just lots of reading. The class is easy enough just very boring. Tests were easy, just read the materials and you will be fine. Difficulty 2/5. Use 1/5. Recommend? No.

**SOC 220 - Social Problems** \- One of the few classes I really forgot almost everything about. Easy gen-ed class with interesting topic. Exams were mostly memorization. Difficult 2/5. Use 2/5. Recommend? Yes if you need an easy gen-ed.

**SPAN 202 - Spanish Level 4** \- Pretty much the exact same review as SPAN 201. Easy language class that didn't change much in terms of difficulty. The most interesting part of this class was that my professor was Korean so I had a Spanish teacher with a heavy Asian accent. She was a good professor and went out of her way to help you understand the material. Easy tests, homework, and projects. Difficulty 2/5. Use 2/5. Recommend? Yes is if you need a language credit.

**STAT 113 - Statistics and Society** \- Easy statistics class that probably covers even less than AP statistics. I had never taken any statistics before but it covers basic knowledge like finding the mean, p-value, r-squared, etc. Homework is longer than it needs to be but tests were really easy. Take it if you need to but don't be worried about it. Difficulty 2/5. Use 2/5. Recommend? No.

FALL 2020

**ECON 340 - Intermediate Microeconomics** \- More advanced version of 251 (obviously), but more focused on the math behind the theory. More math than I had anticipated and knowledge of Calculus 1 is required. Medium difficulty even as someone with little math knowledge. Useful for business majors as the concepts learned here are applicable to most fields. I've heard some people say not to take this class at the same time as 352 but it's really not bad, the classes are not that difficult and don't have much overlap. Homework is classic upper level Econ style, meaning it has a few long questions that require you to show your work. TAs are helpful if you ever get stuck on homework. Tests are difficult but homework helps to prepare you. Professor Elchin Suleymanov has a slight accent and seems like a good professor, but he is boring to listen to. Difficulty 4/5. Use 4/5. Recommend? Yes.

**ECON 352 - Intermediate Macroeconomics** \- More advanced 252 (big surprise), but again goes over basic theory. Less math heavy than 340 and is really interesting to understand monetary policy. This class covers GDP, inflation, fiat currency, savings rate, the FED, etc. If you are into cryptocurrency, this class covers some interesting fundamental theory about currency. I'd recommend this class for anyone interested in politics or public policy in general. Homework is similar to 340, not weekly but takes a long time. Tests are more memorization than 340 and less difficult. Professor Cathy Zhang is a good lecturer and fair in assessments. Difficulty 3/5. Use 4/5. Recommend? Yes.

**ECON 390 and ECON 393 - Computational Economics** \- The best class I took at Purdue, yet it does have flaws. I took this class the first semester it was offered to Undergrads, and it definitely felt like it. The class uses Python to perform various processes used in economics such as Monte Carlo simulations, Markov Chains, etc. The professor said I did not need previous knowledge of Python but I regret not taking MGMT 288 first. The Python tools and libraries covered in this class are still on my resume as they are very useful in industry. If you take this class PLEASE know some basic Python before doing so. I truly regret coming into this class and spending half of it struggling to write code and ignoring the methods we used. If you have any interest in coding and data, please take this class. Professor Yaroslav Rosokha does have a heavy Eastern European accent, but is very knowledgeable and helpful. Difficulty 4/5. Use 5/5. Recommend? Yes.

**ENGL 420 - Business Writing** \- Required class for business students. Very basic teaching of writing emails, resumes, and whitepapers. This class does provide some useful information, especially when making whitepapers, but most should be known from high school English. The class is easy enough but the projects do take some time. I recall a website being made through Squarespace, and this was the most difficult part. Difficulty 2/5. Use 3/5. Recommend? No.

**MGMT 295 - Career Readiness and Exploration** \- Required 1 credit class that was a waste of time. This class mainly goes over your resume and how to apply to jobs, though this info is easily found on the CCO website with better guidance. Difficulty 1/5. Use 2/5. Recommend? No.

SPRING 2021

**ECON 370 - International Trade** \- Interesting upper level econ class. Somewhat difficult but the topics covered are good to know. Discusses immigration, outsourcing of work, skills of different countries, tariffs, etc. If you have interest in international monetary policy or global affairs take this class. Underlying theory/equations are also covered which provide a good continuation of intermediate microeconomics. Classic upper level econ homework, infrequent yet takes a long time. This class also required a few essays about various topics which were annoying to write, but did create a greater understanding of topics. Tests were medium difficulty, not only memorization was required but you need to understand the material. Professor Chong Xiang has an Asian accent but is easy to understand, and he is a good professor in my opinion. Difficulty 3/5. Use 3/5. Recommend? Yes.

**ECON 451 - Game Theory** \- My second favorite class I took, the topic is very interesting but math heavy. If you have any interest in the prisoner's dilemma or other ""games"" definitely take this class. More math heavy than I'd like but necessary for the topic. Classic upper level econ homework, infrequent yet very long. Tests were difficult as this was mostly the math portion. Professor David Gill taught my class and he was easy to understand and follow. Difficulty 4/5. Use 4/5. Recommend? Yes.

**MGMT 200 - Intro to Accounting** \- Boring memorization based class that was required of me to take. This class focuses largely on basic accounting vocabulary and processes. You go though lots of terms and then apply some basic algebra performing calculations as if you were an accountant. The most useful part of this class was the vocab I learned that's used frequently in the finance world (PE ratio, balance sheet, cash flow, etc.). Homework is long but easy, tests were largely memorization. Difficulty 2/5. Use 2/5. Recommend? No.

**MGMT 288 - Programming for Business Applications** \- Really useful class for basic Python understanding. The professor (Roy Dejoie) literally talks to you like you're 5 years old, but this was super nice as someone who hadn't done much programming. The class goes over the very basics of Python like making variables, creating functions, discussing vocabulary, etc. The homework was weekly and took a few hours each time but really taught you a lot. The tests were really annoying and asked conceptual questions that weren't nearly as useful as the homework. Difficulty 3/5. Use 5/5. Recommend? Yes.

SUMMER 2021

**IVY TECH - MATH 202 - Brief Calculus 2 -** That's right, I took calculus 2 at Ivy Tech and I highly recommend doing so if you can. This class took about 2 months and I completed part of it on vacation. Very easy and a much preferred option to taking it at Purdue due to ease and how cheap it was. Difficulty 2/5. Use 1/5. Recommend? Yes.

FALL 2021

**MGMT 382 - Management and Information Systems** \- General class that taught about the business side of software. It's hard to nail down what this class is actually about as I heard other professors did other things. I took the class under Dr. Chaturvedi and largely went over some lectures about software info, such as SaaS, Agile method, Waterfall method, etc. The second half of the class went over basic SQL programming in Google Cloud Platform, and this is where some of the most useful skills came from. This class's discussions of Agile methods of software development actually helped me get my job in tech consulting so I highly recommend it just for that aspect, but the knowledge of GCP and SQL are also things on my resume. Projects were easy and useful. Tests were stupid easy as they were open note. The professor was nice but way too enthusiastic, though he taught us useful information. Difficulty 3/5. Use 5/5. Recommend? Yes if you have Dr. Chaturvedi.

**MGMT 472 - Advanced Spreadsheet Modeling and Simulation** \- Class that goes over advanced methods of Excel use. Really great class I'd recommend for any business major as the methods learned here are applicable to most business jobs that use excel. I was taught about simulations, RAND(), conditional formatting, SIMQUICK, too many methods to list here. Classes consisted of us following the professor doing a few examples of each method and then we'd apply those methods to homework and quizzes. Tests were easy and open note, but an understanding of each topic was necessary. Very useful and I think I will be using this class's teachings more than any other. Difficulty 3/5. Use 5/5. Recommend? Yes.

**MGMT 544 - Database Management Systems** \- This class focuses on databases and their creation/use. The class starts with creating a schema for a database and following all the necessary rules. The second half of the class goes over SQL and how to create a database and manipulate it. Everything I learned was useful and I'm glad I took this class. The professor, Jerry DeHondt, is fantastic. He is incredibly nice and knowledgeable and he loves to help students. The class consists of lectures and in-class SQL demonstrations. Homework is easy and there are a few projects finishing with a final all-encompassing group project creating a database. I'd recommend this class for anyone who wants to learn SQL or about databases. Difficulty 3/5. Use 4/5. Recommend? Yes.

**STAT 190 - Data Mine Corporate Partners** \- The closest thing I had to an internship, this opportunity was great and I wish I knew about the Data Mine sooner. I worked with a certain company on a small data science problem. Despite how much I enjoyed the Data Mine, this project itself sucked. It was great to put on my resume, but the company we worked with was not very helpful with us. Our TA was also not very helpful as he understood data science but did not seem to care enough to teach the rest of us. Basically, the corporate partners program is great but highly dependent on your TA and company. Difficulty 4/5. Use 4/5. Recommend? Yes.

**STAT 290 - The Data Mine 2** \- 1 credit class that felt like 2-3 credits, this class teaches basic data mining methods in various languages (Python, SQL, R). Dr. Ward is amazing and he is one of the most enthusiastic professors at Purdue. He will bend over backwards to help you with a homework problem or getting outside work opportunities. Kevin Amstutz is also a great professor/TA. This class has weekly homework, but 3-4 dropped grades so it is hard to fail. There are also 3 ""outside events"" you must attend and write a 1 page report on. Each topic is useful and discusses a new library or method and this class really helps you become a better programmer especially if you are not in Data Science or Computer Science. Difficulty 3/5. Use 5/5. Recommend? Yes.

**STAT 350 - Intro to Statistics** \- Everything you have heard about this class is true. Long, annoying, and extremely repetitive. This class is not difficult but is one of the most infamous at Purdue due to its unnecessarily long homework and obtuse professors. Weekly homework is way too long and the main class project was just annoying. Tests weren't too difficult but covered a lot. I was excited to take this class only to learn more R programming but the professor was not interested in helping me understand the R code we used. He told me to just said to copy it down and that this ""wasn't a coding class"" despite the fact that we used R in every assignment. I will say I think the class has improved somewhat over the past couple of years due to the harsh reviews left by students every semester. From what I've heard the class is slowly getting better, but avoid it if you can. Difficulty 3/5.  Use 2/5. Recommend? No.

SPRING 2022

**ECON 360 - Econometrics** \- Likely the most difficult required economics class, but not nearly as difficult as I thought it would be. If you took STAT 350 you know linear regression very well. After you take this class you'll know it like the back of your hand. Linear regression, multi linear regression, anything to do with regression and you will cover everything about it. This class lightly uses STATA, but again it does not go very deep into the coding. The tests were the hardest part of the class, but the homework took a long time. Professor Victoria Prowse is a good professor who wants you to succeed and is very slow with the lectures, making difficult topics easy to understand. Difficulty 4/5. Use 2/5. Recommend? No.

**ECON 471 - Behavioral Economics** \- A class that basically went over many different types of economic experiments. Every week is a different type of experiment with Friday requiring you to be present to get participation points. The professor, Jacob Brindley, has good energy and keeps you engaged during lectures. I was somewhat let down by the class as I thought it would go more in depth on each topic, but each experiment was only discussed for one week. I won't lie, I skipped most of the lectures as it was my last semester and I still passed with an A. Just study well for the tests that are mostly memorization and you will be fine. There is a final group project where each group presents an experiment; this project was pretty easy especially considering there was no final. Difficulty 2/5. Use 2/5. Recommend? No.

**ECON 485 - Racial and Gender Discrimination** \- Really interesting class that I did not expect to take. A friend recommended me this class at the last minute and I'm glad I took it. This class goes over multiple social issues such as the gender wage gap, racial prejudice in the job market, and other controversial topics and discusses them through an economics lens. I highly recommend this class if social justice interests you or if you'd like to see economic type research applied to non-business/public policy areas. Professor Timothy Bond is nice and enthusiastic. The tests are fair but require you to understand the topics. Difficulty 3/5. Use 3/5. Recommend? Yes.

**ILS 103 - Intro to Data Lifecycle and Management** \- 1 credit class required for my certificate. Very easy, only minimal effort is required. The topics covered aren't very useful and are very basic. Topics include naming data, ethics of data, data management, etc. There's a few homework assignments and a project at the end, but even the project took maybe an hour to complete. Difficulty 1/5. Use 1/5. Recommend? No.

**PES 116 - Golf** \- Golf. This class costs extra money but it was fun. The coaches teach you basics of putting, chipping, driving, etc. Sadly the weather sucked this semester so we only got to go out on the course a few times, but the course allows you free access outside of class and a free bucket of balls for the range per week. The only real grades were 5 tests that took me 1 hour total. Difficulty 1/5. Use 2/5. Recommend? Yes if you're bored and have money to spend.

**STAT 290 - The Data Mine 2 Continued** \- This is just the second semester of The Data Mine 2 so the review is the same. Difficulty 3/5. Use 5/5. Recommend? Yes.

* Full-time IT internship, month 5 (bc he liked his helpdesk job in college)
* bartender nights and weekend
* Going to take the Net+ this month (he claims)

* obsessed with personal device security and VPNs and that kind of stuff
* likes networks and thinks cloud is a ""cool feature of our day and age""
* thinks the word 'Kubernetes' is cool and wants to try his hand at that (whatever it is)
* thinks being a part of designing the next Assassin's Creed would be sweet
* doesn't like statistics nor data analytics

I'm currently about a year and a half out from separating from the Air Force where I'm serving as a 1B4 (Cyber Operations) on the blue side. By the time I get out I will have 3.5 years of cyber experience - 6 months in training and 3 years as a network analyst on a Cyber Protection Team where we do threat hunting + IR. This is probably a little strange to you since on the civilian side that's where more experienced people tend to go. I'm trying to prepare myself as much as possible to land a job where I can have better opportunities to grow and develop my skillset and hopefully see a pay bump. I'm not very interested in continuing government work outside of the military but of course I won't close myself off from a good opportunity. I also plan on doing skillbridge (internship) for 3-6 months depending on what I'm approved for.

* I currently hold Sec+ and GCIA and I'm expecting be to GCIH certified by the time I'm out.
* I have some schooling done, but a degree is not attainable by the time I'm out of the military.
* I have a home lab set up to learn in my free time.

These 3 bullets are the 3 paths I see I can take. Stack certs? Finish as much school as I can? Work on having as much practical knowledge as possible?

I could use some advice from some of you all as I haven't had the opportunity to meet many professionals outside the public sector. What can I do to add value to myself in 12-18 months?

Thanks a ton for your input."

This took me quite a while as I only started programming once I entered college and after graduating I didn't feel like I got to learn much coding since I spent so much time just trying to survive my classes and working on the side to pay my bills. I decided I wouldn't try to get a job immediately but self study in order to actually get comfortable with a language and learn some of the concepts I struggled to learn while in college. I worked a lot with Java but focused only on C++ once out of school since my goal was always game development. I succeeded in getting comfortable with the language and I learned way more in the past year then I ever did in the 4+ years I spent in university, a story I've actually seen reiterated quite a bit by others in the field. Now I'm getting ready to apply for work(honestly fine with getting anything) but I don't feel very confident. My self study mainly dealt with reading books and answering as many of the questions as possible from the chapter questions. I'm also getting into leetcode to further my skills but I still feel like I don't know enough to get a job. I'm looking at the requirements for some of the positions and they expect you to know so many skills and languages and already have years of experience, I'm not even sure where to start with my applications. For those of you who already have internships or jobs how did you get your position and how knowledgeable were you when you started? Am I overthinking things or should I keep learning more before I potentially burn any bridges?"

As of today, I’m one work week into my internship. Here’s what I’ve done so far! 

• Terminated CAT6 cables and hooked them up to RJ45 connectors and then plugged them into various switches 
• PXE booted computers using onboard NIC IPv4 and then flashing them to a image for stock deployment 
• Hooked said computers up to our domain and set up DHCP and static IP addresses
• Remote pushed software (antivirus typically)
• Used RDP and RemotePC to connect to computers remotely and troubleshoot various issues 
• Troubleshot printers 
• Used a flagship ticketing program
• Gotten more used to Powershell in an enterprise setting 
• Dispersed and recycled a LOT of toner 

There’s probably some things that I’m forgetting, but over the last week I’ve already picked up a ton and so far I’m really enjoying it! Here’s some other cool things. They’re paying for my ITPro Premium subscription and covering the cost to take my A+, the 4 other people on the team have been super helpful and the feedback they’ve gotten from people that I’ve helped has been very positive. I had a meeting with my supervisor and then a separate meeting with the CTO (who is overseeing the internship) and both went very well, discussing my progress and the like. 

This is a 2 month internship and I’m not going to hold my breath, but, there was mention in the interview that it *could* turn into a full time position. I’d be elated if that were the case, we’ll have to see how it pans out in the following weeks.  

In compassion to my previous position this is like a dream. The days are flying by, I’m getting more sleep every night- and I could keep going but the point is that my QOL has 100% improved and I feel like I’m building towards a career for the first time in my life. I’ve had a lot of jobs, from fueling airplanes to selling insurance. I feel like I hit the bullseye with this one. 

Now because I know it’s going to get asked, prior to getting the position I had my Google IT cert and done various homelab things with AWS EC2, VirtualBox, and a Raspberry Pi. That’s it, I’m very lucky that I got this position. I look forward to work tomorrow :)"

I'm a student who's currently tasked with building a CI/CD pipeline as part of my internship for a startup.

As far as I know from the HR team, they already have their full-stack, cross-platform mobile application running on AWS (they also use AWS Lambda) and they keep their code on GitHub.

For web: Angular as front-end, NodeJS as back-end

For mobile: Flutter &amp; NodeJS

Database: PostgreSQL

I would like to develop my DevOps skills because I have very little knowledge of the culture itself since my previous experiences were all around IaaS, system administration and networks, but I am familiar with Docker, Kubernetes and Ansible.

After a lot of research I'm kind of confused on where to start and worse, which CI/CD tools to use(GitLab ,Jenkins, AWS Code Build, AWS Code Deploy, AWS Elastic Beanstalk...).  


Please keep in mind that I'm the only DevOps person who is also an intern, hence these are the only details that I could gather. They are also willing to provide any needed resources for the implementation itself."
v7d2ib,0,2022-06-07,Is university housing responsible for my computer getting fried?,YootSnoot,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/v7d2ib/is_university_housing_responsible_for_my_computer/,"Sorry for formatting, on mobile because my computer is busted...

I am working as an intern over the summer and because I lived far away, my company has paid for me to live at university housing nearby.

This morning my computer was working. There was a heavy storm during the day that was enough to cause lights to go out at my work, and when I got back to my apartment, the breakers to both rooms had been flipped. My TV screen, computer monitor, and Nintendo switch were all off at the time and are all fine now, but my PC, which was on while I was away, will not turn on. Another intern has told me that their TV, X-Box, and charger are no longer working as well.

All of my appliances were plugged into the same power strip which is screwed into the wall outlet, but I can't tell if the outlet has a surge protector. Here's the weird part, none of the other interns have these power strips in their rooms, so I don't know if it was provided by the university or if someone left them behind.

I have sent an email to the housing asking if they are planning on doing anything to fix the situation, but I wanted to know if they have any obligation to prevent this? If the power strips were not attached to the wall I would have used my own which definitely has a surge protector. I don't think I have any contracts or anything with the university that talk about electricity, but if that is something I should have I can try looking again.

Any advice is appreciated!

Transferring to the #1 school in this major, I had so many hopes that the weight of Georgia Tech would get me an internship this summer. I took CS1301 last Spring and I knew that wasn't enough so I have learned some other skills by myself. During Spring, I submitted over 30 applications just to get 3-4 interviews, one of them being Delta Co-op. I was so hopeful about Delta to the point that I skipped other interviews just to be best prepared for Delta. The interview took place on 3/18 for Summer, but they also asked me if I would be available for Fall. Since then, I haven't heard anything back from that Delta team, while other Delta teams already rejected my applications, along with the rest of the applications I submitted. I haven't been officially rejected for the position I had the interview with Delta, but I think the chance is slim that I will get anything from them. I haven't given up my hope yet tho.

So basically the plans of having an internship in the summer are all unsuccessful. I have been having so many doubts about my abilities and stuff, and realized that the school name alone is not enough. I have been looking at my resume, and revising it over and over, but I haven't had enough confidence to start the internship search again. Right now I am taking CS2316 and soon CS4400 to gain more coding knowledge. But can anyone share your experience and tips of how to get your first internship? I feel like the GPA alone is not enough, I have some work experience but it's still not enough. I just want to reset everything and start over but I don't know where and how, I am just feeling like I'm stuck in this situation, and I really want to get out it.

Any thoughts would be much appreciated. Thank you guys."

So my ex and I broke up like 5 years ago already, and to this day I can't stop thinking about her. But not like in an in love way, different, not sure what way really.
But the thing is, she was awful to me during our relationship. Of course not always, but when she was, she was awful, she would say that I was a piece of shit. She would call me faggot, she would say that I was not enough, that I was not like her friend's boyfriends.
And it hurts because I have never put so much effort and love into something or someone, I would take a 2 hour bus everyweekend with the little money I had just to see her and be with her, I returned from the US to my country because I couldn't stand being without her. I really really gave her my everything, I was a better human being and my life felt better when I was with her, when things were right of course.
And I am not saying I was perfect by any means, but I never treated her not even a fraction of the way she treated me sometimes, even less said to her the kinds of things she told me, and of that I'm sure. 
The thing is, we broke up, not because I didn't love her, but because I couldn't anymore. She treated me like shit and it was too painful, but that was a decision I took against all of my desire to still be with her even how she was with me.

And our relationship lasted like 2 years. Now fast forward to 5 years since then, we have not spoken one bit, but I sometimes look at her Instagram profile, and see how she is with someone now that she clearly loves, he is French, she is living with him, traveling all of Europe, she is being an intern at the United Nations, she stopped following me even though I never bothered her, I was never the ex who still lingered. Nothing.

And me, I'm a loser whose life does not flow at all, I work at a customer service job that I hate, I apply to hundreds of jobs wishing to get something different but never hear back from no one. All my friends have moved on with their lifes, I try to reach out to those ""friends"" just to talk sometimes and I am always ignored. My days are always the same no matter how much change I try to implement to my life, I'm back living in the US, and I do not fit here, I cannot make friends because is hard for me and people are not specially friendly here.

I just keep asking life, why am I paying the karma when I did everything as best as I could? Why she doesn't leave my mind? Why do I loved someone who has treated me the worst anyone has in my life? Why life doesn't flow for me?
Why am I the one wanting to kill himself, when I try to be good to everyone. I feel like such a loser, and probably I am.

This will probably go unread but at least it helped release some emotion. Thanks anyway."

Coursework:
- All Honors throughout 9th and 10th grade 
- 3 AP’s Junior Year: APUSH, AP SEMINAR, and AP Physics (expecting a 5 in APUSH and Seminar, and a 1 in Physics lmao)

- Had a great relationship with her throughout the year, and im the only person that asked her to write a letter ( so hopefully she’ll spend more time on it). I also asked her to specifically write certain things that would be good for a communications major, because she has a degree in that too

- Language Arts Teacher - 10/10
- Known him since 7th grade and he’s coached me in football and basketball.
He’s definitely seen me grow as a person, which I think colleges will appreciate a lot. Only thing is that he has to write 50 other applications, but im pretty sure he’s gonna make mine extra extra tough

Other:
- I do come from a wealthy family, so I might not receive as much financial aid. And that could also potentially hurt my chances at colleges idk

I was wondering if there are any key similarities or differences between C++ and Javascriot that can sort of help me conceptualize the language more. I am seeing things called controllers used very often, seeming to control different parts of the webpage(views I think they’re called?) 

Also things are being watched, I see $ used a lot.

Will learning JavaScript make the other languages I mentioned more readable? I plan on doing an html tutorial next.

One is with a startup where someone in my course in the year above is currently the tech lead (let's call this company A), and the other is with an established yet small-ish company. (B). 

A require 10 hours/week of remote work, essentially just react web design ( I am not extremely confident with this, but I have told them that I will be learning a lot as I go, and they seem to be ok with it) I will be working in a small team meeting 2-3 times a week. They told me that they would only need me in June , but it could probably last longer with it being a start up. 
Company B is Monday to Friday, 2 days a week in person and 2 remote, 9-5 days. I will be shadowing a SWE, and also helping with any projects/ work. There is a larger team here, and I am not even entirely sure what I will be doing, but the work that the company is doing is really interesting. It starts june 20th for 8 weeks

I basically don't know how to reject A, and I am even considering doing both. Some people I spoke to said that this is stupid because I should fully commit to one, especially since it’s my first internship, which makes sense but I also think that 10 hours a well should be manageable, but I really don’t know and I still haven’t told company A about the other job."

I was at the point I was ready to get the hell out of engineering altogether.  I posted this:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/pskesc/coop\_making\_me\_reconsider\_engineering/](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/pskesc/coop_making_me_reconsider_engineering/)

It was truly bad. My team was miserable, my mentor would take weeks off at a time and leave me with almost nothing to do, and my manager probably barely talked to me the entire term (we talked maybe twice he was so busy). I would ask around for work and be told ""I'll get back to you"". My most intensive project was looking at a picture and putting the information in Excel. It was a complete waste of time. I knew I had to get out of there. This was a universal experience among other co-ops in different departments, so I needed to get out of there before I wasted another two semesters.

So at work, I spent my time getting ahead on classes I knew I would be taking the next semester. I was watching Youtube series to learn skills like Verilog, VHDL, SystemVerilog, and SolidWorks. I even worked on small coding projects I could put on my portfolio. I reached out to many professors on campus about research jobs in areas of my interests. If I was going to get another internship or co-op, I wanted to make sure I had the skills the jobs I was looking at wanted (hardware and embedded systems).

&amp;#x200B;

When I got back to school, I applied to every job I was interested in. After about 2 months of applying to jobs (typically 3-4 a week), I interviewed and got an offer two days later. I am working at the company now, and it is so much better. My team treats me like an engineer, they have a JIRA full of tasks for me to pull from, and my mentor/team is supporting me every time I need it. As a result, I have completed a number of tasks in just my first month and I have learned so much about embedded systems as a result. I look forward to going to work every day because it is challenging. I will definitely be returning.

&amp;#x200B;

So, if you are like how I was and you're sitting at an internship or a co-op that you hate figure out where you want to be. Look at the job postings for those jobs, and spend your time at work picking up those skills. You are getting paid to be there so take advantage of that time to become a better engineer in whatever field you want to be in. You have to make yourself competitive. Already having an internship on your resume will be a huge help even if you don't think it is. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this helps."

To give you an idea of where I am in my career, my resume is attached in the comments.

At this point, I'm quite confident in saying that I missed the boat for Summer internships. However, I'll still keep applying to maybe 5/day for the slim chance that it may return a result.

Since this is unlikely, I'm thinking to choose between two paths I could take until Summer of 2023.

Path 1: Take an entry-level IT position (i.e. desktop support) until Summer of 2023. This will let me gain real-world experience in tech and hopefully pad my experience, given that we're headed for a recession in the US. This will likely be part time so I can balance school. Keep in mind, I will still be doing pentesting related things (i.e. CTFs, THM, certs, etc.), I'll just have less time to do so.

Path 2: Spend the time I would've spent working a job on improving my knowledge. I got to WGU, so I'd be able to finish my bachelors faster by taking more classes this coming year. Additionally, the extra time will be spent on certs (OSCP), projects, and other things that will help pad my knowledge. This, too, will end in Summer of 2023 when I get an internship.

Regardless of which path I pick, I will still use whatever free time I have to complete THM, CTFs, projects, and learn needed skills.

I'm reaching out because we're unfortunately headed towards a time where employment opportunities may be a bit more scarce than they have been, so I understand that a bad move here may put me back much further.

The CEO of the company was a fellow student from my university, as were most of the other ""interns"" or employees. We were told we were going to be paid when the business got more funding, but it never happened.

For about 6 months I was doing copy editing work for them and meeting regularly with other team members. All of the sudden in January, the CEO stops contacting us, doesn't respond to messages, and essentially ghosts us without an explanation as to what's going on. I decide that's that I guess and move on to actual paid opportunities.

The other day, I got an email the business newsletter (which I used to work on a bit) saying the the company is going to start up again with coding classes. 

I'm very tempted to email back on the newsletter, if only to warn whoever is running it now that they may be left high and dry. I'm still connected with the CEO on LinkedIn as well, and really want to shoot her a message asking her what's up with the relaunch when she basically shut everything down the first time with no warning.

It was just a dumb internship from years ago but it definitely irks me that we never got a reason for why things were shut down and we were ghosted, meanwhile she wants to pop back up doing the same thing potentially to other employees/interns. Should I send a message to the CEO or just leave it alone?"

A couple of weeks ago, I was offered guaranteed transfer to Tech as long as I take a few required courses and maintain a 3.3. The problem is, none of the course at cal poly transfer, so i’d have to be enrolled at both cal poly and a cc if i wanted to go to georgia tech next fall. I was wondering if you guys could help me decide if it seemed worth it to put in the extra effort? 

Cal Poly
pros: 
- all my DE courses transfer (can graduate in 2 years) 
- closer to home (my sister is pregnant) 
- cost (i am getting paid to attend and get a free laptop) 
- super active student body 
- pretty good cs program 
- super small class sizes
- teaching focus 
- great career outcomes 
- allowed to continue taking voice lessons as a CS major 
- get to stay with the people i meet in freshman year

cons: 
- not diverse 
- closer to home (i don’t get to explore another state) 
- small town (afraid i’m going to get bored) 
- not really known out of silicon valley or for anything other than cs
- hard to switch majors/double major
- ***prestigeeee***
- not many AI electives past the intro ones

Georgia Tech: 
pros: 
- one of the best cs programs in the country 
- more diversity
- ***prestigeeee*** (national recognition)
- can transfer to whatever major i want 
- known for majors other than cs
- research uni (possibly better for grad school admissions? i want to get into ML) 
- get to explore a new place 
- big city 
- ridiculously specific AI electives 

cons: 
- seemingly less active student body 
- costs (paying 30-40k/year) 
- almost none of my credits transfer (will take 4+ years to graduate)
- taking double college might ruin my freshman experience at cal poly (?)
- far from home 


(side note: I’m still unsure if i want to pursue research or industry yet. I have already been offered a faang internship for after freshman year tho, so i think career prospects are going to be a smaller factor because i will have already had the experience regardless of what school i attend.)"

I've touched a lot of areas of programming and a lot of languages, but feel as though I can't really say I'm great at one specific thing.

Should I be leet coding now, working on personal projects, etc. Should I learn some more specific framework or language and apply to jobs with those requirements?

My mom is solely just living her life now to take care of mine and my sister's needs and doesn't even think of any of this, just lives her life taking care of my health.

The problem is we have no money. My mom and I have a total of less than 50k with us. After abusing my mom and injuring her while I was in college, he left to stay at another place he usually goes. Luckily no lasting harm to my mom. We were planning on going next week to another state where my doctors are and where the hospital that I am mainly treated from for a bunch of tests. I don't know whether we have sufficient funds for it. I have asked my friends for money but don't know if I will get. I have tried putting up a brave front for my mom and my sister.

And yet we have to build on top of this and very intimately interact with the API. Kinda feels like the whole team is walking through this blind.

Finally i got internship for 2months. Internship was unpaid, and ofcourse i have to manage with my main job, because i cannot quit the job and sitting without money. it was hard internship, because company working hour was from 9-15, my job was from 5-16. In the evening i was doing my task, but all my team was offline, so it was hard to understand everything. So after 2months then my internship ended, they dont continue. They said, that they dont have time with me, and they want to move forward with mid DevOps.

After long time i was overthinking, maybe i dont like DevOps( because they do a lot of things and i dont know everything). I was thinking to learn networking, Cisco and etc. And the problem that i dont know what to do, move forward with AWS cloud, or something else.

I need some advice. Can Terraform certificate helps to find job? What about linux certificate?"

I am looking to move to the UK to be with my boyfriend and live/work while there. I am opting for the YMS at first as it is much cheaper than other options, and to make sure that we have a probable future together before going down the visa/citizenship route. Once we have decided if we want to get married and such, we will then go down the Spousal/Family visa route (unfortunately I am not eligible for Ancestry visa so this looks to be my only option). Also this way it will be easier for proof of income as here will be two income streams that will be able to combine to meet the minimum requirement. If anyone had any other recommendations for immigration process that would be appreciated!!

I have a few questions/concerns that I would look some feedback on

1. I have been looking at the job market / requirements and I am often seeing something along the lines of ""Minimum of 5 GCSE's at Grade C or above (or equivalent)"" and I am trying to figure out the Canadian (Alberta) equivalent. I keep finding conflicting information online and would like some clarification. I am listing my classes I took if that helps any. In Alberta everything was done on a percentage scale (at least when I graduate, am not sure if it has changed since then.)

My Marks / Classes, 30 level courses are grade 12, 20 level courses are grade 11,

* English 30-1 - 72%
* Social 30-1 77%
* Math 30-1 69%
* Math 31 (PreCalc) - 77%
* Chemistry 30 - 70%
* Biology 20 - 78%
* Physics 30 - 67%
* Career &amp; Life Management - 86%
* Personal Psychology - 82%

I had completed these high school courses, but they don't have final/overall marks, just multiple project marks for each course

* Communications Technology (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced)
* Electro Technologies / Robotics (Intro, Intermediate)
* Foods (Intro, Intermediate, Advanced)
* Human &amp; Social (Intro, Intermedia)
* Information Processing (Intro)

I did a year of university before dropping out for stable work (was offered a really good position after a summer internship) and have completed a few media, economic, and computer sciences courses I am not sure if those would be relevant or not.

If someone could tell me how to convert my marks, or let me know what mine would be that would be greatly appreciated.

2. Moving personal possessions

I am planning to sell most of my stuff (such as my car) but am going to want to bring a few things such as my computer tower and monitors if it is feasible. What is the experience like moving stuff overseas with fragile items, is it worth it or would I be better off selling it off and rebuying when I move?

3. For banking what would be a good bank to go with when I move, and what would the best route to transfer lumpsums of money over be? I am currently with Scotiabank if that makes any difference.

Thanks for any help / suggestions :)"

I don’t want you to get fired or something cause I know the bosses their suck, but it was so nice in the early summer when no one was checking buzzcards.You should consider it a small but meaningful act of civil disobedience, a middle finger to the institution that keeps charging us the “special institution fee,” makes us pay $800 for parking, and forces freshmen to pay thousands for rat infested dorms.

My department is small, so when at a company lunch, I tried to get to know and become friends with the other interns. This week, one of the interns came to our department asking a question, and asked if I wanted to eat lunch together. He also asked if they could put their number in my phone, so we could coordinate our lunch break. I thought it was him asking as a friend, and this first lunch went fine.

The next day, I was planning on taking my lunch break to call a few places, so I wasn't planning on meeting up for lunch. He came to my department, and I explained to him what my plan was for my lunch break, but he insisted. I went to a fast lunch with him, since I had to eat any way, but he asked me to text his number since he had never received my phone number. I sent it (I still thought he was trying to be my friend at this point). The conversation was making me a bit uncomfortable as he asked me a lot of personal questions and was telling me to visit his home city. I also asked why we didn't invite the other intern in his department to lunch with us, and he made an excuse. 

After the lunch, I went back to my office to make my calls, and then I saw I had received a text from him. He was complimenting what I was wearing and how I looked. 

Today, my department had a remote work day. I did not inform him that I would be working remote (because why would I?). Around lunch time, I received a picture of the cafeteria and his food, with a message saying he was missing his lunch partner and why I wasn't there (even though there was a sign on my department's door saying we were working remote). I responded and said maybe the other intern could have lunch with him today, but he simply read the message and did not respond. 

I'm not sure what his intentions are, but I'm not interested. I just wanted to hopefully make work friends at this new job. I want to set boundaries with this coworker, while being professional and not rude about it. Any advice on what I should do?"

I initially just wanted to hook up but we really hit it off, so we started dating. Just 2 weeks later my internship ended and I moved back home, but we agreed to keep seeing each other as our countries are next to each other and it’s just a 2 hour drive between us.

At first we had a lot of fun, but it’s like he changed after I moved back home. We couldn’t see each other for one week and he was texting and calling me all the time, telling me that he couldn’t be without me… when we had known each other for just a few weeks.

When we eventually met up it was so extremely boring. He didn’t like any of the activities I suggested (playing videogames, watching a movie or a show, going on a walk, visiting the city center, etc) and didn’t come up with anything himself, so we just ended up sitting on my bed and doing nothing for hours. It was also difficult to have a conversation with him: I was always the one to start a conversation and keep it going. When I didn’t put effort in, we would just sit in an awkward silence for what felt like an eternity.

He started crying when I told him he could only stay for two days, because he wanted to stay three. I didn’t feel comfortable with that because we had only known each other for a few weeks, which offended him, plus I had a ton of work for uni.

I spent the entire two days he was there feeling bored and annoyed. Towards the end I wanted to just break up with him, but I started to feel ill and didn’t want to deal with the emotional outburst he would probably have when I ended things with him. That was probably pretty selfish, but I felt so annoyed that I didn’t really care at that point. When he left he cried again because he was going to miss me so much.

After a few days of me having the flu and feeling ill I finally broke up with him over the phone and all hell broke loose. He kept crying and yelling at me that it wasn’t fair, that we should try to keep going, that he couldn’t lose me, etc. That just confirmed my feelings because he was waaay too attached to me after dating for about a month.

After that I received multiple texts every day in which he told me he was sorry and wanted to try again, that he really needed to talk to me because he was in pain. I said no and told him that things would get better soon, and to talk to his friends instead of messaging me. He said that that was a ‘cruel’ response.

When we saw each other one last time so he could pick up his stuff, he tried to kiss me, kept hugging me and touching me, told me he still loved me and kept trying to convince me to try things again. I eventually told him to leave because I was uncomfortable.

After a month of no contact he texted me again yesterday to ask how I was doing. I told him I wasn’t doing very well (I just broke my collarbone), asked how he was doing and then ended the conversation after he replied.

I thought he understood that I didn’t want to talk, but today I got another text.

Then he told me that he loved me. I replied that I felt really uncomfortable with that message and that I would be blocking him.

At this point I just feel so annoyed. We dated for one fucking month and after another month he still can’t stop crying over me? He’s acting like I was his entire life, which is insane and really childish. This man is 24!!

v7zo0s,1,2022-06-08,Do I sacrifice my mental health to have a relationship with my younger siblings?,aloeplant56,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/v7zo0s/do_i_sacrifice_my_mental_health_to_have_a/,"Sorry if this is kind of long, but its a complicated situation and I really don't know what to do. I (25f) have been no contact with my mom for almost a year after a fight resulting in her sending me a text telling me she doesn't want me in her life anymore, she doesn't want me to call or text her, and that I am no longer welcomed at her house. For context, we have always had a strained relationship. She thinks I took my dads side in their divorce (I was 5 when they separated) and has never gotten over it. My dad has been far from a great dad and was absent in many ways, which is something I have acknowledged to my mom before. But I was never yelled at when I was with him growing up, which is why I liked going to his house as a kid. I grew up incredibly unhappy at her house and felt like nothing I ever did was good enough (still feel this way), but whenever I would try to talk to her about my feelings she would tell me to live with my dad if that's how I felt. We've gotten into several fights over the years that have resulted in me staying with my dad or another family member for a few weeks to give us space.

 Things got better for a little bit after I left for college, but we soon started fighting every time I would come home. My parents and I have very different political beliefs and although I stopped talking about politics or anything related to it, my mom will bring it up every opportunity she can. This has caused an immense amount of conflict between us and within the family. I am at the point where I just deal with their beliefs and don't say anything, but have also asked them not to talk about certain things/make certain comments to me or around me because they make me uncomfortable. My step dad has respected this, but my mom ignores me or tells me that I turn everything into a political conversation. This has been really frustrating and hurtful because at this point it felt like my mom was purposely disregarding my feelings.

Our last fight honestly made me feel so unbelievably broken and unloved. After I expressed the resentment I feel towards her because she has never seemed to want to know me at all, she basically told me she doesn't want to know me and doesn't want to talk to me because she hates who I am. I worked so incredibly hard during college to make her proud and get some amount of approval, so this devastated me. I am the first in my family to graduate from college, chose a respectable career in education, was able to study abroad twice (mostly on my schools dime), and had an internship at an Ivy League school. I won awards, went to conferences, and held leadership positions on my campus and nothing seemed to matter to her. I was the model child that their parents could be proud of and their siblings could look up to. In my eyes I did everything right and did everything I was supposed to. She berated me for every accomplishment that I am really proud of myself for because ""I could have been working"" or it cost me money somehow and was therefor a bad financial investment. I come from a low income family and understand that she wanted to make sure I graduated without loads of debt, but she continued to do this even 2 years after I graduated. She basically invalidated everything I had done that had shaped me into the person I am now.

I know that my relationship with my mother is far from healthy, but going no contact has been emotionally devastating to me. I cry all the time now. I am not particularly close with my dad and don't talk to anyone from my extended family on both sides, so cutting my mom off essentially cut me off from what little family I do have. I have only talked to my step dad a handful of times and he really wants me to be apart of the family again. I have three siblings (4f, 13m, 16m)  I haven't spoken to in almost a year because I don't know how to have a relationship with them without my mom in the picture. And honestly sometimes I think they are better of without me in the mix. The house was filled with anger whenever I was home and I felt bad for essentially forcing them to live in it. My older brother (28m) thinks I am being dramatic and that I should just drop the situation, which really hurts because if anyone knows how my mom is and what it was like growing up, its him. 

My mom has reached out a few times, but only to let me know about important things like family weddings, when my brother broke his foot, grandpa was in the hospital, etc. I haven't responded to a single thing she's said and have texted my step dad instead when its been really important. At this stage, I'm making it a point not to respond to her because she told me she didn't want to heard from me anymore. She hasn't tried to apologize once or even seemed remorseful about what happened, which makes me feel even more heartbroken. I really think that if I got a sincere apology for our last fight and how she treated me growing up I can move past everything and start over, but I know this will never happen.

I have missed out on so much of my siblings lives and feel so bad about it. I used to be a great sister that was very involved. For the past 6 or so years I have lived a couple hours away from home, but I am about to move back into the metropolitan area where I grew up, so I will be close enough to them where I could go to sporting events, hangout, etc, so I think this has been weighing a little more heavily on me lately. I desperately want to be a good sister and be there for them, but I can't even think about my mom without getting emotional. I wouldn't say I am happier since I have been no contact with my mom, but my mental health has definitely improved. 

Do I put my mental health on the back burner to reconnect with my siblings? How should I go about forming relationships with my family without my mom in the picture? I know my brothers (13, 16) are getting to the age where it will be easier, but my sister is only 4 and will still be living at home for a while. Do I continue to keep my distance and hope that one day they understand why I cut ties off with everyone, but my older brother? Am I wrong for refusing to respond to anything that isn't an apology from my mom?  I'm not sure I am doing the right thing or even the thing that is best for me anymore and I don't know how to move forward from here."

. Scrape a facebook page, load the results in a database, develop a simple interface with fastAPI

. Containerize the application with Docker/Docker-compose

. Write atleast one test

I built this over a weekend, here's what I came up with:

[https://github.com/a-nacef/Facebook-Webscraping-Postgres-fastAPI-/tree/master](https://github.com/a-nacef/Facebook-Webscraping-Postgres-fastAPI-/tree/master)

This was about a month ago so I don't expect the company to be getting back to me at this point (Pretty common where I'm from, unfortunately..). I did however get a part time job for the summer, so it's chill. Would be nice to get some feedback for this project though, do tear it apart!

Here's the technical notes I sent them via email when I submitted:

""The API exposes 3 endpoints: \[""/"", ""/text/&lt;num&gt;"", ""/raw/&lt;num&gt;"", ""/rank/&lt;num&gt;&amp;metric=&lt;metric&gt;""\]The first endpoint just greets the user and can be used for livechecks, for the next 2 endpoints, &lt;num&gt; refers to the number of posts to retrieve with /text just returning a post's id and text content, raw being a full payload.The application runs with docker-compose, a healthcheck is defined in the .yml file for the webscraping service, tests are implemented with pytest.   
Given the simple set of instructions, I made sure to minimize complexity and not add unwanted features; I was operating under a set of assumptions about the service's usage patterns, mainly:

* Applications consuming the API are mostly interested in the latest posts on the Facebook page (Although the API does offer N-ranked data with respect to either likes, shares or comments)
* Request frequency is low (Ex: A website with a posts compilation updates once a day)  

With this in mind, I decided that the scraping would trigger on each HTTP call; This is to guarantee always having the latest posts.

I designed the service such that each API call invokes a separate thread to load the payload into the database, I made sure to handle potentially duplicated data during the mini-ETL by first pushing the data to a staging table then ""merging/upserting"" into it to a primary table.

This makes our pipeline idempotent, meaning that repeated calls to load\_data() always result in the same outcome.

Had usage patterns been different (More frequent access, complex queries), it would have made more sense to decouple requests and scraping/loading entirely,  instead using a scheduling tool like Airflow to have a scraping job running at a low enough interval (10-30) mins and constantly updating the database, I figured this might be too complex for a prototype.""

Not ""too good to be true"" but still very good. The landlord is friendly, we speak the same language and he told me he he moved 20 years ago as an engineer and has worked both in a famous company of our home country and at the University here and now is looking for two tenants to fill his apartment because he's moving upstate and he's only gonna keep one room as a base in the city.

So it seems pretty legit, not scammy or shady at all. But, he asks for rent in cash. Says due to tax reasons. He first asked me "" how would you prefer paying rent?"" And when I said ""dunno, bank transfers"" he said he'd rather have cash. But he specified that I wouldn't have to send it via email or anything.

I'm torn about this. On one hand, I really like the room, and there's no reason to be suspicious about it otherwise. The neighborhood is PERFECT for me and it will not get much better than this. As an intern I have a limited budget and it's hard to find something not completely terrible. On the other hand, rent in cash is risky and I definitely do not want to end up responsible for some fraud.

Overall I'm fairly positive it isn't a scam. I saw no huge red flags - he showed me the room, the price is good but not impossibly low, the building and place are kinda average (good for the price and for my standards/values, but not luxurious by any means), I have his phone number, he didn't request any payment upfront etc. He even said he's got other applicants so he couldn't say me yes right away. So it seems relatively safe. But I still want to protect myself. I will definitely ask for some written confirmation/document/receipt and a signed contract but other than that, I don't know.

I know he's probably trying to dodge taxes but I don't really care as long as I face no repercussions. But I have no idea what's the worst that could happen to me. 

Any advice?"

I would like to preface this by saying that I am a civil engineering student currently employed as an estimating intern for a heavy civil general contractor.

I hope everyone is having a fantastic day/night depending on where you are. I have a few questions in regards to my summer internship, which is an estimating internship for a heavy civil construction company. So far, I am really enjoying the type of work that I am doing and I am learning a lot. However, I believe my company, especially the employees in the estimating department, do not really like me and think that I am incompetent/unintelligent. For example, I took the majority of the day today to complete a takeoff that was relatively involved. Without going into much detail, they wanted me to do a takeoff for a set of plans with hundreds of traffic signs. For me to complete this, I had to obviously go through the plans and locate the signs, which took me awhile to do because the plans were rather complex. I also had to make a description of traffic redirection, which required me to look through the traffic plans for the project and write a brief description for each sign. Being an intern, I am quite inexperienced with navigating through the plans, coupled with the fact that the takeoff was lengthy, and I feel as if that is the reason why it took me an entire day to complete this project. When the head estimator was talking to me today, he said that I took too long to complete this project, which upset me a bit. This situation made me feel really weird and made me reconsider my future with this company. Also, ever since I have started, they gave me ""real"" assignments to do without any form of training or explanation. For example, on my first day, they immediately just gave me a takeoff to do without explaining anything to me, and the project engineer seemed baffled when I did not understand the assignment or know what a takeoff is. For background, I have never opened a set of plans before and it has been awhile since I have taken any construction-related class as a civil engineering student. So, my questions are the following:

Should I be competent enough to do these assignments faster like my manager wants? I genuinely worked through it as fast as I could.

Does it seem weird that this company made me, without any training or in-depth explanation, complete tasks that project engineers typically do?

Should I look elsewhere for employment after graduation? I am not by any means suggesting that I want to quit this summer, but I am considering looking for a different job and a different company.

My qualifications is a [B.Tech](https://B.Tech) graduate of 2021. I was placed in my campus placement with a pretty good package but after completing my internship i decided to pursue UPSC and did not take up the PPO. 

Probably it was the lack of ground reality or knowledge i thought UPSC can be cracked with a year of preparation and was in full swing in preparation. Slowly but steady the uncertainties crept in and i started loosing track. add to that the coaching class were extensively long which had left me with barely 4-5 hrs to study. Even after many hiccups i had decided that whatever may come ,i shall not quit this preparation till i give my 1st attempt. 10 days before the exam my head was telling me ""just 10 more days and we are done,lets complete it"" it went on and on and finally the D-day arrived and as expected i did very very bad in GS(which i gave all my time into) but would clear CSAT(Which i barely gave any time to) .( i believe im technically very sound owning to engineering)  

somewhere back of my mind ,i know that there was a lot of lacking in my preparation and i gave my head 3 days of time to decide (after sunday's exam) but im still stuck with this dilemma. I was totally committed to stopping this preparation but somwhere in the bottom i feel i can do this with a better preparation.

I know that i have to be capable to take my own decisions but this dilemma is not helping me.   


On one side ,i feel i have to prepare better and give it another chance but on the other side i fear repeating another lonely year. I had decided to stay with my friends in a PG to keep myself engaged since in my first attempt i prepared staying in my house ,but the fear of repeating another year still persists.

I am not looking for somebody to make the decision for me, but maybe shed a light on aspects I haven't thought about or have experienced a similar conundrum. I hate regretting my decisions so I really want to weigh both opportunities.

Internship/Student Job Opportunity 1:

* Barely any commuting.
* offered a student job as well (Thus, also the prospect of full-time employment after my education ends)
* Will receive a small compensation during the internship (I live in a country where unpaid internships are actually the norm and getting literally anything during the internship is a plus)
* Paying the bare minimum when it comes to a student Job in IT
* Seems like I would love working there (actually engaging )
* Smaller younger company, but with great potential
* Have more experience in the field (opportunity to prove myself)

Internship Opportunity 2:

* 2-3 hours of total commuting (both ways, probably can negotiate to spend most of it working)
* No offer for student job yet or further employment yet(looks quite possible, but haven't been discussed yet)
* Paying way more during the internship period 
* Huge company with a lot of departments
* A bit more hands-on (that's a plus for me)
* The job looks not as exciting (will be doing basically internal ad-hoc tasks)
* Have less experience in the field (opportunity to learn)
* Never worked for a fairly big company

My thought process:

If I take No. 2, even though I don't totally enjoy commuting and I would love to be given ""proper"" compensation for my time and the prospect of having a huge company on my CV, is great. I am afraid that I won't be able to grow in the ranks at all in a huge company with thousands of employees, compared to a smaller one with great potential. On the other hand, If I take No.1 I am afraid that I will end up being underpaid when I get my full-time employment and have a company on my CV that is not as prominent. I am just afraid of doing the ""wrong"" choice and blowing the other opportunity because I have been offered a contract by both (so I have led them along for as much as I could, before deciding)."
v8dkja,5,2022-06-09,Work on embedded C or C++ control system for next internship?,retro_Vampire,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/v8dkja/work_on_embedded_c_or_c_control_system_for_next/,"Hey everyone, I've done 2 internships programming MCUs in C and am now deciding between 2 offers:

**Internship A:** Developing firmware for image processing chips. Emphasis on low level C, RTOS, and Python scripting.   
**Benefits:** Mentorship, working on production code. First time working in non-startup environment. More advanced project than prev internships (I'm new to image processing).  
**Cons:** similar tech stack to prev internships, but much larger name/company and better working environment. 

**Internship B:** Developing low latency controls for quantum computing. Emphasis on C/C++, multithreading, Cuda, signal processing.  
**Benefits:** interesting project, opportunity to learn C++, CUDA, controls. Prev interns working at Apple and other FAANGs.  
**Cons:** Research group focused on quantum computing, less focus and knowledge of embedded. Expected to be mostly independent, not much mentorship. 

I'm debating whether A or B would position me the best for landing an internship at a top tier company (FAANG, HFT, etc) in the future?   
I'm concerned A will trap me in embedded C jobs and my lack of C++ xp would make DSA interview questions difficult. I'm concerned B is too research focused, I'd have to teach myself mostly, and I'd miss the industry standard work environment and mentorship in A which I haven't experienced yet. I probably can't get an opportunity like B again but could still get A.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

I was thinking of building a desktop app in Java and I was interested in this for a while. But am concerned that companies would not think much of it. I have been going between actually creating this project or building a web or mobile app that does something similar. Would a desktop app project look good on the resume? What are some things I should pay attention to when building a project for fun that will look good on my resume? Thanks."

When I did that I saw posts like this [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsCAD/comments/uj2j0j/best_advice_for_recent_grad_with_no_internship/) that made me very worried about my future prospects. In reality I thought it wasn’t that bad, it took me around a month to find a software engineering job making around 75k.

I really would recommend doing co-op and internships but if you haven’t I do not think your prospects are as bad as some on this sub make it out to be.

I should also mention that I had interesting projects, went to a good university, can do leetcode mediums pretty consistently and I think I sound like I know what I am talking about during technical interviews.

These were my job search stats:

65 - Job Applications

4 - Interviews (not counting initial phone screens)

v8gb0p,493,2022-06-09,"Professor uses LeetCode problems in assignments, accusing students of plagiarism",vvrim,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/v8gb0p/professor_uses_leetcode_problems_in_assignments/,"Hi I'm new to this sub.

I am a college student taking the algorithm course. In our assignment, professor put links to some leetcode problems and ask us to solve them (Medium, Hard level). I already solved those problems before taking the course as I was preparing for interviews for some internship. So I just copy-pasted my solution and submitted.

Now, he publicly accused us of plagiarism because many students submitted similar code. To be honest, I also learned the solution from YouTube videos, so there's a high chance that my code will look similar to other students who watched the same video, or just read the similar code from leetcode discussion.

It's not formally announced yet and grades are not out, but I'm very scared right now. I don't think it's fair to say we were plagiarising. What should I do if penalty is given?"
v8ie66,1,2022-06-09,"I got the trifecta and an internship in tech, what's next?",TheVengefulSoul,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/v8ie66/i_got_the_trifecta_and_an_internship_in_tech/,"For context, I am almost done getting my bachelors of science in cybersecurity (after studying computer science for nearly 4 years, and switching at the start of 2021). I should be done with school by May of 2023.

This year so far, I was able to get my CompTIA triad (Security+, Network+, A+)

I was certified as an AWS Solutions Architect, but it expired in 2020. I could renew my certificate if needed with a bit of studying.

This year, I also got a ""Technology Internship"" at a large corporate company in their ""cyber"" department (10k+ employees) for 10 weeks. It is a conversion program. That means if my manager and all like me, there is a chance that they will give me a full-time offer at the end of the program. Not sure exactly how much I am liking corporate life, but don't have any other options as of right now :/.

Other than this internship, the only other job experience I have is another 10-week internship I did back in 2019 when I was studying computer science. I was a ""Digital Developer Intern"" for a medium-sized company which I enjoyed more.

I want to keep applying to more jobs in the meantime so I can have more options.

I am not 100% sure what path I want to take in cybersecurity, but engineering/architecture sounds like something I would be interested in (my father works in cybersecurity as head of infrastructure and his work sounds fun). Pentesting also sounds great, although I have little on my resume regarding projects and hackathons. I am open to all opportunities though.

My question is: given my current knowledge/experience, what jobs in cybersecurity would be a good start towards working more in engineering/architecture/pen-testing in cybersecurity? Any tips on making myself stand out?

Much thanks!"

Just curious about whether I'd have a good shot at being accepted by a really good American university.

Major: Comp Sci

Background: Chinese national living overseas

GPA: 4.0 (I think, not sure how my school calculates that but I typically get 95-96%)

SAT: 1530 (740 EBRW 790 Math)

APs: By the end of my senior year I would have taken like 10 or 11 (should all be 4s and 5s apart from psychology which I kinda threw last year) 

List: [2021] Psych (3) [2022 - TBD] Stats, Lang, CSA, HUG [2023 - hopefully] Both Phys Cs, Calc BC, Chem, Euro + potentially Lit

Extracurriculars: I write informative and opinionated blogs and like to research history and geography on my own. Also made a couple maps to make quizzes, although I'm not sure whether this would help. Other than that I'm hopefully going to be doing an internship early this summer and also tutor other students in my grade as well as the grade below Comp Sci and SAT. Don't have a lot to include here unfortunately.

Other qualifications: 5 IGCSEs (4 A*s, 1 TBD), DELF B2 (although I barely passed, at just 51.0/100)

 I also don't know any language well. I do have some knowledge of Java thanks to APCSA as well as a little HTML but I am by no means even close to being good at them. The best thing I made here was a ""getting robbed simulator"" where you could lose money as well as kidneys. 

Oh and I can speak 4 languages (3 fluent - English, Mandarin, and Wu + broken French), but not sure how that's going to help me.

I think that's all I have atm. If you feel like there's missing information here be sure to inform me! Thanks :D"

v8krtq,1,2022-06-09,Landlord/Tenant Law: is it legal to be completely removed/switched from the apartment you signed and placed into a completely different building//location?,UpAHillToTheRight,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/v8krtq/landlordtenant_law_is_it_legal_to_be_completely/,"+question: do I have the power in refusing to sign a lease for an apartment I do not want?

I am a college student and signed for an apartment in my college town (in Pennsylvania) recently. The apartment I saw posted online was really nice, so I went and toured it. The one I was shown was a mediocre version of it, but it was okay enough for me. It had a full kitchen, bar seating, island, living room, 2 bathrooms, 4 bedrooms (I was renting 1), coat closet, etc. The apartment shown, and I’ll specify, WAS the apartment I would be signing for and renting, make no mistake. This was not the “show apartment” or “mock” one, or an “inspo” one.

He’s a landlord so obviously he was really pushy with the lease, however I stood my ground and told him I would review it overnight and come back the next day with an answer // and a deposit if I wanted it. I looked over the lease and wasn’t overly alarmed at anything. I reviewed it with my parents and my friend who’s in law school herself. Nobody said anything was alarming or shady. 

So as some pertinent info, I am a female student and requested that I be placed in an all female apartment. He said he typically does this and it would be something he would be able to honor. Obviously this wasn’t written, but I had it on good faith that this was the case. Reviews and the apartment he showed me were all positive it seemed, tenants were home, and all female, so I figured it was a believable and probable* thing.

I was also the first lessee of this apartment as well. He told me he would be giving me the “big bedroom” too unless he had 2 people want to share it which he said was unlikely and didn’t often happen. Even if I got the smaller bedroom, it wouldn’t be a bust, but I really did like the large bedroom. 

I get a call from him not a week later stating he wanted to sign 3 male students into the room. I said preferably it would only be female students and if he could figure out a situation where that worked, it would be beneficial. He said, and I quote “I’m just spitballing here, looking for some options”, “Nothing is set in stone”, and “I’m going to find a happy medium for everyone”.

He in fact did not find a happy medium. 
I told him that if he NEEDED to sign the boys on, I’d be okay with it, especially if I got the large bedroom. This bedroom is isolated from the others and isn’t butted up against them. I thought this was a fair request, especially since he told me there was a “99% chance I’d get it” already. If I have to live with more boys (the reason I moved away in the first place btw), i at least could be further away from their bedrooms. 

After this conversation it went radio silence for a few weeks. I got super busy with finals and it didn’t ring concerning until it had just been too quiet for comfort. I called to ask what the situation was, he told me “I had to sign them, I had to. I’m sorry”. I texted back asking if I was still receiving the large bedroom. More silence. 

Finally I called him and he picked up and told me he signed a 4th boy on. In the apartment WE signed for together. Not only was I not getting the largest room, I was systematically removed from it completely. I held back immediate tears, wondering where the fuck i was going to live now.

Please keep in mind, I live 2 hours away. Gas is $5 where I live. I do not want to drive back to tour new apartments after this (wrongful?) inconvenience. 

After this, he says he’s going to (majorly downgrade) me to a 2-room apartment. These things are depressing, disgusting, condemnable, and truly make me nauseous to look at. I will not be living here. If I’m forced to pay him, so be it, but I will be sleeping in my vehicle for the academic year. THATS how bad they are. These apartments are geared towards people who probably have not gotten any loans to help them with rent or don’t have parents who can pay for them. (And I feel truly sorry they are subjected to these) These are shoeboxes, don’t even have full kitchens to cook/bake food with (microwave only), and the shower isn’t even large enough to extend both your arms out. I cry every time I look at photos and think about having to live there. (Think nasty roadside motel aesthetic.) I DID tell him, very sternly, I wouldn’t live there, and he said it may “not be his choice”. Who’s is it, gods? No buddy, it’s your choices and your (bad) landlord management. 

Like the original question was, is this even legal? Nothing in the lease stipulates that I can be removed, rearranged, or put into a separate apartment in THIS situation. We signed for the number on the door. This apartment is convenient and right next door to my internship. This apartment is nice. 

And like the second question was, am I allowed to refuse this dump of a place he’s trying to put me in? I imagine I have to sign a second lease for this apartment, or he has to write something down on this lease that we will sign, which I will not do. 

Thanks much for answers/advice, sorry if it’s ranty in parts. :) I’m just losing it over this."

I am a college freshman currently enrolled as a CS major and looking to get a BIA minor. As a CS major, my overarching plan (super generalized) for being successful is learning languages, learning respective tools, then applying these skills throughout internships and experiences over the course of the next couple years (ex. SQL --&gt; SQL Server --&gt; Internship focused around Data Management/Processing).  

Personally, as a socialite, I don't really think I would be happy sitting down and utilizing my skills in a desk job developing software, which prompted me to take BIA. 

I'm probably looking too far into the future, but I've just been recently concerned with the career prospects of a CS and Business Major/Minor. Obviously, I can't attain an administrative position in a company, like an IT Program/Project Manager, straight out of college, so as a goal-oriented person who wants to do something related to a management position in tech, I've just been confused on what type of career would utilize my skills.

Ideally I would like to simply interview to pass the bar but I feel like these don't really exist outside of new-grad interviews.

Given that I'm not really a new-grad anymore, do I simply apply to the teams directly? Is there no ""bucket interview"" like there was for new-grad positions?

I was sent the ANSI MH28.2-2022 document to review because my supervisors are thinking about having me give load capacity ratings to the shelving they have that doesn't have one already displayed. It's not clear how involved I'd be or how much they want me to do, or even if they're actually assigning this to me officially at all, but they're insinuating they want me to actually give not only a load capacity rating but a way to calculate it in a general sense (like something you could run in Matlab or Excel to auto-compute it based on inputs). I'm checking out sections 4 and 12 because they look the most relevant but honestly I can't see how I'd be able to even do this at all. It's talking about seismic stuff that I've never even heard of and things that I wouldn't be able to calculate myself. I saw someone ask a similar question on another forum and it was said that only a PE could even do this so I'm wondering what exactly I can do here and if it is possible for me to do this, what the strategy would be.

My qualifications is a [B.Tech](https://b.tech/) graduate of 2021. I was placed in my campus placement with a pretty good package but after completing my internship i decided to pursue UPSC and did not take up the PPO.

Probably it was the lack of ground reality or knowledge i thought UPSC can be cracked with a year of preparation and was in full swing in preparation. Slowly but steady the uncertainties crept in and i started loosing track. add to that the coaching class were extensively long which had left me with barely 4-5 hrs to study. Even after many hiccups i had decided that whatever may come ,i shall not quit this preparation till i give my 1st attempt. 10 days before the exam my head was telling me ""just 10 more days and we are done,lets complete it"" it went on and on and finally the D-day arrived and as expected i did very very bad in GS(which i gave all my time into) but would clear CSAT(Which i barely gave any time to) .( i believe im technically very sound owning to engineering)

somewhere back of my mind ,i know that there was a lot of lacking in my preparation and i gave my head 3 days of time to decide (after sunday's exam) but im still stuck with this dilemma. I was totally committed to stopping this preparation but somwhere in the bottom i feel i can do this with a better preparation.

I know that i have to be capable to take my own decisions but this dilemma is not helping me.

On one side ,i feel i have to prepare better and give it another chance but on the other side i fear repeating another lonely year. I had decided to stay with my friends in a PG to keep myself engaged since in my first attempt i prepared staying in my house ,but the fear of repeating another year still persists.
I feel so insecure and lost

requesting your suggestions if any,  
Thank you"

I have never seen any of this stuff before, as they don't teach you any of this in the first 2 years of college. I am now expected to complete time sensitive tasks to be ready for production and deployment, and if I don't complete them the team is blocked. Every task I receive I find myself confused and lost. Are internships supposed to be like this? I thought they had their specific role for the purpose of learning, while I'm here getting grilled by my boss for not having an api ready for production. I'm not familiar with their backend infrastructure and it's been barely 2 weeks. Is this what an ""intern"" should be doing?

When I arrived in Germany, I thought I was going to stay 5 months, so I found an apartment with a fixed-term rental contract. It is a shared flat with the son of the owner at 400 euros every month.

Two month ago, a friend of mine told me that his boss was looking for an intern for a position that would suit me perfectly. After an interview, I was accepted for this position which will start in July. I warned my roommate (the son of the owner) that I had to return to Italy before the end of the rental contract. He said that there was no problem. A month later he tells me that his father does not agree with my departure, I signed a 5 month contract and I have to pay my rent for 5 months.

The internship in Italy is a big professional opportunity that I don't want to miss, and I don't have the means to pay a rent in Germany and one in Italy. What happens if I just stop paying the rent and leave 2 months before the end of my lease? Can the landlord sue me in another country?

According to my contract : If the tenancy is terminated by justified termination without notice by the landlord at the tenant's instigation, the tenant shall be liable for the damage incurred by the landlord as a result. Does this means he can sue me?

Thanks for your answers, my bus to Italy leave in one week, I already paid the ticket and I am a little anxious about this situation.

on top of this, my managers are kind of…idk. i was out of town for a funeral recently and then i got covid that was so bad that i had to go to the hospital. i had to miss a whole week of work and they kept calling me and asking me to come in anyways. despite the fact that i could barely even speak without my throat hurting. i’ve just been watching all my classmates work internships, and having worked a summer office job before going into retail, i very heavily prefer office type jobs. i’ve been applying to some and i have a few interviews, but if i get the jobs, i’d have to start asap. 

but i guess my retail job isn’t absolutely awful, so maybe i should just stick it out? i only have to work for like eight more weeks. either way, i’m kind of at a crossroads because if i do get another opportunity, in order to give two weeks notice, i’d have to tell them tomorrow. or i could just wait to see what the other jobs say and just quit on the spot."

&amp;#x200B;

Hello everyone! I am a freshman at a Computer Science University and I have 2 internship offers this summer, one for iOS development and one for .NET development. Both companies are about equal in status. The iOS development internship has you working on a small part of a real project that will be delivered to a client, while the .NET internship has you developing a desktop application for your own portfolio. Both opportunities offer a possibility of getting hired after the internship, although the iOS path has a higher chance from what I've heard from the employers. The .NET path has more oportunities locally, but also more competition (as for any web dev vs iOS dev situation). I don't know information about which jobs pay better. Which is better for my CV and future career? My plan is to get an internship at a FAANG company someday. Is working on a real project considered better from a CV perspective? Thank you in advance!

TL;DR: Freshman at uni, 2 internship offers: iOS development and .NET development. Which is better for my future? (I don't know anything about either yet)"

v8twqr,1,2022-06-09,My girlfriend is very suicidal,throwawayacc15397,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/v8twqr/my_girlfriend_is_very_suicidal/," I (M19) have known my girlfriend (F19) since middle school, have been best friends since freshman year of high school, and got together about a year and a half ago. She's been struggling with depression and anxiety since 7th grade and has been suicidal off and on since she was 15, attempting it fully once and half-heartedly another time. She has always had issues with her self-image, her father, and her motivation, and they tend to fluctuate in intensity depending on the day. She used to self-harm, but she hasn't for at least a year or so. She's been through multiple depression medications and none have seemed to help, including her current one. She's been to inpatient twice, and neither time seemed to help much. The last time she was hospitalized, they asked her if she wanted to leave the next day, doing nothing but tending to her wounds.

However, recently things have been getting worse for her. She has explained to me a few times recently that she is ""passively suicidal."" She doesn't always feel strongly enough to plan to kill herself, but it wouldn't make any difference to her whether she were alive or dead. Having said that, even with slight obstacles and inconveniences, her mood starts to drop and she starts wanting to die, saying that nothing in her life ever goes as planned and that everything inevitably goes wrong. When she doesn't have the motivation to do things to distract her from her depression, she either sleeps or sits alone with her thoughts.

She says that therapy has given her methods to cope and helped discover more about herself, but she says that even through that she never has and never will be truly happy. She can only ever really be placated by two things: me and weed, but I can't always be around her as I live with my parents and they set a curfew, and she hasn't heard back from any jobs in order to be able to afford it.

Now I fear for the worst. I am accepting a full-time paid internship for the remainder of the summer, so I won't be able to talk to her as often, and I can no longer stay up as late as I have been in order to make sure she's okay before she goes to bed. Her parents are in the dark about this entire situation because her dad would freak out, and she doesn't want her mom to worry about her. I'm also scared to say anything to them because the last time I expressed my concern for her to them, we nearly went on a break. I know she is never truly serious about breaking up with me, though, because I am the only close person left in her life since she lost almost all of her friends after high school and is too anxious to make new ones, believing that she is not a worthwhile enough person to be able to get close to others. She says she used to care about others caring for her and crying over her when she would say she wanted to die, but now she has become almost entirely numb to it. She wants to kill herself in order to preserve the old her and not turn into an uncaring husk of her former self.

She says that she doesn't see herself living too much longer and that it is inevitable that she will kill herself so I should break up with her so that it'll hurt less, but I always tell her I'm not going to do that. I realize that this is unhealthy, but I love her to death and am the only thing keeping her from doing something to herself, but even that might not be enough.

I'm going to a scheduled therapy session with her for a therapist she's been with for years, but that is in two weeks and I'm unsure if she can even make it until then.

What should I do?"

- Known him since 7th grade and he’s coached me in football and basketball.
He’s definitely seen me grow as a person, which I think colleges will appreciate a lot. Only thing is that he has to write 50 other applications, but im pretty sure he’s gonna make mine extra extra tough

I graduate in one year with a Bachelor’s in Full Stack Web Development. However my career goal overall is IT but I took that degree because my Uni’s IT program isn’t very good and is largely covered by certs and work experience. 

I have two semesters left in college one full time and one half time. 

I have an A+ cert and was thinking of getting my Net+ Fall 2022 and Sec+ Spring 2023. That way I have the trifecta and a degree upon graduation. 

I also have an internship at a MSP this summer (11 weeks @ 40hrs a week but might end up being 10.) I’m already getting tons of hands on experience and the environment rocks so it’s awesome. I was thinking of trying to land an internship or part time gig doing MSP during Fall and Spring as well to round out my resume. 

Is there anything else I should do before graduation or any different certs you guys recommend? Was thinking Azure or AWS the summer before I take a job (I wanna take one last summer off to travel and be with family and stuff before moving to a new job). I wanna knock out as much as I can before I have to go to work 40 hrs a week lol so I can be marketable and find a good job."

/or feel a way towards you. I had a colleague who considered me a friend. Same classes, same major, similar career aspirations. 

Me knowing that we had similar career aspirations any job leads, internships, networking opportunities that has helped me get in the positions I have sent her way and told her about. And there was once a time she said to me “I speak to my mom about you and I used to tell her how I feel guilty because I don’t want you to feel like I am using you.” And she mentioned how she just doesn’t know how I find these opportunities like how I do. She told me that her mother said to her that she shouldn’t feel this way especially since I was going out of my way to help her. 

That was very weird.  

When I got an opportunity of an internship that would help me in my career, she was supportive. Commented on my assignments, told me I did a great job. But when I received a really huge one that helped me advance in my career there was silence. No support from her and I noticed a slight change in her energy. 

We’ve worked together and she became passive aggressive, accused me of having attitudes with her when I never have, and all around just been very uncomfortable to be around. She even wanted to hang out outside of class and tbh I wasn’t comfortable hanging after noticing her behavior. I also noticed that she began to change up her profile to look exactly like mine and went behind my back and stated to follow people that I went out of my way to develop a relationship with. (Networks)

After graduation, I honestly deleted all form of contact with her. Obviously the thought comes to mind because I don’t understand what I did especially when I was always helping. And the fact that I work hard and received all of the opportunities I got. 

What are your thoughts? How would y’all have handled it?"

It turns out that I didn’t have to worry that much because my team is really nice, but also because my project uses absolutely none of the tech they asked me to learn. I’m basically dashboarding with splunk, with the very far off possibility of working with golang to extract new metrics. There is some html/css/JavaScript, but even those aspects are minimal.

My manager wants me to solely focus on this project, and isn’t too open to me working on additional tasks with the team alongside it. 

Splunk is really interesting, but will it be enough to bolster me during the next recruiting cycle and demonstrate any skills I’ve gained this summer? I’d appreciate any tips on how to present the project on my resumé and make the most out of the internship experience!"

I feel like this post will get a lot of hate, and that’s okay. Not sure how to start this, but I’m pretty good at CS. People always ask me for help and are usually impressed when I show them the extra credit projects I’ve done. However, my heart’s not in it. I skip class a lot, and I really don’t like it. This is a little bit of a rant, so sorry about that. 

I’m double majoring in international relations, though, which I absolutely love and am equally good at. The only problem is that my parents have been pushing CS since the end of middle school for me. I’ve never really given it my all or have put in much effort, with the exception being my first year of coding.

I’ve gotten a ton of top, highly competitive IR internships, and keep proving to my parents that I can make solid money in the field, probably in defense contracting or related fields. I keep getting top internships despite hardly applying to any.

My parents keep pushing CS thinking that it’s easy to get a job at a FAANG,etc. Ironically, it seems that with my networking, getting a good IR job is much easier, and more sustainable. I don’t really have to try all that hard and know enough to write long research papers without doing any research (footnotes after the fact lol).

I’m just really running out of steam. Even though I don’t have to try that hard, it’s exhausting to code because I absolutely hate it. I’m halfway through my cs degree and don’t want to have wasted the past 2 years.

I just want a good relationship with my parents and I want them to be proud of me. I don’t think they’d financially contribute to my education without the cs major. They just seem to think it’s so easy to get amazing job’s in SWE like magic. Both of them suck at STEM, so I have no idea why they think they have authority to speak on this issue.

All in all, non-CS people making judgements about CS pisses me off. It’s just not for me, and I feel kind of stuck. My family is important to me, but again, my heart just isn’t in it (I know, first world problems).

Can anyone relate? I want to quit it and leave it behind me even though I’m thriving in school, which makes this a hard choice. My boyfriend thinks I should drop it so I have time to do 3 IR internships + research &amp; TAing next year.

2 of my close friends left cs after the first semester and I wish I’d joined them, but now it feels too late :/ I’m very conflicted and confused. Does anyone have any advice?

EDIT:
I’ll probably do at least one SWE internship to impress IR people, but I don’t know if I can do any more than that, knowing that there’s something I’m equally talented at that actually brings me happiness."

Surprisingly, it was a bait-and-switch and my duties were essentially backbreaking manual labor (or, in my case, ankle-breaking) fixing this giant mis-managed automated warehouse. I was desperate for engineering experience, even though they lied about the salary and gave me $10k less than what I verbally agreed to. 

The company culture was TOXIC. I was salaried and they told me to put in overtime or I wouldn’t get a good performance review. Managers took credit for all the work my team and I did, and of course they shoveled all the blame onto us when things went wrong. One female intern I mentored always complained about the creepy vibes from the old, fat managers and their entourage and the myriad lunches they compelled her *specifically* to go to. 

Things always broke and even when I was off, I still got calls frequently from the underqualified $16/hr hires. I felt bad for them because they were just, as my old manager put it, “cockroaches” and “bodies to throw at the system.” 

I fell at work one day and suffered a Grade 2 ankle sprain. Getting worker’s comp was like pulling teeth and they told me that everything had to be done through the company doctor who, predictably, said I was completely fine. No one from work ever called to check up on me. I was miserable, miserable, *miserable.* 

And now, I’m out of that environment! I’m at a much better company that cares about me, my team is a lovely group of brilliant engineers, the benefits are great, the company culture is second to none, and I get to do meaningful work that has the potential to save lives. And I get to work from home every friday!

It’s frustrating though because I now need to unlearn a lot of bad habits. I’m always in panic mode when I receive new tasks at work thinking I need to get them done ASAP, even though I would have like a 3 month timeline. Having a lunch longer than a half hour is a new concept to me, and my days off are eerily quiet now that I don’t have to be a de-facto 24/7 automation support. But at least I get to build new habits and finally love what I do.

**TL;DR:** Old job was absolutely terrible for my physical and mental health, and I thought this was the norm for engineering or work in general. New job made me realize that the abuse I took was NOT normal."

A bit of context about me. I'm one of those people who's pursuing a college course in terms of practicality. So that pursue your passion mantra doesn't really work for me lmao. The reason why I chose accountancy was because it is a flexible degree + it is always in demand. Moreover, magandang pre law daw yun sabi ng parents ko and the people around me hahahhaa (I have plans in pursuing law school, but not 100% decided talaga). Anyways, I passed the DOST scholarship and deferred it for a year in case I change my mind and decide to pursue a STEM-related course.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been doing a lot of reflection these past months and was hit with an existential crisis if worth it pa ba I pursue ang accountancy and the CPA path. I don't know, the coursework is mind-numbing itself and I just don't see myself staring at numbers and doing routinary work for the rest of my life.  I've always considered computer science as my 2nd choice when I applied to universities since I've been always interested in technology. Sadyang traditional lang kasi yung family ko, that's why I took their advice to pursue accountancy nalang.

&amp;#x200B;

I've listed pros and cons to help me with my decision:

&amp;#x200B;

**BSA AT MY CURRENT UNIVERSITY**

**PROS**

* In demand and provides job security. There will always be jobs for accountants.
* Flexible course and well regarded ang mga CPA dito sa bansa. 
* Magandang pre law daw. Really this is one of the reasons I took BSA, because I want to become a lawyer someday but not really 100% sure about that.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONS**

* I can't see myself in the future staring at numbers all day and doing repetitive work.
* Mostly nasa CPA ang karamihang opportunities, and our school has a low passing rate for CPALE
* Academically demanding, at least in our university
* I've seen a lot of accountants online quitting or na bu-burnout because of the workload. This is probably one of the main reasons that made me question this career path.

&amp;#x200B;

**COMPUTER SCIENCE**

**PROS**

* Offers a lucrative career path with growth
* More room for creativity and innovation.
* Unlike in accountancy, you get to see tangible results when you code.
* Software development and data science sounds really interesting
* Lots of interesting internships opportunities available online 
* Mas maganda ang facilities and well known sa region namin yung university na lilipatan ko

&amp;#x200B;

**CONS**

* Math is not my forte. Pero willing to work hard to be better.
* No coding experience
* Will be an irregular student when I transfer to a different university. I'm also an introvert so this will be a challenge huhu
* Family is traditional and skeptical about me pursuing a career in tech. They are worried that I might have a hard time finding a job in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

**ADDITIONAL INFO:**

**+** I want a job that is flexible, has job security, and evident ang career growth. I also value autonomy and agency when it comes to doing work. 

&amp;#x200B;

**+** I want my college experience to not be entirely focused on academics. I want to pursue other things like do internships and be active in organizations while studying.

&amp;#x200B;

**+** There's the option to continue pursuing accountancy and studying programming on the side but I'm not so sure if I can stomach accounting-related content for 3 more years + review for the board exam.

&amp;#x200B;

**+** I've been thinking na hindi naman mawawala ang law school and that I can still pursue it despite any course. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't really trust myself sometimes so I'm just gonna ask some random people on the internet  hahaha.

Help out an indecisive college student stuck in a quarter life crisis. I would really appreciate y'alls insights. Thank you!"

I have wanted to go to USA for further studies. I was good in computer science in school. Went to two countries for international programs (like 1 week convention) and have taken part in few science exhibitions. But I have a problem, my gpa is fucked up like below 3.0 and I have honestly no explanation to that. Also the eca that I mentioned above is actually quite generic I found.

v98qdv,1,2022-06-10,How do I frame my job hopping in a positive light?,LatchedVoice95,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/v98qdv/how_do_i_frame_my_job_hopping_in_a_positive_light/,"I (27/f) have been in the workforce since 2019, after I graduated with my MSc in Mass Communications in the US. Since then, I've worked at 3 different companies and I'm looking for a new job again. 

My first job was a well-paid marketing internship at a nationwide retailer. After a few months, I was promoted to a full time position. After some time, the job responsibilities changed. I really struggled with these new responsibilities and was ultimately put on a near impossible Performance Improvement Plan. I left the organization to avoid getting fired. I stayed with the company for a year plus two or three months.

From there, I went to a construction organization. I was the only individual in the marketing department. I reported to an executive in charge of myself and the sales and estimating teams. I was given a lot of flexibility in my job since I consistently delivered increasing performance on digital metrics. I loved that job. I was able to work remotely 50% of the time, had good health insurance and was able to have a life outside of work. However, the overall salary was relatively low. Plus, there was no room for advancement. I knew if I wanted to advance my career, I would need to look elsewhere.

Out of the blue, I stumbled across a job that sounded perfect. It was a manager level position at a small marketing agency. The responsibilities of the job were limited to my favorite parts of my current job. I felt I was a good fit for this role, applied and got the position. This led to me leaving the construction organization after about a year and a half.

When I started my new job, I really enjoyed it. I liked my supervisor and my job was exactly what I expected. 

After a few months that supervisor left and a new one came on. She was challenging the status quo, making my job harder. Despite this, I liked my new supervisor. She preached on work life boundaries, was understanding of some ongoing health issues I have and was a great role model. However, many of the executives and project managers did not like her. While I'm not privy to the entire situation, I do know that they made her feel like an outsider. This ultimately led to her resigning after being with the company for about 4 months. 

On top of this, the company announced they are several hundreds of thousands of dollars in the red. The CEO blamed this on the employees being inefficient at their jobs, and he specifically called out my department of 3 people as one of the main culprits. Never mind the fact that the CEO refuses to charge clients for how much work we're actually doing or the fact that he recently made an agreement with a client that they wouldn't have to pay for services for a limited time. 

Ultimately, the fact this company can't keep a someone in my supervisor's position and the company's financial troubles that the CEO refuses to take responsibility for has made me realize it may be time to seek out a new position. I

I've been at this job for about 11 months. I've never been at a job longer than a year and a half. How do I explain this in interviews? I don't want to seem like I'll jump ship after a year or less. I want to find a company I can stay at least 3 years with (if not longer) so I can grow my knowledge and skills. I would appreciate any advice on this situation."

v98wbe,1,2022-06-10,Grokking the Coding Interview vs Leetcode explore?,stuffingmybrain,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/v98wbe/grokking_the_coding_interview_vs_leetcode_explore/,"Starting the leetcoding process for summer 2023 SWE internship recruiting (I'm a rising junior). I've already taken a DS/A class at university. 

I was wondering if it's better to go through Grokking the Coding Interview patterns then go through tagged company problems, or go through Leetcode Explore? For reference, Leetcode explore basically has sections for each data structure, and some problems for each. 

On one hand, Grokking seems very promising as the patterns they teach seem to crop up quite often. However, I've heard that companies like Google don't necessarily ask questions super similar to ones we might see on leetcode, and I don't want to become a leetcode-pattern-but-nothing-else person if that makes sense? Is this a valid concern? 

Or should I look at other resources such as [Grind 169](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?weeks=15&amp;hours=14)?"
v99d5j,15,2022-06-10,Trying to Leave Home,numbpotato2345,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/v99d5j/trying_to_leave_home/,"It's been a miserable couple of days. I tried to move out on Wednesday and of course I didn't want to break family ties so I wanted to have an open conversation with my family about it. It backfired spectacularly. I should have just left.

For the first time in my 24 years of living, I actually went to a therapist of my own volition to try and figure out my feelings. I feel trapped in so many different ways. I am emotionally burnt out. I'm tired and I feel numb. I can't even react when my parents text me ""I'm sorry for yelling at you, I love you."" or when anyone tries to hug me.

I just can't believe that they love me, anyone in my family. I'm just yelled at and constantly guilt-tripped. Whenever I say anything... I'm being too emotional or I'm putting words into people's mouths. And I do admit that I do not help the situation by yelling back. My therapist told me that it was natural for me to do that, because I am disappointed and frustrated with my situation.

My whole life I have grown up hearing my parents say no or nag me. A part of me understands that they do this because they worry about me. But I am so resentful of who I am today. I get paralyzed whenever I try to research on how to buy a used car. I get nervous whenever I try to look up anything apartment-related. It's difficult for me to talk to strangers. I have the mindset of giving up before I try anything.

I couldn't sleep all night yesterday because my mom came in my room to yell at me. About my bad decisions like my boyfriend and wanting to move out. I don't know how many times I have to say that it isn't because of my parents but me wanting to have a space for myself. To reclaim myself and be able to do whatever I want whenever without having to constantly worry about what my family would think. I've lived my whole life with my family. I've shared a room (basement) with my older sister for 4 years. Before that, I shared a room with my younger brother. I have no privacy. I went to a local college and was an off-campus student while working part-time. I worked my ass off to get a relevant internship and then a job right after my internship.

I don't do drugs, I don't party, I don't over-drink. All I do is get all of my work done (I'm a full-time employee @ the government) and then kick-back and relax with gaming in the evening. I don't understand why my gaming is such a big problem to my family when I get my work done and I am clearly happy about gaming. Even now, at 24, my mom will burst into my room and get extremely heated about me gaming. I don't even game with weird people anymore! (One of her concerns) I literally play single-player games or play games without even communicating to other people.

Anyways, I can't trust anyone in my family. I overheard my sisters talk about me. Lots of things were said, and I know those things were said out of venting anger. It still doesn't make me feel any better. I can't look at them without thinking of those things. I can't trust them anymore. I don't ever want to talk to them again. And I know those feelings are being amplified because of the situation, and that that's something I'm working on with my therapist.

I'm just lost. Reading all these stories about going no-contact seems so freeing. I'm jealous of watching Asian women my age living their lives, going on vacation but still have a connection with their family. I want to do that. I want to run away and escape and finally live out the dream I've always wanted. I want to be able to just LIVE without being nagged at or worried about.

But a part of me will always repeat back the words my family has told me. That I'm not emotionally ready yet, that I'm woefully unprepared for the real world, that I should just stay with my parents for another 5 years to save up for a house, and that I will never make the right decisions. And a part of me doesn't want to be cut out from the family. I can't bear to not be called my mom's daughter because I think I do love them. But at the same time, I feel like this family doesn't even LIKE me. They say they worry about me because they love me but I just don't understand it. Maybe it's because I'm so numb to everything around me now.

It took all my willpower to not jump into a car and drive into a lake last night. I'm just so tired of living. I've also lost my appetite. I lost like 10lbs already. I don't want to eat anymore because that's literally the only thing I have control of in my life. The only reason why I haven't ended my life is because I wouldn't want my boyfriend to be upset."

&amp;#x200B;

just some backstory

i am a student in data and trying to become IT-Support, and my GF is trying to become a twitch streamer and artist in digital art, IT-Support that 100 percent and I don't have a problem with it.

&amp;#x200B;

the thing I want to vent about: I really want to see my friend fail. he ""lives"" with his GF and non of them have school or a job, they both live off of money from the government but they don't want to get a job, well they want to but they are too lazy. my friend has ADHD but he says that he's ADHD and laziness is the reason he isn't in school or work, and he only wants to work if I work with him. I have another friend who takes almost the exact amount of ADHD medication + autism medication. and he is having a school and 2 side jobs and he is doing just fine. anyway. my friend who is too lazy says that he wants to do YouTube and streaming for a living but he doesn't make videos or stream.

&amp;#x200B;

he just wants to use the government for money and nothing else and he complaints about holidays because everything is closed during holidays and he hates schools more than everything and keeps telling me how much school is shit and sucks. but I honestly want him to be in worse condition financially then he already is. I want him to realize that he should have a job or something, his GF just wants to try and have a job but she doesn't know how to make a cv and when I wanted to help her she didn't know anything. (school name, interns, jobs, etc.) they both sleep all day and seem like they have no problems even though they don't have a lot of money.

&amp;#x200B;

i get paid threw my school, and I have a shit tone of problems that I cant just fix with a flick of a finger. and even though he's just ripping off the government he doesn't want to help in any way shape or form (like pay taxes or work for a business or anything like that.)

&amp;#x200B;

am I wrong for wanting him to struggle, for wanting him to have problems?"

im a 29yo male from germany and i am feeling completely hopeless :(

my life is spiraling into a deep abbys and i feel much guilt, shame and despair. yesterday my day began crying and with a willingness to write a goodbye letter to my family :(

for me, life ist just a fight; i don’t enjoy anything anymore, and for over half a year now i am okay with the idea of sleeping forever. i lack meaning and purpose, lack motivation and am tired. i lost a vision for my life, goals and dreams 😢 i could travel to a nice place tomorrow, but doubt it will affect or alleviate my pain and emptiness. money is no motivation for me.

i don’t have a job, sleep often throughout the day and have no joy nor much motivation for social activities or sports anymore. i overeat almost daily or do at least have unhealthy food consumption patterns, such as eating peanuts with yogurt and banana at 11pm, ruining my sleep, and despite being full. i buy food but am too lazy to cook and eg eat cereals instead of preparing salad.

i have attained a masters degree in business management last august but am since then without a real job. i never was full-time employed so far, i just did two internships; i am still living with my dad, who is a wonderful, hard-working man; my father fully financed my studies and is such a supportive human that i hate myself for being such a fool. i have truly one of the most supportive families (dad, two sisters) one could imagine but i bring them to their absolute limits and create pain for them daily 😢😢

i don’t know when my depression started but i connect it with many negative events in my childhood and adolescence… first my mother died when i was 9yo… i have no memories for her 😢 i drank lots of alkohol during puberty (binge drinking, lots of blackouts) and feel extremely guilty about that period … my father had cancer in 2010 and i cant remember the time back then, just that i drank a lot… (but only at the weekends and never alone)… i had lots of unresolved anger for my dad as he wasnt there for me and did not stop me drinking…

i stress the alcohol issue a lot… i have troubles remembering the time and feel so much shame and guilt when being told stories i forgot about or was extremely drunk 😢 i sometimes combined alcohol and thc, and i had bad hangovers from bingedrinking, sometimes +2 days :/ … in my perception i attribute myself cognitive deficits, memory problems and blurred speaking to my alcohol intake back then… this is almost compulsive so that i feel guilty today for things that are +10 years old.

in 2018 i started a 1year CBT therapy + sertralin … i was diagnosed with moderate depression… lots selfdoubts, anger towards my dad, fear i damaged my brain 😢 did not really help… then 2020 i was 9 weeks jn a psychosomatic clinique… for MDD … felt a bit better afterwards: the idea was to do a psychoanalysis + escitalopram… fast forward 2021 i again went into the same clinique 10 weeks this time …. felt not at all better, still the same thoughts in my head (alcohol damaged my life, i am a dead loss etc.) was treated with tavor quetiapin olanzapin venlafaxin… nothing helped! 😭

after the 2nd clinique stay i pretty much abendoned life for several weeks i was lying in bed ALL DAY… no motivation to do anything and talked yeah even threatened (😢) my loving siblings openly with suicid…

then i was prescribed wellbutrin for energy and drive … didnt work either 😢 my feeling of unhappiness just increases with every failed medication

tried a job in retail and felt overwhelmed… always negative thoughts in my head, crying, extreme sadness, inability to concentrate…, persistent feelings of guilt for drinking events that are 10 years gone…

meanwhile my therapist to which i went 2years more or less abandoned me and said i need to go into a clinic again (3rd time) as she cant go on with me talking about my acceptance of death…

….

i am compelty unsure about everything!! am i even depressed?? or am i just a fool that is too lazy putting in the work everyone has to and should just get a job and stfu…I think the latter

everyday everything feels like a burden no joy just suffering

everything i do is out of coercion… like getting out of bed or not being in bed all the time … no enjoyment in anything no more interests…

should i go one more time in a clinic?

i also looked for special CBASP clinic for chronic depression … maybe it helps?

apart from that perhaps try  psilocybin… am afraid if i should try it (bad trip) but what do i have to loose 😢😢

in terms of medications i almost had everything thats out there :/

thanks for any advice i hope i will see light once again"

v9ek5e,5,2022-06-10,Is a masters really necessary for ML/AI?,PineappleOver2072,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/v9ek5e/is_a_masters_really_necessary_for_mlai/,"I go to a top undergrad and feel pretty confident about my chances at getting a FAANG internship eventually. My school offers a 5 yr MS/BS but I definitely would rather start working instead of more school. 
1. How hard is it to break into ML/AI with just an MS vs BS, assuming I get good internships?
2. Is the pay bump significant? 
3. Is it much harder to move up or move into management without an MS?"

What advice would you give me regarding applying to University professors for the same? How to apply, which universities to target, what to keep in mind, some suggestions etc 
The winter break would only be a month long, but after that I'm willing to continue remotely on a part time basis without a stipend (as I have done for all my previous internships because I can't leave a project that I'm interested in)

I apologize for the long wall of text. To understand my situation, I will encourage your to read my background, because I think that might help to understand my situation.

So here is some background. I graduated in May 2022 with BSCS. During school, I didn't do any internships because I was working full-time and didn't want to lose a well-paying job that supports my family. Before graduation, I accepted a New Grad SWE Position at F500 in Feb 2022 and was really excited to start. However, things didn't go as I planned. A week before starting, HR contacted me and told me they can't offer me the job because of my immigration status. At this time, I had already said no to one other company and stopped looking for jobs, and in middle of the May, I had no Job. I have already given notice to my day job and started training my replacer. (you can read more about the immigration situation in the end)

Sinces May, I have been applying for all sorts of SWE jobs ( Junior, Entry, and even internships). Noticeable companies I applied to and reached the final round:

* Xactware - Ghosted after final.
* Fidelity - Bomb the final round because I can't understand the question and the financial lingo they used in the question.
* Visa - Rejected after the final interview, even though 2 out of 3 interviewers told me they would love to have me on their team and told me they are going to give me a positive review.
* Coinbase - Stop hiring, the next day of my final interview. I aced the last round and finish it before time.
* Zillow - ghosted after phone screening, behavioral, and OA
* ZipRecruiter - ghosted after behavioral and OA

Finally, I interviewed for an SWE job at a Big Bank. After all rounds, HR called me and told me all the interviewers loved me but they don't have any SWE jobs available anymore; however, they like to make me an offer for a BA position. I accepted the offer a few days later because it's better than nothing. **Now I come to a conclusion that I have left with two options left:**

1. **Keep applying for jobs while working as BA, keep doing LC, and hope for the best.**
2. **Do the above \^ and wait till the end of the year. If I didn't lend a job, I should quit my BA job and go to school for MS full time and do some internships.**

Thanks in advance for the advice.

The immigration drama:

For the ppl interested in my immigration situation, here is what happened. I told HR the laws they are going by are old and told them to go check the new immigration laws. But HR didn't listen and kept reciting that I have my immigration status doesn't permit me to work in the US. I was upset and broken. I can't fathom that the HR of one of the F500 company which has 25000 employees have no knowledge regarding my immigration status. I decided to sue the company after talking to different HR friends of mine. They told me the company violated the law and they are just not aware of it. I sued them for immigration discrimination and currently settling the lawsuit. The F500 lawyers apologize on behalf of the company after realizing how they ruined the last 3-4 months of life."

v9ijch,88,2022-06-10,From zero interview to Amazon in 6 months,chris_costa1989,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/v9ijch/from_zero_interview_to_amazon_in_6_months/,"Preface:

Just a preface, I am currently a junior computer science student who six months ago had no meaningful projects or interview invites. This is a bit of a long post, but it really documents the journey.

Beginning:

I started my journey by applying to over 50 companies, ranging from small to large. However, the response remained the same, rejected. Feeling disheartened, I watched over 200 hours of videos talking about how they got a job at X (Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.) trying to understand why no one wanted to hire me. 

Finding my weaknesses:

So, I began working on projects that would show I am capable of working in such an environment. So many people in computer science programs only have single language projects that were done for a class. In this field, it is so important to work on side projects that delve into technologies that will actually be used. Learn front-end, back-end, full-stack, anything! Highlight skills that will be applicable to everyday work. This was the first step to helping me land a job.

Reapplying:

I updated my resume and included a full-stack REST API project, a front-end project, and a python web scraping project. This is when I felt prepared to start searching for an internship! I once again applied everywhere and to my surprise, heard back from a few. I landed a job as n SDE for the Army research lab for the summer. So far it has been incredible and I am learning so much. However, I know most people clicked on this post not for the army position, but for Amazon. 

Start of Amazon:

So, once I landed my internship with the ARL. I wanted another position for the fall. Luckily Amazon had just posted a position and I applied. About three days later I received the first Online Assessment. It consisted of two Leetcode style questions, both of which I passed all test cases. I received the second online assessment 3 days later. This round consisted of behavioral-style questions that revolve around Amazon's 16 leadership principles. Funny enough, working with APIs earlier for my personal projects, one of the questions asked was about querying a database, a question I was able to get right. Passing this round, I was then sent the final round invite.

Prep for the final round:

So, the final round. I had already been doing a lot of Leetcode around this time. The goal I set for myself at the beginning of the year was to do around 5-7 problems a week. I highly recommend doing this as it is near impossible to cover all topics for a technical interview within only a few weeks. This is a common issue I see among friends who make it to the final round, they lack preparation. So, I had 2 weeks to prep for my final round and I was doing about 5-7 problems a day. (string manipulation, arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, graphs) I also had about 2-3 stories for each of the leadership principles, as Amazon heavily weighs the behavioral questions.

Interview:

I logged onto Chime, introduced myself, and overall had a great interview. The interviewer asked me a bunch of behavioral questions, all of which I was prepared for. The technical question was not bad, I was able to solve it with optimal time complexity and was able to adjust my code when he added an edge case. The one thing I wanted to focus on, as well, was to really bond with the interviewer. REMEMBER, they are human too! Towards the end, we had plenty of time and I asked him so many questions about his job, the environment, what he enjoys, etc.. (Also remember, people love talking about themselves.) 

Offer:   
It did take a bit of time to receive my offer, as during this time it was memorial day weekend. A lot of the managers were out of the office. In total, it took 12 business days to hear back. However, I did receive multiple updates from my recruiter, basically letting me know I got the position. Then finally, on the 12th day, I got it!

End:  
Just remember, any internship and experience beats no internship. In this field, working an SDE job will always be more impressive to someone hiring than getting an A in data structs. (You need to know how/when to use them) If you have any questions, feel free to ask. I was completely lost and somehow figured out what to do with pure luck, I don't want to see someone in the same position. 

Anyways, Good Luck!"

No prior internships (fell through when covid hit) or certifications, just school, personal studies, and projects. The in person interview got me nervous because it was my first real in person interview with a big company. Thankfully I got along with everyone and showed off my skills as well as my EAGERNESS TO LEARN MORE AND BETTER MYSELF FOR MYSELF AND THE COMPANY (this was a biggie companies wanna see in candidates). The company deals with private security and investigations (high profile clients, hedgies, etc.) and they’re trying to restart their cyber security division, so i would technically be the first on the new team. Im guessing since I’m young they want to mold me into what they specifically need for the company since I’m still green. 

Traveling to the job isn’t bad at all, just a 45 minute bus ride there and back (it is based in NYC). As of what I know right now, the job is full time with a base salary of 55k a year, I haven’t been sent the paperwork yet, so idk about the heath benefits, 401k, and bonuses yet. As well as if there are clear wage increases (by year or by 2 or by however many), which is a must. 

Is this a good deal as of what I know now? Or am I getting screwed?"

Passed,ScienceAcrobatic1177,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/v9ji0c/comptia_security_exam_and_my_experience_passed/,"Alright everyone, I seen alot of posts before taking mine and wanted to do my part for the next set of people.

Background: BBA Computer information systems, 3 years of desktop support Currently: intern for cyber sec company for IR

Scored:758

Passing:750

Used the full time to take exam

2 months of studying, last month went a little hard on the studying.

So let’s start by saying I’m not that great of a test taker.

What helped me pass?

* my background experience helped me grasp concepts easier.
* I used testout.com for learning the Material, kinda pricey. It’s good stuff tho. Had labs to help me really get it. 80 a month haha first month free and has other certs in there.
* practice exams!!! I used passemall.com, pretty close to the real thing tbh. It tells you why you got the answer wrong. Used this mainly. And learned from all the wrong answers.
* professor messor, but only like 2 days, since my exam was comin up. He has PBQs in his exam, which helped because those question are apart of the test

Advice:

\-know them ports and if they are udp/tcp, the common ones. -types of attacks and how to prevent -mostly scenario based questions

* there are like 3 questions that asked me to configure networks and I had to actually type in Ips and wireless type. Was one where I had to match the attack and how to prevent it.
* OSI model
* cyber kill chain
* incident response steps
* Know them acronyms and what they do, knowing them can help answer some simple questions.
* Flash cards I promise!!
* do pbq based questions for practice messor or that dion guy.
* asymmetric/symmetric keys,digital signature
* firewalls
* tools like nmap, netstat, grep
* internal controls - preventatives, deterrents, corrective

Test taking tips?

* I personally needed more time, I’d advise flagging the questions that you can’t figure out quickly and move on. Come back at the end to take care of them. Sometimes other questions can trigger your memory and understanding.
* don’t you dare leave a question blank
* you get a white board or paper to write on, I’d jot down everything before your brain forgets.

Last not least, please make time to rest before. Goodluck, hope this helps!!"

I have an internship (well it's technically called a ""Co-op"") coming up in the fall semester, and I'm wondering whether summer internships are more likely to be very surface level due to them being slightly shorter (12 weeks typically vs 16 week co-ops). Or, if anyone has any experience with Owens-Corning specifically, that would be appreciated as well. Thanks."

This is my first week of internship with a mid size firm and they use like 3 different softwares for filing tax returns and I'm not liking the softwares at all. They are so complex and there is one that always crashes once in a while - I don't know how I can further explain but is this the same thing with Big4? The reason i am asking is because my next internship is with PwC.

Also, I am not able to retain all the information they go over in zoom meetings and I am super afraid that I will do bad in the projects they will give us in the next few weeks. I know they don't expect much of a intern but is this normal or I am just dumb?

And how long does it take to get comfortable with the work you are supposed to do? If any of the tax people can mention what they do on a regular basis and how hard is it on a scale of 1 to 10 - I would really appreciate.

Thank You!!"
v9mdnu,1,2022-06-10,"5 years into my professional career and I have been with 4 full time jobs and one part time. Newest job has a great work environment but has a 24/7 component that is overwhelming. Should I save my mental health? Or, stay longer?",snowfat,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/v9mdnu/5_years_into_my_professional_career_and_i_have/,"Hey Everyone,

I am at a crossroads. When I turned 30 I made a major life move to no longer be a wandering hippie and join the adult workforce. I started at a non profit interning and doing back breaking labor but I loved the career field. I have made progressive career jumps to work myself out of the field and into an in demand office management role. My job history looks like this:

Job A: Intern 1.2yrs

Job B: lead and field manager: 1.2 years

Job C: lateral move to another field manager: 6 months 

Break in jobs to pursue personal endeavors: 6 months

Job D: part time but title increase(still work with the company) 1.9yrs

Job E: Big title increase and pay raise, 11months


Job E has been amazing for learning, remote work, and enjoying my team. The biggest downside is it has a 24/7 component that was sold as being not overwhelming just occasionally. So during the week I am on call 24/7 and every few weekends. My jobsite just so happens to be awful and the company admits it was poorly executed by the time took over. The specific project has been highly demanding for over 9 months and continues to.be draining. 

This is my first really corporate job and my interview process had a component about my work history having job hoping (which is true, but I was make under 50k in a HCOL) felt necessary. 

I was really wanting to make it to the next holidays to have more longevity, but that number is starting to feel arbitrary.

1. Should tough it out to the 1.5yr mark?
2. Does my job hopping seem unreasonable?
3. Have others dealt with a 24/7 component? If so how did it work out for you?
4. How can I approach my leadership discuss my inability to handle 24/7?

Just looking for feedback and advice. My company Fortunately likes me so I am not in danger of being let go anytime soon."

v9nib2,0,2022-06-10,Summer Internship,cards_123,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/v9nib2/summer_internship/,Hello. I got a position to intern at a new tech startup this summer where I could help with helping the company on some projects. Should I do this and will it help my app? Thanks.
v9npvo,1,2022-06-10,I just had a really bad nightmare and it’s freaking the shit out of me,bestieharem,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/v9npvo/i_just_had_a_really_bad_nightmare_and_its/,"It was set in a childhood mall and everything was benign at first with me just marveling at the changes and expansions in the mall that had gone on in the 10+ years I’d been away from my home city. I’d just had a nightmare previous to this so it seemed like a welcome reprieve. That one was about interacting with a class movie activity for something I’d watched in the past, but the more I watched the more twisted and bizarre it got. At some point I had entered the movie world and was drifting behind the main characters like an invisible spectator so I was seized with the same paranoia and slow spiral into insanity as they felt. The movie was called “the other spring” or “the other winter” or something similar to that. The visual metaphors in the sections correlating to activity questions were extremely vivid and creative, but just fucked up and bizarre. What’s sinister is in the previous nightmare and this one, the setting and plot felt so familiar and I “knew” I’d been at that mall before throughout my childhood and had the same excitement of recognizing old landmarks in it/disappointment at some of the renovations or changes. That mall does not exist in real life and the layout and shops are completely foreign to my awake mind. It’s fucking terrifying how the brain can just conjure these situations out of thin air and make it your reality. I had another dream earlier this year (which was actually really positive and euphoric), waking up from which actual reality seemed flimsy and substanceless and I was awed by how much more the dream reality seemed the “truth”. 

It makes me think how powerful delusions can be and how people with schizophrenia must feel as their condition gets worse. Before going to sleep I was having some dark thoughts about ending my shit because of social anxiety disorder I’ve dealt with my whole life. It’s similar to this in that my brain just decided sometime in toddlerhood to fuck my social chemicals and I’ve only tasted what “normal” feels like for a few months out of my life. What I’m living doesn’t constitute a life, it’s like a bad dream. The only reason I don’t do it is because my mom doesn’t have anyone else she can put hope in since my dad and brother are disappointments causing her to contemplate ending her shit for years. I have this fear of my mental issues getting worse over the years. I remember the first manic episode I experienced last year that convinced me of my bipolar diagnosis, where my brain was going at like six or ten thoughts simultaneously for hours and days at a time without needing sleep, my entire personality changed and I could not control the anxiety attacks, claustrophobia, feelings of “doom”. Luckily I’m not one of those people who hallucinate or have paranoia during their episodes, that would scare me to death. Just waking up from this dream, I looked at the bookcase in my room and saw it elongating and extending upwards. Had to jump on my phone real fast and wake myself up with blue light so I didn’t keep hallucinating. 

Recently, I had my first “panic attack” where I was actually losing grip on my mind and felt I was going insane or entering psychosis. I don’t remember huge chunks of that night’s trip to the ER. I just remember feeling sad during the attack that I’d probably be in an institution for the rest of my life, I’d have to give up my internship before even starting and I’d be extinguishing the one hope my mom has for future happiness. I was begging my mind not to lose grip so I wouldn’t do this to my mom. I’ve only recently started making good progress in academics and career-related stuff, this couldn’t happen now. The thing is I wasn’t pleading with my mind to stay in control for myself. I have no joy in my paper-thin life and spending the rest of my life mentally incapacitated would be equivalent to the lack of life quality I’ve had thus far. I am just going onward like an automaton for my family. Since childhood I’ve had so much self-hatred, I hate my personality (or lack of) that caused me to get rejected and bullied, I hate the social anxiety that has gotten worse and taken away my childhood talent of public speaking along with any chance at having normal friendships or a friend group. I’ve been depressed this whole week and hated myself even more seeing other interns interact during onboarding week and actually have personalities, the confidence to speak up routinely and ask questions.. I’ve tried constantly this week to participate and be super friendly but my awkwardness and lack of things to say has just led to more judgment and rejection. I’m faking my happiness and upbeat attitude for the zoom meetings and in front of my family. The only time I can have a normal conversation is when I’m seeing my therapist or psychiatrist, that’s the only time I feel “normal”. Fuck this life, it’s exhausting living in terror of interacting with other people no matter how much I’ve tried to expose myself to it. I must’ve done something particularly bad in my past life because this one feels like a curse. I wouldn’t have fucking depression if I had the mind of a normal person, able to be in public places and interact with other people casually. The thing that brings me the most joy in life is interpersonal connection, yet I can’t have it. I wish there was a way for me to be erased from existence so my family could go on without remembering me. I’m scared of death lately for various reasons but now I wonder if it’s just an unending sequence of nightmares like my nap today. That shit was so horrifying even worse than the gore dream I got when starting Effexor, I was half-aware during the dream thinking I better write this down afterward because it’s scarier than any horror movie. The stuff that happened in it was “creative”, totally unlike things I’ve seen in horror before… 

Man lately I’ve even been considering drugs to change my personality or take away my social anxiety. I have never considered this before and turned down invites to even smoke weed, now tho I’m at the end of my rope figuratively speaking. I don’t even know if it’s possible to cure my condition or change my personality but something has got to change because it’s not normal for me to be writing fucking essays every night just to get these feelings out my head. I got prescribed a strong social anxiety medication lately but haven’t been able to take it yet, I really hope it works because I need relief from this shit asap. So tired of faking normalcy and feeling like a stage actor afraid of slip-ups around other people. In a damn zoom meeting of all things. This has got to be a joke."

\- I plan on retaking the sat and act

\- I realize that just providing stats might be not enough info, but im not ready to share essays b/c... well... I still have no clue what to write about.

\- please... be brutal. I need a reality check

\- personally, I think my stats are a little bit lacking. I didn't win anything big like nationals/internationals, and some of my ec's are basic. but I just want some outside opinions thanks!

This is a rant about one of the jobs I had before this one.",Bigbuckrocks,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/v9q8yt/this_is_not_a_rant_about_my_current_job_which_i/,"It’s January of 2020, and I started working at a gas station (7-Eleven, although it’s still Sunoco-branded) because I needed any job. Oh my god, this was the worst job I have ever had. I hated (mostly) everything about it.

I had to work by myself. I thought I could handle it. But there were numerous times when I called my manager who wasn’t there because I didn’t know what to do. He yelled at me multiple times for various reasons throughout my time there and his English was hard to understand at times (some of our staff, including himself, primarily spoke Arabic I think since they were from Egypt). I dealt with shit customers all the time. Some regulars were nice and I learned what they usually came for.

I’m fortunate that I was able to keep my job when the pandemic started in March. Or rather, I chose to stay there because I could and I needed at least some income. Most customers wore masks, which I appreciated.

I started to feel like I was being taken advantage of by one other worker asking me to work an extra hour (if I wanted to) on days where he was supposed to come in once June came around. Most times I did, but there were times when I couldn’t. In August, my manager wanted to promote me to assistant manager, I assume because I’m the only one other than him who worked more hours than anyone, and I was coming in 4 days a week instead of 3 because now I was done with school for the year at the time. I wasn’t interested because I knew I would be going back to school soon (I was a part-time student by the time the fall semester started that year) and a minimum 40-hour work week would not fit my schedule when that time would come.

In November, I started suffering from depression for other reasons. Having a job I had come to despise was not helping my situation and I was desperate to escape. That’s when I found Wendy’s. Why did I choose Wendy’s? Well, since I was almost done with school I wanted to find a job or internship in my major but nobody would accept me or they would just ignore me. I was basically guaranteed a job at Wendy’s because I would not have to compete for any position. And, I wouldn’t have to work by myself anymore, which I absolutely hated. A few days before Thanksgiving, an interview was scheduled, and I had it exactly one week later. My soon-to-be new manager was also foreign (as were some other workers) but I could understand a little bit of Spanish so it would be slightly easier to communicate with them. We agreed that I would start in December and the offer was given to me and I immediately accepted it.

In early December (I was back to Fridays and weekends only by this time), 2 days after the interview at Wendy’s, I went to 7-Eleven on one of my off days and told my ex-manager that I would be leaving. The next 2 weekends would be my last ones. He wanted to keep me around by reminding me of the available assistant manager position and even offered a raise, but I stood my ground.

December 12, 2020 was my second to last day there. Someone was supposed to come and take over but he was in hospital according to his sister (I think she was answering all of his calls). I told my manager to come take over for me. I worked almost 12 fucking hours that day, but I knew the nightmare would be over soon. Just before I left, he tried to get me to stay again saying he could give me whatever I wanted, but I still refused to budge. We were very short-staffed by this time but I had to look out for myself.

December 13, 2020 was my last day. During my last hour, I was listening to Break Free by Ariana Grande on my Bluetooth radio, and I have never been more happy to leave a job once I left. I even refused to stay an extra hour for that other coworker who always asked me if I wanted to. I have no idea how I managed to stick it out for 11 months.

I made less money at Wendy’s, at least at the start, but it was so much better for me. I could interact with people who weren’t customers, managers were there, and I didn’t have to worry about staying late for anyone. Some of the people who worked there were also attending the same high school I graduated from years before. One manager seemed to not like me but at least she was there and not hanging out with her family (although she took her kids to the place and let them hang out sometimes), but I was on good terms with everyone else. I was still depressed but mostly because I was involved in the lives of toxic people whom I completely cut off by April of 2021.

My last day at Wendy’s was on June 20, 2021, and I left for an internship at Raytheon which started a week later on June 28, and I became a permanent employee with them in November. Wendy’s was nice but I’m much happier at Raytheon, and everyone likes me. I also moved out of my mother’s house and into my new apartment at the very end of 2021."

**My Profile:**

Indian Male, Undegrad in Mechanical Engineering from a top 5 Engineering School.

**GPA** \- 8.5/10

**Coursework** which might be relevant to some of the programs I want:

Multivariate Calculus - A

Linear Algebra - A

Analysis and Interpretation of Data - A

Operations research - B

Game theory - A

&amp;#x200B;

**Work experience:** 1 internship as a python dev, 6 months of work-ex in a full time management role (which I quit). Presently I work as a research assistant at a lab in my undergrad uni. Current research is in applied stats to design optimal experiments for mixed populations, might publish this month in a decision science journal. Will continue working in the lab for a few more months and optimistically get a couple more publications in applied stats.

&amp;#x200B;

**GRE -** Q 170 V 167 AWA 4.5

&amp;#x200B;

**Goals:** Work in applied ML, move on to do a PhD in ML/Stats later

&amp;#x200B;

Broadly, these are some of the masters programs I'm considering:

* MS in ML or MCDS - CMU
* MS in Stats or MSc in Analytics - UChicago
* MS in Data Science - UMich
* MS in Data Science - JHU

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what I'd like to know:

Would I qualify for a program in stats, given that my undergrad is not very math heavy? (UChicago for example)

Are there other programs which I can consider that are academically rigorous and give me a decent chance at ML roles?  (For example certain programs in Computational Science or Operations Research)"

v9urbe,1,2022-06-11,[NEED ADVICE] What's expected of me considering where I am at in my life? (Long term unemployed),toosoon247,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/v9urbe/need_advice_whats_expected_of_me_considering/,"Just want to start this off by saying, at the age of 26, I've been unemployed for 5 years and also, I've only worked 6 months in 8 years. I haven't been to university... it'd be an understatement to say I'm in a fucked situation - I don't have a good excuse as to why I have such large unemployment gaps.

I also have some voluntary experience, but in my mind, I consider them null &amp; void because they were at least 2+ years ago and I'm unable to get a reference from them.

I feel like I'm in a constant battle to catch up to where I should be at, at my age. I feel like I'm lagging behind by several years and I need to somehow fast-track myself. However, that is kind of hard.

I want to know, what do I have to do to get from getting rejected from all the opportunities I apply for, to getting offers of interviews for everything I apply for?  How do I become a ‘star candidate’ that is always on top of the list? How do I get myself to have some amazing 'WOW' S.T.A.R scenarios to talk about in interviews?

And will my unemployment gap follow me around for the rest of my life?

Another factor to add to this, is that I've been pretty miserable living at home, I want to move away so bad and I feel so unsettled at the moment, that my existence has been such a bore - at this point I've given up. So, I find it really difficult to mentally commit to a job for more than 3-6 months, this has been the same for 4+ years. To be honest, I've been wanting to dip since I was 16. So, every job I think of or apply for, I always think about when I can quit and use the money saved to move somewhere else and hopefully get a job.

(also, I understand if you say I'm leeching off my family, trust me, I feel guilt from that every day).

What does my CV need to like to enable me to attract employers?

Would short courses help? tbh I'm a tad bit skeptical of how much that plays a factor. What about starting a small business? Are there any statistics out there that show, for example, if I have this, this or this, my chances of getting employed is X%?

How would someone like me gain leadership experiences?

Would university help, even if I want to study Film? Am I too unemployable or too old to get internships? 

Idk if this is relevant but, I want to work, ideally part time hours, 20-35, and pursue other creative endeavors and try to make some money from them. However, I can’t get a job.

Also, this is a mental barrier I struggle with, but working full-time at a shitty job, my imagination suggests it would be soul crushing.

I'm just stumped.- I just want to put this shit behind me man and move on. You don’t understand how frustrating life can be when you have no idea what to do or you have mental barriers in place."

I went through the usual hiring process and was given a temporary contract by the company in February 2022. Everything went well during my first two weeks of employment until someone else came into the picture.

Another applicant received a temporary contract for the same position. Ever since then, my boss and mentor focuses all their efforts on that applicant. I am kept out of the loop regarding work, not given any training and I have to always put in more effort to do my job. I confronted my boss regarding their unequal treatment of me and was told that I will not be keeping my position because people don't like me.

Here are several facts about my situation:

* While my hiring process lasted three months, the other applicants lasted only a week and happened during my employment.
* While I applied for this specific position, the other applicant applied for an internship and was given this position almost instantly,
* This is the first job for both myself and the other applicant, so there is no gap in knowledge and experience between us,
* The job was advertised for only **ONE** person. I came to this position first and the other applicant began working two weeks after my employment.
* I have been commended for my work multiple times by other colleagues, for which my boss asks me to explain why is that happening,
* My boss said that I am an enormous potential and that they don't wanna lose me,
* My boss doesn't want to give me the names of the people that don't like me and simply ignores any response via the official communication channels,
* The other applicant specifically said that they were hired via a connection,
* My boss demeans my work and efforts by calling me a student or an intern, which is not written in my contract,
* I help out the other applicant more than the other applicant helps me,
* The other applicant is given ''ownership'' of various departments and meetings without any knowledge and experience while I am hung out to dry.

I have no idea what to do. I asked numerous people outside work if anything could be done and was told that I should start looking for another job. I was also told that if I tried doing anything about it that my life would be over because my employer would certainly make sure that no one hires me anywhere else.

I want to stand up for myself and fight, but I am also scared for my life. Is there anything I can do about this or is my situation hopeless?"

I’d greatly appreciate some perspective from the outside. In respect of your time, I’ll try to be brief.

I’m at the end of the first year of ESCP’s Master in Management. On paper it’s a [good program](https://rankings.ft.com/rankings/5/masters-in-management-2021), though certainly not on par with more renown names, and I think the school’s brand is mostly recognized in France. In fact, if you’re not French you’ve probably never heard of it.

The school has a few campuses around Europe. The current plan is to spend the second year in London, ideally do an internship there and get a sponsor for a full-time role. Despite Brexit, I still think I should aim for the UK. First, because that’s where most of the roles I’m interested in are. Second, because of language barriers: other than Italian (my mother tongue), I only speak English.

I’m targeting asset management (equities), straight out of school. I’m well aware of the odds, but that’s not what I’m conflicted about. I’ve already made up my mind, and I’ll face the rejections until I get a graduate role or convince some boutique firm to have me. That’s not the point of this post. But the slim odds do play a part in what I’m considering.

Here’s the thing: the current plan has very high costs, both in terms of time and in terms of money. And I’ve found myself wondering: is this really the best I can do with my resources? I don’t have an answer, and there probably isn’t one, but let me briefly go over these two factors.

First, time. Current plan means spending a whole year studying whatever ESCP decides I should study. Now, having first-hand experience of their teaching standards, I know I can learn just as well on my own. In fact, I can do better. What I need to be able to do to be useful to an asset manager is (ultimately) writing stock research pieces. What I’m learning by staying here is tangential at best, sometimes interesting, but mostly irrelevant to my objectives. Meanwhile, I have a list of resources that I *know* I should study and a list of pieces that I *know* I should write but not enough time to do so. In other words, if I could spend the next year on self-study and preparing for interviews, I know I’d be objectively a better candidate in the end.

Second, money. To pay tuition fees and support myself for a year abroad, I took out a loan of €50k. I already paid the first year, so I have about €35k left. Now, London is one of the most expensive cities in the world, and should I go there for a year this money would be quickly wiped out. I picture myself throwing away thousands of euros just to be able to live in a small room half an hour from everything, and it seems stupid. Meanwhile, I could be staying in Italy virtually for free and save the money to repay (part of) the debt early. This assumes dropping out of the program, of course. I’d have a debt for no real reason, but a much smaller one. More importantly, that’s pretty much the definition of a sunk cost, and sunk costs are irrelevant.

So, assuming I go ahead with the current plan, what do I get in exchange for the time and the money? A piece of paper that says I graduated from ESCP. A name on a resume, basically. And I’d have two degrees instead of one. Plus the network of the school. That’s it. The plan is only worth it if these things collectively manage to make finding a job in asset management way easier than in the alternative case. But I’m not at all sure how the two options compare in this regard.

The school doesn’t seem particularly well connected with the industry outside of France. I’m under the impression, perhaps mistakenly, that no investment company will really care that I went to ESCP.  And if that’s the case, then the name is worth to me just as much as that of whatever public university. However, said investment company might care that I do not have a master’s degree. Dropping out, I’d only have: (i) a bachelor’s in economics with overall unimpressive grades which took me more time than needed to complete (long story); (ii) a somewhat irrelevant 6-month internship in management control; (iii) a quite relevant internship at a major asset manager which I will do this summer. There’d be gaps in my cv, and my odds would get worse. But how much worse? I’d be an unknown graduate, but I already am, so what?

There are other things to consider, but I’ll stop here. Thank you for reading.

**TL;DR: Completing master’s program vs dropping out, saving the money, putting the time to better use and going all-in with what I have.**"

I’m a second year student in university, currently recovering from an incredibly stressful web development project for my web dev class. I generally dislike web development for it’s idiosyncrasies, but I love programming nonetheless. However, I feel like my opportunities for progressing through the software industry will be severely limited by my aversion towards web development. All of my peers with internships have received them through FAANG or web focused companies, whereas opportunities for  non web dev positions seem a lot more scarce for someone in my position with my experience.

I would like to know if my perception of web dev being the main “in” for most people in the industry is truly valid, and what types of positions are common for people like me in non web dev domains, who has not had industry experience.

For reference, I love tinkering with my arduino doing small embedded systems projects, and creating small games and the interesting programming problems that come with them. I might be the only person in the universe who actually doesn’t mind practicing Leetcode questions. I’ve most enjoyed taking a systems programming class working in C with UNIX.

1 month in, I was getting job offers and messages from headhunters - likely due to the great resignations. Had to turn them down, as a full time Masters student. 

However, oversight on my end, my full time Masters require a minimum 10 week internship to graduate. However if I filed to be a part time student, I can skip the internship whole and even have a change to look for a full time job.

Reason why I am pursuing my Masters is to be better at some subject matters which I never had formal education and I found it necessary at work to advance. And also to expand my network. Lastly, to take a break from work and embrace student life. I do not plan on switching go a completely new industry. 

Now I have another full time offer knocking at my door. However I have not been active looking for jobs. My CV shows a 6 months gap.

I am unsure if I should just take the job, try it out and also skip internship. 

Unsure what to do. 

Need advise."

However, after digging in for context you have tons of people (the posters) who are doing a career switch with no formal education, people who done bootcamps, data science masters (which has a pretty bad reputation?), awful resumes, and not having CITIZENSHIP.

What about all the people who did a masters/PhD in stats, math, CS, ML, etc (straight from undergrad)? People who have citizenship, went to a top school, and internships+research experience in ML/AI. I know finding an internship is hard, but is that also as bad as people make it out to be if you're at a target school (mit,stanford,berkley, gatech, CMU,etc). ALSO im talking about degrees that aren't online. In person where you are actually doing research/making connections.

I mainly put the emphesis on citizenship because there is a large amount of people in grad school that are internationals (and companies don't want to sponser h1-b's). And there has been a declining rate of Americans entering grad school just because its a pretty bad ROI."

I've always aced my computer classes (Scratch, HTML, BASIC, Javascript, Arduino Robotics) in my highschool years, but only to the extent of the class activities, like solving fun computer puzzles, &amp; not anything theoretical. 

**Despite my studies in an engineering discipline, could I still get internships at a tech company &amp; eventually break into the tech industry? Should I reevaluate my career path?**

I'm maximizing my summer by indulging myself in the Tech Industry and I believe that Data Analysis is the career path for me.

I watched the entire Crash Course: Computer Science series on YouTube &amp; I'm also reading books related to programming &amp; computing.

My mom thought that I would “outgrow” it and took me off meds and that’s when everything became harder for me but I didn’t realize it was because of my ADHD and the lack of treatment. I only took them in highschool after that.  The times I wasn’t on medication o struggled so much to focus on even the basic things in school and would get bad grades. In college I still didn’t do as good as I could have but I got by with good enough grades to graduate even though I had trouble with starting tasks.  I managed to get an internship and graduate so I didn’t think I needed the meds anymore. Fast forward one year later and after the isolation due to the pandemic and  my life is literally in shambles. I have trouble socializing with people to the point that I struggle having basic conversations. I tried working at a call center for a year but it was so hard to keep up with the metrics that even when I tried so hard to meet them for a month I failed to pass them. I eventually got a new job at a startup only to be fired two days later due to me not being able to perform to their expectations and attendance. So now I don’t have a job, I spend most of my days looking for a job and sitting in bed trying to find motivation to network or just do more useful things around the house for myself. I feel like I am in a freeze response at this point. I even struggle to cook properly as I burned myself like 3 times. Even after all this my mom still thinks that ADHD isnt that big of an issue that I need real help or medication and things that getting sugar placebo pills from overseas will “cure” me. I’m struggling to even schedule my first appointment at this point do to me being nervous and the costs.  My mom still doesn’t want me to schedule it but I think I’m going to anyway because I NEED to fix my life, and I’m going to move forward with it without her

Edit: She also tells me not to take meds because their “drugs” and I can’t take them when I’m pregnant and I’ll have a hard time?? Like I’m not having a hard time right now??! I don’t know what she’s thinking but that’s the last thing I ever would want to do."

- they hold over my head how much money they spent on me as a child and constantly say “you will never be able to repay us for how much we have spent on you”
- I was SAd by my neighbor when I was 6 and they said “there was nothing for them to even look at”
- I was SAd by my brother but it was ignored for years because he was autistic
- my mother died when I was 17 and I was told to “get over it and go back to work” because I needed to graduate highschool two weeks later and go to college
- the community raised money for me to help pay for college and they put stipulations on how much money I could receive each semester depending on my “attitude, grades, effort to be a part of the family, behavior, etc.” which caused me to have to go further into debt 
- I got a boyfriend during the summer before college and they did not approve as he was not of high enough socioeconomic status and I drove home to meet his family so they took my car
- they constantly told me he was going to leave and /or cheat on me
- told me he would never be able to support us, yet he would send me food because I was so poor the only thing I could afford to eat was plain noodles and salt
- refused to let me stay with any family for the summer, I had to stay in a storage unit - which is illegal - and walk to work every day because that was all I could afford
- took items of my mothers (including her phone which had many valuable texts and images) and gave it away to someone who wiped it completely before I got a chance to get anything off of it
- tried to sabotage my living arrangements and jobs and internships
- demanded that I give them the extra money I received from loans and scholarships every year which put me into more financial stress

Etc. Etc. 

When I shared these things with a therapist she told me that my family was abusive and controlling and that I should speak with them about it. When I went to speak with them about it they claimed that she was trying to separate me from my family and refused to let me go back. 

And at the end of it all, when I went to graduate college, they made a huge post on Facebook claiming that my success was all of their doing. They claimed they got the jobs and internships for me, which is completely false as well as continuing to pretend that they supported me financially and mentally throughout the years. 

But thankfully, 10 years later I’m married and have finally gone completely no contact."

CSC369 (operating sysytems), csc320(visual computing), mat246(Concepts in abstract math), CSC311 (Intro to ML) and MAT334( complex variables). 

I was planning on doing either csc301 (intro to software engineering) or csc309(Web programming) in addition to these 5 for being useful in the industry. (Tried getting a paid internship this summer but did not get it. Instead I have an unpaid internship that is not very good. Not learning much). 

I might also be doing some kinda part time work/work study/ research over the year. 

I know csc301 and csc309 are useful ""big project"" classes that are gonna be useful in my resume. I don't think I can drop any of my other classes cuz I wanna finish up degree reqs. 

So is csc301/csc309 birdy enough to handle with 5 other courses and a part time work? I searched online about csc301 and it seems to be purely project based with a 45% project or sm. 

I have pretty much given up on a ""college life"" lol so I don't mind not having time to explore or whatever. (I'm boring anyways) I also do care about my GPA in case I go do a masters or sm. 

Thanks for your advice!"

vaf2sg,12,2022-06-12,Will commuting by bus limit me?,claCyber,udub,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/vaf2sg/will_commuting_by_bus_limit_me/,"Hi all,

I am an intern at UW from overseas. I'm currently living near Seattle Children's hospital and I'm working full time at the campus (9am-5pm). I usually take the bus to reach my department in approx 10 minutes, sometimes I return home on foot in 30 minutes. I'm in a furnished room with private bath, Airbnb style.

I will have to stay at UW until October and by next month almost all people I met here will leave, so I decided to move out from my current place and look for an homestay family starting from July to have a safe place to live and some people to talk with every day.

I found an available family with a big house, I would still have my private bath and meals included.

The only problem I'm thinking about is that this place is about 30 minutes from campus on bus line 75. I would like to join some RSOs to do some summer sports such as hiking and biking. Do you think living 30 minutes from campus would limit me if I wanted to do these activities?

In addition I'm willing to go the gym 2-3 times a week.

What is your opinion about this?"

We made a Javascript full stack app. Out of 6 team members, 3 didn't even know basic development.   


I did 98% of all the development. I made the entire frontend and backend. But somehow, 4 people got selected (2 out of them did not write **a single line of code** and the other two just made **one React component** each.   


I'm not ashamed to tell that I cried when these results came out. If you're going to put soooo much effort and someone else who doesn't deserve it gets it all, what's the point of even doing it?   


PS: My team mates are now in the company office doing their internships and when I see their instagram stories, I can't sleep over the fact that I was wayyyy more deserving than they were."

vaft8e,13,2022-06-12,Columbia CS vs UC Berkeley CS,xRockstar__,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/vaft8e/columbia_cs_vs_uc_berkeley_cs/,"Hi, got into both Columbia and UC Berkeley as a community college transfer and will be majoring in Computer science. Already got an apartment and chose classes at Berkeley for Fall already

**About me**: age 23. From a poor family, first-gen. Older brothers dropped out of high school. Sold an e-commerce and software business last year. And sold small media businesses and 2 B2B iOS apps prior to that. Currently running a media/data biz and personal investment biz.

**Goals:** Might do an MBA later or MS in Management at either Stanford, Harvard, MIT, Wharton, Columbia, Oxford, or Cambridge. I will continue running the main biz and personal investment biz after graduating. I will likely move to a lower tax area which will save 400k -+1mil in taxes each year after graduating

**Berkeley:** Graduate in 1-1.5 years (7 classes needed to graduate); Can spend more focused time on doing things I really like. Less likely I will lose momentum

* Cost: \~$50k in-state
* An hour away from home
* My younger sibling will be a freshman and live with me rent-free. Substantially lowering their cost and easing their transition.

**Columbia:** Graduate in 2.5-3 years. A lot more classes are needed. I will probably lose momentum/ get distracted and start applying for internships

* Cost: 3 yr cost \~$190k
* Prestige factor
* A smaller student body
* Living in NYC would be pretty cool
* Any other pros that I’m not thinking of?

Is Columba (mainly prestige factor) worth 2 years of my life? 20% of the time in my 20s? I could spend that time fully focused on working and do an MBA/MS later if I want. 70% of strangers I talk to say Columbia but they don’t really know me nor my situation. I don’t want to tell everyone I ask about my situation."
vafzh2,21,2022-06-12,Parents restrict my education,iwanttodieallday_,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/vafzh2/parents_restrict_my_education/,"17F, South Asian, CA
I know this probably sounds out of the blue to a lot of people I guess, since almost all Asian Parents are beyond fixated and probably obsessed with their child being a complete genius and taking multiple AP and honor courses and getting good grades, getting internships and into prestigious summer programs and getting into top colleges/well-ranked colleges, etc. Things like that, in regards to education/academics. Every-time I look on this sub if there’s a post about academics it’s always about being pressured to do too much and being burnt out. If one’s parents here are a complete and obsessive tiger parents, mine are like the complete opposite lol. They do not let me pursue more advanced courses and stuff, I don’t even know how to formulate my words for this idea but I hope some of you all can understand. I’m in highschool but I’ve not even taken a single honors class or AP class because of my parents. They don’t let me, and they constantly use my dropping/fluctuating grades(which half of the times is because of them) and etc against me. 

I don’t know how to put it out, like express this in words. They(esp my dad) blatantly voice out how dumb I am and constantly pressure me to not take any other activities because “what I’m doing is enough” and “we don’t want you to be overwhelmed” and “no stress”, amongst other phrases. To give you all a picture of my life, I’m just holed up in my room all day. I mean it’s summer break but usually I’m not allowed to do anything. If I’ve expressed that I want to take an honors class or some sort of accelerated class then they push it down right away and it turns into a screaming match where they interrogate me on how it’ll benefit my life and why I even want to take it and a lot of how dumb I am, for so long sometimes, and in the end I’ve always been told that “unless it goes through me then fuck off” or “unless I approve of it you cannot do it” and things like that. I finished junior year with not having done a single honors course or AP course. They didn’t allow me to take it, pressuring me like that. I ended up taking the easiest classes, and even then struggled to maintain my grades simply because of home problems. Of course I worked hard and really did do my best, and I was able to maintain good grades in the ending part of the school year but like :( it sucks to see all my classmates and other people challenging themselves, knowing that I’m not even allowed to do it. I wasn’t recommended for any AP sciences by my teacher either(i took physio) and so I have to take regular physics next year. When the math and science recommendation letters from the teachers were sent out to parents a couple of months ago he was so mad. He got so mad over me taking physics and was getting so mad about why I couldn’t just retake physio again since I was obviously going to fail physics. I remember at one point after all that screaming he asked me to spell physics to see “how smart you are”, i was so nervous I could messed up on the last two letters, and it went downhill from there. My mom was watching and listening. He told me that he wanted me to fail, and whatnot, but tbh that’s usually what’s said in the heat of a moment so. But if I want to take a summer math class or a class afterschool or some sort of accelerated class whether it be at or outside of school, they refuse and I end up not being allowed to take it. There’s no need for me to take it, apparently, and there’s no extra value added, and I am fine the way things are right now. I don’t know how to express it. My education is restricted, that’s the best I can say it. I want to take honor classes, I want to learn math and science at an accelerated pace I want to be able to take AP classes and I genuinely enjoy learning things in class and my school has good teacher, but I can’t. And I know it directly affects my future so much. Letting all this out makes me want to cry, I can only think of the miserable future I’ll have when im older. I can’t even get accepted into a part time job, and I’ve been sending applications since last December, and my schedule is completely free. I don’t have any qualifications. They expect me to get into a state college/go to community college and constantly express that, and with others constantly remark on how dumb I am and all their low expectations because “in the end it depends on the child themself”. Next year I’m taking CalcAB, so that’s the only AP class. At first they tried to fight against it, and my counselor told them some course called Applied Mathematics could be a choice, I guess they don’t care right now since they have something else going on. 

I feel that such an academic life has affected and will probably affect my life really badly. I know I live in the US so I have a lot more opportunities, but please just think of it from my perspective. Everyone at my school is a complete genius/very motivated/very passionate about something or very talented, but with this kind of academic life it makes it even harder for me to stand out. During AP exam season it was so embarrassing for me to go to school everyday and I couldn’t swallow the fact that I really was dumb that I couldn’t take any advanced classes. It’s so embarrassing to say that in front of your classmates(even more so in front of all my classmates who are literally die-hard-studious-straight A-genius Asian classmates, like my entire school is literally just East Asia and South Asia, seeing a white black or latino kid is like seeing an Asian kid in a rural town in the middle of nowhere in Nebraska or South Dakota). I ended up just lying about the classes I took to others and playing it off about the AP tests I was “taking” and being interested in knowing what their tests were about. So embarrassing and pitiful, but it really did hurt me. I can’t even do any afterschool sports because they’re so stingy on me being anywhere outside the house. But I’m so sad about this, because it’s hard to see everyone excelling in their academic lives while I can’t even do that. My younger sister and brother are allowed to do so much more. I know I still have a long life ahead of me but this feels like the end of the world. I’m not saying I’m dumb but I really wish I had more academic freedom. Feels like they’re doing it on purpose."
vag1qq,1,2022-06-12,Personality development / value system,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/vag1qq/personality_development_value_system/,"Hi everyone,

I'm a high schooler (17F) thinking about what values to have and how to present myself to be more likeable.

First: I don't know what values to have. As a child, I used to want to have a committed relationship when I was older, and I wanted to quit my job for domestic work because I didn't see the joy of education and a career. Now, as a teen, I find that I am more liberal in terms of my views on sex. I don't want kids when I'm older, only want to marry maybe later in life, and I want to explore all my sexual kinks and casual sex-oriented desires in my mid-twenties before jumping into a committed relationship. However, being raised in a conservative family, I am confused as to if I am a pervert or something for thinking this. I don't want to be labeled a whore, (as I actually am now -- many people at my school refer to me as the ""class whore"" even though I haven't had sex with anyone at my school yet). In terms of career, I want to actually keep working because I'm falling in love with the field I plan to pursue. I got an internship in the field and I'm loving it. I don't know what to do or think about my future. What sounds best to me is casual sex + career but my family is leaning towards marriage + kids + *maybe* career. Also, since I'm young right now, my focus is on studies. My motto is ""career before dick"" always, but I don't know if dick is even a good thing to be thinking about right now. Basically I want to know how to act in college -- should I hook up with whoever (safely, of course) or pursue a relationship with the forethought of getting into a long-term relationship? And how do I approach the idea of having kids? Presently, I don't see kids as anything but a burden; no vacations, no sex, large amounts of money spent, etc. My family says I need people to take care of me when I'm older and kids and marriage will be great for that. My family says couples without kids or single people don't have friends past 30 years old. Is this true?

Second: Because of COVID, I have become an introvert and I don't like it. I am extremely socially awkward and have no friends anymore. I have always been open about sexual topics, and people told me that my dirty jokes were funny. Now, those same sex jokes are apparently ""too much"" for some people around me. Do you think I should find new people to surround myself with or try to be less explicit? I have lost many friends after COVID for being ""too weird."" I don't know what the pandemic has done to the same people that liked my dirty jokes before. Also, any other tips to be more socially likeable and get more friends? Also, how do I get people to be interested in me romantically/sexually?

Sorry if I sound desperate or stupid or immature. It's probably because I am all those things. It's late at night and I've been feeling sad over my social-emotional situation, and I want things to change. As evidenced by this post, I'm very unclear and messy about my feelings about my life. Sorry if this post was hard to understand. Frankly, it was confusing to write. My feelings and thoughts are all over the place. As such, I'd really appreciate some solid advice about how to approach life. Thank you."

Terms of Sale:

Refund Policy: I am not obligated to issue a refund under any circumstance once a code has been sent unless the code does not work as advertised. Buyer mistake(s) do not constitute grounds for a refund. This includes, but is not limited to, already owning the title, purchasing a code for the wrong platform, and not adhering to notes associated with a code (i.e. do NOT click iTunes).

Code Redemption: You may not use any code purchased here on any site other than those associated with your purchase. Doing so will result in me requesting you pay the listed price of the second use of the code, and refusal to do so will result in a report to the mods of this subreddit. Any points or other bonuses associated with a code are not included with your purchase unless specified in the post.

""Should Port/Upgrade To 4K"" Codes: I make no guarantees regarding 4K ports/upgrades. If a code that should port/upgrade to 4K does not do so, I will direct you to the relevant support team. I can, in most cases, provide any photo(s) of the code insert and/or Blu-ray upon request if needed for a support team. I will only provide a refund if I cannot produce them upon request when needed for a support team.

Payment/Fees: I accept only USD through Venmo and PayPal Friends &amp; Family (F&amp;F). I do not cover any fee(s) associated with any purchase(s). I require that the buyer pays before I send the code(s). When paying through PayPal, do not pay with Goods &amp; Services (G&amp;S) or with funds not from your PayPal wallet/linked bank account (i.e. credit/debit/pre-paid card, etc.). Doing so may result in a fee from PayPal. I do not accept eChecks. Failure to adhere to this rule may result in a loss of funds. I typically issue a partial refund in this case because PayPal charges fees that I cannot fully refund without losing money.

Transaction Etiquette/Timely Contact: I do not get immediate notifications for chats or comments. I check posts when I get the chance. I respond to messages as soon as I am aware of them, but please do not expect quick replies. I will interpret 'interested in' as a request to purchase the title unless you also make an inquiry. I also require that all price negotiation be conducted in the comments in accordance with [Rule 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalCodeSELL/wiki/index/rules#wiki_4._proper_transaction_etiquette): ""All discussions/negotiations about a potential exchange must be made via comments.""

Dual Redeems/Splits: I can check any code upon request and provide a for-sure answer as to whether or not it is a dual redeem/split. Otherwise, assume all codes are dual redeems/splits."
vaglu1,1,2022-06-12,Need help on how to negotiate for hybrid work after a job offer,patroney,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/vaglu1/need_help_on_how_to_negotiate_for_hybrid_work/,"On Thursday a company I was interviewing for reached out to me with a job offer. This would be my first full-time job since I just recently graduated and while the job posting was listed as On-Site, I'm hesitating to sign the offer letter documents as I realized that I want a hybrid work schedule with at least 2 or even 1 day of WFH.

On the day I received the offer letter, one of the interviewers called me soon after to tell me the news and during that phone call, I tried negotiating for a higher salary or a sign-on bonus with no prevail. I wanted to ask if I could have 4 weeks of PTO instead of the 3 they were offering, but I didn't know if that was right to ask. (Is it wrong to ask for that if a hybrid schedule isn't possible?)

During both interviews, both my interviewers reiterated that the position was on-site and I responded by saying that was doable. I'm new to this whole negotiating thing and since this is my first potential full-time job with benefits, I don't want to say the wrong things that could potentially jeopardize this opportunity.

My offer letter expires later today at 5:00PM and I'm unsure of what to do. Should I try to negotiate with them now or later?

Edit: Previously, I was a full-time contractor for 9 months at a pretty good sized financial technology company with a couple of part time jobs and internships sprinkled in. Not sure if that could or would of helped"
vagrmr,6,2022-06-12,Asking for advice as a graduating IT student,sumbungan_ng_hatdog,phcareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/phcareers/comments/vagrmr/asking_for_advice_as_a_graduating_it_student/,"Hi! IT student po ako mula sa isang kilalang university at nag-oOJT ako ngayon sa isang company as a QA intern. Compared sa mga iba kong kaibigan, nagregress na coding skills ko dahil matagal na akong hindi nakapag-program. Learned C, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, PHP and SQL pero mostly basic lang. Hindi rin malaki ang naretain kong knowledge sa past subjects ko dahil di rin ako makasabay sa teaching styles ng mga prof. Dahil dito, natatakot ako na baka hindi na ako magiging employable enough para sa mga companies. 

Aside sa pag-aaral ulit ng programming, ano pong dapat kong gawin o dapat na aralin para maging competent enough at sa makapasok IT industry? Tried following youtube crash courses pero hindi sya para sakin. Any advice would help. Maraming salamat!"

I am a Data Science major, and would like to take CS 189, then CS 182. I have taken Data 140, Stat 135, Data C102, Data 144, and Data 101 prior to these classes. I will try to avoid Sahai at all costs. These classes will be taken two different semesters with one other tech and two breath classes. Is there anything I should watch out for? How is 189/182 in comparison to CS 188?

Thank you for any help. The reason behind this choice is because I had an internship last sem, got a return offer, and learned sparse neural nets were a core part of their work. Plus the topics of these classes looked more interesting than the stats classes I was going to take in place of them."

But the problem is that there are no entry-level roles ( and no internships ) for DE in my country. All the positions are for people with 1+ years of experience.  So please help me with the following things: 

1. What should I learn first? I already know Python, SQL, and a bit of data analysis and I'm also good at web dev. 
2. Since there are no opportunities for entry-level DE, can I start to freelance in this space like web scraping, data extraction, and automation?
3. I have an internship opportunity of working in the backend ( Node Js ), so is it worth taking it, if data engineering is my goal and since I don't have any DE internship at the moment?

vanpcx,57,2022-06-12,Can you make Tetris?,dota2nub,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/vanpcx/can_you_make_tetris/,"So I did a 9 month internship with little development stuff (was mostly working on some form templates) and I did a small Java course before starting my CS degree.

I study 60% and work 60% now and am nearing the end of my second semester. (So a bachelor's will take me 4 years)

Last weekend I had three days off and figured I felt like I actually knew enough now to build something. I started work on making a Tetris clone.

After three days of wrangling with index out of bounds exceptions, drawing tetris blocks and figuring out all the logic without looking it up I was left with a working playable Tetris game. To make it a bit harder and to get better at what my company does I wrote it in Cobol, which we use at work, so that was an additional difficulty.

I'm quite proud of this little milestone.

Where are you at in your programming journey? Can you make a tetris game without following a tutorial? I know that half a year ago this would've seemed way too daunting for me. It's nice to see that I'm making progress."

vapj3c,3,2022-06-12,Considering a MS CS Program as a mechanical graduate.,Forward-Currency-831,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/vapj3c/considering_a_ms_cs_program_as_a_mechanical/,"Hey guys. Hope you are doing well.

I am a 2020 Graduate with a Bachelors in mechanical engineering. Coming from India, My University (SRM) is ranked in the second tier, but nevertheless I believe it is somewhat decent (at least among the private universities). Here's a brief overview of my profile:

* Prior to my first full time role, I did an intern as a research assistant at DRDO for about 2 months My First full time role was at an oil and gas company where i worked about for 6 months. However, I have always had an interest in machine learning/AI ever since I undertook an elective (Neural networks) during my 6th semester. I quit my job in may 2021 and took the effort to learn python and related libraries required for ML work. Got into a service company after a couple of months since i had no luck with the startups. Here in my current job, I've finally been assigned to the AI/ML team albeit still not fully into ML, I am involved in automation processes using java. So my total work experience sums up to 1 year 2 months.
* Have two Research publications.
* My CGPA is 7.8 and it's 83.05%
* Have done a lot of extracurriculars (Event organizations, Won the best presentations etc). The most significant one was winning a national event for a project built and exhibited on an AI (CNN) based bot.
* I have not given the GRE yet. However, I do aim for a 320+ and 105+ in the TOEFL.
* Have done online certification courses related to programming in MATLAB and python. Not so much so on ML libraries and deep learning (depended more on YT videos).

I have chosen to do either the MS CS or MS AI as all the electives line up with my interest (Machine learning).

Now a few questions:

*(1) Is there anyone out there who got into MS CS or MS AI at northeastern coming from a non CS background like me?*

*(2) Does my profile stand a chance to get into these two programs?*

*(3) I have seen the Align MS CS, But I feel it's more expensive and I am fairly comfortable with the prerequisite concepts of the align courses. But for the sake of getting admissions, is it a more safer option (though a bit more expensive)?*"
vasc9v,0,2022-06-12,What are the chances my employer will allow my manager to sign my internship placement form so I can get college credit for having an internship?,danielr088,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vasc9v/what_are_the_chances_my_employer_will_allow_my/,I recently started my summer CS internship at an insurance company. My school requires us to have an internship in order to graduate (basically youre enrolled into a course and you give a final presentation of what you worked on at your internship) I asked my manager if he could sign it and he said he’s willing to do it but he just doesn’t know the policy so he’s going to reach out to HR and get back to me. But I’m kinda worried HR might just say no. Does anyone else have experience with this or know what the possibility is that they’ll sign it?
vask4o,1,2022-06-12,Best way to set myself up for the next steps in CS?,Spartan098,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/vask4o/best_way_to_set_myself_up_for_the_next_steps_in_cs/,"To give some context, I recently switched majors into CS from business this past spring semester. It was the spring of my junior year, which means I’ll be entering my 4th year this fall. However, because of the change, I’ll probably have to take a 5th year to complete the degree due to not having taken any CS classes before this.

I did have some AP credits from high school in CS, and all my gen eds are done since I’ve been in college for 3 years now. I’m currently also taking DS&amp;A right now in the summer, to get myself ahead and advance my degree.

My question is, how can I best set myself up for future internships and a career? I would love to one day enter into FAANG or something equivalent. I’m just not sure when to start everything, such as when to start Leetcode, when to apply, and what specific type of projects I should be working on.

So far I’ve only learned Java, but I’ve completed my school’s advanced class for it so I have a decent understanding. 

Thank you!"

I don't know but recently, one of my senior frds getting really hard time getting any internship or job for like 6m and the senior actually taught me all, he got me interested, now he itself is being in this situation where he can't get a internship even do he has way more experience and projects and skills /tools etc then also it kinda fears me..
Like should I drop the plan, bec I don't were Is there any hype or demand in this or just its glimmer ? Or its all ment for international terms, u know like, feels odd like how will it end so don't but just got scared and kinda had the data science things aside and got in web dev build it but can't find my self into it, I don't am I just over thinking or just what all this feel?

Next month I am also gonna get a internship and like feels to avoid the data science part even after learning it, is there any internship or job active open for Noob like me, that really confusing for tbh

Like if someone to share words of wisdom and experience, help in need."

And 2 of these (December 2019 - May 2020 and January 2020 - August 2020) were like group internships (we worked as a team of 5 on a specific project for the company). And another one was from June 2020 - August 2020.  


Well as you can see the dates overlap for these internships and I'm confused if I should leave them as they are (above dates are the ones on the internship completion certificates too) or change them to something like December 2019 - February 2020, March 2020 - June 2020 and June 2020 - August 2020. 

Second question, I've been using bold on the technologies I have on my resume. For example: Reduced backend crashes by 20% by designing a monitoring script using **Python** and **Psycopg2** that mails transaction reports every day to preemptively identify write failures and crashes (this is a sample bullet point). Should I use bold or avoid it? Personally, I think if the reviewer spends just a few seconds the bold font is useful, otherwise they might find it annoying."

As the title states, I wanted to ask you guys about how you find CS programs. By CS programs, I'm referring to programs like Google's Summer of Code or Codepath (I'm not sure if there's a better way to word them). I've only started finding them out recently as a rising Senior by browsing this subreddit or LinkedIn, but I wish I could have found them sooner as some of these programs are only for Freshmen or Sophomores. I feel like there's a lot to learn from these programs and they help open more doors of opportunity. 

I've been trying to find more of these just by googling, but I usually come up short. I was hoping there was maybe a github repo similar to the pittcs summer internships that has a comprehensive list of these programs. Would greatly appreciate your input on this.

vawzhn,4,2022-06-12,Finance-related jobs? Career advice for dealing with SA in office job?,bestieharem,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/vawzhn/financerelated_jobs_career_advice_for_dealing/,"Hey y’all, so I’m someone who’s struggled with pretty severe SA her entire life and it’s only gotten worse over time. Medications that have worked for me lost their effectiveness pretty quickly so now I’m having to accept that I’ll probably have to cope with SA throughout my career. 

I’m a finance major about to graduate in a year. Currently in a management-focused internship and just completed onboarding week… whew. All the other interns are socially skilled extroverts and despite my best effort speaking up in meetings and trying to talk to them, it’s clear I don’t fit in. I’m super apprehensive because I met my manager/team as well over a virtual happy hour and it was excruciatingly awkward. I’m worried that with me lacking people skills, even good work and an upbeat attitude may not lead to me getting a return offer.

I’m wondering if any of y’all have found corporate jobs related to finance/business that you were successful in? Is there any role or line of work you found where you were able to survive and thrive despite bad SA? I’m mentally preparing myself for the possibility that I don’t get a return offer and have to start job-hunting this fall. Not sure which entry-level roles are the most appropriate to target. Beyond that, any tips/tricks for making yourself liked/accepted in the office and maintaining professional relationships? Being successful as an intern with SA who can’t rely on personality/social skills to stand out?

Thanks a bunch!"
vax9cz,9,2022-06-12,Entry-level jobs for severe social anxiety?,bestieharem,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/vax9cz/entrylevel_jobs_for_severe_social_anxiety/,"Hi y’all, I’m a rising college senior majoring in finance with pretty severe social anxiety disorder. I’ve tried pretty much everything- medications, therapy, a ton of exposure to social situations- to no avail. Right now I’m having to accept this is probably something I’ll have to deal with throughout my future career. 

I know finance is a field where “people skills” are crucial and I’ve had difficulties at past internships despite being super upbeat/friendly and trying to connect with other people… because I just come across so awkward. I can’t rely on my personality or being well-liked to give me an edge in interviews or on the job. I’m wondering if there’s anyone who’s been in the same boat but managed to find a job/career path suitable for them? Whether it is in finance or an adjacent field. Any tips for being successful in the corporate environment with SA would be appreciated as well. Thanks!"

Sunt anul 1 si am avut norocul sa prind un post de intern la o firma destul de mare de mobile-development. Postul e pe iOS development in SwiftUI.

Sunt curios daca sunt oameni pe aici care lucreaza in SwiftUI si sa aud niste pareri: merita sa merg in directia asta/imi pierd vremea/e ok dar nu in Romania etc.

I've recently accepted an offer to intern at Esri for the summer of 2022. When I inquired about housing, I found it odd that they directed me to a hotel that charges $75 per night.

vb32d3,13,2022-06-12,Would it be stupid to transfer to UBC CS?,bobthetitan7,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/vb32d3/would_it_be_stupid_to_transfer_to_ubc_cs/,"Long post here, I am finishing up my second year in math here at uw (finished 2A, on coop) and I received an offer to transfer to UBC Vancouver for CS. This has really been weighing down on me and I thought I should get some second opinions here from some fellow students. 

Some background:

Attended UW math because I wanted to be a quant / finance bro, realized work condition is shit and got matched with a cs coop for my first coop (knew how to program, did not like it much in hs and did not consider doing cs until then). Really got to like the work life balance, and the problem solving I got to do on the jobs and decided to maybe try it out some more. Second and third coop (ongoing) also related to SWE. Since then I have really wanted to transfer to CS/DS but my grades are FAR from the cutoff (low 80s CAV).

I am not exactly unhappy doing math, it is more like a job at this point where I have simply hustle myself to finish the work and live my life, but everytime I help my friends with their cs assignments, or talk with my cs friends about course selection, I am a little jealous internally because I am simply restricted from taking those courses. I kind of feel like a second class citizen here not being able to take most cs courses and I have heard people talk behind me as the ""smart cs reject"" which honestly rubs me the wrong way. I really enjoy what I am doing at the job (compiler/api ish stuff) and have even consider cs grad school / research after undergrad. I am planning on majoring in CO or CM and just cruise through the degree, the math courses are pretty easy to me and I honestly do just enough to get 80s to keep my CAV up for exchange. But I feel like I am wasting my time learning about extremely abtract concepts that would require outside studying to be applicable to my field of employment. I am really interested about learning about the stuff I work on at work and have found myself interested in alot of the upper year cs electives (distributed computing, concurrency, computer vision, etc) . I feel like I would be happier studying CS but honestly, uni took alot of the fun out of math for me so I honestly don't know if my assumption will hold up. I feel like I have already gotten most of the benefit from coop, gotten my dream internship and have a pretty good track to eventual fte in us. 

At this point, is it worth transferring to ubc for my so called ""academic enjoyment""? ofc, I know that is a question only I can answer and place on my internal scale but I want to hear your thoughts. I also have a few questions that I am unclear about that I will throw out there. 

\- Does the uw rep really matter after I get my first job?

\- Can I do a cs master from a math undergrad? is it significantly harder than from a cs background?

I know there is a skew of other factors that goes into this (social, family, etc.) but worry not, as those are things I will consider and factor in myself. 

Thanks and cheers"
vb3o8s,0,2022-06-13,History vs Computer Science vs Information Systems,spccoop,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/vb3o8s/history_vs_computer_science_vs_information_systems/,"I was fortunately admitted as a transfer to an Ivy for the last 2y of my undergrad and need to decide what I will major in. I’m looking to go into IB and have already placed for my junior summer internship (top group at a mid-tier BB IB) and so the value-add of transferring is hypothetically found in potential IB-&gt;PE transitions and b-school admissions. With this said, because I want to be able to go full-time with the group I'll intern with next summer, it's also imperative I graduate on time, and so I'll have to fit my remaining general university requirements and all major requirements into two years (four semesters) of study.

I am considering three different majors to accomplish the ends of placing well in PE and b-school:

Computer Science - 37 points (+remaining generals) in 2 years
Pros: deep level understanding of software, rigorous coursework, area of genuine personal interest
Cons: rigorous coursework, high per-semester point load, lowest expected  GPA

History - 26-33 points (+remaining generals) in 2 years
Pros: shortest major, low-moderate course difficulty, humanities major opens doors to EA MBA programs and provides better story (maybe?) for MBA admissions, highest expected GPA
Cons: ""soft"" perception when compared to finance or CS, no connections to tech

Information Science - 33 points (+remaining generals) in 2 years
Pros: interdisciplinary major which is technically a subsection of CS, exposure to tech/software backends, relatively low # of credits, moderate course difficulty
Cons: ""JV"" perception when compared to CS, worry as to whether it will carry same weight when interviewing at tech PE shops

For those who have gone through the IB-&gt;PE transition and MBA recruiting process, I'd love to hear your thoughts/advice on what will allow me to optimize for admissions and placement. 

Also, I’m copying/editing the post from a finance specific forum which is why parts may seem incongruent."
vb3xtc,2,2022-06-13,Class Pairing Recommendation,tomtom6400,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/vb3xtc/class_pairing_recommendation/,"Hi all,

I’m a currently full-time actuarial analyst doing predictive analytics work and I’m about to start the OSU program next week. I’ve talked to my advisor briefly about my plan but I wanted to get some feedbacks here. 

I’m aiming for big tech internships or full-time position (probably a long shot) next Summer. I’ve done around 500 leetcode problems since the beginning of this year. While I’m pretty comfortable with coding problems, I don’t have much projects to include in my resume (I have a personal project written in Java that kinda demonstrates my data structure knowledge but it’s pretty lousy tbh). 

With that said, I want to take courses that include projects asap so I can add them to my resume. Here’s my current plan. 

Note that I’ve already taken 161, 225, 271, and 261 equivalents at a CC.

Summer 22
CS162 - Intro to Comp Sci II
CS361 - SE1

Fall 22
CS290 - Web Dev
CS325 - Algo

Winter 23
CS340 - Database
CS362 - SE2

Spring 23 - Fall 23 
CS344, 3 Electives and Capstone (Undecided) 

I don’t want to overload courses because I work full-time and I still want to more Leetcode as much as possible. If you have any suggestions or feedback, they will be greatly appreciated."
vb43la,2,2022-06-13,Two bachelors? Mechanical Engineering and Economics BS,[deleted],careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/vb43la/two_bachelors_mechanical_engineering_and/,"
I graduated HS with an associates of arts, ended up going back to community college to get some pre-requisites for mechanical engineering. Once I finished my pre-requisites I transferred to a four year University. My first semester didn’t go as planned, I had some personal issues that led me to drop 3 classes.

After this I switched my major over to Economics BS (it was my original intended major and the credits rolled over nicely)

Here I am 19, A senior. An internship is in the books for the next months. I enjoy my major.

I now find my self playing with the idea of finishing the bachelors in mechanical engineering. I would have about 2 years of 3-4 classes per semester. My work load would be core classes as I already have all electives completed.

My idea is to further focus into my commercial real estate photography business while taking classes for MECHANICAL ENGINEERING. 

What is the general consensus of having two degree like this?

Is it a bad idea?


Note: My business is freelance of sort, so not as demanding as transitional business. 

Note: I very much enjoy both degrees

Note: my intentions are to use these degrees to gain competence in personal business endeavors. 

I find that engineering and Econ have a unique way of altering the way you think. Playing influence in many aspects of life."

vb4aho,1,2022-06-13,I need help overcoming a resentment of rich people,smamgod1115,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/vb4aho/i_need_help_overcoming_a_resentment_of_rich_people/,"It's been growing for a really long time now and it's becoming unhealthy. And I've already reached out to get a therapist but I wanted to know if anyone else ever felt the same way.

I am very privileged compared to the majority of the US. I come from a family of six, my parents are both teachers,  and I never had to worry about my next meal. My parents are alive, healthy, and still together, have kept their jobs for over twenty years, and the only thing I've had to do to support the rest of my family was to give them 6k to buy a car one time. I know I am very very lucky.

Now, my resentment comes because I am now a working professional in an artistic career that benefits from financial privilege. I knew if I wanted to go to college, I would pay for it myself. I knew this and accepted the risks of a financially unstable career. I got a job in high school, paid for my own art classes and coaches to get into a good college (but didn't even consider most reputable, well-connected places because of the cost), and I ended up with a good scholarship in a good program. In college, I worked three jobs, ate discarded food at restaurants, and occasionally borrowed money from a friend to pay rent. If a class required too many materials that I had to pay for, I would drop it, which is so frustrating looking back at all of the skills I wish I had now in my mid-twenties but couldn't afford back then. Compared to my peers, I feel like I am constantly making up for lost time.

Anyway, over the past two years, I've gotten some work here and there, with covid also having a big impact. And more and more, I find myself working with people who are incredibly talented but also extremely privileged and it is becoming so apparent the benefits it has afforded them. I guess I theoretically always knew but seeing it first hand has been rough. I have friends/coworkers whose parents paid for their rent, or their cars, or who paid for them to go to elite colleges and make incredible career-changing connections. Some of them have had access to incredible resources since they were in grade school. Some of them could afford to do unpaid work or low-wage summer internships at amazing organizations that would help increase their portfolio and get connections. A few even just get payouts from trust funds and only a handful have student loans (I pay $400/mo). I spent one summer working doubles at two restaurants for six days a week in order to pay for my next semester. I've also been doing unpaid work here and there but I've only ever been to do things after work and have turned down opportunities that didn't pay enough. I am happy with my own choices, am fine with how much I make personally, and I am proud of supporting myself in my career.

BUT DAMN IT IS SO FRUSTRATING. I think I just need to vent because I am so sick and tired of working so hard for stuff that is so much easier for others. I still do it because I love my art and it's what makes everything worth it but DAMN. It's crushing in a way to listen to people enroll in special classes or pay for workshops and then tell me all about them after I get off work. Anytime anyone mentions opportunities I know they have because of wealth, I feel myself tense up. No one else can really tell but it's gotten to the point where my blood starts boiling if they keep talking about it, especially if they complain about it. It's equally frustrating when I'm getting career advice from privileged people because I don't have the luxury of following their suggested path. Every time I meet someone successful, I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop and to find out they're rich or supported. More often than not, the shoe falls.

Also to be clear, many of my peers still work incredibly hard, are devoted to their craft, and are incredibly talented. I don't want to discredit the work they do because of their wealth. Their own financial situation has nothing to do with them (although whether they appreciate it is different) . But this resentment can be sometimes debilitating. If I go long periods without work, I'll start to blame it on my lack of wealth. Which is scary to me because there are so many other factors and I'm worried I'm getting tunnel vision. I want to use these work gaps to motivate myself to be a better artist but I've caught myself scapegoating my lack of success (compared to my peers) on my finances. It's beginning to detract from my motivation to improve the quality of work I am producing. I don't want to end up in a spiral where I end up bitter and not trying anymore because I decided the world is against me.  SO I want help.

Any advice? Or stories of artists who started from little (not nothing. I have more than nothing). Or just if you've ever felt the same.

I know this is long and will probably get lost. If you made it this far, thank you for reading my somewhat self-indulgent rant.  I am just so tired and so angry when people don't understand how good they have it. Been finding out more and more people have success because of nepotism and it's just the icing on the cake.

TLDR: I am a self-supporting artist who is watching my financially supported peers get access to better opportunities and it pisses me off. Trying not to become a bitter, spiraling burnout."

At the start I was like Ok, I can get through a bit of tech but the work is total academic research based in the field of pure Computer Science. 

I told my manager this if he could shift me to another project but he was very weird apparently and said that he can’t give everyone everything they want.

I just finished my second year of Engineering. At my university, we are supposed to go on internships after the third year. I found out that most people in the same year as me have all secured a summer internship in order to get an actual internship after the third year. I asked my friends how they got their position and all said that they got it from family connections since they already came from a family of Engineers and professionals.

Now, I didn't know people were going to do this. No one told me. Even if anyone did tell me, it would have been hard landing a position given that all of them already have connections. I am new to the city. I don't know anyone. I have to look for a part-time job in order to pay for my tuition and expenses. My family is low-income as we are immigrants. I am the first in my family to go to university so I am basically raw dogging everything. My parents can't provide any support or insight. I don't know anything. I find out about opportunities when it's already too late for me.

Basically, I've been feeling like crap these days. Would I be able to get an internship at all? I've been feeling really anxious. Normally, I would solve these types of problems right away but I figured that my background/""social status"" is something I can't control. I just hate how I can't control the situation. I feel like it would be hard for me to get an actual internship without these valuable experiences. 

I am just lost. I feel like it's over for me already.  Has anyone been in this situation before?"

How to approach admitting to a superior that a task is too much for you?,noodl_es,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/vb9qxe/feeling_incompetent_at_new_job_how_to_approach/,"I started my internship almost a month ago. The first few weeks were great, but my first big task/project is to do an analysis on excel.

I thought I knew enough Excel to feel comfortable working with it, however this weekend I have put in 30+ hours off the clock into learning how to sort the data how I want it and solidifying which functions to use. 

I have heard ‘fake it til you make it’ as a means for overcoming imposter syndrome and I don’t think I can fake it til I make it with this. I don’t really understand what any of the variables are and have restarted this project 2x now. I have cried multiple times over this and now it is Monday and I’m going in with way less than I am expected to have. I have never been in this position before, where I couldn’t complete a task after putting in so much time/effort to learn what I need.

I’m supposed to present it this week, and it’s my first task/the first big impression I will leave. I have felt like an imposter since day 1 and I am beginning to feel those feelings have been confirmed. Any advice for how to go into work today and tell them that I feel defeated with this? I have never put this much time/effort into something and not been able to grasp it enough to do it. I have utilized Google and as many outside resources I can to learn this enough to do it, and I still can’t. I would be very proud of what I HAVE learned this week, but in the grand scheme the stuff I have learned is insignificant to completing the task at hand. I know I am capable of doing good work, but I truly feel like I can’t do this task with what I know and have learned. 

I really was hoping to be hired at this company after this internship, there’s a lot on the line here and I am a bit ashamed to go in today with what I have. I’ve been keeping the best attitude I can but after multiple failures I am starting to feel like I don’t belong. 

Words of encouragement or success stories are appreciated as well as any advice for how to go about my morning today- I basically am planning on just telling them that I’m not sure what exactly I am doing with this but really want to learn."

vbd44r,203,2022-06-13,The API I created as an intern surprisingly made it to production!,fish_the_fred,dataengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/vbd44r/the_api_i_created_as_an_intern_surprisingly_made/,"I really wanted to share this as I'm so happy with the work I did. 

&amp;#x200B;

A little background, I was a summer intern a few years back at a large and well known company in the US. I was supposed to create an API that services downstream (internal) clients that were currently connecting to the Data Lake directly. We all knew the data lake was migrating to Redshift, but didn't know when it would be live, so they had me creating the API for the current PostgreSQL DB anyways despite my mild protest. In the middle of the internship, the actual migration to Redshift started so they let me start creating a middle layer with AWS. 

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly had no idea what I was doing, but my manager forced me to fully research top to bottom which tools I should use (as they didn't know the answer themselves) and had me justify in writing the why and how behind each tool I selected before I started creating. I ended up using AWS Lambda and some other layers, including third party IDP, to service the 12 or so clients with highly varied requirements. I basically made it so they could interact with Redshift as if there was no middle layer, but incorporated other tools that allowed for easier security management and operational management from a data lake owner perspective. After all the research and back-and-forth to get proper permissions I was finally able to create and successfully test my API on Postman.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't think what I created was was actually going to be used as a contractor guy who was supposed to be my mentor sandbagged me towards the end and said he knew a better way to do it without so many layers, to which I was all ears on his better idea but he withheld the specifics. I felt like all my work was for naught and chalked it up as a learning experience and moved on. I just met my old boss in person the other day and he told me that they were actually using my architecture in production! Albeit, with some minor changes. It was so awesome to hear that I got it right in the end, it is a much needed confidence boost."
vbes62,1,2022-06-13,Is it worth it to temporarily take a low paying internship?,DuckMasterFlexxx,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/vbes62/is_it_worth_it_to_temporarily_take_a_low_paying/,"So a bit of background: I have very recently decided to make a career change and try and make something of myself in IT.

My current career pays decent (64k) but I’ve completely topped out and feel crazy there. I’ve only applied for maybe 5 entry level jobs but recently interviewed with a school district and was offered an intern position.

I’m pumped about it EXCEPT it’s 12.50 an hour which just isn’t liveable for me. In this situation I would absolutely have to do both jobs meaning I would most likely work 7:30 am to 9:30 pm split between them.

My question is: what is the true value of experience and how easy/fast is it to pivot into a job with a liveable wage once you do have some experience?

For what it’s worth the job sounds amazing and sounds like something I would really really love to do but it definitely wouldn’t cover my expenses.

Any advice for a noob is very very appreciated!"
vbfjie,4,2022-06-13,Company X has invited you to take their coding test.,HilltopHood,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vbfjie/company_x_has_invited_you_to_take_their_coding/,"Hello, I just received this email from an internship I applied to. The company is called SIG and I have until August to take the coding test.

I’m very new to all of this and coding in general. Just finished my second semester of Java programming and now I’m halfway through a DSA class. 

So far I’m maintaining a 4.0 in my CS classes but I’m putting in 30 hours of study time a week and haven’t had the time to reinforce what I have learned.

I would LOVE to get this internship I’m pretty nervous and fully expect to fail the coding test. Would it hurt me to take the coding test anyway? I’d really like to use this coding test as a way to gauge where my weaknesses are.

If I do poorly and my code is terrible, would they permanently throw out my resume, or would I still get a shot at their next internship window?

TL:DR

Should I take the coding test, even if I’m extremely underprepared? Would they reject all future applications to their internship program if I perform poorly?"

I was thinking about becoming a freelancer in app development so i won't go through big tech companies and be my own boss (i know they wouldn't come near to each other) i thought Kotlin and i said who better than google so i started google career certificate android app development course and then someone recommend a three-js course to me and it was interesting so now im in middle going with android development and web development. 
And if we have experts here on the three-js subject, should i go down that path of i should go with basic web dev? or should i leave the joy out and stick to one language till i master it in my case python.
And this is important to me cause since i finished ICDL,

I requested references from my internship supervisors for current job applications and heard nothing back. Silence. I have zero years of industry experience and only 3 failed internships + 4 years resume gap.

I learn well and did great in school. The only thing is I could not navigate social rules to build a good relationship with management. Since school only required knowledge, that wasn't a problem.

So I know I can work hard if I want to.

A few years ago I suffered from having my feelings really hurt by the people I worked with. I am still unsure if it was all in my head or those people were actually mean to me. 

Obviously, I hope I’m not delusional and the depression I got into at that point was not self-inflicted. I got so friendly with those people in a way that had me feeling happiness and self-confidence at a level I never ever felt before. Somehow I placed them on a pedestal as if they were the parents I never had (I have parents but they’re not doing a great job..maybe I ain’t the best son either). At some point all that they preached never turned into reality and that’s when I got really upset and sad. I had anxiety and panic attacks. 

I decided to quite working with them after almost a year or so. It was a good decision. After a while I also decided to get out of the industry and change to something different. I also started therapy.

After a year or so, I got back into the same field of work. But now I tell myself I’m choosy with my projects - I’m a freelancer. Truth is I get a lot of projects but I refuse most of them under all sorts of pretexts. I have some money saved up so that makes me feel comfortable but on the long term it’s obviously not a good idea to keep refusing projects. 

Last year I worked on two long projects and in the end I was so exhausted that I told myself I need a longer break. 

I took a long break, for about 5 months, time in which I traveled for a bit and made some changes in my private life. 

Now I have worked for the past month but I don’t seem to have the willingness and strength to want to go back to work. 

I also have a job that presumes decision-making all the time, there is a big responsibility on my shoulders, lots of money and people’s jobs. 

Although I do want to change jobs and work something with less responsibility I end up thinking what other people might think “worked so hard to get there just so you can give it all up now? And for what? For less money and less excitement”. Of course, I know this is not what I should be telling myself, I should take my side and be more understanding with myself, my needs and my wants.

My question is: has anyone else gone through this and managed to overcome it? Obviously everyone has different journeys but has anyone lost motivation and willingness to work and regained it somehow"
vbhbz5,0,2022-06-13,Internship Site Change question,Doodle-e-doodle-e-do,therapists,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/vbhbz5/internship_site_change_question/,"Hey folks, I'm a graduate student and I'm looking for perspective on a dilemma I'm facing with my internship site. I am in conversation with my academic supervisor about this (the clinical supervisor provided by my school, not the one at my site) and I'd love to hear what y'all think as well. 

I struggled to find a clinical placement, applying to over 40 places in my area before landing a spot. The clinic I landed at turned out to be not a great site. I don't really want to go into the details or explain why I'm leaving, but I am leaving the site. My supervisor from my school program is 100% in support of this and she encouraged me to find a different placement ASAP. 

Well, I found a new placement, and I can start there in mid-July - starting early because they know I'm changing at an odd time, or in September, with their other new interns. 

My concerns are the following:

1) What do I tell my old placement, and when do I tell them that I am leaving? They ask for a 6-month commitment, but they are so disorganized that this was not communicated to me before I agreed to be placed there. I think 6 months is a reasonable commitment, I'm just pointing out that I didn't sign anything or agree to stay for that long.   
What is difficult about this for me is that I'm trained by my past to NEVER tell my old employer that I found a new job until I'm ready for them to tell me not to come back to work tomorrow (worst case scenario). I don't want to stop seeing my clients at the old placement right away. In part because I need the hours! I spent the first month of my internship w/o seeing clients and I'm stressed about having to see more people per week than I feel ready to see in my later months to make up for this month's gap already. 

2) I'm not sure what to do about the clients I'm seeing. All of the clients I'm working with (except for one) at this current clinic are folks that were referred to me by colleagues (from outside the clinic). They enrolled in treatment at the clinic because they specifically wanted to see me. One client is someone who came to the clinic to find a therapist, and the coordinator sent them to me. 

Should I be able to take the clients I brought in with me to my new site? They and I would be frustrated if they couldn't work with me anymore because I am moving sites. The only reason they came to this site was to work with me. I imagine the one client the clinic sent me should stay and transfer to a new intern at the clinic. 

3) If I get to take my clients with me, I'm worried about the new placement letting me work with them. I asked the new site if I can work with folks who get referred to me from outside the clinic. The supervisor said yes, but, they have a waitlist. I'm not sure if that means my clients who have already been working with me will have to go on the waitlist and wait until I can see them? That would suck too. It doesn't seem in service to the client to take away their care in order to treat folks that I haven't established a therapeutic relationship with yet.   
I will ask them for clarity on this, but I want to get clear about the first two issues first. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance for any guidance and support. Please take it easy on me - I'm new, and I'm posting here because I feel like I need more support than what I have as a new clinician."

I went back to college to pursue a degree in IT. I've worked retail or Customer Service roles most of my life, from Sales Associate to Store Manager, but wanted something I could do hopefully for the long haul. I know my soft skills will help me immensely, but i'm trying to follow the subs advice and pursue an internship during my final year at university.   


The issue i'm running into is that every IT related internship near me is remote. I live in a fairly rural area, and i've tried looking but very rarely find an opportunity that is closed to me than 80 miles one way. My main worry is that I won't gain as much from a remote opportunity as I would from an in person internship. Obviously I have no clue if this worry is founded or not, so thats why im here asking if anyone has experience or can speak to if remote internships are just as informational as in person.

Thanks!"

vbiu9d,1,2022-06-13,Worried I might fail the background check. Help?,Consistent-Dare8455,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/vbiu9d/worried_i_might_fail_the_background_check_help/,"Hi guys,

I am a little anxious and I hope you guys can help me.

I am going through a background check and it’s for a financial services company. I have never done anything like this and I am pretty scared that I might fail it. I really want this job and so I’m just kinda stressing out. 

I have done everything and I’m confident that I have passed most of my background check. I am not worried about my drug screening, fingerprinting, education history, residential history, or most of my employers. 

However, I am concerned about one of my employers. I worked for a sauna for a couple of months. I was working in Europe at the time and went back to the US and kind ghosted that employer. The thing is I found an internship in the us and I wanted to pursue that. That combined with the fact that it was a short term contract and that it was covid, I pretty much knew that my contract wouldn’t be renewed. 

Combined with that, I also didn’t know when my contract ended but I stopped working in January of 2020 and so I put that on my form. 

This is literally the only part of the background check that I am concerned about. I think all the other parts will show up fine. 

What do you guys think? Is this something I should be worried about? Will my job offer be rescinded because of it."

I just qualified for a Level 7 in Computing. In a perfect world, I'd like to have advanced entry into an Honours degree course in another college (this was a 3 year course), but I am unsure as to the likelihood of this based on numbers/admissions requirements etc 

There are a lot of HDip conversion courses available, some on Springboard that seem very accessible to me, but I worry I am missing out on some higher end content or end of year project that might be to my benefit in employment.

The long and the short of it is - is a HDip (level 8) in a similar field (software dev/comp sci etc.) good enough for employment upon graduation? Some even have internships tacked onto the end of them for 3 months, which is quite appealing to me as there was none as part of my 3 year course. Or is is worth my while trying my luck and enquiring colleges about advanced entry into their honours degree programmes?

Thanks a lot in advance!"

vbjndc,27,2022-06-13,Dao of the Deal 1. Deadhead (1),thejacobk,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/vbjndc/dao_of_the_deal_1_deadhead_1/,"Synopsis:

*When Muchen wakes up as an orphan living a hardscrabble life in a world of magical kung fu, he immediately starts working towards the obvious goal: to get rich! Money can make ghosts work hard, let alone cultivators. He can worry about immortality once he's secured a comfortable standard of living.*

*Unfortunately, on the Qianzhan Continent, it takes a clever mind to earn a fortune... but it takes strength to defend it.*

**First | Previous | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/vbjphc/dao_of_the_deal_2_deadhead_2/)**

Muchen woke to the sight of a man standing atop a sword, flying through the distant sky. The sword cut through the air with the sort of speed he usually associated with a jet airplane. After only a few heartbeats, both sword and man were little more than a blurry dot off in the distance. Muchen watched the dot dwindle in size until he was distracted by a sharp headache and a flood of memories.

It hurt. His first instinct was to throttle back the flow and focus on the here and now. He stared at his hand and tried to focus on the physical sensation of wiggling his fingers. The rush of memories clamored for his attention. He clenched his fist, gritting his teeth and pushing the memories away.

They just kept coming. After a moment he felt something snap. There was nothing he could do but loosen his mental hold and let the memories wash over him. The pain faded away and he was able to start paying more attention to the images rushing past his mind's eye. What he had thought of as one giant river was actually made up of two distinct streams.

In one, he remembered the modern world. His name... his name eluded him. He remembered flying aboard airplanes and grabbing all sorts of entertainment from a worldwide information network. He remembered going to school, busting his ass to keep his scholarships. He remembered hustling poker games and long weekends spent manning a stall at a farmer's market, doing whatever he could to keep himself in pocket money while he worked an unpaid internship that was supposed to act as a launching pad for his career.

He'd managed to wine and dine his supervisor and turn that internship into a solid job offer waiting for him on graduation. He remembered heading out with his friends to celebrate. The faces of his friends were blurry when he tried to call them up, and for that matter much of the evening was a blur, but the last memory hit with startling clarity: a lonely walk home that ended when a bolt of lightning struck from a clear night sky.

Muchen sighed. He'd read about plenty of senseless deaths, but he'd never expected it would happen to him. He could only hope that it had been caught on camera. At least then he'd have a shot at immortality in the form of a viral video.

Actually, his other stream of memories suggested that he might have a shot at a much more practical form of immortality. Muchen had been born on the Qianzhan Continent, in a world where men and women could develop extraordinary powers through a process called cultivation. A combination of meditation, martial training, and the consumption of esoteric medical materials all came together to grant cultivators impossible strength, supernatural powers, and nearly unlimited lifespans.

Having seen a man ride a flying sword, Muchen thought it was safe to conclude that he was now in that world of cultivation. Either that or his mind had finally snapped from overwork, but that wasn't something he was going to waste time worrying about.

Unfortunately, Muchen himself was not a cultivator. Far from it. He was an orphan who had been adopted by a traveling merchant. Old man Wangpai had often said that he wanted to pass down his legacy to someone he had raised himself, even if his legacy only amounted to a mule and a wagonful of goods.

The thought of the old man brought a twinge of pain to his heart. A month ago, he'd died of heart failure. It had come as a shock. Wangpai was old, but he'd never shown any signs of frailty due to his age. In the morning he'd been kicking Muchen awake and cursing him for his habit of sleeping in. Then in the afternoon he'd frozen while driving the cart, then dropped the reins, clutched at his chest, and slumped over. By the time Muchen had been able to get them to the next village, his body was cold.

Muchen had handled all of the funeral arrangements and stood vigil for the old man together with a bunch of strangers. Then he'd sold off the cargo they'd been carrying and set a course for the Cloudy Peaks Sect. He'd visited the area once before and remembered hearing of a low ranked steward who was notoriously corrupt. He'd planned to bribe the steward to sneak him into the sect as an outer disciple. With his terrible spiritual potential, the only way he could hope to enter a sect was through the back door.

He'd been nervous about taking such a long journey all by himself, but he'd buoyed his spirits by focusing on the dream of becoming a cultivator. He'd made it to within less than a day's travel of the sect and had been making camp for the night when a bolt of lightning had struck him from a clear sky.

Looking back on it now, it seemed like the plan of a particularly foolish teenager. It was somewhat excusable, seeing as he was a teenager.

Was he? Muchen turned his attention outward, taking a look at his body. The left sleeve of his shirt had been burned off by the lightning, revealing an arm that had been trained by seventeen years of hard work, with none of the flab accumulated from a life of modern luxury.

He was a teenager, then. Was he still foolish? That remained to be seen.

Muchen grunted as he pulled himself to his feet. His back was damp, courtesy of the morning dew, and a chorus of aches and pains greeted him as a result of a night spent passed out on the ground. Just a chorus, not the symphony he'd expected. Muchen hadn't cultivated supernatural powers, but he'd built up quite a bit of natural toughness over the course of a difficult life.

Unfortunately, it hadn't been enough to protect him from the lightning. The more he explored his memories, the more Muchen was certain that the original owner of the body had been cast out, to be replaced by a soul from a different world. His feelings, his habits of thought, they matched what he remembered from his modern life.

He looked at the charred mark left on the ground by the lightning to mark the spot where the original Muchen left this world. A somber mood came over him as he headed for his cart and pulled a bottle of wine out of storage. The original Muchen might not get a gravestone, but he should at least get a memorial service.

He carefully unwrapped the protective cloth from the bottle. It seemed a little excessive, but the padding had done its work in letting Muchen transport a fifty tael bottle of wine halfway across the Qianzhan Continent without any damage.

Fifty taels... his fingers froze in the action of unsealing the wine. After a moment, he wrapped the protective cloth around the bottle.

In a memorial service, it was the thought that counted, right?

Muchen offered a bow towards the scorch mark.

""I'll do my best to lead a good life and let our name be remembered with admiration,"" Muchen said, then smiled and shook his head. ""Although I'm afraid I can't in good conscience go through with your plan.""

He shook his head as he made his way back over to the cart. It took a special kind of person to try and bribe his way into a position as an outer sect disciple.

Outer sect disciples provided labor for the sect in exchange for cultivation resources and cultivation guidance. It sounded nice in theory, but working in exchange for room and board—and by the way not being allowed to leave—was not Muchen's idea of a good deal. The cultivation resources provided were a relative pittance, and even holding on to that much was a challenge under the vicious competition between disciples seeking that all important admission to the inner sect.

The only way to ascend from the outer sect was through immense talent or immense good fortune. The original owner knew he didn't have the talent. He'd been planning to make it by hard work and luck.

Muchen could only say he had been too naive. Selling yourself into indefinite servitude in exchange for a lottery ticket was bad enough, but what about that corrupt steward? Once the bribe had been paid and it was clear that Muchen couldn't be squeezed for any more money, could he really hope to enjoy a good life? He'd be lucky if the steward didn't have him killed to erase the traces of his misdeeds.

He hoped that, if the lightning bolt had caused them to swap places, the original Muchen would take a more sensible approach to the modern world.

Muchen turned away from the scorch mark, then paused as a thought occurred to him. ""Of course, I could be persuaded to change my mind if that lightning came with some kind of cheat power attached.""

Muchen had read enough web fiction to know that an orphan with little talent could become a domineering protagonist overnight with a sufficiently powerful cheat boosting him up. He struck a dramatic pose. ""System? System store? Status? Menu? Open sesame?""

The only response was a whickering snort. Muchen looked to the side to find Huichen the mule looking at him with a hint of derision in his eyes. Well, the animal hadn't wandered away after its master was struck by lightning. That was pretty good. It couldn't be helped if he wasn't a particularly appreciative audience.

Muchen put away his thoughts of an immediate rise to power and checked over his cart after putting away the bottle of wine. It had been untouched by the lightning and, as far as he could tell, had gone unmolested while he was unconscious. That was good. He had the foundation he needed to make his own plan.

If a heaven-defying opportunity fell in his lap, he would grab onto it with both hands and not let go. He'd be happy enough to defeat a tide of young masters and ride the escalation treadmill to ultimate power.

He couldn't just assume that something like that would happen, though. He needed a stable, reliable plan for the future. Really, even if he did get some cheat power in the future, it would be better if it were backed up with a plan of his own.

Old masters handing out top level techniques, for example, could hardly be trusted. There was no such thing as a free lunch in this or any world. You'd end up fighting off a body snatching attempt if you were lucky; in the worst case, you'd end up getting dragged into fighting all of the old master's enemies.

Godly weapons were even less reliable. They could break at a critical moment, they could be stolen, they could even try and eat your soul.

Cheat powers in general were a poisoned chalice. How many protagonists had lost access to their cheat in critical moments, forced to rely on their own wit and ability to survive? Actually, once he took a minute to think about it, Muchen couldn't come up with an example. Nobody had ever accused him of having particularly discerning tastes as a reader.

He didn't have access to a cheat, anyways, so it was best not to dwell on it.

What he did have was a cart, a mule, and a decent sized stash of silver. In other words, start up capital. All that he had to do was make that stack of silver grow.

Money was stable. A tael of silver was a tael of silver, no matter where you traveled.

Money was safe. No lump of silver would ever stab Muchen in the back out of jealousy. Money would never break an engagement with him because of his low talent for cultivation.

Money was popular. Nobody hated money, and everybody wanted to have more money.

Muchen believed that if you were confronted with a problem that couldn't be solved with money, then the underlying problem was that you didn't have enough money. There was nothing wrong with the original's dream of using money to buy passage down the pathway of immortality. The problem was that planning to buy a place as an outer disciple was thinking too small.

Accumulating enough money to offset his lack of talent would be hard work, but Muchen had never been afraid of hard work. He just had to make sure that his efforts were focused in the right direction.

Right now, the most valuable piece of information he had was the name and rough location of a corrupt member of the Cloudy Peaks Sect. The steward might be a small fry, but it was precisely because of his humble position that Muchen would have a chance to talk to him. Instead of using that connection to buy his way into the sect and leave the steward with all the profit, though, he intended to adopt an approach that would be more mutually beneficial.

vbkhho,45,2022-06-13,G Offer - Zurich,Danver97,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/vbkhho/g_offer_zurich/,"Hello everyone,

I just got today my offer for a role (L3, SWE Backend) in Zurich.
I have 3 past internships in local companies (Italy) and an additional 2 YoE in two startups.

The offer is composed of:

* 134k gross
* 17,5k equity (70k over 4 years, some people are pointing they vest 33% on the first year and non 25%)
* 15% annual bonus

for a total compensation of 171.5k (the 15% bonus is on the gross, right?).

Now, the offer seem not that far from what [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi) tells, but still 5% off of it.

I currently have no other offers, except for an Amazon offer I declined in August 2021 (I don't know if I can recover it and still negotiate on it) for a role in Dublin.

Few months ago an Amazon recruiter contacted me for some positions in the US. Since I was looking for applying at Google too, I accepted to start the process, but the suddently saw that I already declined an offer in the past year. He told me that if I was 100% sure to move forward he could resubmit the case for approval the role in the US, but the strongly required me to be committed to accept it. Since I wasn't committed, I told him I wasn't because I needed more time to evaluate different opportunities in the EU and US. Do you think I could use it to negotiate the Zurich one by asking for a new offer approval in the US?

On the other side, there's Microsoft who put me on wait since they were closing the fiscal year in june and they needed to acknoledge the new headcounts.

What do you think are my odds to negotiate?

Thanks in advance!

Edit: Microsoft's recruiter just sent me the online assessment and told me they're already interviewing candidates for the new fiscal year."

vbkkge,2,2022-06-13,Quit my internship after 2 months or stick it out another month?,Otherwise_Industry49,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/vbkkge/quit_my_internship_after_2_months_or_stick_it_out/,"I (22f) graduated from university last year with two BA degrees in the English and Drama field. I wanted to get more internship experience because I am trying to figure out what I want to do for a full-time career. With this being said, my good friend kindly hooked me up with the company he is interning at. Basically, what the (unpaid) internship requires is asynchronously reading 1 film script per week (about 125-160 pages on average) and writing a review of the script that details what was good, bad, and what needs improving (the writing is anywhere between 6-10 pages single spaced as I've learned it comes out to- for me at least.)

My friend said that the internship was easy for him and probably would be for me. He knows that I have comprehension, engagement, pacing issues with reading (yes, I'm an English major, go figure) and am a very slow and tedious writer, but since it was one script a week and at the time I didn't know that I would have to write that much, I thought I'd give it a shot.

Fast forward two months and as of right now, I've completed 2 script coverages and am having SO much difficulty getting another one done. It takes a while for me to get into the reading, even if the script is decent, and I usually have to read things over a lot too. The script coverage afterwards is absolutely daunting to me as well, and I feel like I have to prepare to write an 8 paged essay every time I read a script. It sounds pathetic, but it's getting to the point where I am crying every time I have to do work, and I am incredibly resistant to even opening up these scripts. I was like this during my junior and senior at college, and having these emotions and reactions return a year later makes me frustrated.

The people that work at the company are really nice, and they were completely understanding when I recently told them I'd like to do biweekly script coverage. However, it's been over a month since I last handed in a script and I am beyond frustrated, embarrassed, and disappointed in myself that I can't get this done.

I feel badly for not being a good intern and for my friend recommending me when I am terrible. On the self side, I don't want to leave after 2 months of being at this internship, plainly because I need this internship on my resume and worry that 2 months isn't long enough. I go back and forth about staying for another month simply for resume purposes and trying to redeem myself as an intern, but I don't know if I can do it. I feel like it might be better if I just quit, but I'm not sure what to do.

Thank you for your insight.

Unfortunately, I've been having a lot of trouble finding a new grad job. I am super worried because I'm an international student with limited finances and had to borrow money for rent and living expenses this month, and need to find a full time job by this July -- otherwise I won't be able to work until I receive my work permit, which will take at least 6 months, and I absolutely cannot afford to be unemployed in Toronto until then.

Could you guys guide me in the right direction in terms of how you found a new grad role? It feels like all the new grad postings for analyst roles, BA, DA, industrial engineering positions, etc. that I'm seeing on LinkedIn right now require 3-5 years of work experience, which is a challenge because the only work experience I have is a 3 month summer internship. 

I actually did manage to secure a offer back in March, but they rescinded it last minute in May because they didn't want to hire an international student over a PR/citizen, which is why I am back to square one with looking for a job now :(

Thank you, and I appreciate your time!"
vblh4w,1,2022-06-13,Would learning angular be a waste of time?,ventadorrecluse,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/vblh4w/would_learning_angular_be_a_waste_of_time/,"I am currently in an internship. I was basically gifted this opportunity, so I figured I may as well take it. I have been coding for a few years, however not too seriously. I have been a CS major for the past year. I know python and C++, I prefer C++ and am better with it. At this intnernship, since I am not super deep into my CS education, I am not really working on any serious projects. I am working on a website they use. The website uses angular, angularjs, javascript,c#,css,html, probably some others I am missing. Like I said, I am a C++ developer mostly, that is how I learned, and at least from what I know, if I was to really get into it C++ is not really for web dev stuff, or at least not front end stuff. It seems like that is what angular is, there is also a lot of backend stuff in the website that seems to be coded in javascript, not sure if angular is used for that.

At this internship we are required to do some supplemental courses on Udemy, or at least I am required to (since I am a noob). I found a 35 hour angular course on udemy that I will do. I figure I can learn the other stuff along the way while doing it.

Still, this may be a little stressful taking this course and doing the internship at the same time (although I can sometimes do it during the internship), and I don't really want to pigeonhole myself as a ""web developer"" as that is not really my interest. I think angular seems cool and I wouldn't mind knowing it just to know it, but would it be a huge waste of time?"

So this very legit looking company, that I assume is a small bank of some sort, reaches out to me on LinkedIn telling me I’d be a good fit for their internship! 

Mind you I’m a freshman. I wasn’t even going to bother with internships until I transfer to a 4 year. Why am I getting offered a financial internship as a community college freshman?

I’m stoked but confused, so I set up some time to talk to the recruiter. Over this weekend I get way too excited, I’m planning to switch my major to Finance, and was thinking I’m this major hotshot for having an internship his first year in college. Maybe I can get into IB, etc. I basically just hit the lottery.

Finally got around to doing some research before I talk to them. That small “bank”? Northwestern Mutual.

Going to stick with Computer science.

vbqk6m,81,2022-06-13,From a College Graduate to Anxious High Schoolers,chrisp1934,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/vbqk6m/from_a_college_graduate_to_anxious_high_schoolers/,"I was an active member of this sub 4 years ago and I occasionally lurk to see how the admissions process has changed over the years. Once upon a time I was just like many of ya’ll. I did club gymnastics (No mens gymnastics at my high school) and was therefore not involved in any leadership in clubs at my HS. I spent my weekends playing video games and hanging out with my friends. I enjoyed my time, but going to the college admissions process, I did not have a ton to put on my application. Like many of you all, I was set on going to a T5 school. However, obviously based on my lack of ECs and other achievements, things did not go as plan. 

I ended up getting denied from most of the schools I applied too. The only match school I was admitted to was Purdue, which is the university I just graduated from with a degree in Electrical Engineering. While still in high school, I struggled grappling with the fact that I was not going to a better university. I worried for my future and if I would get a good job. I felt ashamed in the beginning to be attending Purdue because it wasn’t Stanford, MIT, or an Ivy League school.

These feelings did not last long and I fell in love with Purdue. I was successful, had internships, did undergraduate research, and was involved heavily in clubs. Next fall, I will be attending UCSD for a PhD in CS. The most important part of all is that I am happy with where I am and I don’t wish it had gone any other way. I don’t feel embarrassed to have attended Purdue and I am proud of my acceptance to UCSD even though it is not a “T5” CS school.

The point of my post is that it is going to be ok. Hell, it might even be the best thing that has happened to you. I know my story of overcoming my shame is not shared by everyone, but I hope that you all understand that where you go to school doesn’t define who you are. Thanks :)

TL;DR
Don’t worry so much about where you go to school. You will prove yourself. Life works out."

A bit of context:
I am a recently graduated(2021) engineer with a CS background. I didn't do well in my bachelor's and ended up getting a cGPA of 6.7 out of 10. I know it's super bad. From then on, I've been trying to compensate for my bad GPA by working on research problems and trying to get publications while doing that. I've managed to have 7 publications in the last two years and one is on the way. One of them is in a Journal and one is in the topmost conference in Natural Language Processing. Others are workshop proceedings papers but I'm the only contributor/author in them. Other than this, I've won a few international data science competitions and managed to get the top 1% in a lot of those competitions. I've been as a research intern at the best University for tech in my country ever since I graduated. I had worked as a Research Assistant for 6 months from one college that comes in a top 20 University worldwide. All the professors I've worked with have agreed to write an LOR for me. 

I'm thinking of applying to top universities in the US for masters in data science. 

Can anyone who has gotten through this please let me know if I have hope for a good uni from the US,?"

So I'm wrapping up my undergrad computer engineering in the US and I was thinking of doing a one-year masters where I studied abroad in Edinburgh before settling down full-time. I absolutely fell in love with my host city, got to travel Europe, and enjoyed the rigour of the university

The main concern I have is financial. I'll have ~50k in loans and it'll cost another 20-30k to study there while I'm aware many US companies will pay for a masters. That being said, I have 3 aerospace internships under my belt and I hope to stick with same field so I'm not too concerned about finding a job

I also want to note that my motivation to study abroad is mostly for life experiences. I understand that I can vacation and travel when I'm older, but being able to live in Edinburgh as a local was such an experience and it's extremely cheap to fly around Europe. Am I being too irrational? Thanks! 

TL;DR: I want to do my masters where I studied abroad but I'm worried that going with debt and paying for it is a stupid financial decision"

TLDR: Co-worker is pissed I got a role in a new team and he didn't. How do I handle them feeling like they are entitled to the opportunity because they have been here longer and are a level higher than me, despite being a poor fit, bad at their job, and unreliable.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been with my company seven years. I've moved from Intern to FT and have been FT for 5 years now. I recently got a new role in a newly formed team within my area of IT. 

A co-worker who has been here longer and one level higher than me is upset that I got placed into a new team in charge of design/architecture and that he didn't get chosen to go into this team. There was no application specifically to be on this new team. I applied to the same job the co-worker holds, but the team was formed with people from existing teams. They placed me into the new team without me knowing until I started. 

This co-worker believes they are constantly looked over and disrespected and I was given a chance but he wasn't. The hard truth is that this co-worker is just not good at their job and not a good fit for this team. I was told I Was a good fit for the team. I'm very good at my job and try very hard to be the best I can and take every opportunity to learn and help improve things. I told the co-worker that I don't appreciate being marginalized as I've put in the work to get where I am. This person believes because he is one level above me that he is entitled to a certain level of classism, but that is very much not how our teams are ran and he has been told this before. I told him to talk to my boss.

How should I handle something like this? I'm going through a lot with the new role (so insanely busy) and things in my family life and didn't have the mental capacity to really try to engage with this person when they called me to air their grievances. I'm not a person that handles personal conflict well in the work place, especially when the other party gets loud and upset."
vbthxm,29,2022-06-13,Advice for a depressed cs major?,dumboranges,UCI,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/vbthxm/advice_for_a_depressed_cs_major/,"This was my first year a UCI as a CS major, and I've found it incredibly difficult to process this year and my feelings around it. For starters, I'm proud that I came out of the year making friends and learning to enjoy the major that I'm in. On the other hand, I came out with a 2.5 gpa, getting low Bs and Cs in all my classes. I relied a lot on academic validation in high school, so just passing my classes and feeling unsure about myself is something that I need to learn to be okay with. 

Today Professor Pattis sent an email that made me question how prepared I am for future courses, and then I realized that I genuinely feel like I learned nothing in ICS 32 and ICS 33. And it's bit difficult for me to figure out if it's true or not. I feel like I relied heavily on my friends for explanations and help, but I was also able to complete every assignment by myself. I can't tell if it's imposter syndrome, burnout, or actually not understanding material thats making me feel this way. 

Since moving to Irvine, my mental health hasn't been *the best*. I've noticed my depression and eating disorder getting much worse which also interferes with my classes and self confidence. I have a hard time clearing my head and this quarter my brain fog was the worse its ever been. Burnout hit me hard this quarter, causing my grades to drop full letters simply because I couldn't bring myself to study. It's easy for me to blame everything that happened on my mental health, but I know that I could've done more this year to help myself (except I didn't).

In reality, this year gave me a lot of happy memories, I'm only focusing on the bad parts in this post. I'm scared of repeating this same cycle next year, especially as classes seem to get harder. I don't want this year to be a precedent for the rest of my time at UCI. I'm scared that I won't be able to get an internship or job because of how badly I screwed up this year. Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one in this situation, but I know it's far from true. I just can't get out of my head and tell myself it'll be okay."
vbul2s,78,2022-06-13,Survival Tips For Incoming Freshman/Transfers/Students moving to Apartments,Keitorina,UCDavis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/vbul2s/survival_tips_for_incoming/,"Here are a couple tricks you can utilize before getting to UC Davis.

1) Apply for CalFresh [here](https://www.mybenefitscalwin.org/#/home). CalFresh give low income individuals up to $190 a month for fresh groceries. If you dorm, yes you can qualify. You can use the [Aggie Compass Basic Needs Center](https://aggiecompass.ucdavis.edu) if you need additional help. 

2) Make use of [Aggie Compass Basic Needs Center](https://aggiecompass.ucdavis.edu). Are you a student? They can give you free fresh groceries including eggs and milk, and toiletries. All you need is a symptom survey, your ID Card, and a bag for your stuff at the Memorial Union. There are several other resources the website provides you as well.

3) If you receive Medical or have health insurance get your asses out of paying for no reason [here](https://shcs.ucdavis.edu/uc-ship-waiver-information). You have until September 1st to waive it. **If you receive Medical transfer it to Yolo County via this [link](https://www.mybenefitscalwin.org/#/home). (It is the same link as CalFresh)**

4) Severe Depression and Anxiety qualifies as a disability at UC Davis. You may be provided testing accommodations. [Here](https://sdc.ucdavis.edu) is more information about the process. 

5) Receive Pell Grant? Get reduced internet plans if you purchase your own internet with the [Affordable Connectivity Program](https://www.fcc.gov/acp). Get $30 off your internet just by applying.

6) Looking for organic fresh vegetables grown by your fellow students at reasonable prices? Look no further but at the Student Farm’s Farm stand. Operational on Mondays during the school year from 12-3. [Here](https://asi.ucdavis.edu/programs/sf) is more information. 

7) **STAY AWAY FROM INTERNSHIP ABROAD PROGRAMS!!** I didn’t realize it when I signed up for it but essentially you are paying yourself to go slave away in a foreign country. They don’t disclose ANY timeline of when you’ll get your internship placement. (“Anywhere between 8-3 weeks before your departure.”) Cancellation deadlines are far too early to make any sane decisions about the program. **Cancellation fees vary from $300 - up to the full cost of the program depending on when you cancel.** Most of the time you don’t get the full scholarship amount they advertise. You can attempt to receive financial aid from your major, but you need to at least know where and what the internship is. You can upload documentation for cancellation to support why you’re not liable for the fees (they don’t disclose this to you on the website.) but likely need a medical professional to say you can’t leave the country.

8) Need a bike that needs some TLC? [UC Davis Bike Auction](https://taps.ucdavis.edu/bicycleprogram/events) sells abandoned bikes left on campus. [Here](https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/whats-the-best-bike-for-commuting/) is a bike guide on good bikes to purchase for commuting. **Be aware 1/4 students have their bike stolen in a 4 year period. Buy a good bike lock based on this [guide](https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/how-to-prevent-bike-theft/). TAPS Bike Information is [here](https://taps.ucdavis.edu/bicycleprogram/parking_security).** A bike locker space is $10/month but need to purchase the remainder of their fiscal year (July reset). Convenient if you want to leave your bike overnight and want extra security.

9) Download the UC Davis App. [IOS Link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/uc-davis-mobile/id455098573) and [Google Play Store Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.ucdavis.mobile.aggie&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US). The app is useful for accessing campus map, unitrans bus locations, routes, arrival times and stops, apparently email, canvas, and schedule builder as well.

If I am missing any additional resources or information please add to the thread. If academic resources are requested, I will add more but I figure people would prefer ways to save money instead."
vbve77,2,2022-06-14,Quit Internship without 2-week but rather 1 day notice. How bad did I mess up?,No-Key6964,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/vbve77/quit_internship_without_2week_but_rather_1_day/,"I started an internship last month for a web developer position with a company that uses SAP software. I would have been making analytical apps using ABAP, CDS and Fiori. I spent a month reading 2 books provided by the company and then told to look online for more information. After that month it was mentioned I would start a project. I thought I was ready and could start developing for them. I spent a week staring at my computer screen, reviewing and still could not produce anything for my project. I felt defeated, I've never had any other problems like this in college when I'd design my own websites with full stack elements (front-end and back-end) I'd have no issue. Yet I sat there staring at the screen for 8 hours a day not producing anything. I felt like I was wasting the companies time that they were paying for.

Today I put in an email ( I worked from home 4 out of 5 days) for my resignation for the end of the work day. I lost motivation and felt defeated because I couldn't figure it out. I would reach out on SAP forums would receive help but I could not apply it. My background was in MERN stack.

Tomorrow I'm going in to give my equipment back and honestly tell them I don't feel right for them. It wasn't what I professionally wanted to do for my web development career. I felt two weeks wouldn't work because I'd be stuck and possibly costing them more money. I feel bad doing this but I also don't want to fail my internship class and I know I would have failed my internship evaluation. I felt leaving now for internships that are more in what I already know would be professionally and educationally right for me. I don't/didn't know SAP and could not figure out ABAP or CDS especially for web development. 

TL;DR: put in resignation with only 1 day notice. Didn't feel right for the position and didn't want the company to keep paying for me for producing nothing. Couldn't figure out the languages used for their development."

The school year is over and what a pleasure it is. So much has happened in the past year Much of my time as a sophomore was the most stressful experience in my life so far. For a little context, I am your typical run-of-the-mill straight A student with a little something of tenacity sprinkled in there. This past year, I joined something called the Academy for Health and Science Professions at my school. It is a “smart kids program” as I like to call it, and the teachers have “different” teaching styles. Apart from that, they have us do community service stuff and internships during the Summer. To get to the point of what I am trying to say, this school year broke me. It destroyed my sanity, so much so that I had 3 mental breakdowns with one being an explosive meltdown. Balancing choral competitions, my personal life, and school work was no problem. The issue came with me becoming self-conscious about my intelligence. Joining a program like the one I did put me with the other smart kids in my school. I had always been the best in my advanced courses and never got below an A in almost everything. Up to this previous high school year, everything had been a breeze, as expected. However, that was before being in harder classes; before the Academy. When I joined, my first B’s started to pop up. To a normal person, that would be fine, but not to me. I have a huge fear of failure which is a blessing and a curse since it pushes me to work harder that most. My tenacity and persistence as well as work ethic keeps me going; however, a side of me that had been locked away popped up when I began to feel what it was like to earn a B. My anxieties and my self-doubt began to take a hold of my life. It left me as an empty shell of void that felt worthless and deserving of nothing; such as a sinkhole that keeps devouring it’s surroundings until little is left. If I didn’t constantly get an A or if someone “out did me” on a test or assignment, I would feel destroyed. It surpassed a point even I would think is completely ignorant. A 90 or a 92 was not good enough, it had to be higher. This was on top of the fact that I expected myself to perform better even when I got little to no sleep every, single, day. I hungered just as a hungry lion hungers when they haven’t eaten for days. “More, you can do more!” Or “You are dumb and aren’t smart!” Played on repeat in my head constantly. The only thing keeping me alive at that point was my willpower. The ember in my soul is so large and strong that never did I consider any sign of backing down or giving up. I still pulled high A’s on report cards and the lowest grade on my last report card was AP World History with a 92. However, it left big scars in my psyche and who I am. It is something I am working on, but will understandably take time to heal. With all that said, I know this is a college subreddit, but I thought I could get some advice on stuff. I was planning on taking some steps towards preparing for future endeavors such as the SAT and maybe doing some work with college stuff such as scholarships or just doing some self-study for fun. Should I rest and wait a little or dive into it rn? Juniors or seniors, what other sort of advice could you give me? Just in general about AP classes or college knowledge that you wish you knew before you came to applying for schools? Idk if this is the right subreddit for asking this stuff, but since I’ve been a part of this community for some time, I though to ask here. Thank you for your time!

(P.S, sorry for the sappy story, just wanted to share something about school in general and maybe get some advice for college stuff I could do this Summer.)"

I have accepted an IT internship offer at a tech company (Company A) in the healthcare industry, an industry that I am interested in. Here are some details about this offer:

* $18/hr
* Start date is one day from today
* Will be doing security work like patches and reaching out to people to troubleshoot
* Potential opportunities for full time work after internship at Help Desk

I got another offer from a company after I had already accepted the position with Company A, signed the offer letter, and  did my background and medical check. Company B makes physical products in an industry that I'm not really interested in. Here are more details:

* $26/hr
* Will mainly allow me to work with Tableau and Access
* Potential opportunities for full time work exist but not exactly sure what type of positions they'd be

Some of my concerns in accepting the position with Company B is that I'd be burning a bridge with Company A. Additionally, company A is a tech company so I feel like I may have a higher likelihood of getting an offer with A compared to B in something tech related.

I would love and appreciate some guidance that can hopefully put this in perspective for me and help me make a decision."

I had absolutely no clue in which subreddit i should ask this question so i hope i'm at the good place \^\^. And sorry if my English isn't perfect, i'll try my best to stay understandable :).Ive read many things on google to find an answer but on a page i'll read a thing, on the next i will read the opposite, and in the next page the question was asked 10 years ago.

So i guess nothing is better than asking the question myself \^\^.

I have a Laptop with inside a SSD and a HDD. Sadly both are close to full and that's why i'm here with this question.

I wanted to know if using an extern SSD (connected to my PC with a 3.0 USB port) can be interesting for example to install/play some games ? Will it be faster than an intern HDD?

I have two 3.0 USB and one 2.0 USB.

I suppose it won't be as fast as my intern SSD but can it be interesting for me to do that?

Won't the SSD be too much ""slowed"" by the fact that's its connected via USB ? If i copy some games from my intern HDD to the extern SSD will they start faster for example?

Hope you'll be able to answer me :).

Thanks !"

&amp;#x200B;

I've been into web development for two years now, and I'm working in the same company that's given me an internship right after I finished the programming courses. I'm grateful they took me in because, at that moment, I was desperate after failing every interview I went to and already had doubts whether programming was my thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Not that I'm not happy with my current position or the income, but I have a couple of acquaintances that graduated the same year and have achieved more in their programming carrier though, in their words, they have the same skills as me.

&amp;#x200B;

So yesterday, inspired by the stories of my friends, I tried to talk to my boss about a raise. I considered it was time to ask for it and that I was a valuable employee. However, when he asked me to provide a convincing reason why he should give me a raise, I couldn't find a better one except that I often take work home or stay late to finish the job.

&amp;#x200B;

He smirked and said that this only shows that, unlike my colleagues, I can't complete my tasks in time and isn't an indicator that I'm a professional in my field. His argument made me feel ridiculous. He said to return when I come up with a better reason for an increase. I apologized for taking his time and left his office.

&amp;#x200B;

Like it wasn't enough that my boss made me feel like a loser, a couple of hours later, the [UI test automation tool](https://www.zaptest.com/ui-testing-automation) we use displayed an array of bugs. When my boss saw the report, he gave me another smirk and a """"what were you saying?"""" gaze.

&amp;#x200B;

All that happened yesterday made me feel like crap, and I can't focus on anything else except that, despite all my experience and successful projects, I'm still not good enough. More now, I feel uncomfortable whenever seeing my boss. It's cringe and embarrassment in its pure form for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice? Are there some checkpoints that help distinguish a good programmer from a bad one? I'd really want to know my level."

I am a senior CS student and Fall 2022 will be my last semester at a California State University with a 3.8 GPA.

Unfortunately, I am an undocumented person, so I have not had a chance to get any internships.

I will graduate at the end of 2022, and I plan to move back to my home country in Spain where I intend to work as a software engineer. Due to personal reasons, I will stay in the US until Summer 2024, and then I’ll be in Spain.

I started working on a website as a project I could put on my resume, but I lost motivation since I can’t get a job for the next 2 years. I also thought about practicing for coding interviews, but I don’t wanna spend the next 2 years doing that without the possibility of getting a job, I feel like I’m gonna end up hating it if I do that.

How far in advance should I start practicing for coding interviews and continue my project to be ready when it’s time to move?

Is there any other advice you have that can help me be ready to succeed by the time I can work? I’m concerned this time off from CS can hurt my chances to land a job.

I’ve been presented with two internships that clash with one another and I’m torn on which one to go for. 

Choice #1 is a potential month long internship at a law firm that I might secure after going through a series of interviews. Currently, my school is preparing me for this by organizing a simulation of a law firm internship of sorts; we’re expected to come in 9 to 5 and will be trained but at the end of the day it’s up to the firms to hire us as interns (the simulation itself will also be considered a seperate mini internship of sorts). This is a good opportunity since it’s related to my career and I would learn lots but it will be unpaid, although it’d open doors for me to apply for more internships in the upcoming years and strengthen my network in the field. 

On the other hand, Choice #2 is a 6 week long paid internship for content writing where I’ll be given a stipend + commission based on my performance and there’s a possibility of me securing a high paying work from home job by the end if I happen to do well. The hours for this internship are flexible but I’m expected to complete two shifts of 4 hours each in a day. 

I’m torn since although #1 doesn’t pay anything I’ll learn a lot and gain corporate experience while doing something relevant to my field but on the other hand there’s no guarantee that I might land an actual internship after the simulation is done with (I’ll be taking the risk of giving up a guaranteed internship for one that I may not secure). On the other hand, #2 isn’t relevant to law in any way but it’s good money and comfortable working conditions. 

What should I go for, since the duration for both is overlapping and choosing one would mean giving up on the other (unless I somehow manage a 9 to 5 and the two four-hour long shifts at the same time which seems practically impossible)"

I am 21 years old, pursuing a degree in mathematics, my first encounter with programming was in Summer 2021, I learned C# and continued to do it for a good number of months (June 2021-November 2021) Then switched to python, now my learning was slow as I was doing university courses and none have python courses so the only time I am really consistent in programming was the summer, because no courses, nothing so I could throw 3-5 hours each day doing C#, I wanted to do games in C# then my friend told me that I have a math degree, why not pick up python / R and do machine learning. I saw linear algebra, probability, calculus etc etc in machine learning and data science thats all fine by me I have the background. BUT, it seems very competitive, I graduate in spring 2023 I am not sure if I have enough time to learn so many things, in so little time, get an internship then get hired as a data analyst / data scientist. I have been doing SQL for the past 3 weeks, and I really find it... boring? But I keep doing it lol. Then again what's discouraging me is not that I have to learn so much which is fine you keep learning your whole life you don't just stop. But the amount of time I need to get... a job? I only have a year left at uni, afterwards... lmao

Web dev on the other hand seems very, interesting I mean you make websites, web applications, web games, web-anything its just really nice and I'd love to make a fancy website presenting my resume, that could be a project on its own too! Then again data analysis is tempting, all because I have a math degree so with math I won't struggle much! I read the whole book of ISLR (Intro to statistical learning) did most the exercises (in R, also is R used in DS jobs? Most people I hear are doing python) , and plan to give it a re-read this summer to go further in depth (I did it during the semester alongside my courses, some concepts were not crisp clear to me)

My lacking part in programming is probably data structures and algorithms, I know some algorithms (Binary search a classic, its a classic because its in every course, book, tv show and movie ITS EVERYWHERE, some sorting algo's like quick sort, heap, bubble etc..)

the things I just began writing some basic projects using OOP in python, as well as learning libraries (Seaborn, pandas, numpy) and also some libraries for automation and web stuff (selenium, bs4, requests)

I have to learn AWS too? Or microsoft azure?

Do I have enough time? I am really in need of a guide here."

My gf and I had a rough year. I got into a burn-out, she had some other personal troubles. I made some mistakes (obv no cheating!!!). Also achieved some huge goals. She graduated college, I got an offer at a top constructional/building management company for an internship (thats something big here in the Netherland).

So, i wanted to celebrate big. Not only our achievements but also our love and relationship. I decided to book a suite! Got very pretty one with nice views and a spacious bathroom.

But, i want to take things further than some roses on the bed and bottle of wine.

We are both into small gestures and living the good life. 

Do you guys have any advice or inspiration for me?

That's where I become mad, I am the sole one building the product and currently someone who can competently work with the technology. Then dumating sa punto na namention ko na ung contract ko is until June 20 na lang since Internship lang naman ito. Then out of nowhere he send me a forged contract which he edited and may sign there na I signed last June 1, but I never did signed anything. He threatens that he will file a complaint, contact interpool and bring necessary legal action against me, which is somehow hindi valid since I didn't breach any contract. He say this remarks when I tell him that our relationship can't work anymore. I really feel threatened with this.

&amp;#x200B;

I have all the conversations and his forged documents. He threatens to sue me because he said I signed a new contract which I haven't. Never. Nada. I didn't sign anything. I don't want to work with this company anymore since I am being micromanaged and there is this time monitoring software installed on my PC all the time. Nakakawalang motivation.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still a student, it would be better if I have this internship as an experience right? But I think it's already been tainted. Now he plans to sue me if I leave, but there is no point since I didn't break any contract. He did forge a contract which he has sent me. What should I do? Should I sue back? Worth it ba ang effort? I'm earning 4 digits a month here and micromanaging is really getting into me. I think I can't continue with this setup. Do you know the process of suing a company, especially he did forged the document? And making me feel threatened? Is it worth it in my future career? I'm still a student doing an internship...  


Please guide me what decisions and actions to take."

Been feeling a bit lost lately. I’m 23 and graduated in 2020 with a Bachelors in Finance, but just barely passed my degree and didn’t have any internships. Couldn’t find any entry level jobs with my degree and I was getting rejected by firms left right and centre. 

I’m now working full-time as an entry level lab technician in the mean time, but just making very slightly above minimum wage. The work is very physically demanding, and I want to be in a role where it’s more technical and problem-solving focused compared to a routine physical job. I guess I just want something that’s mentally stimulating. 

I’m expecting a  $2-3/hr increase in the next few months as part of becoming an intermediate lab tech, and we have more career pathways to go from there (like Quality Assurance,  Team Leader etc) however from my coworkers’ experience a lot of their careers stagnate at the intermediate level with high levels of burnout and relatively low pay, despite putting in more work. Progression isn’t always guaranteed. I’m not really quite sure if I’m prepared to stay here for a couple more years for a chance I *may* get something better as I’m physically burnt out as it is. 

Relocation is not an option either as I’ve got family to support and my partner has a very stable teaching job in town he can’t just leave. 

Money is mostly the concern really, as my current job’s extremely underpaid for the amount of work expected and I’d like to be able to support my partner as well when we get a place together. 

Any tips and advice how to figure this one out, where could I go, would be highly appreciated :) Thank you!"

This is more of a rant than anything particular. I am just constantly dismayed at how competitive the engineering tech scene is in this country - with the worst part being the fact that we are basically fighting for scraps

I see all these resumes on this subreddit, with so many skills, so many awesome achievements and contributions, and then you have these guys asking how to land a 10 lpa job? Like wtf, is the market that saturated? 

I see students doing fucking unpaid internships and being grateful about it, like no the company is fucking exploiting you. Imo unpaid internships should be illegal, but we have millions of people falling over themselves to get these

This really leads to a snowball effect where even talented devs are vulnerable. Companies know that they can do whatever they want to employees and we will just take it. In many tier 3 and 4 colleges, people are happy to get into WITCH. These are talented guys with decent skills who deserve far far better

It's really disheartening, and with more and more people getting into coding, with more and more resources available to people, this will get much much worse imo. (I'm not saying it's a problem that people have these resources now, just that without a change in mindset, every employee is just a little more screwed). 

As someone from IIT, I am a bit insulated from stuff like unpaid interns and 3 lpa witch jobs. But at the end of the day, I am acutely aware that whether I make 20 or 30 or 50 lakhs or whatever, there are millions of people who are willing to work 15 16 hours a day for 10% of the pay, breaking themselves for the opportunity

It's pretty damn sobering. And can we even do something about it?"

I've had interviews with 10 different companies, vast majority of which are full time positions. and usually make it past the first conversation stage  round.

In the time I was gone, my direct supervisor, our team leader, two other supervisors, and one subordinate on the team moved to other teams in the company. 

This concerned me, but I am trying to be open minded. I opened my computer after a week being offline trying to set up my equipment and I never got any welcome email from any of my new team. This hurt my feelings slightly because it seems like they don’t care about me being here.

I’m worried about this and it is a stark contrast to my treatment last year. Everyone welcomed me with open arms and now, it’s crickets.

My role is also very different than what I expected. Since I came on after being an intern, they just placed me in a role— I didn’t apply for this specifically. 

I’m wondering if I should try to find another role or how long I should wait before looking. If this is how it’s starting out, I don’t see it getting much better…. a big reason for me accepting the role was because of the company culture and team spirit and now all that is gone. But do I risk a good salary and remote position just because they aren’t being welcoming?

I have enough credits to graduate this December and I am currently enrolled in all the classes I need to graduate for this fall.

I’ve been told by both my parents and advisor to graduate early as i can start making money sooner and save money from not having to pay for the spring semester. However almost all of my friends have advised me to stay for the spring semester and take more classes because I am only in college once and I have the rest of my life to work and make money. My Girlfriend also gave me this advice and I am having trouble deciding what I want to do. I am majoring in computer science and am currently doing an internship that I enjoy, I don’t have any full time offers yet but hope to get one either from my internship or during the fall semester. I don’t have any intention on going to get a masters or PHD at least not right out of college.

Another side note is that my parents have stated that since I have the ability to graduate early they will make me pay for the spring semester if I decide to stay. This seems fair to me as they have payed all my college expenses thus far and me staying for the spring semester would only really be for my enjoyment before I graduate.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

vc5ebi,3,2022-06-14,I feel pigeon holed,stuart0613,ucf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/vc5ebi/i_feel_pigeon_holed/,"I'm assuming like most people out there, I had no idea what I wanted to do going into college and I really only went because it was the next step up, and presumably the best thing to do after graduating high school. I chose to go to UCF because it was the closest decent state school to my house, and because I could commute and cut costs. I did want to go to Valencia for 1-2 years because it was closer, it would cut costs further, and because I wouldn't have to choose my major as soon as I got into college, but due to being pressured into going to UCF by my dad (""because it's more prestigious than Valencia""), I came here anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

Next thing you know, I'm going into a Business Management PreMajor because my dad works in business and I thought I would just choose the major as a secure choice. I did pretty much the bare minimum because I didn't particularly care for what I was doing, however I switched to PreFinance a year or so into the PreManagement major because I thought that Finance would give me a more specific, and thus more sought out degree. I don't fault myself for the logic I used, however I should've known better and researched the major and \*especially\* the careers I would have to choose coming out of college. Turns out, I don't want to work 60-80 hours a week on average and have a shitty work-life balance.

&amp;#x200B;

The third year of college was pretty nice. Since I was going into upper level classes, I had smaller class sizes, I started caring more about finance, and started acing most of the classes. To put it into perspective, I have a 3.4 overall GPA, a 3.3 CoB GPA, and currently a 3.9 for my Finance GPA. And Since my interest in  Finance was growing, I thought it was natural that I look up the type of careers I could get out of my Major. Although there are more to it than just these two, the most popular choices seemed to be to become an Investment Banker or a Corporate Finance Analyst. IB is notorious for extremely high work hours and horrible QoL and for a lot of people are used as a stepping stone into Equity Banking, Hedge Funds, and other buy side careers. Corporate Finance is often regarded as boring and repetitive. I played with both ideas, and decided that this type of work isn't something that I would want to do. Not only is UCF FAR from being a target school for investment banks, I'm not willing to slave my life away for high income. I also know the type of person I am and Corporate Finance is far from something I'd want to spend the rest of my life doing. (And the careers I could transition to weren't too appealing either.)

&amp;#x200B;

What I finally found out I wanted to do after 3 years in college, was tech. For the most part tech has good pay, good work-life balance, and plenty of intellectually stimulating work. My brother has gotten into tech and was able to obtain an internship in webdev through self studying programming and so I had a bit of exposure to it, and it  is something academic I actually feel like I enjoyed doing on my own time which is almost unheard of for me. Specifically though, I believe I would enjoy Data Science more so than other tech jobs or pure programming jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is where my pigeon holed feeling kicks into place. I'm 3 years into a completely unrelated major with almost none of the prereqs for CS completed. I haven't taken the math placement exam because I never cared about college (going into it), and planned to only take college algebra and some other introductory math class that the business premajors required. I'm not even bad at math (was able to pass AP Calc AB and AP Stats in HS with little effort) and due to the countless PreReqs I  have to take, I don't think I can even switch into the CS Major due to having too many credits (although I will try to talk to an advisor about this). Because of this, I ended up adding a second major in Economics with a Business Analytics track because I want to transition into the tech field, and since I feel like I have no other option left. I'm also self studying Calc 1 over the summer to try to test out of Calc 1 at UCF so I have more options in regards to math classes I can take to potentially get a Math Minor. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, I want to become a Data Scientist. To get there, I've added the second major (Econ Business Analytics track) and will be trying to add a math minor for when I attempt to get into grad school. I'm playing around with a couple of ideas and other factors I should look at when deciding my specific path into tech but ultimately it seems really hard to achieve what I want due to the limitation in credit hours and the lack of prerequisite courses I have. I'm doubting whether or not the Econ major would even really help, and if I should focus all in on completing math courses at UCF and just graduate with a Finance Major and a Math Minor, or if I should try to jam pack both majors and the minor in order to look appealing for grad school, or if I should completely hop ship and switch to a CS major by taking a year off to self study so I can override some prereqs by passing the calc 1 exam and possibly the CS foundational exam. There are so many options I'm looking at, and the more and more I look into it, the more complex the solution seems to become, and the less hope I see in myself making it.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I feel as though I CAN become a data analyst (or a business analyst) which is better than before, but I want more than just becoming a data analyst. But I'm so severely underprepared to become something I WANT. I wish I could just redo the past 3 years of College, but I can't control that so It's rough knowing what to do. It's also rough not having the support of some people in my life that I wish would just even listen to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, thanks for reading this rant if you made it all the way through. If you have any tips, I would gladly appreciate anything I can get :)

Tl; Dr - I realized too late (3 years) into college that Finance/Business isn't something I wanted to do. There are a lot of factors that go into it, but I'm severely unprepared if I were to try to transition into the field I want to go into (tech). It's rough out here lol, and the more research I do, the more hopeless it seems. I'm trying at several ways to try to break into what I want to do (data science), but It's hard.

I'm currently doing an internship, and it's very much ""heres your work, come back in a fortnight for the sprint review"". Different teams may as well be a different company. As in, there's 0 social interaction between projects.

People work quietly and get work done, rarely communicating or laughing/joking around, or anything. I honestly think I start over half of the conversations in the office. It honestly seems like the stereotype of the quiet nerd is true. You can ask for help, but it's very much back to normal after the problem is solved. I don't think I've heard anyone laughing in the office for at least a week atm. I do work in the defence sector, so maybe this is a factor

I've also applied to a lot of companies, and they say something like ""we have a sausage sizzle every 3 months"" as if one social event every 90+ days is anywhere close to enough. A lot of them also say working from home is the default, which I just cannot do.

Basically, my highest workplace priority is a friendly environment, having a good laugh (obviously not to the extent where work suffers), and meeting new people (clients/team members/etc). (I am extremely extraverted)

It's gotten so bad at my current workplace that I'm thinking I should have gone into a different discipline all together.

What industry would be best for my needs, and what job specifically? Project lead would mean I get to talk to a bunch of clients, but I can't think of any other jobs that would get me the level of interaction I need. Hell, a call centre gets more conversations than I do.

Perhaps something in team management? but I do still really LOVE programming. How can I combine my love of programming with my extraverted nature?"

**Letters of Recommendation**

AP Chemistry/Seminar &amp; Research Teacher (7/10): talked to him a lot, came for help, small class size in Seminar and Research really boosted our relationship, but at the same time, he asked for a resume and literally forgot about half the stuff I've done, plus he doesn't really love me over the moon but we have a respectable relationship.

AP Lang (5/10): It was virtual so I had a harder time making relationships with teachers. I did try coming in and asking questions a lot, but generally we didn't talk that much.

Comp Sci Teacher (6/10): This guy is really dry and has a reputation in the school. He actually got mad when I first asked him to write for me since he said it was too late but he eventually did it. We have a weird Mr. Miyagi relationship like most other students where he sometimes likes when I ask questions and seems like he likes me but also doesn't have much patience and tends to roast people. Plus, I got a B in his class in senior year, so I only submitted to a few schools.

Local University Research Mentor (9/10): Really good relationship, worked closely with them a lot, really nice guy, plus we had the benefit of the science fair awards and presentations.

T10 Research mentor (7/10): Nice guy, super chill tbh, we talk a lot and he seems to like me, but I don't think I stood out in any particular way.

Internship Mentor (8/10): Worked with a lot during the internship, asked a lot of questions and was interested in the work, plus I brought him on as a board member of my non profit

Local Clinic Mentor (9/10): Really nice person, I enjoyed working with her a lot, and she was so encouraging!

Counselor (6.5/10): We've talked a lot about the college process and she knows about my accomplishments but otherwise we aren't really close together.

**Interviews**

Georgetown (7/10): My interviewer was the sister of someone who was literally in my grade lmao. Nice interview overall, answered the questions well, and asked a lot, pretty standard. She came 15 minutes late though and then apologized in her response to my thank you email, and her sister said the same thing to.

MIT (7/10): Pretty standard, talked about how it was a problem solving school, gave some nice responses to the more weird questions, but could've been better.

UPenn (5/10): It was ok, but I kinda didn't have special reasons for why I wanted to go to UPenn. Mostly standard.

Northwestern (8/10): Really liked overall. Interestingly, the interviewer scheduled for early January, then got COVID and ghosted me for 2 weeks, then responded back and we had our interview. We connected on a lot of issues and she said I gave unique answers to a lot of the things she asked. Only weak spot was the question on how I'll contribute to Northwestern.

Tufts (9/10): Also really really enjoyed this interview. The questions were weird but I answered pretty well. It was also kind of short so we just conversed for another 20 minutes afterwards.

**Essays**

Common App (7/10): Interesting concept on food and failure, pretty decent overall, though nothing special. I had a college counseling service help me with this which did not go well at all, but I got through it.

Supplements (8/10): Pretty good, I liked them a lot, most of them were really good though some could've been better.

**Thoughts/Reflection:**

I previously posted this but decided to repost since I've had a lot of reflection and sort of a catharsis. My graduation is happening this week and honestly I've been so fixated on college admissions stuff for so long that I kinda realized I needed to move on, so I am reposting this so that 

I was initially kind of sad and disappointed by my results. First, for context, while my GPA might look high, its actually pretty average for my school system. I knew my GPA wasn't that good but a) I had an upward trend and b) I tried compensating with ECs and test score. I had so many worries and dreams about the application season since I wanted a school with the intellectual fit (I had a lot of bullying and loneliness experiences throughout my life so I really wanted an escape so much). I really hoped that colleges would look past my GPA and see my other aspects of my application. And honestly, I don't know if they did or not, but honestly it shouldn't matter. My biggest regrets are obviously my GPA, but then also taking college counseling, applying to BS/MDs, trying to do more niche majors like History of Science without realizing I didn't fit with it, and not doing a good enough job to make myself known to teachers/counselors, as you can tell with my recs.

I ultimately committed to URochester since I started exploring the school more and realized I really enjoyed it (open curriculum, very good for research, nice community, etc) but I was having so much doubt and feeling that I could've done better, as well as regret on if I had wasted high school or not. But I remembered something one of my teachers said, which was that no matter what, at the end of this process, you will ultimately find a school that you enjoy and fit in. I initially kind of shrugged this statement as just another fairytale but now have come to realize it happened to me; Rochester offered a lot of what T20s offered and in some ways was kind of better.

So at the end of the day, no matter what happens, things can work out, even if they don't seem to initially. T20s and similar schools are great but a) just getting into college is an achievement itself and I think I didn't really appreciate that, and b) you can still find a good education, environment and opportunities no matter where you go. And with that, I'm leaving all the college app subs (A2C, chanceme, etc) and I'm just going to move on and focus on college and getting into med school. So peace out ig."

I'm 21 years old and currently doing a bachelor's in IT. I will be in my final year now after a month (Entering the 7th Semester). It's going to be long.

&amp;#x200B;

I will be sharing a little story about me and will be brutally honest, I never studied in college, I passed my exams through a little studying and cheating, and I didn't care about anything as I had a ""We'll see"" attitude. I didn't enjoy my college life either...I have zero friends in college...I see all these people have friend groups...I didn't have one...I tried but I guess I suck at communication skills, well anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

About 3 months ago I started talking with a girl at college, She was my sort of crush (damn this is super embarrassing). I asked her out...went on a few dates...fast forward...she became my girlfriend and I couldn't believe my luck. I just enjoyed and had fun for the initial time period of the relationship and didn't care about anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Soon, we started talking about careers and all...she had great goals, she is very ambitious and I know she will achieve those goals. We are both from good well-to-do families, I won't say I'm spoiled and don't respect money...I respect money a lot and I respect my dad for all his hard work.

Her dad is a super-rich guy, I don't think he will ever let a loser like me marry his daughter realistically.

I started creating a plan...of what I will do in the future...I decided to work hard for me and for her.

I still don't know anything! no c++, no java, no DSA, no DS...NOTHING!

&amp;#x200B;

Placement in college will start in 3 months and I have no skills. Bangalore is the IT hub of India and that's my goal, to get a job there...a good job. But I don't even know if it is even possible to learn a skill in 3 Months AND given my competition will be classmates and collegemates who did a shit ton of interns and have good work experience as compared to someone like me.

&amp;#x200B;

This is what I thought:

1. Get AWS cloud certification
2. Do web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS AND PHP)
3. Learn Data structures (I'm very scared of them, but my professor said ""these are the most important to crack interviews).
4. Finally shifting to Data Science (I like this field, The pay is good and it looks interesting).

&amp;#x200B;

In 3 Months I want to do 1, 2, and 3.

I don't think I have a chance but I want to do something, for me, for her, for my family, to make my dad proud, My eyes have opened, please guide me as your dumb younger brother.

Thanks"

I was 23, and got a job in the config lab of a big system integrator doing PC setups.   Well we started hearing about this internet thing, and companies started putting drivers on websites that we needed.   But the Old God who ran out IT, didn’t see a need to run ethernet back to the lab.   

I watched him one day write his own driver for an I/O card in assembler with a logic probe.   He was like that.   Anyways my cohorts and I wanted to be networking and server guys.   But there was a big debate about ethernet vs token ring, and so my company was trying to decide a winner.  So he kept telling us to wait. 

Well one day we found an old token ring MAU.   We installed token ring cards in client PCs all the time.   So we built a computer that had both an ethernet card and a token ring mau.  We ran IP as a bridge to our lab, and then bridged it to ipx on the Lan.   To help us out, we went to a computer that had internet and just copied the settings.   (It was a different time)

But low and behold it worked. Kind of. We had internet in the lab for a couple of days. 

But unbeknownst to us the OLd God was having 14 hour days trying to find out why his Internet gateway kept going offline.  After a week he found his way to our little band of upstarts.   By that time we had built a whole little hive of our own network using pilfered static network configurations from various locations on the network.   He caught us as one of the guys was trying to ghost the netware server. 

Our reward for this was that the company paid a network engineer to give us all networking training because if they didn’t, we would just experiment.   He made us build our own config network and do our pirate stuff on that.   

That guy taught us security because we kept messing with his computer in class to drop rude pictures on his desktop. 

I am now one of the New Gods of tech support. And I am convinced that 95% of all security of fighting out how to stop the crap we used to pull. 

Everyone once in a while, I get an intern who asks me how I learned my role.  I tell them, “long ago, there were Titians…”"

Still shitting bricks, overthinking all possible outcomes.

I am currently enrolled in a 6 month internship with company A as a Software engineer. As my internship is coming to an end in the next couple of weeks, I thought of pushing my luck and fetch a better offer from the market.
Company A is a good company and I enjoyed my time there but the pay they currently offer is below par which is obviously a big decision making factor. 
I got myself another offer from company ‘B’ that pays almost double what ‘A’ is offering me, So naturally I am inclined to accept it ASAP. 

I sign the offer letter, put todays date on it and wrote a delightful acceptance email before sending over to the HR of company B …… using my current employers official email id. 
I did then apologise and sent a new email using my own ID to HR of ‘B’.

Big fuck up. 

Best case scenario- nothing happens, ‘A’ ignores it and ‘B’ is none the wiser.
Worst case scenario- ‘A’ fires me tomorrow and ‘B’ thinks I am a jackass who should not be allowed near computers.

I shall update this as it goes! Maybe sharing it will make it less cringe.

Tldr- sent acceptance email for a new job to current HR using official email id.


Edit 1- company B doesn’t care! Received a acknowledgment email from them and they didn’t mention the email disparity!"

**Field within CS**: Nothing specific - Software, Systems

**Degree &amp; Undergraduate Institution Tier**: BTech + MTech CS, Top 3 IITs

**GPA**: 9.55 out of 10

**GRE**: 170Q, 162V, 5.5AWA

**Research Experience**: 1.5 year MTech Project - Very implementation heavy, not too much research work.

**Publications**: None

**Work Experience**: 1 Year at a famous hedge fund, 6 months as an intern, over two companies( 1 startup, 1 hedge fund).

**Universities Considered:**

* Georgia Tech
* CMU
* Stanford (MS&amp;E)
* Princeton
* UT Austin
* Columbia (#1 Priority, dream school)
* UCSD
* UCLA
* USC (Safety?)

Slightly worried about the fact that I have almost no proper research experience. My MTech project was more implementation based ( by choice ). But I'll only be applying to programs which are not thesis based. Would love to hear more choices I should consider, looking for more safety schools, as I know admissions are sometimes an absolute toss up.

Also, some schools don't allow dual masters, so I'm a bit skeptical.

Thanks!"

It was a huge learning curve for me and by the time I graduated undergrad, I went into my phd with the intention of going into power. I had two internships at a utility in two different departments. But my research in my phd is cybersecurity for Distributed Energy Resources more on the system side, designing resilient control systems. I've had time to self reflect and I think because during my undergrad I was all over the place in terms of interest, I did well in my networking courses, my computer design courses, my programming courses, my signal processing courses. I have yet to get into machine learning/computer vision. But, I just have no idea because I have so many interests. I can't be wasting anymore time and this field is so vast. Any one else in this predicament or have advice?"
vcadn7,0,2022-06-14,Need help budgeting for a computer (3rd year university student),blake___firegaze,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/vcadn7/need_help_budgeting_for_a_computer_3rd_year/,"Hello,

I need a laptop for school plus I'm also due for a desktop upgrade. I plan to get a gaming desktop by the end of 2023. Currently, I have just over $1,300 saved up, but I can't afford the majority of Lenovo Thinkpad laptops with that budget. Also currently living with my parents so I don't have to worry about most expenses that I would have if I was living on my own. I have an iPad 6th generation, but I'm unsure how much longer it will last. Currently I am unemployed, I am also on the job search.

My program internship is in a year from now (summer 2023), and I've thought of 4 options if I can't get a part-time job by the end of the summer:

1. Just wait until the internship if I don't get a job now. I know that the program internship at my university requires a minimum of 400 hours at $14 per hour. This will net me a minimum of $5,600 in gross pay. I'm unsure of how much income tax I have to pay on that, but a quick google search says federal income tax is 15% on the first $49,020, and Ontario provincial income tax is 5.05% for the first $45,142. After income tax, I'll make at least $4,452 after this internship. The problem with this is, that I need my laptop for this September, not 2023.
2. Apply for a job on my university campus in the Fall semester, which will net me just over $2,000 after income tax (14 weeks at minimum wage for 15 hours a week). I use the iPad for one more semester; then I use the money to buy a Lenovo ThinkPad. I have to wait until August to apply for this.
3. Sell my iPad and apple pencil and get the cheapest possible Chromebook instead (though I will take a loss on this).
4. Enroll in an excel course on a website like Coursera to gain experience and use the iPad for one more semester (I'm still thinking on this one).

I'm still searching for a part-time job to work for the rest of the summer at the very least, I don't know where to continue the job search, and I'm not sure how feasible my backup plans are. Any insights would be appreciated."

I'm not saying that I'm doing the full job of an engineer, but our deal was that I would be the responsible for the position duties while the original engineer is working on some other projects.

I've been learning a lot (through pain) and I feel that I'm really building up experience here. It's also a great opportunity for me to be hired at the company after I graduate, which is a motivation.

The main issue is that the position demands a lot of time, so I've been doing 2 extra hours almost every day. And it's a bit sad to always be the last intern to leave the office.

I'm almost done with college, so I have only a few easy classes left, but I barely have free time now, because I leave work and have to go straight to the class, and by the time I get home I just want to sleep.

Any advice for time management and work x life balance is welcome.
I think I'm just missing the free time I used to have on my freshman days lol"

Long story short, I somehow secured a pre-MBA Product Manager internship at an enterprise tech company (think Salesforce) that’s meant for 1st-year MBAs (I’m the only PM not already in b-school). Seeing as most of the interns get full-time offers, I’m starting to wonder if I’ll get one as well? (it’s not guaranteed but just want to be ready)

I’m one month in and learning a ton, but it’s definitely not the exact company I’m looking to work for. On the other hand, I’ve got an offer to go to a T15 without any debt. 

My eventual goal is still PM, just more focused on an industry I’m really excited about. Would it be dumb for me to turn down the PM offer and go to school? I’m really excited about spending 2 years making a ton of friends, along with another internship opportunity next summer.

Please let me know if there’s something I’m not considering here."

Somehow managed to land a sell side equity research summer internship in NY. I guess this will be mostly be a rant with hope to hear about your internship experiences. 

Ever since my first day I’ve just been feeling anxious about every single task since I want to do the best for my analyst and actually make his life easier. But this anxiousness leads me to messing up tasks 

I’m not the best writer, it just takes me longer than your average person to write up a piece to make sure it sounds good. Some times when I have done it the analyst has used most of my work, but other times he changes a good amount. 

The hours during earnings szn are insane, worked 16 hour days for a week straight. I get it you people have experienced this but it was overwhelming for me. 

I just put pressure on myself I think but sometimes I feel like a lot is expected from me as an intern, but other times I’m like my analyst knows I’m an intern so maybe he doesn’t expect 100% with everything I do.

I’ve realized I do not want to work on the sell side going forward and sometimes dwell on this summer internship to just end.

I normally do overthink but my work anxiety has gone through the roof. 

I feel like I’m so under qualified for the job and I shouldn’t have been the one they chose, and I still wonder why I was chosen.

TLDR; I (24f) hate my job and want to quit but am nervous about taking the leap. I’m also worried about the job hunt and how leaving this job would look on my resume. Can I put a job I’ve been at for a few months on my resume or should I stick it out for a few more months?

If it isn’t obvious this is a throwaway account! A few of my friends and family members follow my real account and I don’t want them up in my business so to speak! I also changed a few details to make things less obvious if they see this! I also apologize in advanced for how ramble-y this post might be, I just finished working for the day!

I am a 24f who started a new job a few months ago. At first I thought I had landed my dream job. It checked all my boxes, 1. In Marketing, 2. Substantial Pay Raise, 3. Growing Company, 4. Great Company Culture (so I thought), 5. Small Team, and 6. In Person (I had been remote since graduating in 2020). There are a few draw backs (1 hour commute in/1.5 hour commute home, obligations to work some weekends, and no benefits) but nothing that tripped the alarm bells. 

So I took the job… and immediately regretted it. My coworkers my age had formed a tight clique with no room for a newbie and the office manager was a nightmare (total you know what) making the office culture basically horrible. (Think entire office of 10 goes to lunch together without telling me or my supervisor and people not responding when you say good morning, etc.). The work load ended up being WAY more than I was expecting based on my job description and the pressure/micromanaging was insane. 

My partner and I went on a preplanned vacation about a month after I started and I broke down during the trip about how much I regretted my decision. We talked about our financial options and what to do next, and I came to the conclusion I needed to stick it out at least until they could be done with their internship (unpaid) and start their career.

So I’ve been trudging through and things seemed to actually be looking up. My supervisor is really cool and I really love his guidance (talk about a silver lining). The office manager ended up leaving (miracles happen) and the pressure/micromanaging backed off with his departure. And just generally things looked like they were on the up and up! 

Jump to a few weeks later, I am at my wits end once again! The work load is crazy, I get into the office at 8 work until 5:30, get home at 7, work until bedtime, and repeat. And it’s literally never enough for upper management. Whatever I do, it could have been done faster, or better, or just in a different color according to them.

Sometimes I find myself close to tears during the day, sitting and eating my lunch alone in my car just to avoid being asked to change something during my break, neglecting my personal relations during the weekend because I am still working, and honestly just dreading each day I have to walk into the office. My mental health is at an all time low and I’m honestly tired of some job ruining my life.

I want to quit, but I feel like with an incoming recession that quitting would be the dumbest decision considering the good money I am making now. Like most people I live paycheck to paycheck and am always stressed about money lol, so I’m not sure if I should scrounge and quit now or keep working and job hunt during my lunch break.

I’m worried about the job hunt and how leaving this job would look on my resume. Can I even put a job on my resume that I’ve only been at for 3 months? 

I would really appreciate any advice! Thank you in advance to all those who comment and read this far! Again sorry for the rambling post!"

I just completed my boards for 12th( commerce) grade a week ago. Earlier this year I was very confused on what degree I should do. I had joined a coaching centre for cuet back in December and when I talked to the mentor there he suggested me to take the ipmat exam and apply for bba as it one of  the 'best' degree. As I get closer and closer to the exam dates I feel even less motivated to study for them (including cuet). I'm just as confused now as I was in the beginning of the year. 

I have been thinking about taking a gap year so that I can take a break from the constant pressure of studies that has me burnt out for more than a year now and to maybe get a better understanding of what I want. 

I have a few ideas on what I can do during this time (do a communication skills course, learn guitar, and I have also been looking up if there is some kind of internship I can do) but I don't know if I should do it. My dad was the one who suggested in a fleeting conversation that I can always take a gap year but my mom is a bit hesitant about it. 
There's also this fear that what if I do take the year and at the end of that I still don't know what I want to do. 

Can anyone provide me with some advice and what I can do to make my year more productive if I do end up taking the year off?"

I'm hoping to use this account to explore issues with my parents and the trauma they left me. You may see more postings from me soon, unfortunately. This is going to be long, so I apologize beforehand.

For reference, my parents are first-gen immigrants that fled a war-torn country some time ago. They had my siblings and me in the USA. In addition, TW: Child abuse, suicide, etc.

When my parents learned that they were pregnant with me, my dad was ecstatic. We're Southeast Asian, and my dad had always wanted a child to share the same zodiac as him (tiger). But, when they learned that I was a girl, there was a definite sense of disappointment growing up. My mother subsequently gave my dad a boy, and it felt as if they spent all of their energy on him. They even gave him the same name as me (a lot of people mistake us as twins because of this).

The favoritism wasn't obvious to me at first, but it became blatant in high school. My brother (who I will just call Y) was treated significantly better than me. When I wanted to join the school art club, my parents badgered me to give it up because it was too burdensome to drive me there. So reasonably, I asked if I could learn how to drive. However, my dad laughed it up, stating where would I go? I barely had any friends (because I wasn't allowed to visit any unlike my brother), and I didn't have work. 

When I wanted to participate in an internship, my dad screamed at me for even considering it. He kept reminding me that no one would be willing to drive me to the internship. This was typical of my childhood, especially with my mother. She'll blame me for our family's financial ruin, how I was a mistake, how I wasn't really her child, and that I looked too 'chinky' to be southeast Asian... etc. I ask myself what did I do as a child for my mom to hate me so much... But, I never really did find out.

On the flipside, if Y wanted to learn how to drive, my parents were quick to spend hundreds of dollars to take him to lessons. They spent thousands of dollars on his new car, they bought him a new phone, encouraged him to join clubs, and they even allowed him to work! The favoritism was so obvious, that even my older siblings (A and B) noticed it. One of the most obvious things was my father would beat my siblings and me for failing to meet academic goals. For whatever reason, Y never got physically punished for this, but AB and Me were. Even when Y's grades were far worse than ours, he never got punished for it.

Eventually, things escalated where Y started to bully me. If I breathed differently or coughed weirdly, he would break down in hysterics about how I was abusing him. My mother would lash out at me, wailing how I was such a violent kid. If I try to explain myself, my mother and Y would accuse me of being pathological liars. Things had gotten so severe that I have considered killing myself countless times. When my father learned about it, he told me I should do it.

After that, something in me broke. By age 12, I knew I wanted to get away from my family as far as possible, but by age 18, I felt horrible. I kept asking myself what did I do as a child to deserve this? How could my parents look at a child and see so much hate? Eventually, I did leave and pursued a school in the countryside to avoid my parents. But when I realized I had no skills, no social skills, no driving skills, nothing-- I returned home. I had no friends, I was lonely. My parents often threw this to my face for the next year until I got into their 'dream school.'

I'm in my mid-20s now. Most of my peers from high school graduated ages ago. I can't help but feel stupid, but It's been a work in progress. I've learned a lot about myself. For example, I was a sickly child and my parents hid my medical files from me citing it was for my own good. I nearly died due to auto disease while studying at my new school. Interestingly, when I realized I needed to go to the ER, I texted Y to take me there (he was attending the same school). However, he texted back saying he was too busy with classes to bother. Later that evening, my doctor was relieved that I came because I was in sepsis. I am doing a lot better now, but I will be disabled for the rest of my life.

My brother Y graduated earlier than me. I was still in the city studying when he moved back home. He lost his room after running away (he attacked my mom when she asked him to take a break from overworking). So, he asked If he could use my room for the time being until he and his GF could move out to her condo. Even though we fought a lot, even though he made me suicidal, even though I am now diagnosed with mental illnesses due to my family, I said agreed to it. Part of me wants to lash out at him or my family for hurting me for years, but I don't think I have the energy to do so. Not to mention his partner was disabled and needed a bed to sleep on. As a disabled person, I wasn't going to punish her for my brother's crimes. 

I eventually apologized for all my hysterical outbursts as a child, teenager, and young adult. My parents refused to let me see a therapist at all because they didn't believe in it. I later find out I was neurodivergent and had a plethora of mental illnesses due to the abuse. My relationship with Y by this point seemed alright. We even suggested that I should move into the condo with him and his GF because job prospects were better in the city.

Anyway, I am graduating this year (yay me). My Lease ended early, so I will be commuting to school for my final classes. When I returned home, my brother's GF moved out to spend time with her family. I was under the expectation that my room would be returned to me. He said I could sleep on the ground because there were no more rooms/beds, and then they would move to the condo with me. However, a few days later, my brother tells me that they no longer wanted me at the condo. No biggie. But then he still refused to leave the room. 

I know this was very entitled of me to even move back home, I know I should be taking care of myself by now. But unlike my siblings, my parents didn't want to pay for my tuition. Unlike A,B,Y, I had no savings in my name, I have nothing. I was hoping to stay at the family house until I had landed a job and decent savings to live on my own. At first, I had no complaints about sleeping on the ground but because of my disability, it became really painful. My mother told me I was supposed to suck it up because I was my brother's big sister. 

However, my sister B, was not having any of it. Like me, she was forbidden to do anything with her life. She tried to go back to school but fumbled out because my parents pressured her into careers she never loved. She screamed at my brother to get out. He eventually did but started to plead because his girlfriend was going to return back to the place. B wanted to know why can't they move out, to which he argued he had 'financial goals (traveling, music lessons, etc) that he needed to save up for. He was well-established, owned stocks, and had thousands of dollars in his savings. But sleeping on the ground was unbearable. What about his disabled girlfriend? (Who by the way, is an heiress to a rich company, and is currently vacationing at a hotel in the city). B told him more or less to pound sand and get the fuck out of the house.

It's been only a week since the incident. I'm sort of happy that B stood up for me. I am not close to my siblings, so to see someone advocate for me felt surreal. However, my parents had since started to escalate the manipulation. My mother would come into my room, blaming me for all of the family issues. Y would cry to our father about how he feels abandoned by us and 'practically' kicked out. Every day, my mother would vent how horrible I've been, how I don't really need a bed/room. How I'm not that disabled (my disability was so bad, I had to leave school for a season). 

Looking back now, looking back at my life, I still keep wondering. What did I do for my parents to hate me? I brought it up to my siblings, Y and A say I'm being dramatic and hysterical again. However, B feels as if Y and A cannot understand the abuse because they're both men. She believes me, she was there when it happened. She witnessed the abuse as well as A... It's lonely. I know I said that already. But I just wished I came home to a family that was happy to see me. I just have 1 more class then I can graduate this summer. Then I can start my life right? But why do I feel so sad. What did I do to deserve this? Why do I feel so unwanted here. Am I being so entitled? Burdensome? I wish someone would tell me I'm not wrong to feel this way. 

Anyways, thanks for listening to me rant. I guess, I wanted to write it somewhere from my friends (yes I have friends now!). I've tried my best to condense this as small as possible.. but it didn't pan out very well. There's a lot of more details to this situation, and I will probably vent more in the future. Anyway, again, thank you for listening to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;Dr.  My parents hated me ever since I was born. They had a son after me, who they absolutely adore. I'm trying to move home but my brother took my space, and now that I finally got him out of my room, my parents are angry at me for hurting him. I'm trying to make sense of why do they hate me so much?"
vcnsie,30,2022-06-15,Should I pursue a very suspicious internship with extremely unprofessional people just because a it is related to the field I'm interested in or should i wait around for another opportunity?,internindistess,Indian_Academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indian_Academia/comments/vcnsie/should_i_pursue_a_very_suspicious_internship_with/,"My qualifications: 4th year law student

I'm in 4th year of my BBA LLB course from a tier 3 law college. I have come to develop an interest in IPR and i wish to pursue it further in my career. 

I have done a few internships but none of them were exclusively related to IPR so I've been having trouble getting accepted for an internship at any IPR firm. 
Aside from my legal internships I pursued a social media marketing and content writing internship in my first year.

Recently I got accepted at this IPR solicitation company. When i spoke to them it seemed like they were more interested in my background as a content writer (which is why it seemed like they accepted me in the first place).

They told me to come visit their office on a specific day so that we can discuss the details. When i went there the door was locked. I came back home and i got a call from someone from one of the staff members saying that they had messaged (not whatsapp, not mail. But messaged) me earlier that the office was closed today (Note that they told me to visit them exactly on that particular day and then the next day they messaged me the office was closed.). I get that it was partly my fault that i didn't see the message but it still seemed a bit unprofessional.

The next day when i visited them i saw that there were only 3-4 people working in their entire office.  The office was pretty big and is supposed to easily accommodate over 15-20 people. I get that there must be some explanation so i overlooked that. 

They told me that half the time they'll teach me stuff about IPR and during the other half I'll be required contribute to their organisation with content writing and any other stuff that they might ask of me. It seemed like a win-win situation at the time but I've worked there for a two days and all they have done is give me non-legal work. 

Today was supposed to be my third day of the internship. I was 10 mins late because of the traffic. As soon as i reached i got a call from them saying that the office is closed today. It's getting a bit annoying at this point. 2 out of 5 times when I've been to their office i had to come back immediately because the office was unexpectedly closed.

I feel like i won't get to learn anything. The work environment and the people seem very unprofessional. However at the same time I'm very desparate. I feel like if i somehow get through this internship it'll be easier for me to be accepted at other IPR firms. 

I'm very confused about what i should do now."

Do you have any ideas on what should I do next? I can't go back to school or afford expensive courses.

I was wondering if someone has a similar experience to me here.

I understand most HFTs use C++, though I think this won't be too difficult to learn considering I'll be learning Java. My main issue, from reading a bit on this sub, is that most applicants are considerably more experienced, having done a BSc in CompSci with FAANG internships and a dense portfolio of coding projects.

All in all, can someone give me some guidance on how I can better myself and succeed in this? Will the conversion masters help me out enough?

I am thinking of switching my major from CS to CM. I am currently a rising junior. I'm just wondering if being a CM major will hurt my chances in the future. I currently have a data engineering internship at a top financial firm this summer and will likely get an offer to intern next summer and then will likely receive a return offer when I graduate. I am interested right now in pursuing data science/data engineering as a career. I enjoy CS however I hate school. My mental health has drastically declined and at this point I just want to graduate. Right now I would have to work very hard (take at least 17/18 credits a semester on top of other things) to graduate in about 4.5 to 5 years and mind you I am a oos student so I can't really afford it😭 However, as a CM major I could probably do it in 4 while maintaining a good GPA, and my mental health. However, if being a CM major would hurt my career prospects(in software development, data science etc) despite data/software engineering internship excperience then I don't want to risk it.
Thanks in advance!🤗"

It was an internship and the process wasn't soul-destroying.

Then for the last 6 years I have been self-employed and instead of finding a job, I have been finding new sales, new customers. So in a way, it is quite similar. 

Now I want to switch career and looking to find a job. The recruitment process now is so soul-destroying almost as if it was designed to destroy your self-esteem.

What could be more depressing than sending out 200 aplications and hear nothing back, and there is no feedback either so if you don't get the job, you don't even know why so you can't improve.

I gotta say I understand why people want to be their own boss. Employers seem to have such an unfair advantage. They require so much from you and they probably pay peanuts. I even saw 1 post on reddit earlier about a guy posting advert for entry level retail job with minimum wage pay and he was surprised no one was serious enough to include a customized Cover Letter! Ha!! 

And employers expect you to do research about their company culture while at the same time they spend no more than 10 seconds looking at your CV.

It’s an office internship (though really more just a part time role since there is no set end date or curriculum). Without going into too much detail, it’s paid but only hourly and only a little over minimum wage - a lot of coffee shops in the area pay more tbh. 

I was fine with this coming out of school because I wanted to avoid a big gap at any cost, and needed some professional experience working in an office. I excelled in my degree, went to a reputable university and came out with fantastic grades, but unfortunately the degree subject went from being seen as quite valuable to being very undervalued over the course of my studies due to some larger political things I won’t get into. For those reasons I was just happy to have found something. 

It’s a small office and I’ve been given a lot of responsibilities. There is only one full time employee and when he is off, I run the entire office in his place. It’s become pretty obvious to me that the workload doesn’t really suit the pay, nor the job title. 

My employer has continually spoken about promoting me to a full time position for this reason, but keeps putting it off for one reason or another. Most recently, I was told I would be starting full time next month, then this was rescinded due to me having a scheduled week off next month and it being ‘better for me to start full time when I’m done taking entire weeks off’ - this feels like a red flag to me because obviously I should still be entitled to statutory annual leave when I’m full time and they should have some plan to cover for me when I do? But frankly I think it was another excuse anyway. 

I really like my employer as a person and I appreciate the difficulties of running a small business, so I don’t want to be too pushy. At the same time, I need to progress my career at some point and I feel I’ve outgrown the role. Part of me wants to believe the promise that there’s some opportunity for progression, but my family has suggested I should start looking for other opportunities. 

Anyone else had a similar experience at the start of their career and any advice? Is it best to stay in one place and just stick it out?"

Hey guys, I’m a year 12 student looking to study chemical engineering at Australia, I’ll try keep this as short as possible, I just have a couple of questions that’s all:

1) How hard is Chemical Engineering? I’m good with hard topics and I can handle them, but I’ve heard that Chem Eng. is the hardest Engineering major. This is important because this leads me to part 2:

2) Is a double degree/major worth it? I’m thinking of doing a double degree in Chemical Engineering and Pharmaceutical Sciences, and the course should take 5 years. However, I’ve been receiving contrasting opinions on this, as people have said that Chem Engineering shouldn’t be done with a double degree. Furthermore, would doing a double degree prevent me from doing things like internships and actually doing well in chemical engineering since you have to take the time to study for both. 

3) stemming from question 2, am I better off just getting my masters and a bachelor degree as opposed to a double degree and potentially a masters?

Main goal: want a career in chemical engineering.


Any and all responses are appreciated :)"

How to Leave my Job and Get my Dad to Change his Life,TrynaTravelLol,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/vcu1ph/undervalued_at_the_family_business_how_to_leave/,"I (24F) just graduated from university with a Master's Degree in Criminal Justice this past May. The job search has been difficult as I am specifically looking to enter a research field, policy management, or investigations so these areas take time for applications to process. The pandemic has also taken a toll on the job search, as most places are looking for heavily experienced workers. I have great internship experiences at both the federal and state level, yet I am still searching for an opening.

I currently have been working for my dad's company since 2021 as he expressed his need for help with running operations. He runs a small transportation business that dispatches truckers to the piers and delivers containers to corporations and does warehousing in the summer. Originally I have come on board to help him with billing, which I had no issue doing. He had fallen behind on billing customers because he started taking in more work. Since working here I have developed the following jobs: unloading containers, developing invoices and billing customers, managing the whole payroll system and creating checks, performing logistics with corporations as I need to route requests on the warehousing end, connecting with clients to monitor container ships, overseeing all of his emails and responding to them, and managing container availability. I work 40+ hours every week, including doing full time grad school as well during that time.  I also do not live at home anymore. My commute ranges from 35-50mins one way. I only make 33,000 a year from doing this with no paid time off and no sick days.

My dad used to run this business with my grandfather, who unfortunately passed away in 2014. Since then, my dad has consumed himself with work and developed a severe alcohol addiction that causes him start drinking at 4:30am and not stop until he leaves work. Mind you, he has a 45 minute commute home after drinking all day and barely eating. He won't brush his teeth, barely showers, reeks of alcohol and cigarettes, and has developed a temper that has caused massive blowouts between us. The building we work in no longer has a working bathroom (I have to leave to go to a gas station every time I need to go), is infested with mice and flies, and has no air-conditioning or heat. All of my siblings and I have talked to our dad about this but he just laughs it off and tries to make a speech on how this is how he wants to be. I've worked for my dad before during the summers doing minor things and he has gotten progressively worse since the start of the pandemic. My brother also works here as a mechanic. My dad refuses to hire anyone outside of the family in terms of running operations (he does hire outside drivers). My brother has shown no interest in doing what I do, despite the fact my brother has been the one presumed to take over the family business. My dad also knows I want to start my career pursuing my dreams.

For advice: I want to leave this job. Every single person, including my super supportive s/o knows I need to leave because I have taken on so much work despite it not being what I want and having no time off. However, I know my dad's business will crumble if I leave because I have been holding it up for the past year and a half. Profits have since doubled but I know if I leave it may cause the business to collapse. I have so much guilt over leaving but I feel like I've had the pressure moved to me since my brother is not stepping up either. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you."

How to choose between a masters in:

- Software Engineering (concentrating in Entrepreneurship)

I worry about this because: while I am a bit tired of doing purely analytics based work and want do more coding, I would also like to eventually become a manager (for data engineering or data science or comp sci. - both of which would take me away from pure-ish analytical and coding work). Using my experience so far, I can easily move into management as soon as I'm done with my masters in Data science - I don't think i'll be able to make same kind of leap if I went with a masters in comp. sci or software eng.

While doing a Masters in Data Science would be a great career move, as I said, i'm a bit tired of doing analytics work and a masters in comp. sci or software eng. would allow me broaden my horizons + improve my coding abilities + give me street cred lol (when applying to more technical jobs or just jobs that require a comp. sci related degree as a barrier of entry) + potentially switch into more coding heavy jobs where the pay starting out may not equal what i am making now or that i may be making as a data science manager for the first 3 years of my new coding career lol. for reference: i make about 100 right now and with a masters in data science can/should expect to make 150-200 as a manager - my resume/past-experience really puts me above most of the competition.

Grad school isn't cheap and I think going with a data science degree gives me immediate returns whereas a comp. sci or software engineering masters doesn't promise quick or the same returns (simply because of the sheer volume of applicants that will be majoring in and being pumped out into the job market?).

My ultimate plan (in 10-15 years down the road) is to get an MBA too (in marketing, strategy, finance or etc.) because I have been working with marketing and finance alot and see myself moving into management role there as well. The end goal in 5-10 years after i'm done this masters is to be in a managerial positions, to have tried out consulting at the big4 in my area of expertise (data and/or the intersection of data + coding?) and then to lead my own team of data analysts and data engineers or to lead a team of various coders + marketers as a product owner/manager or VP of some kind.

Rough stats about me:

Nationality:
Canadian

Age: 
Soon to be 28 years old

Undergrad: 

- finished in 2018 - double minor in Communications and World Literature with a certificate in Entrepreneurship (more than half of my time was spent in the first 2.5 years of a Mechatronics Systems Engineering degree) all at SFU (in canada) which is a tier 1.5 university.
- undergrad gpa in the second half of my degree was between a B and a B+
- undergrad gpa throughout the degree was between a B- and B (not attractive by any means, but i think my second half gpa + work experience + letters of recommendation by former managers/COOs help make me competitive).


Work experience:

- a solid 3+ years
- did a year of internships pre-2018 as software engineer and software engineering research assistant
- tutored throughout uni
- after graduating uni: 
- worked as a data analyst for 11 months at mid-sized startup
- data engineer for 22 months at mid-sized startup
- analytics engineer for 6 months and more at large-sized startup :)
- i've been consulting too on analytics, bi and digital marketing related topics since 2020 as well"

I basically only have my internship left and I really want to graduate soon, but I don't feel super hopeful as I have applied to over 50 companies with only 1 upcoming interview with Shopify. I am mainly interested in backend development, but I am open to work in most places that involve developing software in the USA. 

My main concern is lack of projects and experience. I changed my major just 2 years ago, so in an attempt to not postpone my graduation too much, I started taking a lot of credits. I was able to get As in most of my classes, but as I was so busy with school work, I didnt have enough time for side projects and other extra curricular stuff. This changed just at the beggining of this year where I joined 1 student organization and 1 tiny start-up I found by attending Computer Science meetings (These are the top 2 places you will find under Experience in my resume.) 

Anyways, any advice, especially from people that were in my situation will be appreciated. Thank you.

Been working with them since July 2021
* Founder and President of my school’s Science Club. Founded in sophomore year. We’ve done fundraising for local environmental research, organized school events for younger kids during Green Week, discuss scientific news during meetings, and we’ve organized a field trip to a local college with their STEM education center to see different demonstrations (we went to the anatomy lab and got to see cadavers, kinesiology lab, etc.)
* Volunteer lab assistant at the local college this summer and maybe into the schoolyear. I’m working in a freshwater ecology lab and assisting undergraduate and graduate students in their research projects, whether that be collecting samples or being the numbers guy or helping them set traps for aquatic organisms. Should be a really fun and enriching experience, and I’m very excited about it
* Local robotics team. I joined cold beginning of junior year with no prior robotics experience, and it was a unique experience for me. I was unable to attend any of the competitions, but I helped the team construct our robot and assisted in calculations and constructions where I could
* Literary team since freshman year. I compete in the extemporaneous speaking and spelling events for my school. I’ve been region champion in both events for the past 2 years &amp; won state title for extemp this year
* School math team. Pretty standard math team (complete problem sets, 1 or 2 state competitions). I enjoy it, and I’ve been a member since freshman year

* School citizenship award 1x
* Governor’s honors program semifinalist
* State champion for extemporaneous speaking

Essays/LORs:
* AP Lang &amp; Lit Teacher: 9/10. She’s the sponsor for the literary team as well and we’re pretty close, and I think she will write a letter that shows my personality and intellectual curiosity well
* Hnrs Precalc/AP Calc teacher: 7/10. I do really well in her class, and I’m probably one of her favorite students. She apparently writes really good letters of rec for her students. She can definitely highlight my intellectual curiosity and citizenship well.
* Counselor rec (from assistant head of school): 7-8/10. I know her pretty well, and I have a good reputation with admin at my school. She should be able to give a good perspective of me in the context of my school.

My essays should be good; I’m a good writer and will be starting my personal statement soon."

***Background:***

Middle class white woman pursuing a degree in neuroscience, applying in '23, and I go to a non-competitive public magnet school. I'm in a big-ish city, but we don't have tons of opportunities or competitive programs here (so no Bay Area-type competition). No legacy at anywhere I'm applying, but I'm not first-gen either.

I'm applying to 19 schools, which can be broken down as 5 safety schools, 6 target schools, and 8 reach schools (including 6 ivies, which are ***Brown, Penn, Dartmouth, Yale, Columbia, and Cornell,*** my non-Ivy reaches are ***Barnard and Swarthmore***). I'm applying ED to Brown (subject to change).

As a small side note, a lot of the gaps in my extracurriculars come from the fact that I'm pretty severely immunocompromised. I kinda have to pick and choose where I can do extracurriculars, so a lot of them have ended up being various different positions at a few places (please try to be considerate of that, I'm looking out for my health).

If it matters, I think I have really strong essays so far (not super comfortable posting them here though, sorry). I've written a good draft of my Common App Statement, plus a couple other creative pieces that I can use for different supplements.

***Grades/Test Scores:***

3.97 UW/4.3 W GPA

Top 10% of my class

7 AP classes by graduation (My school only offers 8, but I took AP Chem, AP Bio, APUSH, AP Lang, and next year I'm taking AP Psych, AP Stats, and AP Lit)

3 honors classes (All math classes)

33 act (I'm taking it again in July though)

Didn't take the SAT

High Honors w/ Distinction Award 3 years in a row (highest academic honor in my district)

***Extracurriculars:***

1. ***\*Insert Name of Highly Competitive Metro Area Wide Audition Only Band\**** **(August 2019 - now):** I'm the senior-most vocalist with 3 years of leadership, and I help with mentoring younger students, and additionally, we often host fundraiser events for various charities, such as \**insert names of charities\**
2. ***\*Insert Local Animal Clinic Name\**** **Behavioral and Veterinary Intern (March 2022-June 2022):** I worked with cats with multiple different neurological and behavioral issues, such as Cerebellar Hypoplasia and anxiety
3. ***\*Insert Local Animal Clinic Name\**** **Kennel Tech (June 2022 - until graduation):** After my internship, I was promoted to a paid position as a kennel tech/behavioral specialist. I also help with medical care for cats, such as vaccinations, surgeries, and general wellness checks 
4. **Research Project (December 2021 - April 2022):** I conducted independent research on mental health within my school as a way to help create change to how teen mental health is approached by staff, as well as submitted my research to the district.
5. **Summer @ Brown:** I took the class “Neuroscience in Health and Disease” at an online Brown program as a way to learn more about neuroscience and explore my major
6. ***\*Insert Name of Casual for-fun Music Program\**** **(August 2018 - now):** I perform quarterly in a themed performance with my other band members
7. **Etsy Store (December 2020 - now):** I run a Etsy shop called *\*Insert Shop Name\** where I donate a portion of my profits to “To Write On Her Arms,” a mental health non-profit
8. ***\*Insert Local Animal Shelter Name\**** **Volunteer Work (February 2022 - now):** I help with cleaning and facilities care (100+ hours of volunteering)

Chance me at my reach schools please!

Edit: Added the AP's I've taken and my awards. As a small note, I want to mention that I've had other extraneous circumstances in my personal life since 2019, which I'm writing about in my personal statement because it motivated me to apply as a neuroscience major. I'm not comfortable sharing those but you can PM me if you're curious about my essay topic."

But I am not exactly sure how can I get a full-time job since most companies require a Master's or a Ph.D. is there a way for me to get an MLE/DS role at a good company where I can work on a tough problem and meaningful problems? It was hard enough for me to get internships if I am being honest, the thought of getting a job seems impossible if I am being honest. So if anyone has any tips or advice, I would be very helpful.

Also, does uni ranking matter? It is a top 3 uni in my country, but I don't think this fact has ever helped me in the slightest."

1. Does having 2 to 3 years of professional experience disqualify you from applying to internships or new grad positions, since those are mostly intended for people completely new to the industry? Or are they open to everyone currently pursuing a degree?
2. Would it be considered an advantage? Or is it a red flag for recruiters/hiring managers that you're not applying to junior/mid level positions instead?

I assume that those questions may have different answers based on the company. I'm mostly interested in top paying companies such as MANGA, unicorns or fintech companies.

Thank you for the answers!

Edit: While I appreciate all inputs to this question, it would be very helpful if you can mention if you 're speaking from either the perspective of a candidate that has been in this situation, or if you've been directly involved into the resume screening process at one of those companies I mentioned. It's important to differentiate opinion and verified information."

I’m doing very well on self learning and am currently preparing to get my Network+ and Security+ certs. I’ve realized though I am enjoying learning Python so much that I’m kicking myself for not learning it earlier.

I just accepted a remote help desk job, and while that’s exciting to finally get my foot in the door, I realize I wanna do programming stuff in a possible Cybersecurity field. I am focusing on trying to secure Internships once the season rolls back around but I can’t be guaranteed anything.

So far I’ve developed programs using Python in small teams to create simple stuff like price scrapers, price comparison tools, and integration with Discord to help discord servers that specialize in E commerce. I’ve thought about making a blog or github page showcasing these skills and offering a detailed overview of these projects and linking them on my resume.

This is only a summer internship  They know I’m good with coding (I was hired cause of this) and they have been thinking of a coding project to give me but a las, nothing. Last time I was in contact with my manager was last Thursday. He hasn’t contacted me since then. I’ve asked for work before but it hasn’t led to anything 

The only thing I’ve been doing is attending intern meetings and intern fun events the company plans (like intern day out in the cinema, lol)

Should I keep asking or just be patient and wait and just attend meetings and stuff ? Or should I do some Leetcode / projects while I wait for available work ? I feel like I’m getting paid for nothing."
vd32he,14,2022-06-15,Stern vs Fuqua (w/ 50k scholarship) - interested in IB,lostnoooobie,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/vd32he/stern_vs_fuqua_w_50k_scholarship_interested_in_ib/,"I am really torn between two schools, and I still cannot decide which school to ultimately attend. At this point, I am pretty certain i want to at least recruit for IB first year and try summer internship to see whether i like it or not.

It is crystal clear that Stern is a much better IB school, but at the same time it approximately costs 100k more given that Fuqua offered some scholarship and that Durham is considerably cheaper than Manhattan. While it appears that one can break into IB from Fuqua without too much difficulties if really committed, Stern simply places significantly better to top BBs and EBs - based on my research, Fuqua seems to send mostly to BBs and MMs. I guess my questions are:

1. Does literally everyone from Stern (aside from international students without visa) who seriously recruit for IB get EB, BB or at least MM offers? Per the analysis by menlocoaching in 2020, Stern placed 59 students to BB+EB, and this does not include MMs, so i assume around 70-80 kids received IB offers. Does that mean almost everyone who recruited for IB got some type of offers?
2. Fuqua has significantly less students recruiting for IB; however, does that make it less competitive and ultimately lead everyone seriously recruiting IB to get offers? It obviously seems much more difficult to land top BB or EB jobs from Fuqua. However, based on Menlocoaching's analysis below again,  approximately 25 Fuqua students got BB offers, and the analysis doesn't include MM offers. Therefore, i assume around 30-40 students in total received IB offers (whether EB/BB/MM). I don't think Fuqua will have more than 50+ students seriously recruiting for IB - please correct me if i am wrong. So, it seems they do relatively well in terms of placement...

I'm stuck between two programs:

&amp;#x200B;

Program 1 - Online computer science degree. This is an accredited, top-100 nationally ranked, move at your own pace degree. All of my previous credits transfer nicely, so I believe I'd be able to finish this program 4 to 11 months early as compared to program 2. This will cost a total of $8,000-$12,000 depending on how long it takes me. This program hold no career fairs and has no internship or job placement programs or information regarding them. During this time I would be living at home with about $150/month of expenses.

Program 2 - In person software engineering degree at a top-40 nationally ranked SWE school. All but 4 of my previous credits transfer here, but I still have a full 68 required credit hours to fulfill. This effectively means that for 4 semesters straight, all my classes will be math and programming based. I switched majors, so all of my GE courses and electives are done, leaving only the SWE-relevant classes left. This school has 5-8 relevant career fairs per year, career-planning and placement services avaliable, and CS students here have a 99% job placement rate before graduation. During this time I would be living by myself or with a roommate in an apartment near campus. Living costs would be about $1,100/month and school for the two years totals a cost of $18,000. 

&amp;#x200B;

Background details: 

I have no previous knowledge on this subject, but I am taking this summer to learn the basics and hopefully structure some sort of foundation with a free program. I've been doing online school since March of 2020 and have become pretty disciplined with it, in fact I enjoy online more than in person. I have a YouTube page that consistently produces $4-$5k of income/month with 20-30 working hours/week, however, I'm not sure how long this can be sustained or if I can balance it with either program. I have about $10k cash and $40k in investments that could be liquidated (if necessary, would like to not touch them). As far as the title goes, I feel that program 2 will be more difficult to complete. It seemingly has more difficult material and I have the added responsibility of living on my own. With that being said, I want to prepare myself to have the best future possible. I'm interested in hearing your success or regret stories of going in person vs online and what you think of my situation."

I always considered myself to have lower than average intelligence and I convinced myself I would never be able to do college. I ended up going into a trade after high-school.  Thankfully I met my girlfriend (soon to be fiancé), who helped me with my confidence and helped me realize higher education was possible for me.  

I have worked really hard to get where I am currently.  I started going back to school in 2015 while working a trade. I put off buying a house and starting a family to get an engineering degree.  I managed to keep my GPA above 3.95 through out my college, while participating in a few student organizations.  

Today, as an intern, I got to sit down at a meeting in one of the largest manufacturers in United States and discuss my summer project with cheif engineers.  I'm not a very emotional person,  but it kind of hit me when I got home that all the sacrifice that I have made may be finally paying off. It blows my mind that I get to discuss ideas with engineers in charge of designing some of my favorite products.  If you asked me 10 years ago if it was possible to be where I am today I would have laughed.  

I am extremely grateful for where I am today and all of the people who helped me get to where I am.  I hope others that were like me realize their potential as well and work toward their ""pie in the sky"" goals."

I would like some advice about what to do next. So far, I have been on countless interviews. I was able to make it to a few final rounds and 2 onsite. Unfortunately, I haven't been as lucky as others. I just recently graduated so I'm a bit desperate for a job to start my career.

Right now, I have an internship position offer (paid/hybrid) for 3 months at a start-up company. It seems interesting but I'm not sure if I should take it or keep looking for a more long term position. I realize that this can possibly turn into a full time position (if they like me) and a great resume boost. But I'm still uncertain.

I have applied to over 400+ applications and I don't think I see any new ones yet (I have mainly used Handshake and Indeed as my platform to search). Any suggestions/advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!

I am entering my senior year of college and am pursuing my degree in computer science. I currently have an internship with a software company who are most likely going to offer me a full time position once the internship ends. I am hoping to one day attend graduate school, and have set my hopes on the MIT LGO program to get both my MS in computer science and my MBA. 

Over the last few weeks however, I have had an incredibly strong urge to take a few years and commission as an officer in the US Air Force. Particularly, I want to be a pilot. Originally, I thought of joining the military as a means of paying for graduate school with the GI bill. After investing myself in the idea however, I found myself longing for a career far from what I have been preparing for the last few years of college. 

I know the path to becoming a pilot is long and hard, and requires a 10 year commitment, which makes me nervous of burnout. Ultimately, am I making a bad decision wanting to become a pilot when I can enter the workforce and secure a fairly nice job with my degree early on?"

vd6r6f,24,2022-06-15,"I feel so lost with my Computer Science Bachelor's in a ""No experience loop""",Season6finalesucked,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/vd6r6f/i_feel_so_lost_with_my_computer_science_bachelors/,"I just barely made it through my classes in 2020 for my BS in CS due to some mental problems and personal family issues. It really was me just trying to pass classes however I could and stay sane. I regret not doing more side projects or participating in internships because now I have a degree and not much experience. I'm currently 27 growing tired...

&amp;#x200B;

I am just now trying to make small projects in an attempt to have a portfolio to display with my resume, however I fear the projects I'm doing are not worth it or too trivial to gather interest from employers. Also I feel like the world of Computer Science is so vast that I don't know where to start. I'd like to work on projects to develop my skills but I just hate the idea of wasting time doing something that won't help me get hired in the end. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do know that I love technology and the creation of it. Computer Science seems to give many possibilities. I like software development and cybersecurity. It would be amazing to get into cybersecurity but it seems like a tough feat. I just don't know where to start sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

I do currently have a job in customer service working from home. Overall it is relatively stress-free and easy which I'm extremely thankful for, however the pay is low, and I constantly feel very self-conscious about my position in life. I keep thinking that I wasted my parent's money and spent so much time in school for nothing. I don't care if my next job is remote or not if it is a position I can really learn and grow in.

&amp;#x200B;

The whole application process is also very confusing and contradicting to me. I've tried LinkedIn, Indeed and other job boards. I am just now trying to apply to companies directly on their site. I've tried flashy resume templates and the default ATS friendly formats. I've tried cover letters and no cover letters. Oh and I also get so many spam calls/spam job offers that it makes me so untrustworthy. Maybe I've ghosted legit offers because of this...who knows.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately I just want to be able to put experience related to my field on my resume. Right now I am paid $15/hr and would be happy to just get experience at a little more like $20/hr. I don't know if that's too ambitious for me to strive for but I just feel like I've wasted so much time already. With how the world is and the expense of things it prevents me from moving forward in my life with my own personal goals.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I have my BS in CS since 2020 and currently work in customer service from home. It was a struggle getting through school due to personal problems, so I only have my degree without internships or anything. I want a job that will actually give me experience related to computer science while paying me more than my current job. I don't need it to be remote necessarily. I am constantly overwhelmed with the application process, and I feel caught in the ""no experience"" loop where no one will hire me because I have none however I need to be hired to get some. I do work on projects now and then but I have no idea if they are the ""right"" projects or if I'm wasting more time thinking employers won't appreciate them.

Any advice/guidance is greatly appreciated and anticipated. Thank you so much!"

Which Internship should I choose? So I’m a Junior studying finance and this week I have received two internships. First finance internship hoping to make it into IB.

Both are at search funds. One is focused on a particular niche while the other is more general. The opportunities are similar, as both will be doing industry analysis, sourcing etc. I’m not sure what modeling opportunities I will have as one it depends how comfortable you are and then be put on deals where the other one I have no idea. One has former interns going to top consultant for/ IB firms and the other one has experience in IB. 


Im assuming I can’t do both due to conflict of interest and having two internships would look bad. Thoughts? Any help would be appreciated"

My other option (still under consideration) is to pursue another BA in math. I’m interested in the math side of things. However, I literally can’t do both. I know my limits.

I might not even end up doing neither. I know there’s time to grow and explore. I know a CS degree alone with internships is great. But I just want input from other people and want to take the advantage I have in undergrad rn."

Now fast forward 5 years, I want to transition from Mechanical Engineering to CS/Software Engineering and this program caught my interest. However, I am in the same situation. I am working as an Engineer full time and cannot work an internship. Though, I am willing to work on some personal projects as much as I can to make myself more competitive.

It really was me just trying to pass classes however I could and stay sane. I regret not doing more side projects or participating in internships because now I have a degree and not much experience. I'm currently 27 growing tired...

​

I am just now trying to make small projects in an attempt to have a portfolio to display with my resume, however I fear the projects I'm doing are not worth it or too trivial to gather interest from employers. Also I feel like the world of Computer Science is so vast that I don't know where to start. I'd like to work on projects to develop my skills but I just hate the idea of wasting time doing something that won't help me get hired in the end. 

​

I do know that I love technology and the creation of it. Computer Science seems to give many possibilities. I like software development and cybersecurity. It would be amazing to get into cybersecurity but it seems like a tough feat. I just don't know where to start sometimes.

​

I do currently have a job in customer service working from home. Overall it is relatively stress-free and easy which I'm extremely thankful for, however the pay is low, and I constantly feel very self-conscious about my position in life. I keep thinking that I wasted my parent's money and spent so much time in school for nothing. I don't care if my next job is remote or not if it is a position I can really learn and grow in.

​

The whole application process is also very confusing and contradicting to me. I've tried LinkedIn, Indeed and other job boards. I am just now trying to apply to companies directly on their site. I've tried flashy resume templates and the default ATS friendly formats. I've tried cover letters and no cover letters. Oh and I also get so many spam calls/spam job offers that it makes me so untrustworthy. Maybe I've ghosted legit offers because of this...who knows.

vdaybw,76,2022-06-15,Why is my self esteem is bad? This had been like this my entire life and I want to fix it.,No_Helicopter9361,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/vdaybw/why_is_my_self_esteem_is_bad_this_had_been_like/,"I really want to 'fix' my self esteem around other people so I fell confident enough to talk to them. 
I am asking anyone for advice on how I can do this. It recently just hit me that I need to start being less worried of what I say and how i come across to others. I mean in other words that I want to come off intelligent and not seem like I don't know what I am talking about with other people.

I think my self-esteem started to get bad when I was in middle school and was mad fun of a lot. The whole thing was a mess and if I could go back I wish I could've did things differently. When I was younger I didn't have a lot of friends and one of the main things I wanted was friends to call my own. I jumped from one table to another in desperate need of finding friends but give or take 2-3 months it was nothing more then a mistake for me to sit there. What I am basically trying to say is as a kid the more I came across people the more suffer able it was for me to just keep getting picked on and speak ro other people. 

 Everytime I see one of my co-workers at my internship all I can imagine is recieving criticism from them but they are actually really nice people. I studder a lot and feel bad for the people having to listen to me. This is not just at my job but also in college and around anyone honestly. 

My low self esteem does have a upside to it. Everytime I was picked on I wanted to prove all of them wrong that I was going to go out and do better then them in the world. That has had good and bad intentions on my life. The good was it has led me to want to go to college. The bad was it has significantly lessened who I can speak to and who I feel comfortable around.

I wanted to go into a career that I could avoid that kind of encounter as a kid and the more I got to know myself as I grew up the I more I realized what I wanted to do as a career and that was data analysis.

Everytime I watch people interact with each other on social media all I can feel is jealously. Those were the people who made me who I am and had taken away my enjoyment with others. It's not fair at all that they still get to be happy around others while I have trauma from those same people who did this to me. 

Can anyone please give me advice on how I can feel confident in myself again. 

P.S please upvote this I could really use all the  support I can get. 

Thank you"
vdb574,100,2022-06-15,"Trifecta Passed, my experience writeup",throw_away29123,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/vdb574/trifecta_passed_my_experience_writeup/,"So I couldn't have done it without the help of this community and the writeups posted here, so I am posting my own. Sorry it's wordy. By the end of it, I've had 3 IT jobs and each basically doubled in salary. Before this, I had 0 IT careers BUT did have an IT internship plus IT club leadership experience in school. Certs definitely help, but applying yourself to get certs goes hand in hand with applying yourself to join clubs, socially network, do side projects etc.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all: the study resources posted on the [stickied study resource post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/i7hx4t/master_list_i_compiled_and_ranked_every_major/) are invaluable, start there.

TLDR: Use Professor Messer and Jason Dion's video courses, then both of their practice tests, and since Messer doesn't have Net+ practice tests, use Dion and Meyer's practice tests for net+ and supplement with anything highly rated here. My main advice is that you should use:

* At LEAST 2 ""main"" study materials that you utilize in completion, such as a textbook read cover to cover while taking notes or a video course that you watch thoroughly while taking notes. I used Professor Messer + Mike Meyers, Mike Chapple or Jason Dion's video courses. If you like reading better, pick any textbook from the stickied study resources post on this sub, they are probably all great but I can't speak to them.
* At LEAST 1 ""supplemental"" material for when your two main materials just don't cut it - I used the Examcram textbooks, but any textbook or full video course would work fine here as long as it is a complete resource in and of itself.
* At LEAST 2 practice test resources. IMO Messer's are best followed by Dion followed by Total Seminars / Mike Meyers followed by Examcram. Make sure you do not take them so often that are you are just memorizing the answers. Follow up by studying the answers you get wrong. Make sure you know WHY the correct answer is correct but also know why the wrong answers are wrong, or how the question could have been worded to make the wrong answers correct. If you see an answer that you know is wrong but don't recognize or could explain, write it down and include that in your follow up studies. Most importantly, use these as a tool to see what sections and concepts you are lacking in and follow up by studying those sections hard!
* Google the stuff you do not know or is not getting through to you from your main and supplemental materials. E.g. if your main or supplemental resources won't explain to you why the correct answer of a test question is correct (or why the wrong answer is wrong) then you need to Google for an explanation. Or if your main/supplemental resources just aren't wording concepts in ways you understand.
* I can't remember what it's called but there was a term I heard that basically you don't truly understand something until you can sit there and explain it to a sock puppet. If you think you understand something, imagine you are explaining it to an inanimate object. Can you explain it in full? If not, study it. This is probably the most important thing IMO.

# A+  ~740s on both

Took this as part of a class for college and used Testout. It's not great. Definitely recommend other resources, especially if you are paying out pocket. The labs are okay, but I easily could of done just fine using Professor Messer, Jason Dion/Mike Meyers plus their practice tests. I use supplemental materials and definitely needed them. At this point in my studying, I was unaware of this great community and the aforementioned reverent sticky post on this sub.

* Testout - Only used because it was required for the class. It definitely helped but I would not recommend it if you could avoid. It came included as part of my college credit but paying for it standalone is ridiculous since it's hundreds of dollars (while Udemy courses are \~$15) and it wasn't even that good. If you absolutely need labs, you can do most the stuff for this exam on your personal PC no issue. The practice tests, videos and labs are all good - they just aren't worth the hundreds of dollars.
* Professor Messer notes - Phenomenal. I did not have time to watch his videos in full during this time, but I would have if things were different. Messer's resources are always top notch.
* Professor Messer practice tests - Integral to my success - no doubt they were key to me passing. 1000% worth purchasing, plus Professor Messer puts out so much for free he deserves the buy.
* [Certblaster free study guide](https://www.certblaster.com) \- Free and IMO only slightly lower in quality to Messer's notes. Definitely something to take a look at if you are on a budget and looking for free resources, rarely mentioned here. Definitely a high-level overview - do not use them standalone. They are a good supplement.
* Examcram textbook - used as a supplement. I do not like reading. I read select sections that I was having trouble understanding elsewhere. BUT the testing website that it comes with and the cram sheet are no doubt useful. If not for reading cover to cover, then because they come with both an online practice test software and (perhaps more importantly) the Cram Sheet which is basically a sparknotes version of the exam - it's just all the important stuff condensed into a \~6 page tear-out sheet with the most important and hardest to remember info from the exam. The practice exams are definitely not as good as Dion, Messer or Meyers but they are better than free ones like Examcompass. The online practice exams have study modes, custom question counts, time limits etc. so you can really tailor the practice exams you take to what you are trying to do in the moment. The morning before the test, I always hand wrote the Cram sheet out on a notebook to try and ""stick"" that stuff to memory before the exam. IMO, there's a lot of stuff that's hard to really commit to memory and you just kind of need have it fresh in your mind. Some of it is okay if you haven't studied it in 2 weeks - some not so much, e.g. routing protocols or wireless standards.
* Professor Messer's free Pop Quizzes and Take Ten challenges - the take ten especially are good. Pretty much a short practice exam in itself and he has multiple of each exam.
* Random online tests and other resources -Examcompass, random Quizlet flashcards, Linsutechtips, Sunny Classroom on Youtube, [Geeksforgeeks.org](https://Geeksforgeeks.org), [Chron.com](https://Chron.com), etc. ExamCompass's tests aren't exactly like the Comptia exams but do help reinforce concepts and are free. The others are just for when you don't fully understand a concept as it was explained in video lectures/textbooks so you just Google it.

&amp;#x200B;

# Security+  813

I took them out of order. I had purchased materials for the 501 and didn't realize it ended last summer. Here's what I did:

* Professor Messer YouTube videos - a staple of any of these three tests. High quality and free.
* Mike Meyers Udemy course - Very good quality and I liked the visuals he provided. Can't go wrong here.
* Mike Chapple LinkedIn Learning course - I have LinkedIn Learning free from school so this one was also free for me. Probably the best video course I've taken and very underrated on this sub, but I understand why it's not often utilized since it's really only on LinkedIn learning. Nonetheless integral to my success.
* Professor Messer practice tests - The highest quality practice tests and would not have passed without them.
* Jason Dion practice tests - Also very high quality and good for studying. Not as good as Messer's but that isn't saying much because Messer's are like a 10/10 and these are like a 9.5/10, still absolutely recommended.
* ExamCram textbook - Same as mentioned above.
* [Certblaster free study guide](https://www.certblaster.com) \- Same as mentioned above.
* Professor Messer's free Pop Quizzes and Take Ten challenges - Same as mentioned above.
* Random online tests and other resources - - Same as mentioned above.

&amp;#x200B;

# Network+ N10-007 - 833

Took this one just the other day. This felt the hardest by far even though people say it gets easier the more you pass. The amount of dry and boring material you have to commit to memory is not easy, especially since a lot of it is just memorizing stuff. But this was also my best score so I could have just been psyched out.

* Professor Messer's YouTube videos - Same as mentioned above, free and key.
* Mike Meyer's Udemy videos - Actually could not finish this one. 26 hours for a Network+ course while the rest were \~14 hours? Can't do it. I watched about 60% before I gave up. Don't have the time for it, but if you do it's not terrible. He does get off topic a lot though and it's a little annoying. Definitely not as good as high Sec+ videos, at least when comparing his 501 and n10-007 video courses. HOWEVER, I saw that Jason Dion's N10-008 video course was also like 26 hours, perhaps his should be avoided if you are taking that version of the exam. I can't imagine sinking that much time into it when that's MORE than watching Messer's + another Udemy course combined.
* Jason Dion's Udemy videos - High quality and key to my success.
* I was HEARTBROKEN to see that Professor Messer does not have practice tests for Network+. I demand answers as to why. I would have THROWN money at him for more practice tests.
* Jason Dion's Udemy practice exams - The next best thing, very good and integral to my success.
* Sybex Practice Exams book - Didn't have Messer, had to use another practice exam resource. These were okay, a bit wordy. Good resource but not the best IMO.
* Total Seminars / Mike Meyers Udemy practice exams - Pretty good, would recommend. Not as good as Jason Dion's but still very good, especially in lieu of Messer's.
* ExamCram textbook - Same as mentioned above.
* [Certblaster free study guide](https://www.certblaster.com) \- Same as mentioned above.
* Professor Messer's free Pop Quizzes and Take Ten challenges - Same as mentioned above.
* Random online tests and other resources - - Same as mentioned above."

*(for reference I am in Miami)*

So I feel like I have become somewhat stagnate in my IT career and would like to pursue bigger and better things. I feel like I cannot get out of the ""help desk"" role as is everyone else in this subreddit apparently.  Below has been my career path so far.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **IT Help Desk / Volunteer-Intern          2014-2015**              ***Free 99. It was an internship***
2. **Assembly Tech / Integration Tech       2016-2017**         ***$10/hr then $11/hr. $1 raise yearly***

*(build high end gaming computers then promoted to integrate / configure computers before going to customer)*

3. **Computer Technician                                 2017-2019**       ***Commission 65% of any labor work***

*(On Call technician to do odd ball jobs at residential and business clients. More of IT Consultant if anything)*

4. **Senior Field Tech Analyst                           2019-2021**         ***Starting $20/hr then $25 then $26.50***

***(1 yr Contract; renewed)*** *(Glorified Desktop Support role. They ended up giving me so much work I had to quit. Was basically managing 300+ employees in local office and 1000+ in Latin America remotely alone. Also the MSP switched in the last 3 months of my work and new management was absolute garbage.)*

5. **Client Services Analyst                               2021-Present**    ***$24/hr***    

***(6 month contract; renewed)*** (Left my last job on a whim because I was extremely stressed and was ok with a slight pay downgrade.)

Have an AA in Computer information Systems

No Certifications (that are job related. Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign from HS)

&amp;#x200B;

My last two jobs were contracts and never seem to be able to get hired full time. Honestly speaking I feel like I do amazing work and outperform all my coworkers as far as quantity of work and overall impression on the clients, but I feel like I lose the race with my coworkers that are extremely bubbly and have seniority rather than hard work ethic. I have been in the corp scene for over 3 years and I'm slowly realizing they do not give anyone any sort of promotion / up in pay unless you have seniority and kiss a$$ to managers. I find it really disheartening because no matter what company I have worked for I feel like the odd one out always getting the sh\*t.  I am reaching the point in my current job that I want to leave but I have bills so I am just applying to anything slightly higher paying and hopefully remote to save some costs on gas. 

My current job hired 3 new contractors and one of them told me they get paid $26/hr when I have much more experience. They are actually a friend and we play video games so don't think he is lying. I even asked my manager if I can get a full time position at the current company and his response was I need to be ""Hungry"". Honestly that got on my nerves because I close 3 times the amount of tickets than anyone there even the ones that have been there for 20+ years. Evidently I think best thing to do is leave this place and pursue a higher title. Not sure, I think because of my social anxiety and lack of bubbliness I get ruled out for promos or even full time positions. This is also a trend I think shows in  interviews as well. I'm just an awkward person with social interactions lol.

I guess my question is does anyone have any tips they can give so I can actually have a job out of help desk or desktop support. I would like to upgrade to sys admin as I think that's the next step in my career but not sure what route to take. I am kind of a jack of all trades which is why I land these types of jobs. I also do some side IT jobs for a few clients so I think I am truly capable of so much more than this mundane job but employers never see it. If anyone genuinely would like to help me I could send a copy of my resume. Maybe I just have a bad one. I am really not sure what the problem is and I am starting to blame myself for my stagnation when in reality I feel like I do so much and put in maximum effort in any job I work for.

My roommate has his own IT business and is basically an MSP for multiple small companies. Not sure if I should just pursue my own business and expand my side job clientele and pursue a career in that. I'm confused and need reddit's expertise haha.

I'm and imtern at a large corporation (won't say name for privacy reasons) that works with genetically modifying plants and pesticides along with selectively breeding animals. Recently I was offered a full time position if I assisted with a new test we were running. I agreed as I was in need of a job. For context I'm 19 and living with my parents, I have a car and license but have been struggling to find a job, I have an associates in STEM, I took dual credits in high-school. 8 months ago a large company based where I live reached out regarding an internship that may lead to a full time job. I hastily agreed as I am qualified, but was confused as to how they found me, and why they chose me. Well after I passed all the screening processes I was immediately accepted and started working. It's been 8 months as I said and I've enjoyed working here but recently we did something that calling a crime against life itself would be an understatement. I had to tell someone but none of my friends or family will believe me, as this company is very reliable and has never done anything like this to theirs or my knowledge. After this project and once it's completed I'll have a full time job starting 400k a year, but I'm not sure if the money is worth what it did to me mentally.

So the whole basis of this project was on the premise of using cells from cows to create real steaks without killing an animal, this is already being worked on by other companies but our higher ups decided we should put our hand in the ring. The project started normally and we had multiple successful trials, we had officially made steaks from just cells, but our cfo was interested and taking this a step further. This is where my mental stated started taking a turn, he wanted to clone full animals. We started this and it was working, we had successfully clones small animals such as rats and other rodents, not even a day later he wanted to move the trials on to larger animals such as dogs and medium farm animals like pigs and goats. We kept doing this and it kept working, but after 3 weeks the subjects started showing signs of aggression then dying brutally. Sores would develop on the subjects and then upon them bursting the subject would bleed out. The cfo refused to believe this was an issue, and continued to allocate funds for the project.

This intern led to very rich people funding our research with special requests. One well known billionaire in particular requested we clone a person.  Our entire team was against it and wanted to back out but the billionaire was promising millions to the company and millions to each member of the team individually. So we all caved and started on this cloning, we weren't told who's cells we were working with but all of our attempts were completely unsuccessful. Eventually we were able to get a fetus formed and it was fully responsive, it grew at an extremely accelerated rate and it clearly came clear what we were doing.

In a matter of 3 weeks it had developed from a fetus into a toddler that looked oddly similar to the man who had payed us. This really unnerved me and I took a week off of work. Promptly bought a house, furnished it, and moved in, I had totally isolated myself from any of my family and friends. The mental stress of learning that we were making what very well may end up being the next person to take over our company and mass produce clones. After my week off I had returned to work to find the clone in a stasis chamber covered in sores and very obviously heavily sedated. I also had received news that someone had acquired our company and had made this project our whole operation, he had halted everything else. No one ever told me it was the man who had payed us off to clone a person but I assumed it was based on what I had been told.

Soon we had 5 ongoing tests of this same subject, all at different stages, they all ended up becoming deformed or dying from the bloody sores they developed as side effects of the process. Soon the team was cut down from a large group of around 30 or 40 to just 5 of us. Anyone who disagreed at all was cut from the team and subsequently never heard from again, after some digging it seemed these people had been completely erased from existence. No names or identity profiles that matched their description, phones deactivated, all social media removed, and after some contacting of previous employers, phone providers, and even families of said people, I was always met with a single answer ""who is that."" I became scared I would be cut next and kept quiet even among others in the company.

A day before writing this I was allowed to go home and I took one of the subjects. I'm not sure how I managed to sneak past security, or maybe they knew and wanted to see what would happen. Last night after I was home with it, he started asking questions, like ""what is the meaning of life?"" and ""why am I alive?"" This scared me a lot and I was worried he might start lashing out or try to end himself after I was unable to answer. I went to bed with him locked in a guest room with a mattress and pillows. I couldn't sleep so I stayed up and watched my door with as much vigilance as I could. Eventually I heard a thump and crash, I quickly locked my door and armed myself with a bat I had in my room and waited. I soon heard screaming and it was hitting my door, he was abnormally strong and ended up breaking my door with a lamp I had in the living room. He charged at me with murderous intent, without thinking I blindly swung, I ended up hitting him in the head and he fell to the ground. It was a bloody mess, I checked and felt no pulse but I was so shaken up I could have been wrong.

I grabbed my keys and got in my car and drove to the courthouse, I bought a one way plane ticket to a different county (will not say what country in case anyone from the company finds this) as soon as the court house opened I went in and changed my name (again I will not mention this in case the company finds this) they said it would take weeks to process but I bribed them to get me all new documents immediately a long with a new SSN. It cost me a lot but I think I got away. I'm currently about to land and start my new life."
vdcq60,96,2022-06-15,Intern can’t keep up. What should I do?,MoneroThrower,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vdcq60/intern_cant_keep_up_what_should_i_do/,"Im managing several interns. One of them in particular seems to be struggling with some simple C++ concepts like inheritance. He is on StackOverflow a lot (which is fine) but doesn’t seem to understand the answers that he is using to implement what he’s working on. He asks questions that can be Googled easily, and I find myself repeating myself more than once during our interactions. I always remain calm and restate myself in different ways, but I have found myself telling him to “struggle through” the problem he was facing (for example, how to implement a given design pattern. Nothing that can’t be Googled, just several lines of code in total). 

It doesn’t seem like he has the knack for programming that I’d expect, as he writes functions that take in six different parameters, when things can be done much simpler in the context of the code surrounding that function he wrote. I found that he writes code before thinking about what he writes, and I’m writing code for him at this stage to guide him down the right path because I know that he’s not sure how to proceed.

I also think that he feels like he isn’t doing well, and it makes me feel bad, because I don’t like it when someone feels like they aren’t doing well.

The context switching between helping him and doing my own work is frustrating.

What do I do?"
vdeteu,21,2022-06-16,"Can someone help me make sense of my mom's weird ""pitying"" and why it pisses me off so much",notanothertina,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/vdeteu/can_someone_help_me_make_sense_of_my_moms_weird/,"My mom essentially ""pitying"" me has been going on since I was a kid but it wasn't until I became a teenager that it started irritating me, and now as an adult it's just straight up makes me angry. (Idk if this is the proper english translation, but the word she uses in mandarin is ""chan"") 

Currently I'm away from home on an internship in another city (I'm still in school and living with my parents as my university is in my city and just 20 min away), my mom called me today and asked what I ate for dinner and I said ""leftover take out from last night"" and she replied ""that's so depressing, is it even edible? your so pitiful"" and it just made me really angry. The leftovers were fine, and I was kinda happy I got two meals from one take out, I hanged up immediately after. 

When school went back to in-person, my mom insisted to drive me to and from campus every day because she was scared that I was going to COVID from the public bus. I thought that took a lot of my freedom away, I couldn't stay after school to study, participate in ECs, hang out with friends, even skip a morning lecture without letting her know before hand. It became such a hassle because my schedule would always be changing and I'm kinda spontaenous. Also, just in general how I felt like a part of my freedom was being taken away. Everytime I brought up ""I can just bus today, it's fine"" she would hit back with a ""I would never let my poor daughter take the bus, that's so sad, you'd have to wait so long for the bus to come, wake up extra early and get home so late"".  As if I did not take public transit all throughout high school and the most part of my university career...

When I signed up to be a volunteer tutor, she said ""why are you volunteering? what do you get out of it? why are you wasting your time with that? you're such a sad pitiful girl"" Got the same response when I signed up to volunteer at the blood donation clinic, along with an overt expression of disgust.

When I got a job at my school that paid about a dollar above minimum wage, which is pretty good for an entry level job and it's also really easy going job, my mom said ""you get paid so little, not even a thousand dollars a month, that's so sad, your so pitiful"" 

When I buy some cute clothes on sale from zara or h&amp;m, thinking I got a good deal, I show it to my nosy mom and she says ""why are you wearing such cheap clothes? it's cause you can't afford nice clothes with your sad job, it's so pitiful that you have to dress so poorly"". Cherry on top is that when I do buy expensive clothes, she complains it's overpriced and a waste of money. 

I literally made pasta last night with spinach for dinner, called my mom and told her what I ate. She said ""that's so depressing, your starving out there all by yourself"". It was a fine meal that filled me up, plus I like pesto pasta. 

I don't get why my mom pities me for doing seemingly normal things that everyone does, and I also don't understand why I get so angry about it. I feel somewhere along the lines of ""I'm literally competent grown woman, I can handle this"". And there is nothing in my life worth pitying, I'm extremely blessed and grateful to have the opprotunities and things that I do. Does anyone else's parents do this: just think your the real life little match girl for living your life?"

I’m a graduating senior from the University of Florida with a bachelors in Telecommunication/Management. I do have work experience over the past 3 years, including: a marketing internship for a tech company, sales role with a construction company, as well as operating my own small construction business for the past two years.

I do not want to continue running my business, as I am not passionate about construction and plan on moving from my current area. 

My family wants me to get my master’s degree, and I have been accepted to Northwestern University’s Master of Leadership program, as well as Vanderbilt University’s Master of Marketing program. (They have offered to pay for my degree).

I also have a job waiting for me if I wanted, and it would probably pay over $60,000 a year, 

But lately I have been feeling a bit torn, as to whether or not getting the degree will be worthwhile or not. I want to work or own a business in the media industry, and I don’t know if it would be better to get more experience in the field first, before getting a degree.

My only concern with that is that my family might not be willing to pay for the degree in the future if I decide not to go get my Master’s now.

What do you think I should do?"

We are still in touch with our family but we know we should never expect anything from them. I avoid talking about this with my brother because I know he holds it against them too.

* I have tried to reach out to some high school friends. I was always brushed off. However, when these people needed something from me, then they had no issue in contacting me.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, if you're still reading this, you actually give a crap about my thoughts. Your mistake.

After one year of development I pushed DOE out into early access. I naively said I would reach 1.0 update within six months. As the title gave it away, I missed my goal - there was just too much to do and I allowed feature creep to happen. This was not necessarily a bad thing though - folks who really invested time into the game, joined my discord and shared their thoughts on how features could be improved and what could be added to really make the game stand out. I welcomed their feedback and pushed to add new mechanics. This was a double edged sword though - on one hand it showed the community my commitment to listen to their feedback and ideas, but the pain was in building new systems and continuing to finish the core experience with just myself developing them. Thus six months turned into two years.

Quite honestly, there is a lot more I COULD do to build this game out more, but after all this time, and everything that I have learned throughout the development cycle, going back through old code is frightening. While I could spend time refactoring, adding more layers of polish, I think my time is better spent on a new project, armed with the knowledge gained. I am pretty much burned out on this project, so I am happy to bring it to closure with at least the roadmap I setout to complete. Now that I've rambled on, let me share some insights that helped contribute to the success of my early access.

&amp;#x200B;

**Feature Roadmap**

A low effort, high value artifact you can easily keep updated with minimal effort - a feature roadmap for your development that you include in every update to let folks know what's coming next and ensure transparency in your timelines. Helps answer questions as well.

&amp;#x200B;

**Discord**

This is one of the most important things you can do as a game dev, get a discord going and ensure you have a direct link embedded in your game to bring users to it. Direct interaction is key to building relationships, feedback, and most importantly, bug reporting before they leave it as a negative review.

&amp;#x200B;

**Other Social**

Keeping up on social is an absolute chore imo and quickly became an annoying distraction. Social posts barely translated to traffic to my site, unless I was running an ad on FB (I'll get to ads next), but I thought it was important to keep up a social presence. I was posting inconsistently and at the wrong time (usually at night). I ended up hiring someone to take on all my social responsibilities, to prepare and post on a consistent schedule to FB, Twitter, and TikTok. I can say it this was a great time saver - One less distraction and thing to think about. IMO still has not translated to a significant increase in traffic, but growing your audience is important for future projects.

&amp;#x200B;

**Sales**

If you have a game on steam and you are not putting your game on sale at every opportunity, you are making a huge mistake. These have been my highest traffic spikes where I would see my most sales - barely anyone is buying a game off steam unless it is on sale. Take advantage of this as much as you can.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ads**

For Ad management, I ran FB ads only during sale events, and while ads were running (about 30$ a day budget) they would make up about 10% of my traffic in. Avoid twitter and tiktok ads, just not worth it at ALL.

FB still seems to the go to for ads.

&amp;#x200B;

**Content Creation**

Content creation is a strange beast - and can be the single contributing factor to your success. I don't think there is any formula or plan you can make here - you just need a product that looks nice, and if you are lucky enough, someone with a big audience will try it out. Somehow I got lucky enough for two content creators with a sizable audience 500k-800k to pick up Dungeons of Edera and play it. These were some of the biggest spikes in sales I have ever seen when these videos were aired.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then I have tried to collect  emails from hundreds of youtubers and send them keys. Very, very few responded and it was usually the folks with smaller audiences.

&amp;#x200B;

I've previously talked about services like Keymailer and Woovit - These can be useful tools to reach out to a lot of creators, but be warned - once they make a video, its unlikely they will play it again. So ensure its not too early in your development cycle when you share. I pushed heavily into these tools at my early access release, and I can say since then less than ten have made subsequent updates.

&amp;#x200B;

Besides those services, I also tried Capapult, which is a service you pay content creators for videos. I got very low results from this service and cannot recommend it. I just didn't see the return in using this, or at least not with the budget I wanted.

&amp;#x200B;

**Other Media**

One cool event we actually did was submit DOE for the Seattle Indies Expo - and to my surprised we were selected to be featured! This didn't bring in any real spikes in sales, but it was a lot of fun to be featured and interviewed by them - so my advice to you all is submit your game to your local game expo, its fun, free exposure!

&amp;#x200B;

**Team**

Three years, one developer - you might be asking. ""Why didn't you bring on more programmers"" the answer to this, is that I really didn't want to go through the hassle. At the point where I thought some help would be nice, my project files and design style was in absolute disarray. My filepaths and code shared one thing in common, only I understood it, and it disgusted me. Even as I brought on teammates to help build out the environment and story, I never used a proper repository. I managed it on a Google Drive. I do not recommend this. For the love of cthulhu use a proper repository if you have a team. I had to manually integrate all levels, just wasting time there if I had set it up correctly at first.

&amp;#x200B;

Building and maintaining a team is hard. Most of the folks who worked on this project were international, so all communication was done asynchronously on discord. Somehow we got away with less than 10 voice calls throughout the entire project. Which was great because my time on this project was all on nights and weekends - so this was another reason I kept the team small and took on all development responsibilities - minimize management.

&amp;#x200B;

One piece of advice I will give folks is use fiverr for voice acting. It made it easy to find everything I needed for my game.

&amp;#x200B;

**Unreal Marketplace**

This project was built 99% in blueprints - only the AI movement component was built in c++ (performance reasons). Using blueprints is just too easy, and honestly, I only have a basic understanding of c++ so I could not have been able to achieve the scope of this project with it alone. One of the great things about using Blueprints is access to a host of premade packages on the Unreal Marketplace. If I had an idea for a feature, I would just search there, and more often than not, there was a blueprint for sale that at least set me in the right direction and helped my learning greatly by seeing all of the various ways they were built and integrating it into my own project and building on top of it. Some folks may look down on this, but I do not care - **Time is your most valuable asset**. Anytime you can spend 20$ to save yourself a week of development, that is a WIN my friend. The unreal marketplace is how I was able to complete this project with such a small team.

&amp;#x200B;

All visual assets you see in the game are bought from the marketplace, and again, I know folks have mixed opinions on this, but again, don't listen to them. You will save time and you get exactly what you see - no finding the right artist or modeler and getting varying results in quality. I would say less than 2% of reviews mention anything about the assets, and remember,  **Game developers are not your target audience**. This group is the only one who will know you have purchased assets, unless its like the most popular assets like Synty. Pay the money for the high quality assets on the marketplace, its worth it.

**Closing Thoughts**

If you made it this far in my rambling you are truly a madman. Maybe you're like me and just refuse to give up, because that is what it takes to finish something like this.  The parts where you're learning or programming new features from scratch with knowledge you gain throughout the cycle is absolutely exhilarating, but its not always like this. There are times where it is an absolute slog. Inconsistent edge case bugs, UI, UX, VO coordination, localization - all those things that put the final piece in place to make a game, a game.

&amp;#x200B;

Motivation can be killed by these things, because we all just want to be working on the cool stuff, but its important to get all the in between in too. One thing that really helped me stay with it is not doing ANY other projects. I know some folks like to take breaks with pet projects, but I stayed consistent. All energy went into this. Sometimes you have to force yourself just to do ONE thing a day. Fix a bug, reprioritize your backlog, tidy up some UI, something - anything to push it one step closer to the finish line.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what's next for me? Depending on the success of the 1.0 launch, I may also explore another title in the Dungeons of Edera universe, but next time. I will ensure I prioritize my scope ruthlessly, three years is a long time to be on a single project. So for now, I've already got another project in the works on something entirely different. Something small and I will force it to stay small. I am wanting to release it in six months, so I naively think.

&amp;#x200B;

Stay focused, my friends. Until next time.

&amp;#x200B;

Cheers,

Going to preface this by saying that I’ve tried googling to solve this issue already. Meta is pretty much just trash, so I’m looking for a fix on the user end, Ie possible settings changes I can make to free up processing power. 

I’m an intern with a small business. Our client wants us to respond to every person who shared posts on our Facebook, thanking them and reminding them to purchase event tickets. 

The problem I’m having is that there are over 3,500 shares on just one of our posts, and the way Meta Business Suite works I need to start my responses from the bottom of the list. I should also mention I’m doing this on chrome, but I’ve also tried edge. 

I’ve been scrolling for over 2 hours trying to reach the bottom of the page while my CPU and memory usage keeps climbing, slowing the entire process significantly. At this point it takes 30 seconds just to load in the next 2 shares.

Meta suite is horribly optimized, that much is obvious. It continues to process all previous shares while also trying to load up new ones, so it’s no surprise my laptop is struggling. What can I do on my end to help speed up this process?"

I'm living in a 2-bedroom college dorm/apartment repurposed for summer residents with a girl I knew from last year's internship. Last year, we had a great friendship and she actually ended up having a one-night stand with my former roommate and friend. When she found out I had gotten a job in the same City as her, she invited me to share an apartment to reduce costs. We also really started to text constantly about 2 months before actually moving in, with conversations getting consistently more personal (but never platonic).

Since we moved in, the relationship has been nothing short of fantastic. We both work really long hours but when we finally get home, we catch up and talk until we practically are forced by our bodies to sleep. I constantly make her laugh and I feel like we both have a great time. I've also been the textbook roommate. On the days I get home first, I clean everything up, make dinner and help with any work project she is concerned with. She also clearly appreciates that.

The thing is I may be catching feelings. When I first met her, I didn't find her to be particularly attractive but I'm finding her preetier everyday now. We really click on personality and values. I don't know how much of this is my brain being blinded by other parts of my body.

She has expressed that she doesn't want a relationship at this point of her life, which may be good or bad since we will be in different States in 2 months. She's also talked about how a recent situation where she friendzoned a guy from her college really bothered her (how ironic).

I don't know what to do. I don't want to create a toxic environment or make coming home more exausting than the job itself. At the same time, I clearly like her and she clearly likes me as something (probably a friend) and don't know if I want to end the summer without knowing what could have been."

Next week will be my last one after around 6 months at my internship. I would like to get some people's phone numbers and instagrams, as it feels weird never seeing them againd and I would like to see what's going in their lives. I feel extremely awkward asking for them and feel like I'm coming across as a creep or like I'm flirting with them.

**Full text:**

Hi,

So I've been doing an internship at a relatively small company for about 6 months now. I'm a 20 year old male. Next week will probably be my last one, and I would really like to stay in touch with some people. Not necessarily hanging out or texting, but just a way to contact them and see what's going on in their life.

As it's a small company, I know almost everyone, we eat lunch together and work on the same floor a few feet apart. I work in the tech department, while most of those people (the ones I want to stay in touch with) work in marketing. That means we don't directly work together but we are in the same room and sometimes talk. I won't consider them friends right now, but they're all nice and fun to talk with during breaks.

I have one person's phone number and Instagram because I paid for pizzas and she wanted to pay me back.

It feels weird spending almost half a year working there and then leaving and never seeing them again. That's why I would really like to add some people on Instagram and get their phone number. I just feel extremely awkward asking for them. Some of them are girls/young women (all still older than me though), and I don't want to come across as a creep or like I'm flirting with them. Also just looking them up and adding them out of the blue seems kinda creepy.

I hope you guys can give me some advice on how to do this without making anyone uncomfortable. Next week we'll probably have some sort of farewell party for all the interns, although I don't know all the details yet. Maybe I can ask them one way or another? I don't want to go around with a card and asking everyone to write their instagram username and phone number. I know that's kind of an extreme example, but one of the best ones I could think of.

Big thanks in advance for any advice!"

I want to prepare and maximize my chances of landing freshman/sophomore internships and if time permits, I would like to at least try for SWE internships too for SUMMER 2023

What I have so far: I plan to use GFG, MyCodeSchool, and Abdul Bari-  as parallel resources alongside Stanford's 4-course DSA specialization. \[I don't care about the certificate but given how much analysis-paralysis I have, I want structured learning hence a MOOC.\] Towards the end of it, I want to start with Blind75/Grind75 and then other high-yield interview topics on LC.

To give an idea of my learning pace, I completed most of the weeks of CS50x in 1-2 days \[1 week in 1-2 days\]

My expected timeline is: To complete DSA by August end. LC from August itself, slowly building up the pace and doing it until Sept-end which is my decided deadline to start applying.

My 2 biggest worries are:

1. Burnout/Trying to do too much
2. Not getting an internship this August-April cycle lol

I would love for a fresh pair of eyes to help me make sense of whether I am going in the right direction and possible recommendations/alternatives if otherwise.

Thank you!

One of the laptops that we *finally* got around to processing after months of it sitting in a return pile is enrolled in Petco’s AutoPilot program. Yes, *that* Petco. This despite the fact that the laptop in question has been in our internal inventory system for years, the HWID was stored on our file server already, and the device’s AAD record matches an employee. It was “found” in one of our other buildings and returned to Helpdesk earlier this year. 

Now, I have no way of confirming or denying that our company has a relationship with Petco. It’s entirely possible that we did at some point or still do, but that doesn’t explain why one of our laptops ended up enrolled in their Intune tenant. So, I made some phone calls…

After a collective total of an hour and a half on the phone with Petco’s corporate IT department, including a call with one of their Intune managers, I have screenshot evidence from a @petco.com email address that the device isn’t present in their Intune tenant. No one I spoke to can find any record whatsoever of that device, but they did confirm that the AutoPilot screen I see is exactly what theirs looks like.

I figured, “what if I try to import the HWID again?” No dice. HWID is registered in another tenant. Then on to Microsoft, who said the device *is* registered but they can’t release it without proof of purchase from my end. My boss says it’s too much effort to track down that purchase order (since the laptop in question is old enough that we don’t deploy it to anyone other than an intern, and we have plenty of available stock already), so it goes to the decommissioned pile. 

Ultimately, most of that investigation was to satisfy my curiosity (which at this point has been entirely replaced by confusion). My colleague found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/fagqrc/laptop_enrolled_in_another_organizations_autopilot/) from someone with the same or a similar issue, but no solution. We’re 99% certain that it doesn’t have to do with malware since the device has been erased at least twice since discovering the issue, not to mention that we would have heard from our cybersecurity department by now if there was a malware concern on the network. 

Moral of the story? I’m gonna be reaching out to that Intune tech at Petco for a LinkedIn endorsement."

How to choose between a masters in:

- Data Science, 
- Comp. Sci (concentrating in Data Science + Software eng.), or 
- Software Engineering (concentrating in Entrepreneurship)

I worry about this because: while I am a bit tired of doing purely analytics based work and want do more coding, I would also like to eventually become a manager (for data engineering or data science or comp sci. - both of which would take me away from pure-ish analytical and coding work). Using my experience so far, I can easily move into management as soon as I'm done with my masters in Data science - I don't think i'll be able to make same kind of leap if I went with a masters in comp. sci or software eng.

While doing a Masters in Data Science would be a great career move, as I said, i'm a bit tired of doing analytics work and a masters in comp. sci or software eng. would allow me broaden my horizons + improve my coding abilities + give me street cred lol (when applying to more technical jobs or just jobs that require a comp. sci related degree as a barrier of entry) + potentially switch into more coding heavy jobs where the pay starting out may not equal what i am making now or that i may be making as a data science manager for the first 3 years of my new coding career lol. for reference: i make about 100 right now and with a masters in data science can/should expect to make 150-200 as a manager - my resume/past-experience really puts me above most of the competition.

Grad school isn't cheap and I think going with a data science degree gives me immediate returns whereas a comp. sci or software engineering masters doesn't promise quick or the same returns (simply because of the sheer volume of applicants that will be majoring in and being pumped out into the job market?).

My ultimate plan (in 10-15 years down the road) is to get an MBA too (in marketing, strategy, finance or etc.) because I have been working with marketing and finance alot and see myself moving into management role there as well. The end goal in 5-10 years after i'm done this masters is to be in a managerial positions, to have tried out consulting at the big4 in my area of expertise (data and/or the intersection of data + coding?) and then to lead my own team of data analysts and data engineers or to lead a team of various coders + marketers as a product owner/manager or VP of some kind.

So I completed my MS in cybersecurity recently from a reputable university in the South-East region (US). My CGPA is 3.821.

I am also studying for the CysA+ exam and CISSP. The reason why I was not able to get these certifications during my Masters is because of financial issues and some other reasons.

I am trying my best to secure a job in some cybersecurity role, but the recruiters are asking for certifications and at least 1 to 2 years of experience and I have not heard from them. Keep in mind I have 1 year of IT experience and 6 months of IT Risk Management internship experience. 

On the other side, I keep getting offers for IT support specialist positions which you all know are basic hardware and software issues, troubleshooting things stuff like that and they can hire me instantly. The reason why I am not accepting these offers is that I think it will look bad on my resume when in the future I will apply for a security position (Please correct me if I am wrong).

At the same time, I DESPERATELY NEED A JOB.

My questions are:  
1: Should I take these IT support specialist jobs?  
2: If I secure CISSP and CySa+ while doing an IT support specialist job, Can I easily secure a job in a cybersecurity role in the future. Will this IT support specialist experience negatively affect my resume in a way that recruiters will think ""Oh hey, this woman was just installing windows, fixing hardware issues in her job, she does not know shit about NIST framework, what is COBIT, what is Cyber kill chain how to use Metasploit, etc """

I have a small foot in either Network stuff and would try to get my Security+ cert OR devops work since i'm partially included in a devops workgroup currently but I'd have to learn everything about the tools actually used (I know what Docker is, that's about it). I equally like the idea of pursuing either but I don't know which is more feasible for someone who isn't absolutely insane at coding either."

Background : I have completed my B.E in EEE from 3-tier college and interested in field of VLSI. I have learnt verilog and impleted some small scale projects like MIPS32 core, I2c, SPI etc. (learnt theoritical portion either from NPTEL or some recomended books) and also learnt  physical design (through NPTEL theory) and learnt OPENLANE flow( An open source flow consisting of open source tool capable implementing Automated P&amp;R and entire RTL2GDS flow) as well and am currently implementing PD with 130 nm node for my and other online available verilog codes to increase my understanding. I know basic of scripting but yet to learn more. Recently got a offer for Mtech VLSI IIIT Banglore.

My goal is to settle in abroad as soon as possible and work in R&amp;D computer architecture. Also Currently I dont have any internship or job experince and lack LORs so I havent applied for any MS programme.

Want to get internship to get industrial exposure and ultimately if lucky land a job ,get expereince (2- 3 yrs) and enough people to write LOR.

My question is Should I join MTech or try to get internship in prominent VLSI company and then pursue MS from abroad ?

Can I even get internship in PD just with the knowledge of opensource tools with 130nm (I am aware that in industry 7nm and below is standard and PD for these nodes possess new chalanges)?

If I pusue Mtech , Can I settle in abroad (US or Europe) after graduation without having to pursue PhD. ?

I am considering internship in PD , as I know how to implement it. I know most of the jobs resides in PD or verification.  I dont know systemverilog and UVM as of now and will take quite some time to learn."

I've never done C# before and the only experience I have with graphics programming is a single lab assignment in R using the Shiny library, and I'm not sure that really even counts, since the library functions handle all the details for you.  

I'm not even sure if I'm going to still be doing this, since, when I told the engineer I'd need a few weeks to get comfortable with the language and the familiarize myself with the project, he said maybe he should find me something else to work on that better fit my skills so I could contribute more quickly.  He said next week we'd meet again but for now I have nothing else to work on and he seemed to want me to at least try to get a start understanding this project.  But where do I even start?  Of course, I could just find C# tutorials -- I started Sololearn's C# course already actually, to get the basics of the language down, but those seemed mostly geared to people who are beginners to programming in general and definitely won't get me up to speed quickly.  Just looking through the code in the Git repository they added me to is too much to start with though, as there's just too much going on with the language that I'm unfamiliar with.  Any advice?"

I should soon enroll at college or start an internship. I would choose the college because later on, I will have a better-paying job with my title, BUT if I chose to do so I won't be able to work for at least 4 years (duration of college). Why do I need to work? Well, I love this guy who's from another country.. We used to date, but we broke up because I messed up.. About a month ago I asked him if he would ever forgive me and give us another chance, he said no, so I announced to my parents that I will be attending college. For the past few days, he's been giving me mixed signals and is giving me the treatment he used to when we used to date.. I believe he would give me a 2nd chance if we can start dating normally and not long distance. I don't wanna be pushy with him and annoy him with questions and proposals, I would much rather have my actions speak.. But I'm scared of being too blinded by my love for him that I'm misunderstanding his actions and that I will regret not taking college and having financial stability. I would wait 1 year and do my internship and start working to see how things go between us, but if I don't enroll this year I won't be able to afford college next year and I will be stuck with a low-paying job.

vdu8zv,754,2022-06-16,"How I unfried a motherboard that was ""100% dead""",filliravaz,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/vdu8zv/how_i_unfried_a_motherboard_that_was_100_dead/,"Hello!  First post here after a good time lurking.

This is not technically a tech support tale, but it's a story of how I managed to impress my tech support ""boss"". So I guess tech support for tech support? However if this story doesn't fit within the scope of this sub, mods hit me up and I'll nuke it to outer space.

A little bit of context first. I am an intern at a somewhat local computer repair shop, but the shop also does many more things for other companies, like web hosting, emails, phones, and stuff like that. As I am just an intern, I don't touch anything that's in a production environment, I only work on devices that come in for physical repair.

Because of this, I also have a ""tutor"", or mostly what I'd call a co-worker, whom we will call John.

John is really good at his job, however, most of the time he's in a rush because the phone never stays silent for more than 10 minutes, as he does most of the remote support as well, but trust me, he's a super nice guy.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, let's get into the story.

On my second day there, I notice that in the pile of ""computers to fix but that can't be fixed right now"" there is a strange computer. It's not technically a computer, it's a server, made by the company with only two letters in the name. It's also a very small server, box-shaped. It also happens that the server is somewhat old, but not old enough to just throw away.

Since I'm a curious nerd, I ask John what's wrong with this server. The answer I get back is not what I was expecting.

&gt;John: ""Oh yea, that server has a fried motherboard. Completely, 100% dead, we're waiting for a similar system to come in so that we can swap the components""

That sound strange to me, because this type of server is made to be reliant (it's even in the name).

Unfortunately for me, a customer walks in with a priority issue (him or his company paid for express fixes) and I get on it to fix it. Really easy but it's the end of the day so we deliver the PC back and go home.

The next day is a very boring day. John is on the phone pretty much since he walked in, or even before he did (the shop uses a system where calls can be redirected to cellphones).

So since I'm bored, but most importantly I'm curious, I pick up that server and take a look at it. John sees me, as the pile of stuff is near his desk and tells me to not bother, it's dead and not even worth looking at it.

So what I do obviously is look at it anyway (I really didn't have anything to do, and since I'm just days in they don't trust me enough to put me to do remote stuff, since that's direct contact with the customer) saying that I wanted to see how it's made internally (true).

I look at it and there's nothing obviously wrong like there aren't blown caps, so I figured that I could plug it in just to see what happens.

So I plug it in, the fan spins but nothing is displayed on the screen, no beeps, nothing.

Maybe it's really fried after all, or, maybe, I forgot to put the ram back in.

My bad, I'm stupid. Luckily the ram is easily accessible so I just take a random DDR3 1333MHz module and plug it back in.

Wow, something new happens! Now, the server actually turns on the screen and displays the boot sequence. This is strange for a fried motherboard, but I just wait and see that it gets stuck in the ram check part of the boot (this specific system shows on the screen what tests it's doing during POST), then it boot-loops with 90% completion but with the same cryptic RAM message on the screen.

I start googling like crazy (\*clicking and typing noises intensifies\*) and I find the manual online. I look at it in the memory section, but it's mostly the same stuff as how to properly mount a RAM stick. Except for one thing. RAM compatibility. I look at the compatible RAM, and it's nonsense to me, but luckily it has an ""in short"" section with a checklist for ram compatibility. That's GREAT!

I ask John where to find DDR3 ECC ram, and he brings me a box filled with random RAM sticks. This is going to be really fun. I need a very specific module, UDIMM ECC, either 1333 or 1600MHz, with more than 2GB per stick but less than 8GB. After one hour of looking at RAM stickers, I finally find two 4GB sticks that fit the requirements.

I immediately swap them in and try booting it up. However this time it doesn't even reach the POST screen with the tests. Uh oh, this is not good.

I start googling again, and I find TWO different manuals for troubleshooting (literally volume one and volume two). In volume two, there is a section about ""maintenance switches"". What even is this lol?I look a bit more, and it turns out, they are basically CMOS clear switches. So I try that, but the same thing happens.I look even more closely and find that a combination of switches enables the recovery BIOS/CMOS (or something like that). Now that's interesting! I flip them all in the correct orientation, and now the server speaker starts beeping out an error code. Well, this will at least hint me towards a fix! Except that the error code is just a long, repeating beep.

If any of you had to deal with this type of error code, you'll know it's pretty much ""it's something RAM related, so here there are 20 different errors that have nothing to do with each other for the same beep code"". FUN.

I duck around a bit and find no solution. At this point, I feel like there's no reason for me to continue since the server is most probably dead. So I just put the switches in the default position and start unplugging the server.

But no, I'm not going to stop just because an engineer put a single error code for 20 different things! I'm going to the bottom of this!

So I just plug it back in to listen again to the error code, maybe I've missed something, but this time I'm no longer in the recovery bios, so the beeps don't happen. Instead, I'm just thrown back at the POSTest screen.  Well, I go to look back at the manual for the switch positions needed, but when I get back to the server, IT HAS COMPLETED THE POST SEQUENCE! Now I'm welcomed by an IPMI IPv4 Address, and a message saying that no boot device was found. This is fine since there is no drive in the server, but I notice something strange about the IPMI address. It's in a completely different subnet from the rest of the network. (normal subnet is 192.168.X.X, IPMI is 10.0.0.3)

Crap.

I know that there are ACLs on the network, so I can't just switch subnets on my PC and connect to it, so I get a random PC from the ""fixed but no contact with the customer for the last 6 months"" pile and take a random RJ45 patch cable straight from IPMI port to the network port of the PC.

I start the glorious windows 7, go to network settings, and manually set the IP to be in the same subnet. I connect to the damn IPMI. FINALLY!

I call over John, who had just got off a 1H+ call with a customer and I show him that it's working GREAT! I managed to start Ubuntu from a live image passed with the IPMI, so it's definitely working.

Now this is the great part. He looks at me with the most confused and surprised face I've ever seen, and just asks me:

&gt;John: ""How did you do that""Me: ""I don't know honestly. I guess it's the power of ducking around!""

I got a free candy bar from the vending machine, but more importantly, trust from my tutor/boss.

I guess everyone can revive from the dead something!

&amp;#x200B;

Ninja edit: I accidentally clicked ""post"" before finishing the last part. I already said I'm stupid ok?

Edit 1: I'm not saying John was wrong. When he is not on the phone and has 30 minutes to check stuff he can find the cause of the strangest and wildest stuff around.   
Also, that specific server came from another repair shop AFAIK, so he was pretty sure that it was indeed dead since the other repair shop is ""reputable"". He tried with some RAM sticks that were supported, but as I commented below, it probably got into panic mode and saw ghost modules. Yes, that happened."
vdunbr,3,2022-06-16,Night shift work comes way too cheap,WindsurfingERdoc,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/vdunbr/night_shift_work_comes_way_too_cheap/,"Consider the following: 

My work involves intermittently working with a chemical. I'm exposed a few times per month. The chemical is a carcinogen, with around 46% increased risk of certain cancers (1). Effects of exposure also result in depression and irritability in about half of people, with as of yet poorly measured impact on social functioning and relationships (2). The mechanism for the depression is not fully understood, but likely involves biological process disruption or possibly direct neuronal injury. Short term effects of exposure result in cognitive impairment with fatal motor vehicle accidents as result (3). Pregnant woman exposed to this chemical has around a 32% increased risk for miscarriage (4). Medium to long term exposure result in significantly increased risk for cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and generally leads to shorter life expectancy.  


We currently have no alternative to this chemical in certain important industries. There are however multiple industries who should not be working with it, but only do so because it increases profit and is relatively cheap.  


I currently have no protective equipment when working with this chemical. I have not been warned or made aware of these risks before starting work with this chemical. My employer doesn't have any risk mitigation, harm reduction, or accelerated health surveillance in place. In fact, my duration and intensity of exposure to this chemical is not even tracked. When attempting to address any of the risks, my employer simply shrugs their shoulders and says ""it is part of the job"". There has been very little attempt across industries to reduce the effects of exposure.  


In my opinion, the apathy from the employers are because:  
1. There have only been sporadic small litigation cases, resulting in relatively minor compensation damages, with no class action suit yet motivating any real change.  
2. The managers and admin personnel are never exposed to this chemical.  


The chemical in question of course, is night shift work. The medical literature has now passed the Rubicon, showing definitively the risks and harms of night shift work. It is in the interest of the bourgeoise the maintain the status quo, and there will likely be ongoing attempts to discredit and controversy the evidence. The societal inertia to real change will be massive - but as covid has shown us, massive inertia can be overcome.  


It is my hope that real change is coming for essential night shift workers, with scheduled sleep on shift / more time off / increased pay /  for those occupations where night shift work is absolutely necessary such as healthcare. Night shift work for capitalism to simply increase profit should become prohibitively expensive to employers. This will not happen before some real financial sting and consequence to employers.  It is an unfortunate reality in our capitalist driven world. As such, I encourage all shift workers:  


\- Reconsider doing nights at all, and be happy and healthy. Nothing motivates change like the inability to find staff.  
\- Maintain and log your duration and intensity of shift work exposure, and request that your employer also logs/signs/verifies this.  
\- Make sure your doctor notes in your chart that you work night shift, with possibly accelerated health screening and to note it as a risk modifier for certain disease.  
\- Make sure you mention night shift work for any mood related disorders, and if the disorder arose before or after you started working nights.  
\- Talk to your lawyer friends. A class action suit should be coming at some stage.  


Night shift work is very expensive, but the true cost of it has been paid by the workers themselves.

vdvqcp,1,2022-06-16,Major life change coming up and I feel hopeless,Nea1000,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/vdvqcp/major_life_change_coming_up_and_i_feel_hopeless/,"Hi everyone. I graduated with my bachelors in English in 2018. I did many internships in my concentrated area and was in for a rude awakening when I couldn't find any work despite applying to places 6 months before graduating. I struggled to find work with this degree but eventually did a few months after graduating. Work environment was incredibly toxic and I was bullied by my superiors. I took it and kept it pushing, but when my health was put in jeopardy because of the stress and I started noticing my body breaking out into hives, I couldn't sleep, etc, I quit in 2019. In 2020, right before the pandemic, I decided to freelance. To say I am immensely grateful that it actually worked out is an understatement, but I knew it would never become sustainable long-term or provide financial stability, so at the age of 25 I decided to go back to school.

I took a bunch of science classes within a year. I ultimately decided on a healthcare program and applied. To my shock (but also delight), I was accepted into all of them. Now the time is coming near for me to start the program in September and I am freaking out internally. My classes were difficult, yes, but the majority of my professors also let us use open notes. I didn't take this for granted and still read the material and put in the effort to participate in class, engage with the material and do extra research on my own, complete all of the labs, etc, but I can't help but feel that deep down I am woefully unprepared for the program I'm going into.

Every single night for the past few months I have struggled with anxiety so high it's near crippling. It has caused the insomnia to get even worse, which I didn't even realize I've been struggling with since 2018 until a few days ago when I looked up symptoms I was experiencing. I've tried everything: relaxing, praying, breathing techniques, spending more time in nature, making sure I'm out socializing and meeting up with friends, talking to my therapist, etc. Nothing is working. I wake up every single night in the middle of the night. It's difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep. Some days I am afraid I will experience a heart attack despite being physically active and fit from the pain in my chest.

I've spent some time volunteering/working in a hospital so I know what it's like. I love helping people and offering care to those in need or in times of trouble. But I don't think that's enough. My primary motivation to go back to school was because I need to be financially secure. My mom is on track to retire soon and although she helps me so much and is my #1 biggest supporter, I want to help her reach her retirement goals. I don't want to hold her back or impede on her. She tells me I don't, and she'll always be here for me, but it's a weight I carry every day.

My mom is a single mom; my dad passed away when I young. We don't have any family near us, it's just us two and her new husband. I can't help but feel depressed because I made an awful decision to study English. I graduated at the top of my class with highest honors, but that doesn't mean much considering I struggled, and still struggle to this day, to find a career where I can transfer over those skills into something longlasting/secure. I feel like HR people take one look at my resume and think, ""nope, she's inconsistent and job hops - next."" The only luck I've had is with hospitals and making a turnaround with a new career altogether.

***I guess what I am asking for is some advice. Is it normal that I'm having second thoughts? Am I just paranoid that my life is moving forward - I have an opportunity, so just take it and keep it moving?*** If money were no object, I would go to law school or work at a nonprofit or an organization that matches my values/beliefs of helping underprivileged people. Unless I receive a major scholarship, law school is out of the question which is why I removed it as an option when I considered going back to school. A few months ago I received a certification to help women experiencing domestic abuse through an organization I support. During training when we broke out into teams, several people asked me if I worked there. They all said I have great communication skills and would be an asset to the organization, which I still hold near to my heart.

When I think about working in those areas, I feel a sense of calm. I know the work will be hard some days. I'm not naive, however, and I know nonprofit/""good for society"" organizations aren't perfect. But if it's something I care about, pays decently/a respectable amount, and is close to where I live so I can save money (I'm very frugal), I'll be happy. Biggest concern here is longevity, though. My mom always asks me, ""that sounds nice, but what about when you're 40 and you need a new job? Would you be able to find another one doing this work? Will you be discriminated against in the workplace based on your age?"" My mom has lived a lot of life and I know she speaks from experience. She had to rebuild an entire life after my dad passed. I don't know if I'll ever get married. Would be nice, but I'm not counting on it. So I need to be financially secure for myself because I know that no one's going to save me.

Now with this healthcare program in September - do I love it? No. Am I looking forward to it? Not necessarily. Is it going to give me a secure career with great benefits? Yes, absolutely - IF I can complete it. I can volunteer part-time and still gain fulfillment from that and step away when I'm burned out, which is a major bonus I wouldn't get otherwise if I worked in that field full-time.

I'm just so scared of this not working out. I've tried three different career fields before I went back to school and none of them worked. I gave it my all and it flopped. I never tried applying for a nonprofit, though, or the organization I completed the dv training with. I'm terrified of my mom's hard earned money being wasted if I can't finish this rigorous program. It's an accelerated 12 month program and even though I'm on break now, I've been so anxious that I've been trying to study material and look at my textbooks in advance, which is stressing me out even more. And if that doesn't work? I'm back to square one, only that I would have lost the $10k I worked so hard to save to put into my pre-req classes and half of the tuition I'm covering, plus rent since I will be moving out state.

I'm at a complete loss. I feel hopeless. I cannot believe I am nearing 26 within a few months, with no career and nothing to show for myself. I feel ashamed and embarrassed. I never thought that this would be my life."

I go to a target school that seems to be one of the favorites for the location.

Since I applied and accepted my internship, I have realized that I would rather go into advisory, particularly deals advisory.

I also know an incoming first year employee in the Boston office if that helps. Given my situation, I have a few questions:

1.Do you think it will be possible for me to network/get exposure to advisory teams and eventually talk to my recruiter about trying to get a full time position in advisory? And if so, how should I go about this?

2. Do you think I would be able to transfer office locations to Boston because that is where I am from and would rather live.

My preference if I get a FT offer would be to work in advisory in Boston, but I would also take a tax role in Boston or an advisory role in Philadelphia.

&amp;#x200B;

I plan on taking on extra responsibility from other groups to get exposure and show that I am driven and am willing to work hard. My grades are on the low end for big 4 hires, which might hurt me if I need to apply again to advisory. My plan for now is to network and talk to my recruiter/mentors about getting experience with advisory this summer.

Thanks!"

I have my CompTIA A+ and N+, and I am currently pursuing a CCNA. I usually do not get replies from employers. Help desk / Desktop support positions is mostly what I have been pursuing, but most seem to take the 1-2 years of experience/Bachelors requirement somewhat serious. I am considering returning to college for a degree to see if this help, and I am starting an unpaid internship for experience.

Does this reflect anybody else's experience? Is the South Florida region particularly difficult for job searching? Is it a bad place to start a career, and if I had to stay, what would be the best use of my time in Miami or better positions and where for my skill?"

Last year I was an honors student, had an internship and partner who things weren’t always good with, but we’re great with at the time. I was on top of my studies, work, and finances. I was a kind and caring individual.

Since then I have undergone some major changes in my life and just feel like I’m sinking deeper and deeper into a pit. 

I cheated on my partner, I’m failing my classes, and had to drop out of my internship. I haven’t been able to pay tuition and have had to rely on my parents for money. All I can do all day is lay around and mope or smoke weed. I’m a liar and a cheater. I feel worthless and awful about myself. I don’t feel like I’ll ever graduate or be able to dig myself out of the pit I put myself in. 

I want to turn my life around. But sometimes it feels like there’s an easier option…"

vdzn5d,1,2022-06-16,"Advice Please! Should I quit my research, and how should I tell my mentor/PI?",rapidestaura446,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/vdzn5d/advice_please_should_i_quit_my_research_and_how/,"Hey everyone, I'm a rising undergraduate sophomore in a bit of a predicament at the moment and would be super appreciative if anybody could provide a piece of advice:

Since high school, I've always intended on studying agricultural bioengineering in university. However, I didn't get accepted into any school with a dedicated biological engineering program, and ended up enrolling in an upper-middle tier university biomedical engineering program instead. My university's BME program didn't really address the sustainability/environmentalism aspect of bioengineering that I was interested in, so I switched my major to computer engineering in hopes of at least securing job security after I graduate.

This summer, I secured a computer engineering research position on campus in a lab I really enjoy working in. I agreed to intern at the lab for 10 full-time weeks over the summer, then part-time throughout the school year. If all goes well, my PI told me that I will likely have my name on a research paper by October. Although I love the people I'm working with and find the research I'm doing challenging and interesting, I realized that I still don't find it as fulfilling as the bioengineering work I wanted to do since high school.

My predicament: This week, my dream program (bioengineering at a T-10 Ivy League university) accepted me as a transfer student. All of a sudden, I have a chance to pursue the bioengineering path I had given up on in favor of computer engineering. My question is, assuming I want to pursue higher education after I graduate, should I stay at my current institution studying computer engineering so that I can publish a paper, or should I drop my research (and likely my publication) to pursue bioengineering?

Second predicament: Assuming I do drop my research, how should I tell my mentor and my PI? They hired me assuming I could work for 11 weeks over the summer and into the school year. If I transfer universities, I will only be able to work for 8 weeks over the summer before leaving for good. Is there a chance I can still do the publication while attending a different college? How should I tell my mentor/PI this news after they've invested so much trust/resources in me so far?

This is my first time posting in this subreddit, thanks everyone for your help, and please PM me if you've had any similar experience!!"

**Demographics**

* Gender: Male
* Race/Ethnicity: White
* Residence: SoCal
* Income Bracket: ($200k+)
* Type of School: Competitive public
* Hooks: None (maybe my speech impediment idk)

**Intended Major(s): Econ, Math, or both (For USC and Vanderbilt I applied to their schools of music, with econ as a backup major for both)**

**Academics:**

* GPA (UW/W at the time of applying): 3.89/4.36
* Rank: School doesn't rank
* \# of Honors/AP: 6 Honors, 7 AP
* Senior Year Course Load: 3 APs, 2 Honors

**Standardized Testing (I took the SAT and ACT each once):**

* SAT: 1420 (660R, 760M)
* ACT: 34 (35 English, 34 everything else)
* AP Bio: 3
* AP Lang: 4
* APUSH: 5
* AP Chem: 4
* AP Macro: idk, prob a 4
* AP Calc BC: idk, prob a 5
* AP Spanish: idk, but really bad

**Extracurriculars/Activities  (the weakest part of my application by far. Bc I stutter, I had always been scared to put myself out there and actually have leadership positions and take initiative, such as starting a club, interning, or working. I had a passion for music and I loved to sing, so I tried to use that as much as possible)**

* Bass singer for a bunch of choirs, both locally and nationally (I thought this would help bc bass singers are pretty rare)
* Cast and crew member in various school theater productions 
* Member of ITS (International Thespian Society)
* Composed music for fun
* Did Junior Lifeguards for 4 years during the summer

**Awards/Honors:**

* AP Scholar w Honors
* Junior Lifeguard Most Improved Award (lol)

**Letters of Rec (The mistake I made here was that I asked for them too late and also that the subjects they taught didn't really relate to what I wanted to study. But I still loved these teachers.)**

APUSH teacher: 7/10 (Really sweet guy, awesome teacher, but I didn't get to know him that much bc APUSH is the most popular class at my school and it was all online. But I needed a rec from humanities so...)

AP Bio teacher: 9/10 (Did pretty bad in her class but after my lab presentation for a final, she called my parents and starting crying to them about how much of an inspiration I was to her. I ended up asking her instead of a math teacher bc of this)

Choir teacher: 6 or 7/10 (Asked her like 2 days before the deadline bc I needed this for the music schools at Vandy at USC. But she likes me a lot)

Counselor: 2/10 (Disaster. He only worked at my school for 6 months before getting fired. He always missed deadlines and waited until the last minute for everything until I got pretty fed up and sent him a pretty rude email lmao)

**Interviews** 

Stanford: 8/10. Really sweet woman. Talked for over an hour. Really hard for me to try and stay fluent but she was really understanding. But she asked some pretty tough questions.

Yale: 6/10. Hard for me to concentrate with the hail outside haha. The best thing probably was when I asked ""What does a typical Yale student do during the weekend?"" And she said, ""Great question!"" But pretty mellow overall. Interviewer was in her 20s.

USC: 2/10. Probably the main reason why I didn't get in. This was different from the other schools. This was an interview with the Thornton School of Music faculty. For a lot of music applicants, this is the easiest part. For me, this was the complete opposite. Overall, of the 3 who interviewed me, the main interviewer was really nice and even sent me a thank you card :), but the other two seemed really arrogant and condescending. But I know I screwed up when I told them I didn't have any questions for them :(

UCI: 1/10: Also probably why I didn't get in. Also for their music school. Really nice people but I was really pitchy during my song and I didn't warm up beforehand.

I didn't get interviews for Harvard nor Duke.

**Essays** 

Probably the strongest part of my application. My common app was about how I was bullied for my stuttering over my 5th grade presentation about the four seasons, and how a few days later, my mom showed me a recording of Antonio Vivaldi's four seasons, which is what inspired me to do music and how I can use melodies and chords to convey emotion. My Stanford essays were probably my favorite. They covered a wide range of topics and they were pretty quirky.

**Decisions (I applied everywhere RD bc I couldn't handle the possibility of getting flat-out rejected ED or EA and having no motivation to finish RD applications)**

ACCEPTANCES:

* UCR
* Cal Lutheran (32.5K Regents)
* Pepperdine (9K Scholarship)
* LMU (19K Scholarship)- **Committed**
* UCD (Initially waitlisted until May 5th)

WAITLISTS:

* UCSD (Ongoing)
* Berkeley (Ongoing, but rly happy about this tbh)
* UCSC (Rejected June 9th) (Don't consider any UC's as safeties lol)
* UCSB (Closed June 11th)
* Occidental lol (Closed May 23rd)

REJECTIONS:

* Duke
* Stanford 
* Yale
* Harvard
* UCI 
* UCLA
* USC (this one hurt at first bc it was my dream school but I was invited to attend a Trojan Transfer Information session which I accepted)

WITHDRAWALS:

* Vanderbilt (Didn't pass the prescreening)

**What I learned:**

A LOT of things. My fall semester Senior Year, I had put college apps aside for SO LONG bc I was scared of putting myself out there and maybe I got a little too overconfident. When I woke up on Halloween weekend and realized I had NOTHING done, that was probably the most hopeless I ever felt and all my confidence dropped. Even if I had wanted to apply early, I would've had to get EVERYTHING done in 2 days when this should be a process covered over months. Now I realized what Tim Urban was talking about in his Ted talk about procrastination. I was definitely humbled by this process, and I felt like not only I let myself down, but also my parents when the USC and Ivy rejections came out. Being born to immigrant parents, I was always taught to work hard, and I felt like I was ruining that mentality for my family. 

However, in all fairness, this process has helped me for the better in terms of time management, fear and determination. I'm now looking for jobs and internships and I don't care what people think. The mistakes I make in the past are tools for me to use later on in my life. To all high schoolers and even middle and elementary schoolers, don't be afraid to try something new and put yourself out there.

In the end, I ended up choosing LMU over UC Davis bc I felt like this happened for a reason. I would be much more comfortable in a smaller school and also it was much closer to home so I could come home and see my parents during the weekend without having to pay for flights. I also toured the campus and I absolutely loved it! Yes, it's expensive. However, I will work as many jobs as I can to help my parents as a thank you for everything they've done for me. It's gonna be a tough decision if I get off the other 2 waitlists, especially Berkeley, but I'll worry about that if it happens. Now I'm attending a school right by the beach as an Econ/Math double major, and I could not be happier! 

Go Lions!!!"

After months of searching for internships I finally got a paid internship at a large tech company but I had to go through countless applications and interviews and shit and spent dozens of hours. I know a kid from my school that has an expensive college counselor ($100 an hour) that gave them free access to a private HYPSM research internship that all they had to do was fill out a google form. There wasn’t any test of skill but the general public can’t even participate.

What’s really shitty is their internship will probably be viewed as more “prestigious” and “academic” and better for college admissions even though all they do in their internship is search things up and make slideshows. There’s literally nothing I can do about it but the access to internships and admission opportunities are just so unfair and makes me want to quit the process"

I’ve talked to my parents about it, and they seem to think that it may be a mistake to switch, as you don’t need a computer science degree to get a decent programming job. They think with would be better for me to have the “engineer” title to be more versatile and to show that I could work with hardware if the company wanted me to. But like I said, I don’t think I would ever pick a job where hardware would be a factor, as I simply wouldn’t enjoy doing it as a career.

A little bit of what I’ve discussed with my parents thus far:

-It would be cheaper for me to switch to computer science since engineers have to pay a $1000 engineering fee every semester and engineers have to pay a $2000 co-op fee for 3 required co-ops ($6000 in total)

-I would be getting a Cybersecurity minor if I switched to computer science to help me stand out when it comes to applying for jobs

-The first 2 years of computer engineering at my school are relatively similar to the first 2 years of computer science so I would only be one or two classes behind

-I’m actually passionate about programming and enjoy doing it. I actually dread going to my electrical engineering classes because of how little I enjoy working with and learning about hardware outside of my own personal projects

-I am currently an RA at my school and get housing paid in full because of that. If I remain a CE major, I won’t be able to be an RA because of how co-ops work and when we are required to complete them (basically I’ll be gone for spring of my junior year and fall of my senior year because of when co-ops are) so I would have to pay for housing my last two years, as it is unlikely they would hire me to work for only half of the year

-CS majors are still required to do internships (and even if they weren’t, I would still do some anyway just to get experience) so I wouldn’t be missing out on hands on experience in the field if I were to switch

Just to be clear, my motivation for wanting to switch is not because I find my electrical engineering classes too hard or because I wasn’t doing well. My electrical engineering grade was actually one of my highest grades last semester. I just thought I should clarify this because I know my parents were worried that I just wanted to switch because it was too hard or that I wasn’t willing to put in the extra work to do well.

I just need some advice. Do you think it would be a mistake to switch my major since I could just dive more in depth in programming on my own, or because computer engineering is so similar to computer science anyway?"
vec0s0,5,2022-06-17,"I've started looking late for a PhD, should I just try again next year?",NoOne-AtAll,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/vec0s0/ive_started_looking_late_for_a_phd_should_i_just/,"(TL,DR at the end)

I'm a Physics Student from Italy and I want to do a PhD in Physics in Europe after I get my master's degree.

In the last few months I have just looked for places where I'd like to do my PhD (mostly looking at groups doing research I'm interested in). However I haven't had time to actually apply to any of these places, since I've been busy with exams and thought I would be fine looking at it later.

In the last few days I've realized how wrong I was and how much time you really need to apply to a PhD. I've passed deadlines for many programs I was interested in, and now my choice is much more limited.

Also, since I'm working on my thesis and my last exam, I don't have much time to apply and write a research proposal (where required). 

This also means that if I were to try to apply, the proposal, interviews and exams would take away a lot of time and make it impossible to graduate on time.

I've started to think that applying this year is pretty much impossible, but this would mean not doing anything for a few months up to a year. Apart from being demotivating, this would also reflect badly on my CV, which would end up having a hole between by Master's Degree and my PhD application.

I've thought about doing a research internship, but from what I've seen in Europe it's only part of Master programs and so I would not be eligible. If anyone knows more, it would be a great help to share it here.

(**TL,DR)** I believe this now leaves me with choices:

1. Try to apply as best as I can with half-baked research proposals to places I might not like/doing research I'm not that interested in, and possibly even fail to graduate in time.
2. Apply next year, and have better choices, but with a worse CV.

Anyone care to help or simply share their experiences?"

I had some profile reviews from other programmers and recruiters and they said that i qualify as a junior but i need to earn a little of formal job experience because most of the companies nowadays demands a little of real work experience for juniors to be hired, in this case they recommend me to join to an internship to get that experience

My tech stack is the mern stack, i also have my personal website, portfolio, collaborations to companies, collaborations to other programmers etc etc...

For me, i'm willing to accept a junior position, but the truth is that no one pays attention to you if you don't have proven work experience first, so i'm stuck in this phase and i don't know what to do, i want to work as a developer but i'm out of ideas on what can i do in my case"
vecgzn,0,2022-06-17,CS in USA(Scholarship) or BSc. CSIT or Computer Engineering in IOE?,faultintrospection,Nepal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/vecgzn/cs_in_usascholarship_or_bsc_csit_or_computer/,"Expecting answers from upperclassmen be it from CSIT or BCT. Please give your detailed reviews and information to this disoriented lad. I can make it to IOE, no doubt tara Computer Engineering is on the top hierarchy so I'm afraid I'll not make it to the top. Even though if I make it to the top, Computer Engineering ko 9-5 study hour's gonna fk me up. There won't be any time for learning languages on my own, let alone freelance or do an internship.

BSc. CSIT ko course is not up to date as heard from the upperclassmen. Still hooked onto the saying "" Skills matter, degrees don't"". I'll be able to spare some time for work or to learn other skills on my own. I could do internships and researches mid-way which would make a good impression on my ECs for masters application. 

USA is top tier in education. I'll be giving all of my time in but atleast it'll be worth it for the education is valid. I will prolly get a 3.6-3.7 GPA in +2 boards, have been writing Essays and gotten good reviews from proofreaders and scholars (Fisk, Colby, Seewanee scholars from Nepal). If I get a good SAT score and apply to several Unis, might as well get in with full-ride in one or two.

I have a mixed feeling of both going abroad(in case I get a full-ride) and staying here, learning programming languages on my own and freelancing or doing internships. If degree doesn't matter, why pursue BCT for the Er. tag only? Also, I'm more into softwares so I see no good for me in it. 

I also have a family to look after as I'm the second child and my sister's abroad doing her Masters. We are financially unstable too and I haven't foreseen of what happens after I leave. What would you do if it were you? 

**TL;DR** : A lower-middle class, academically sound, +2 graduate, confused of career choices (US, BSc CSIT or BCT) asking for suggestions and experiences of seniors (highly expecting answers from the ones who are studying in the respective fields)."

However, for the last year, I have been an intern at a photogrammetry company in a data science team, with me mainly taking care of the labeling needed to train their ML models. I took this internship as it is really hard to get a game development one in my country and I needed to work a certain amount of hours to finish my degree. The working conditions are great, and the pay is good, so I've been quite happy working there even though the work got boring at times. The thing is that now, as I'm finishing my degree next month, they have offered me a position as a QA Junior Engineer, so I would be moving to a position more similar to that of a developer as I would use Python and some simple C++ to help develop the tools used by the next interns they hire, acting as well as their supervisor.

At first, I happily accepted as it seemed like a step forward, I would work 1 or 2 more years at this company while still learning more of the technologies I will need to be a game developer and while also signing up to game jams to improve my portfolio, while having a good salary and a great working environment, but the more I think about it I get more doubts, as I don't know if I'm getting too derailed from the path I have always wanted to take.

In your experience, is moving fields something doable? When in the future I want to get a job as a game developer, will this time be detrimental?

i assume the opportunities for working at startups and smaller companies will likely become more limited but how about big-tech/known companies? are they also going to be hiring less interns?"

vejp4d,1,2022-06-17,Part time vs full time student and internship eligibility?,gullibleMD,cscareerquestionsCAD,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsCAD/comments/vejp4d/part_time_vs_full_time_student_and_internship/,"I’m doing a second degree in CS. This means I only have to take half the amount of courses to graduate for my second degree. As a result, I’m taking 3/5 courses instead of the usual 5/5, which my school labels as part time (but full time for osap). 

I just wanted to know if this will affect my eligibility for internships during the summer? Or do they not care if you’re part time vs full time?"
vekltt,2,2022-06-17,Software engineer or data engineer for first job?,tomunko,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/vekltt/software_engineer_or_data_engineer_for_first_job/,"I think I’m more interested in application development than like ETL and data management work, but the problem is my internship was as a data analyst so I think it will be easier to get offers as a data engineer.

Assuming the pay for all my offers is the same, should I take a data-centric job if I get it first or wait for a more traditional/interesting software engineering job? I don’t want to get stuck on a track that makes it hard to switch over since I essentially only have coursework experience with python and SQL. 

Thoughts?"
veliu8,1,2022-06-17,Encoding utf-8,paranoidandrea,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/veliu8/encoding_utf8/,"I’m working with some python 2 code trying to debug it to run in my Ubuntu os. I was getting some encoding errors as I try and fix it error by error. I’m super new to programming, started when I started my internship so I thought oh let’s change the encoding: utf-8 at the top of the script to 16 or 32 just to see what happens.

Well what happens is exec format error in terminal when I run it on a file (it’s data reading/manipulation and processing), when I went and changed them all back to utf-8 they now still won’t run and cite the same error in the terminal, and then if I just run it from the IDE I get:

Non-UTF-8 code starting with ‘/xfe’ in file /the/file/path/file.py on line 1, but no encoding declared

However, lines 1 and 2 are a shebang line and encoding declaration-

!/usr/bin/python3

encoding: utf-8

(I didn’t include the hashes here on Reddit but they’re in the script) 

 How do I fix this? 

Code im working with is not allowed to be even in my personal machine at all, so I don’t think I can share anything here. I was thinking this may be a question that could get solved without any code sharing but if that’s not the case, apologies!"
vemh9g,1,2022-06-17,I’m writing my note. It’s over for me.,ydavid25,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/vemh9g/im_writing_my_note_its_over_for_me/,"I’m shocked that at 21 I’ve been able to fuck my life up so completely. I haven’t felt truly happy or hopeful since I was in middle school, and even with all of those years of sadness 2022 has been the most horrendous one yet. In the past I could bury myself in work and I didn’t worry about my internal world. All I did for years was grind and in a real sense, it sort of worked - I ended up advancing a lot quickly, I got to leave the shitty town that I grew up in, I got into a great school and I’ve been having good internship opportunities. If I was to tell my 14 year old self how things ended up, I’d be ecstatic, but it fills me with no joy. I can barely get up to go to work most days, let alone perform well and network. My grades haven’t slipped yet, but it’s getting harder and harder to submit things on time. I had to take a mental health leave midway through last semester because I couldn’t handle the stress of school and jobs. I’m failing at everything I try to do and I know I’m destined for a slow and mediocre decline.

I’ve been having chronic pain after a car accident, doctors have been unhelpful and the only thing they left me with was a ton of medical debt. Im in so much pain daily that living is a struggle, let alone getting things done. I can’t trust doctors any more and they’re so egotistical and stupid that I doubt they’d be able to help me if I could. The only thing that I have to look forward to is a future of pain and sadness. I have (at least) daily panic attacks and even the low dose anti-anxiety medication that I take can’t help very much with it. I had one while driving home and I was lucky it happened at night, otherwise I could have caused a pretty major accident.

Im also a massive addict: nicotine, alcohol, porn, and weed are the main culprits. But I’m also pretty into adderall and acid. All of them are great (besides nic, which just helps me with the sleep deprivation) because they help me forget the stuff that’s bothering me. I need to get fucked up pretty much every day just to not kill myself (tbh I view them mostly as a method of self harm, it lets me kill myself slowly without having to take the big act). But at this point, even the drugs are starting to work less and when they stop that’ll probably be my day to go. 

The worst is still to come. Last month my first and only long term boyfriend, the only man in my life who has ever helped me feel good and validated ended our relationship for some arbitrary reasons. There was no signal, we were eating dinner and having fun one moment, the next I’m single. One thing he said to me really stuck out, “You have to learn that your depression doesn’t only affect you, it’s a poison that harms other people”. Big fucking punch in the stomach right? That might have been the one that really pushed me over the edge, because it’s almost certainly true. That’s how I finally rationalized going through with it, if my depression is so harmful to others and there’s a good chance that it’ll be a lifelong issue, my continued presence on this earth will only bring pain on the people that I love. The only reason I held off before was because I didn’t want to think of making my mom cry (did once as a child, still feel shitty about it). But at the end of the day, if I’m a net negative on her life, I think it’s the best thing that I can do for her. But that’s not all folks, recently I decided to hook up with someone to see if it could handle some of the pain that I was dealing with. The condom broke and the person took plan B, but we won’t know if they’re pregnant for a little while, meaning that there’s at least some chance that I’ll be a parent soon. They got mad at me because I wasn’t able to comfort them through the event and sent me a text basically saying that they never want to see me again which I understand, I’m a piece of shit who couldn’t handle the adult responsibility of the situation. If they do end up getting pregnant and don’t want to abort, the whole life that I’ve worked so hard all these years for is gone. All the suffering all the late nights and all the stress for fucking nothing. Speaking realistically I couldn’t parent a child, if anything them growing up as far away from the poisonous depression that I have is the biggest act of love that I can give to them. I would die of guilt knowing that I subjected a child to the same depression that has almost killed me and likely will soon. I feel like the only way to repay that sin is to die. I will never find love again and I will never be 

I’ve fucking tried it all, I’ve gone to two different therapists. I tried to get psychiatry but that didn’t work out. I exercise 5 days a week, cut out substances for a year, eat a good diet, go outside, hang out with friends, all the typical jazz. I even got a cat and tbh (I feel terrible for sayin this) I fucking hate him, he’s bitey, I don’t get him, he wakes me, up and just stresses me out more than life does without him. He’s just another chore I have to do in my life. He doesn’t love me in any robust sense, he’s just there, waiting for me to give him food or clean up his mess. I’ll drop him off at a good shelter before I pull the trigger. Unfortunately, nothing has made me any happier, if anything, the more of these tasks I try the worse I feel. Right now I don’t want to do anything but drink, take drugs, and rot in my room. 

I wrote my note and I know my day is coming up. Idk, I’m willing to listen to suggestions on how to cope, but as of now I’m unconvinced I’ll ever be happy again."
ven0my,1,2022-06-17,Will my 2-4 year job gap be an issue once I graduate?,PM_M3_PUPPIES,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ven0my/will_my_24_year_job_gap_be_an_issue_once_i/,"So I have a few tech job &amp; education experiences. These are my roles:

- Junior DBA Fortune 500 (internship) 2020
- System Architect Mid-Size company (apprenticeship) 2021
- Devops boot camp (apprenticeship/boot camp) 2021
- AS in comp sci community college expected grad year 2023

I’ll be starting my degree at a uni next year. At the moment, I’m stuck doing food service to earn extra money while I attend school full time. It’s back breaking tbh. The reason I haven’t gotten into roles related to programming is because I don’t feel like I have a good grasp in it. I still need hella practice. These roles were all achieved by technical apprenticeships and programs. It’s safe to say I did not take full advantage of teaching myself how to code. I mostly did basic sql queries and UX/UI design with very minimal coding. I do think I have good grasp on some things but all that’s missing is the coding (&amp; DS&amp;A but I won’t worry about that till I get to my uni courses). Also the boot camp was very fast paced so we went through topics quickly (it was 8 weeks).

Anyways, I was thinking about getting into internships my senior year. By the time I get there it will be 2024 or 2025 so I will have a gap in my resume. I needed to pay my bills so I just went into the food industry and I’m continuing to self teach myself to code when I get home. I think I have good experience to land a job once I’m out but I’m worried I may not get any internships my senior year and I’ll be left with an even bigger gap. I really can’t afford to have short term employment, I need consistent money through the year but I can manage unemployment my senior year. 

I read a lot about how important it is to have internship experience but idk if it will look odd that my last role was in 2021. My expected grad year is 2024 or 2025.

My parents put a high bar of getting into college by giving me two options. CS at top 10( Stanford, MIT, Cornell, etc.) colleges or being a doctor, and I choose the former. Now as a sophomore I need help cleaning out my ec list so I can focus on things that can be helpful for top colleges to choose me and I can go deep into. I also want things on my ec's to have a story I can write my common ap on. I live in America and a below middle class family so I don't have lots of cash. Anything on the list the list with an asterisks I did freshman year and anything that did not I am planning to do my sophomore year. Also some stuff are not ec.  

High School Activities:

&amp;#x200B;

Yale (8/10): Went for 110 minutes, really engaging conversations about not only college stuff, but life in general. I think I reflected a decent amount of deep thinking/stuff like that, but it wasn't awkward at all and it was really fun.

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

Discussed how show choir transformed me as a person, as someone who doesn't just conform to everyone else that just does purely cs. Writing vocabulary was nearly nonexistent, it was very dry in wording but I showed it to people and they said the content was really good.

I wrote it in 2 hours and made a total of 5 major revisions, totaling about 8 hours..

 PM me for further details if you want it because I'm too lazy to write here.

**Additional Information:**

Throughout the process I had no idea what to do. I also procrastinated a ton on most of my essays, writing nearly all of them the same day of the application deadline. I only fully got acquainted with the application process around mid-October, and by then it was nearly too late; i almost forgot to request recommendation letters, etc.

Due to the application size this year, I suspect that a lot of AOs never even got to see my application, or at best, spent half the time reading mine than other people who submitted it earlier. This might explain why the schools I got rejected/waitlisted from are also the schools where I submitted the application past 11PM on the due date. So make sure to submit your application early! With the total number of applications rising every year, if you submit yours late, they might not even look at it and hand you a rejection.

I really wanted to attend a HYPSM school, regardless of its CS department ranking, so therefore, in order to maximize my chances, I chose to apply to Yale EA as I heard they were recently accepting more Olympiad qualifiers than before, especially with CS. I believe this is related to Yale's recent commitment to revamp their STEM schools, especially in computer science, and therefore since my parents kept emphasizing that my application profile wasn't strong enough, I applied to Yale hoping they would look at my awards. I called this plan a ""safety reach,"" which is ironic since Yale isn't even close to even a target, but the oxymoron kind of makes sense since it was the school I had the best chance of applying to.

Looking back, I now somewhat regret this decision and I maybe could have tried something like MIT or Stanford EA instead, for a higher chance at those schools.

I focused so much on these schools that I forgot to apply to my state schools during EA. So, as you can imagine, the period between 12/18/21 (Yale's decision) to early March was peak anxiety for me, as I had no college acceptance during this time, not even from my state school. I was really happy when I got my acceptance from Purdue CS, which gave me hope as, as other people said, nobody got into Purdue CS last year during RD. So it gave me hope for what was about to come next.

I was also baffled by the fact that a lot of people with Olympiad qualifications didn't get into MIT or other top STEM schools like before. I think colleges are starting to place a lot more emphasis on research and community service rather than awards and honors, which might explain some of my rejections.

But anyways, at the end of the day, one acceptance is all it takes to be happy with your results. I'm so excited to attend Yale in the fall and it has completely shifted my perspective a lot. Before Ivy Day, I was headstrong on the idea that I would be doing almost all CS classes at whatever college I go to. But after reflecting on what I really wanted in life, it seems that this is not the case. College should be a place to explore what you want, a place where you can try new things and fail without too many consequences. CS is not everything, rather, according to Yale and an SAT prompt, it should only be built on top of a solid humanities education, which will truly last for a lifetime. I'm excited to try things that have nothing to do with CS in college, starting with things like theatre.

If I had to go through this process again (my advice), is that essays are far more important than one might think. I know it's heavily emphasized already, but I have some anecdotal evidence to prove it.

Many of the people I met at Yale aren't like ""insane"" with one or two olympiad qualifications, rather, I think that the Yale AOs thought that their personalities were really enjoyable and ""fit"" on campus. Case in point, while they were reading excerpts of people of accepted students during Bulldog Days, one of the lines they read was ""I was told I would look smokin' hot in Yale blue"" (no joke). AOs read have to read way too many applications, so make sure that instead of writing something serious, add some sarcasm, humor, or pizazz to your essay to not make it dry. This is not your college writing style, this is sort of like what you would get if you attempted to send an interview script via a text message to your friend.

I'm happy to answer any other questions in the comments below, and feel free to PM me about anything else :D

Good luck on all your applications!"
veqc9j,0,2022-06-17,I made a huge mistake.,Top_Distribution_497,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/veqc9j/i_made_a_huge_mistake/,"Back when I was applying for admission into my college, I chose a course which had a predefined specialization in AI/ML through a third party vendor(in my case it was upgrad).

The course promised a cse course with specialization in AI/ML. Back then, i was quite happy with my decision as i always wanted to learn ML. 
After 2 years, now when I am about to start my 3rd year, i am having second thoughts. From what I know, most of the jobs in AI/ML are given to highly qualified PhD students. Unfortunately for me, my family is condition is not very great rn and I probably wont even be able to pursue my master's let alone a PhD. Moreover, i have realised that my college is already skipping some subjects (not very important) from my specialized course. Basically not even including them in our syllabus. 

So here I am, thinking of switching my specialization to full-stack developer which might actually get me a job as soon as i complete my under-graduation. I have already paid for that extra specialized course in ML, but i am ready suffer that loss if i can be assured that I can get a decent job after my graduation.

A bit of a background on me. I have a cgpa of 8.1(out of 10) and although I have not yet applied for any internship i consider myself a pretty good student. I am not giving up on ML because its hard, but because I have to chose a career path that can assure me a job 2 years from now(of course I will work hard for it)?


What are your views on this? Should I keep the same course and continue learning AI/ML or are my thoughts on AI/ML students getting jobs only after a PhD are true, and so i should switch. Please help me out here.."
veqdu6,3,2022-06-17,Am I an over achiever or is it just my mental illness?,JoAllKnowledge,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/veqdu6/am_i_an_over_achiever_or_is_it_just_my_mental/,"Hi, I'm writing here because my problem is so broad I wasn't sure where to exactly post. 

I'm a university student and I'm currently diagnosed with OCD and borderline disorder (even though I think I have generalized anxiety disorder). 

For the first time since I've started taking my meds (9 months ago) I begun experiencing the same things I had before like suicide thoughts, self harm thoughts, feeling like I'm not good enough and that I'm running out of time, feeling like I'm not an adult and I'll never be, fear for my future, fear that others hate me and last but not least constant tightening of the chest and sometimes I have a mini ""attack"" ( I call  it like that but it's not an anxiety attack it's just that sometimes I'm walking and randomly my chest tightens, my fingers block in weird positions and the only thing I feel is a sense of dread for myself and for my life, they last from 5-10 seconds and then I'm able to snap out of it) 

I don't know why this started though I think it could be for two reasons: either it's because four days ago I forgot one pill (but it happened before and I never felt like this) or it's because of other two things that happened: I had a 25/30 on the exam for which I studied for a month (apparently it's not enough, even though my colleagues study for 2 weeks max and get higher grades) and I felt so prepared about it and I started my internship, that painfully reminds me every day of my last job (that I will only say really left me ""upset"") and makes me feel inadequate . 

I've talked to my therapist about this and she says it's because I want to do too many things and this will lead inevitably lead me to failure in all of them, for example the fact that I wanted to prepare four exams for this month and she made say I will only take two, the fact that I want to take a separate internship to have more on the curriculum and I didn't even tell her about all my other plans (just to give you an idea I'm currently thinking about studying for my master abroad, taking my master and at the same time a bachelor in biotechnology (that I of course can't do online), learning french and korean and in september trying to have a social life, start going to the gym and maybe find a girlfriend/boyfriend)

I know it's a lot of stuff, but I'm afraid that if I don't do these type of things now I will never have the time again (which is not rational I know since I'm currently twenty), but for some reaon it's a constant thought in my mind

I've already sent a message to my psychiatrist, but I wanted to hear from someone who knows what  I'm talking about, who lived through it or is living through it 

Thanks for reading through all this and please share your opinion however minuscule it seems. Every litte bit helps"
veqihv,1,2022-06-17,"Need advice - I ghosted a group of friends for what I believe is a good, mental health reason.",dinoliz93,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/veqihv/need_advice_i_ghosted_a_group_of_friends_for_what/," Long-time stalker, first time writing. This event began in August of last year, and continues to now (June).

My best friend and I have been friends since the fourth grade (20+ years). We are almost thirty, and met in school, were roommates through college, in each other's weddings, etc. Let's just say - we have a strong history. What's also important to know is that we come from VERY different backgrounds: my friend comes from a very priviledged family, and basically had everything handed to her (parents paid for college, never had a job until she needed an internship, etc.). Meanwhile, my story is quite the opposite: I qualified for free-and-reduced lunch (but my parents were too proud so they never signed me up) I've had a job since I was 14, put myself through college with 3 jobs, etc.

Back in August, my friend told me her mom was hiring 2 individuals to work for her, via through a brokerage. The company she worked for has a very strong no-nepotism policy, thus the brokerage, and we had to keep the job on the DL. Despite having no qualifications for the role, and me currently going to grad school for a completely different position, my friend's mom encouraged me saying she would make sure I would succeed, get the training I needed, etc. It wouldn't be a pay raise, but it would be entirely remote, which was the appeal. I had an offer letter in my email that evening. My current job in Marketing (which I am VERY good at and considered a senior leader in) was paying for my grad school, which my friend and her mom knew about, but per their encouragement and persistance I put in my two weeks.

I lasted 4 months at that job, applying for new jobs about two weeks in. It was very clear that all of the promises my friend's mom gave me was a lie, and to say that job was a toxic work environment would be an understatement (I've worked at jobs that actively discriminated against minorities and pregnant women, and that place was more of a dream than here). My friend's mom turned into a completely different person than what I knew, and I was constantly being told I wasn't earning my paycheck - despite working 12 hour days, 6 days a week. Mind you, none of the training or 'made to succeed' ever occurred. Example, I was flown to the Kansas office ""for training,"" of which I was put into an office alone and did my normal work. Which, of course, I was teaching myself how to do, because I was given vague guidelines and only ever yelled at for underperforming by said mother, and brokerage owners. Meanwhile, my best friend is given a mentor who works direct for the company (not the brokerage), and is treated entirely differently because the team knows she is the 'boss's daughter.'

The entire four months I worked at this company, I cried an average of 4x week, was stressed non-stop, and worked so much my dog changed loyalty to my husband over me (dog owners know what a big deal this is). In November, friend's mom calls me for a 'customer meeting prep' at a Panera, which was very crowded. She ends up telling me the job isn't working out and I have two months to find a new position. We sit there for an hour, I cry the whole time, it's clear that people are listening because after changing the topic a stranger joins in the conversation - the entire scenario is horrible.

In December, finally landed a sweet job somewhere else after four months (where I'm at now, and in a much better mental state than before). I quite the other job on the spot, giving them a well-written letter with references on why their place was a toxic work environment and ways to improve (it was professional, I promise you), and I blocked my friend's mom's number from my phone.

It has been 6 months. My best friend has never texted me since before I quit the job, nor I her - despite our long history together. Why I'm really messaging this group is the following reasons:

My friend and I had the same friend group in college, since we were roommates. She ends up marrying a mutual friend, who ends up getting one of those jobs as a campus minister for a Christian club that gets paid via people donating. I donated for 6 years, but post this scenario, I quit my giving in January (for obvious reasons, which I'm sure he also knows about - although, benefit of the doubt, I'm sure his story has only been told from their point of view, which would be phrased very differently than what I've described above). I've received two text messages, per below from him:

**Text Message 1:** ""Hi OP! How's it going? I just wanted to check in and say hi because I haven't seen you in like forever! Also... I noticed you stopped giving toward my ministry budget back in January I think, and I wanted to see if that was on purpose or if maybe a card just expired or something? No worries if it was on purpose, I just wanted to make sure and see what's up.""

**Text Message 2:** ""Hey again! I just wanted to check in and see if we could chat. Hope you're doing well!""

Note: I'd like to make a note that I've responded to no texts from him, or from our third roommate in college who ended up marrying my best friend's brother. The point is that I need to cut communication off from the family entirely. Yes, I should block their numbers and I wouldn't be having this post. No, I haven't, because the petty side of me wants an apology . . . from literally like anyone.

AITA for ghosting him &amp; my other friend? OR, should I just never reply, or what reply would you give to this text message?"

I had such a great time interviewing and really thought I’d adjust quickly and was extremely excited ab the company. I’ve been here for a few weeks now and am finding it so incredibly hard to adjust. I’ve had internships and previous jobs before, but have never found it hard to make friends during then. Now at this job, I dread going into the office. I haven’t made a single real friend or have found an “ally” at work yet.  I don’t talk to anyone beyond a simple “hello”, eat lunch at my desk (this seems to be the norm here) and am too afraid to continue a conversation for longer even when the other person initiates it. for the most part, theyre all pretty young (millenials, early 30s) but I havent met any Other person fresh out of undergrad. Everyone I have met, even those in the same position as me, are at least 4-5yrs older.  


dont get me wrong, everybody has been friendly and welcoming so far. My team even brought me out to lunch a week after I joined to get to know me. Even tho it was for me, I barely talked. I found myself holding back when they were asking questions about myself or telling me to give an honest answer/opinion about something. I want to make friends and get close to people, but I think I’m still afraid of showing myself in a bad light esp not being that far along in my career yet. I’m also too afraid to joke around and keep our interactions short/formal because deep down, I still view my coworkers as superiors because they are older than me so I assume there are inherent boundaries to our relationship. I feel like an intern rather than a full time employee. Can anyone relate? What can I do to get over this? I want to break this feeling while it’s still early on"

I have finished one and I start my second one only to let go today as the place I work at has a slower summer then usual and I got hired at a time where five other people also got hired and I heard that the owners is telling my manager that there are too many people at her store and I do agree as why do you need nine people to the jobs of three to four people. I have worked about 250 hours until now and then I was let go and I have only two classes left to get my degree, my last internship class and the final class that students can take once all other classes are done and finished.  I asked my manager if I was bad worker, she told me that I am very good, it is just that high inflation and high gas prices are hurt lots of our clients and they are cutting back spending. I would have to dropp out of college and my last interhsip and then re-enroll and take my internship class and then take my last final class and get my degree.

I don’t know what to feel or do? I am trying to keep my head up high as my former manager told me to use her as a reference and that I was a good worker, but outside forces made bad things happen. I feel that I let down my parents who were happy about my internship. I don’t want to drop out of college when I am so close to get my degree. I just don’t know what to do? I feel like I am lost in the middle ocean with no map and hurricanes are coming closing on me."

vew0at,1,2022-06-17,I am alone I don't know where to go,Astro_cheran,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/vew0at/i_am_alone_i_dont_know_where_to_go/,"I've been struggling with depression for years now and I (F 20) feel like i've ruined the last ""beautiful"" years of my life. for a little background, I moved 6 times in my life and each time was from a country to another. My ID card is a whole bunch of nonsense at least 3 countries are mentionned on it. I don't have childhood friends anymore and the few people that are left after all my chaotic life just scare me now because of how much we drifted apart. My best friend lives 1000 km from me, and the people I cared for the most were my highschool friends but as you can start to understand at this point my father just made us move for my last year of highschool despite us bawling our eyes out, begging him to prolungate his contract (which he could absolutely do, his team loved him and they would have been absolutely willing to agree if he asked to stay). 

Things started to spiral during my last year of highschool. That school was just horrible under every damn aspect. People were generally really popularity driven so the new kid arriving in a place where people knew each others for 12 years could not just easily fit in. A bunch of girls seemed to tolerate me, bless their hearts because they had me in pity but they were clearly not thrilled to have an awkward ugly unpopular introvert in their friend group, and I am grateful for them to not have kicked me out.

Now I am in college. I thought I was going to study to get my dream job but in reality I just can't take how much that place sucks too. It's been 2 full years since I've had a real week of vacation without constantly panicking for school matters. School year ended a month ago, I haven't stop going there to work every single fucking day because those arses just gave me new exams because my grades were 0.03 points too low to validate 2 subjects. They know I have been struggling with mental health issues for 2 years, they know I've been under a lot of medication because of that. They know I've had meningitis at the beginning of the year a week before the exams and that why my grades were exceptionnally a little low. They convinced me that they were nice and understanding, and that those grades weren't to be counted on the final grading system. But they did.

They also stood me up three times when I asked for a meeting with the schools internship conselor, which is a useless bitch for many reasons that i'm too lazy to explain but she refused to grade one of my assignments when my aunt was dying. 

I just want to let go of that. I hate what I learn. My friends don't give a shit about me there, I love them so much, for they are my only family, but they don't seem to even acknowledge my existence these days. They made their own new popular friends and I am not good enough anymore. So many things just go constantly wrong. I gave so much of my time, mental health and physical health to stay in that college and this is how they repay my efforts. I don't have passions anymore I am just a useless piece of shit. I hate everything and that makes me incredibly sad because before I had so much hobbies and passions. I gave so much time and energy working for college I'm just fucking empty. I've start taking a lot of medicine again, and smoking to. I never smoked before but I can't help it. I also heavily drink. I am sad ugly and stupid enough to get those fucking exams.

My parents are dicks too, my dad is emotionnally a kid and I always had to act like an adult in our relationship. Tonight we fought for a stupid reason. He always insists on facetiming me and if I don't answer he gets mad, saying i'm an ungrateful bitch. So I answered. I had a shitty day, I am constantly stressed and he would just scream at me for some reason and I complained that I hated our society for valuing \[the reason he screamed at me\] so much, he just screamed some more and hung up on me. Thanks dad. I can't have a bad day, I can't have emotions because he takes things personnally. I fucking hate him.  I would like to say I say that because I am a raging bitch right now but I know I just hate him for treating me like shit for all those years. I hate him for fat shaming me when I was very skinny so I always hated my body, and now that i've struggled with food disorders I am just hateful that I never got to appreciate my body when it was in a good shape. I hate him for treating my mother like shit and making a raging bitch of her too. I lost my mother because of him, I lost my relationship with my little sister and brother because of those arseholes. I am fucking lonely and desperate because of him.

I just had to write it somewhere. Therapy doesn't do anything. Meds either. I can't speak to anyone. I am fucking alone. I just want that to end. I am hating myself because my 11 years old baby brother will have to live his life knowing that his big sister killed herself and I never got to tell him how much I loved being his second mom. I will never be able to apologize to my little sister because I was such a shipwreck of a person with her, when our parents did everything to make us hate each others. I should have known better. I just had to get that out of my system, for if I die, this will be my suicide note.

Many things just got me back up before but now everything is just rotten. I am not even afraid to die anymore, I just want to get this over with.

Sorry for the trashy english and the whole vent thing. It's 4am and I don't know what to do anymore."

I have finished one and I start my second one only to let go today as the place I work at has a slower summer then usual and I got hired at a time where five other people also got hired and I heard that the owners is telling my manager that there are too many people at her store and I do agree as why do you need nine people to the jobs of three to four people. I have worked about 250 hours until now and then I was let go and I have only two classes left to get my degree, my last internship class and the final class that students can take once all other classes are done and finished. I asked my manager if I was bad worker, she told me that I am very good, it is just that high inflation and high gas prices are hurt lots of our clients and they are cutting back spending. I would have to dropp out of college and my last interhsip and then re-enroll and take my internship class and then take my last final class and get my degree.

I don’t know what to feel or do? I am trying to keep my head up high as my former manager told me to use her as a reference and that I was a good worker, but outside forces made bad things happen. I feel that I let down my parents who were happy about my internship. I don’t want to drop out of college when I am so close to get my degree. I just don’t know what to do? I feel like I am lost in the middle ocean with no map and hurricanes are coming closing on me."

I have worked for my company for about 2 years, except for a few months of a brief stint at a different company which I will discuss.

My upper management is notorious for being not employee-friendly, and my work is notoriously challenging due to customers and long hours. However, my direct manager is very friendly and professional. He understands the plight his associates and I have to deal with, gives a lot of feedback, and always tries to accommodate my request. So far, I am happy to have him as my manager.

Also, I enjoy working with my coworkers, and they also enjoy working with me. We respect each other and always try to help each other. Most importantly, there is no crazy work politics at my work. We have no luxury of starting a drama because of the volume of work we have to deal with, and most importantly, we care about each other.

However, I made a final decision that my current work does not fit into my career trajectory and personality. I have performed well at work, but my responsibility is monotonous and stressful. Also, many of my responsibilities are not strongly connected to the skills and knowledge I acquired from internships and school.

As someone who prefers to try something new, I am afraid I will get stuck doing monotonous work, and I want to get other experiences before it is too late. Also, the work began to get more challenging recently because of the stupid mistakes that the upper management made. Many of the issues that make me consider leaving my position have to do with the problems my direct manager cannot help significantly.

On the other hand, I am afraid of getting a new job because of the bad experience I had with the company where I briefly worked. I left my company last year for a different position (different skill sets but less workload) that I considered my dream job. Then, I got laid off after 6 months due to their financial situation combined with poor performance and poor relationships with coworkers. Then, my direct manager opened a spot and rehired me because he felt bad about me getting laid off.

**To make it short**, I am considering leaving my job right now (maybe okay a year or two later) but feel like leaving my company would be unprofessional. I already left the company once and would be wasting the second chance and effort my manager put into me. I also do not wish to lose that phenomenal relationship I built with my coworkers and manager. I doubt I will have such a great team again. However, I am getting tired of my work being monotonous and stressful. I want to try something new, which is related to neither my current nor previous company before it is too late. My work is a lot different from what I want to do and my ultimate career trajectory."

Before a so called Coding contest, I am allowed to train for the challenge on their platform (I am almost certain their Problems are not fully functioning )

Basically this challenge is a 4 hours test that I can’t pause and where I have to solve challenges. I never expected this kind of process to be honest(it’s not amazon but a small company). As I have exams right now and tried to time the application in order to start during my holidays period I will most likely not have enough time to go through all of the Training challenges.

I started  one training . went to the level 3/7 in 2 hours. Challenges get more and more difficult and I will most likely without a training never get all the 7 levels done. Moreover there is no information about the programming language I have to use/the system can execute.

I am a bit lost and don’t know if they are expecting me to pass all 7 challenges. If anyone knows companies with this kind of hiring process can you let me know if they are expecting me to pass all 7 levels ? And maybe if I will get more information the moment I get the “official” challenge ?"

**Essays/LORs/Other:**

*LORS:*

AP US History Teacher (9/10): We had a close relationship. I did in person last year so she got to see me and interact with me in person. Gave me an award at the end of the year.

AP Physics I Teacher (7/10): She liked me and I did well in her class and participated a lot. But we really didn't have too close of a relationship. It was a good rec, but not stellar.

*Essay:*

Common App (9/10): College counselor really liked it. The staff at the college counseling company said it was funny and said a lot about me.

UMich (8/10): Why Us essay was really specific and I did a good job at connecting it back to myself. Bit boring at times.

Georgia Tech (9/10): Did a good job at connecting it back to myself. Did a good job at integrating  GTs mission statement.

Purdue (10/10): Extracurricular essay was unique and showed my interest for CS. Did a good job at squeezing in tons of info in the 100 word essays.

UC PIQ (9/10): Talked about the app I coded to help my community. Talked about my leadership experience in robotics. Talked about my interests in data science and CS.

MIT (7/10): Essays were decent but welcome to my world essay was awful.

USC (5/10): Did these super last minute and it was mostly copy and paste from other essays.

Cornell (10/10): Definitely my best essays in terms of writing quality. Did a really good job at integrating Cornell’s core mission.

Northwestern (9/10): The topic and framing of the essay was definitely the best among my Why Us Essays. 

CMU (8/10): Really proud of my why major essay. Other two were decent but not amazing.

UVA (5/10): Did these super last minute. Mostly copy and paste

UIUC (5/10): Also did these kinda last minute and recycled my GTech and UMich essays

NYU (3/10): Super recycled and started it 2 hours before the deadline.

Penn (8/10): Spent a lot of time on them and I think I did a good job at explaining why Penn was a good fit for me

Brown (6/10): Spent a lot of time on these. But I don’t think the prompts were a good fit for me.

*Interviews:*

MIT (4/10): First interview. Felt more like an interrogation than a conversation. Tripped up multiple times.

Princeton (10/10): Interviewer and I had really good chemistry. He was a  CS professor so we talked about interesting concepts in CS and he told me about Princetons CS department

Penn (7/10): My interviewer and I didn’t have similar interests and didn’t really click that well. But he was super chill and it was a decent convo

Also got informational interviews for Michigan and Cornell

- NJIT (EA)

- Brown (RD)


**Thoughts:** Overall, I’m pretty happy with my results. GTech has been my realistic dream school since freshman year so I’m glad it worked out. For ivies and T20s, I think my downfall was my ECs. They were pretty generic and I didn’t do anything spectacular. I think my ECs were also too CS focused. Don’t be afraid to venture outside of your intended major.

Also, don’t be sad if you get deferred. I was really bummed out about being deferred by Georgia Tech and Michigan but I ended up getting into both RD."

College Math Teacher: 7/10, had a strong personal relationship but I was kind of a goof in her class sometimes, talked with her a lot about my passions and interests

Interviews (as a side note, I did not prepare for any interview. I have always prided myself on my ability to talk to people fluently, prepping ruins that ability)

MIT: 8/10, kind of a strange guy, asked me curveball questions like: tell me about two times you won and lost arguments and what you learned, talked to him about the intrinsic physics behind my sport (shall remain unnamed) and his favorite sport (hockey)

Harvard: 9/10, she ended up loving the store I worked at, cool connection. She also had just finished reading the book I was then reading, talked about the importance of reading in education. She said she would do what she could to get me into Harvard (lol)

Princeton: 9/10, finally got an athlete! Talked about athletics at Princeton, how to connect with others through sports, and the importance of physical activity in tune with mental strength

UPenn: 10/10: said I was one of the greatest communicators she had ever interviewed and that I spoke with intelligence and curiosity, also a Wharton grad and said that I would fit in perfectly and excel at the school

Essays (side note, had an essay counselor. My dad called in a favor from a friend for their services. Also, I have been told by many teachers that I am a great writer)

Personal Statement: 7/10. Had lots of difficulty writing this piece, ended up focusing on a severe fall off a cliff that could have taken my life, learned how to take responsibility for myself and my actions and became a more mature individual. I regret not relating it to my major in all honesty.

UCs: 9/10. Felt able to express myself and my creativity. Best one was on how I express my creativity through mathematics due to my shortcomings artistically.

Yale Supplementals: 6.8/10. Strong, but I feel as if they didn’t show my love for Yale enough. Talked about volunteering and my Investing EC mainly

Brown Supplementals: 8/10. Spent months trying to perfect, also missing a strong passion for Brown particularly. Talked about combining Econ and high level math through ope curriculum

Princeton Supplementals: 9.5/10, current student read and approved each one. Poured a lot into these. That’s all I will say.

MIT Supplementals: 8/10: all strong except had difficulty with the community one. Couldn’t place my finger on a direction I truly wanted to go.

Hey all,

I’ll be graduating this spring with my Bachelor’s in Computer Science and was fortunate enough to recently land a position as a Systems Analyst. I like my job a lot but I don’t want to get complacent and want to start putting in the work to move up. 

I’m very interested in cloud architecture and would love to move into a more cloud-oriented role sometime (preferably not cloud-developer though). I’ve been studying tech for just over a year and a half now so I understand there is a \*lot\* I will need to learn to get there.

Edit: Just want to clarify that I am not looking for a new position immediately. More so just preparing for the future.

I’ve had my resume reviewed by several people at AWS, MS, and cloud consulting firms but I haven’t received much hard advice. Everyone has said my resume looks good and would be impressive for new-grad cloud roles but in the past, I hadn’t been able to land a single internship interview at any big-tech companies. I've been able to land quite a few from retail corporations though so I'm assuming it's not an ATS issue.

I’d really appreciate some advice regarding what I can do now to make sure I at least land an interview in the future.

Do I have lackluster projects (I tried to focus on real-world scenarios where I made an impact)? Should I be pursuing more advanced certifications like the AWS DevOps Pro or RHCSA (maybe even CCNA)? Or is it just actually a complete matter of not having my resume get in the right hands?

Thank you all for your advice!"

Hi, 22(F) new to reddit. I am so tired of pushing myself to be better. I probably have ADHD(inattentive type) and depression for a while now. I can't find good professional help for my mental health.

Each day I wake up and think of breaking this toxic cycle of not feeling good enough, putting in effort to complete the tasks on my to-do list and exercise. But all day I do nothing but stare at my computer screen, scroll insta or sleep for long hours. I am a CS major currently in my pre-final year and somehow managed to grab an internship which pays a lot for a fresher with no experience like me. I have a pile of projects, ideas, tools, and subjects to learn in order to make it in this industry. But I just don't have the energy for such a fast paced working environment or just life in general. I feel like out of the 24 hrs in a day, I feel ok for about 1-2 hrs and can maybe get some work done. All day long I think of all the procrastinated work I have left and it's like my mind is screaming to get the things done but I just can't make myself do it because I lack the motivation or even if I were to start, my mind starts making a list of all the things I have yet to learn and I just can't focus with all the piling anxiety, self doubt and imposter syndrome.

My mind and body feels so tired and the thought of learning something new which will challenge my brain, make me feel dumb, or test my patience is so tiring. I start things but lose interest within a day when things get difficult. I also have a pile of unfinished projects, courses, hobbies. All I want to do these days is hibernate and come out once in a month to socialise. I am a people pleaser and a therapist friend. Giving off mature vibes since I was young, so people feel like I got it all figured out. I came out to my parents about my depression after silently suffering for 4 years and they associated it with my academic pressure and job searching stress. I visited a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with chronic depression and signs of inattention. Gave me such high dose pills that I had panic attacks, insomnia and pain in my chest. I will look for a good psychiatrist when I move out from my parents house and am able to pay for the doc visit. Till then please suggest some coping methods."

I've worked about 5 different jobs in the span of a year from 17-18. They were all temp jobs/warehouse work. I was fired from one due to not having the correct equipment, and I voluntarily left 4 others. I never lasted longer than a month in any one of those jobs.

Recently I've decided to study for college, as staying in my mother's place and idling away is not going to do me any favours, and I was accepted. I'll be studying Information Tech this upcoming September. I'm also in the process of being medicated for my ADHD, which in no doubt contributed to my poor performance in some of those places.

I have quite the work history, and I live in a decently large town. I have a very distinct look so people from previous places that I've worked often recognized me.

I know this sounds irrational but I'm very worried that my past as an unreliable employee will come up when I'm applying for jobs again, specifically internships. I don't have a reliable way of verifying whether I'm blacklisted in all of those places or not, although I wouldn't be surprised if a temp agency refused to hire me again.

Any and all thoughts appreciated, thank you."

I’d like to talk a little bit about my experience, where I’m at, and how much I make. Currently, I make $19 an hour and my official title is IT Support. The thing is, I feel like I do way, WAY more than just support. 

When hired, I had two years of experience professionally with an IT Internship in High School, and about six years of experience personally because I wanted to push myself and learn as much as I can. At my day job, some of my duties and responsibilities are: 

1. Assist computer users in the day to day operations.

2. Install and support hardware, operating systems and software.

3. Hardware, printer maintenance and network troubleshooting support will also be performed.

4. Assist in the various aspects of maintaining the stability and security of the computer network.

5. Automation of processes with different programming methods will be utilized.

6. Assisting end users with learning various applications.

7. Perform add/move, changes on Active Directory domain and phone system.

8. Perform other duties as assigned

Now, number 8 seems to be the kicker. I’ve been doing things that I’m incredibly fortunate for, but I do feel as though at times I’m being underpaid. I’ve written programs for my organization much more than just automating simple tasks, I’ve configured and deployed servers, I’ve built network configurations, I’ve been supporting VMware, I’ve found and stopped security flaws, and much more. The thing is, I don’t have access to Active Directory or the phone system. I have to write guides on how to do things without being able to really deploy things in a test environment, and then when something comes up when someone tries to follow my guides the only thing I can really say is “I don’t know, I’m sorry” because I couldn’t actually do the physical task. I just had to research the hell out of it and slap something together without doing any hands on work whatsoever. 

The things I should have access to I don’t, such as resetting passwords in AD or creating a new user when onboarding. But I’m expected to be able to write these long complex guides in hopes of being able to deploy a new feature or system to our network. 

Now, in terms of experience, I have decent skills and a good understanding of Linux, VMware ESXi, Hyper-V, Microsoft 365, networking concepts, some basic SQL, and there’s some more I can’t think of off the top of my head. I guess I’m just looking for guidance on how I should make the situation work for me in terms of a raise, or what kind of positions I should be looking in to."

vf6vrg,1,2022-06-18,Any advices/jobs in architecture for a foreigner struck with a series of bad luck?,AlaaB,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/vf6vrg/any_advicesjobs_in_architecture_for_a_foreigner/,"PS: this is gonna be somewhat of a long post. TLDR at the end.

Please excuse me as this is my second post ever on Reddit (and a duplicate of the first). I thought this may be the second best place to discuss this subject, mostly giving background information about a person trying to find a career of his passion in architecture and the hard luck.

My brother is of Lebanese origin and he is now 38 years old. He has always been passionate about architecture.

He studied from 2010 to 2016 in Lebanon and got a bachelor's in architecture from Notre Dame University. I remember him spending countless nights without sleeping to finish his projects and succeed in his semester since the semester was very expensive for us.

After graduating, he went job hunting for 1 year. Well... it didn't work out well for him because Lebanon is such a shitty place to start. If you need to find a job in architecture, you need to be affiliated with a political party (because the corrupted political leaders own almost all of the country). Meanwhile, he decided to work in a glass company from 2017 to 2018 where he managed a team by dividing the workload and accompanying the workers on site.

After giving it some thought, he decided to study abroad as his opportunities to find a job afterward would likely be better than staying in Lebanon. He then applied for a scholarship. He was accepted as an ERASMUS student. He studied and got a master's in Urban Management of Rotterdam from the Netherlands from 2019 to 2021. Struck with bad luck again, because of COVID-19, he had a hard time finding a job as most of the offices were closed. Since his visa came to expiry, he had no choice but to leave.

He had a choice between going back to Lebanon or Mali. My 2 other brothers live in Mali and own a company where they construct doors, windows, and barriers made from iron or aluminum. They sometimes go on-site to take measurements or assist the workers to finish the job. He decided to go to Mali since he knew he didn't have much of an opportunity in Lebanon. He has then assisted my brothers in their work by being a manager. He wasn't getting paid since the company wasn't doing well either and he was just there helping my brothers.

However, this was not the job he wished for. He decided to come back to Lebanon since he felt that he would doom his career even further if he stayed within the company.

I, myself, live in France. I have tried to contact multiple companies asking for a job for him, even internships. Most of them don't reply or refuse by saying they are not recruiting. My brother in Canada also doing the same. Nothing is working out.

Since then, he applied for another visa to the Netherlands because they give 1 additional year for foreigners to find a job after they graduate. He is now awaiting their decision on the visa.

I feel like he is depressed about his life. Whenever I discuss this subject with him, he mentions that because of his age, companies are not willing to recruit him since he doesn't have a good background or experience in Architecture. I even suggested that he applies again to study for a master's in architecture in France. But he refused to say that he doesn't have the energy to study anymore.

This is unfortunate for someone who spent most of his years trying to succeed but the companies are not giving him a chance to show what he is capable of. He is a really smart and creative person. He speaks fluently arabic, english, and french.

I think this is all that I had to say and sorry for the long post but I felt like if I didn't give these details, I might be misunderstood.

If you had any advices or a way to find him a job, would you share them with me please?

TL;DR: my brother of Lebanese origins, has multiple diplomas from Lebanon and Rotterdam Universities and is trying to find a job in architecture in a foreign country but cannot after he was struck by a series of bad luck. I am now trying to help him out."

vf7yo2,1,2022-06-18,"With a diverse background, what would be a suitable career path or job role for me?",PixelPlatter,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/vf7yo2/with_a_diverse_background_what_would_be_a/,"Hey everyone, I'm looking for some advice. I have diverse work experience and not sure where to go now.

I  worked in the fast-food industry, worked as maintenance at a sawmill,  was a tire technician for a while, and tree planted in northern Canada  until finally going to film school. I worked in the film industry on the  post side for almost 10 years and thought this was my life career.

However,  the film industry can have brutal hours that are not family-friendly.  When I had my first kid I had a long 3-month push on a film, talking  100-hour weeks where I literally didn't see my kid almost at all, and  when I finished the project she barely recognized me. It hurt and made  me realize I needed to change careers.

It  took me about 7 months to find a new job as a software writer( I had  picked up python scripting during my time in the film industry to help  with pipeline and automation) at a tech company that gave me a chance at  an internship. They were in startup mode about to grow a lot and I  found myself taking on and building their manufacturing WIP tracking  software using a framework called Django.

Fast forward almost 4 years and I have built a number of systems for them and helped tie a lot of things together. For example:

* I took on their 3D printing needs, setup new printers and modelled/printed various jigs and things required for manufacturing
* Shipping  department was using google sheets to track. I built another app using  Django to speed up and automate their processes 10x
* Built  a WIP tracking system from top to bottom for manufacturing that I  deployed using raspberry pis, scanners and Django for both our local  plant and our acquired one overseas.
* The  company grew so fast we needed an ERP system to which I was part of the  implementation team. Only a few months after launch though COVID hit  and my whole team was let go except me. I carried on setting up the ERP  system and now that it is fully up and running I am the system  administrator as well as a consultant for the company.
* Because  of my knowledge of the company's many systems I was also brought on to  project manage various projects a couple of which were global  initiatives.

Present Day:

I  am trusted by everyone, I work from home and really am accountable to  no one as my direct boss (global operations manager) trusts me  completely and no one really understands what I do. Luckily I have  integrity and am not the kind of person that can take advantage of that  and play videos or something during the day and not feel super guilty  about it.

The Problem I have:

All  that said, I feel kind of bored and I also don't know where to go from  here. For example, I've done a lot of coding since working here but I  don't have any proper training, I'm completely self-taught. So I don't  know the lingo and my knowledge has gaps where I may know some things  well and others I may never heard of but probably should know(mostly  guessing about it that). I don't feel like I know/am an expert at  anything in particular but I am very proud of what I have learned and  accomplished.

One thing I do know  is I love problem-solving. I love trying to figure out how to make  someone's workflow much more efficient and make their job a lot easier. I  love learning and discovering new tech. I enjoy working with people and  being part of a team as well. I'm pretty good at understanding the  technical but at the same time am usually good at conveying that to  non-technical people. I realize I like coming up with and building new  systems and tech but I do NOT like maintaining them for long periods of  time. As in I don't like polishing things and making them absolutely  perfect.

I know I wrote a lot and there is a lot more I could write but I tried to pack almost 20 years into this summary.

What  would you recommend to someone like me to look for career-wise? What  career titles are out there that would find someone with my experience  and knowledge valuable?"

Since y'all liked my last post here so much that it became my most upvoted post of all time, here is another one!
However, sorry for the poor formatting, I'm writing this post on my phone.


As before, this happened at my internship.

Me and John, my tutor/boss, had to go on a service call to deliver and install a repaired PC (fried motherboard, another story), two screens and a laptop.

So we get there, in the heat of about 35/38°C and start unloading the company van with all the stuff they ordered.
We bring everything in the room it was supposed to go, and after recommending the user to not fry another motherboard we ask the contact where to put the screens and who to give the laptop to.

This is when we get the first issue. 
The answer to this question is ""oh the new workstation? Yes, that goes on that desk there""
The thing is, they planned to use the Display port daisy chain functionality, even though that laptop doesn't have a DP port, it only has HDMI and a thunderbolt 4 port.

So we setup the two monitors, and we ask them if they have a dock for the laptop, since there is no way that the laptop could support both screens.
The answer, again, is not optimal.

""We were told it would've worked!""

Second, much bigger problem.
Our sales representative, which is also the CEO of the computer shop where I do the internship is not stupid. She knows that a dock was necessary, and she suggested for us to purchase one for them, but they said that they knew it would've worked.

So, since we don't carry 150€+ docks around, they are stuck with only one screen of the two, plus a 75€ upcharge for the next time we will need to go there, since it takes about one hour of travel to go to that business complex.


But wait, when we go back to the store, we obviously ask the CEO/sales rep what happened.
When we told her that ""you told us that it was going to work"" she exploded.

Unfortunately, since that is a really big company here and brings in good money, we can't just cut all services with them.

But you can be sure as hell, they will not blame us once again.


Especially since we let them hear the call log."

Both programs cost around 25k and employer is paying almost full price.

To provide you with some background, my Bachelor is a B.S. in Accounting, but apart from a few internships in  that field, my first role out of college in 2017 was as a IT Oracle Business Analyst in P2P accounting systems implementation. From there I took on different roles In the banking industry and worked on SQL, Unix, ETL, and current focused on Data Governance systems implementation. 

If you are familiar with Data Quality scorecards, I did some technical implementation using an Ab Initio built customized proprietary software, and recently transitioned to more of a management role overseeing technical teams. My role today mainly focuses on business process management, product management, and light data work in Unix/Linux to troubleshoot problems. I’ve also had some experience with ServiceNow/Ticket management but nothing too heavy in the sysadmin side.

Sorry for the long post, but I am really interested in the BU MBA but worried that because I don’t have a technology undergrad, my 5 years experience in tech will count for nothing if I get an MBA. I don’t want to end up in HR or Sales. I wouldn’t mind Marketing or Finance but I have little to no experience there. Ideally I’d like to be in Strategy or Operations but I know how competitive those roles are.

Any thoughts on what the better path would be for me? MS MIS from FSU would complement my experience but MBA from BU seems like a really strong brand for my resume. I would also enjoy the MBA more."

Although I'm grateful to have graduated debt free and with a decent amount of money in savings, I'm also feeling very behind in my career field.

While in undergrad I worked in International Educations Pogramming (ESL, blogging, hosting International students, translation help), studied/interned abroad with a women's rights organization, completed research in the humanities (not super related to my field, but my research was published), had a paid community service fellowship, and graduated with a 3.82 GPA. I also did mutual aid organizing and fundraising.

I studied human rights because I want to work in Refugee and Migrant rights policy (hopefully outside of the US) , and now I'm realizing how many sacrifices I'd have to make to do this kind of work. Specifically, volunteering and then taking on years of unpaid internships or short contract work. I can't move back home, and ideally I would like to stay out of the United States. With this in mind, I've been contemplating going to back school to earn a masters that would make me more employable. Ideally I'd like to use my International relations degree in some way, but likely pivot towards a private industry. I am currently applying for UK University fellowships and Fulbright, and I will be applying to Sciences Po in the fall. I have saved up enough to pay for at least the first year of a masters in the UK or France, if selected for any of the Universities I apply to.

I know that graduating with a masters won't automatically make me more employable, but the Universities I'm applying to would give me great networking opportunities and I feel like it's the only way I can break in. I also don't want all the hard work I put into my degree to go to waste, and if I'm being honest I miss the structure of University.  When I go back for my masters, I want to get a degree which would provide me with good technical skills. I've specifically been thinking about pursuing a masters which would include technology or business. Here's some programs I've been looking into:

Sciences Po, Master in  Digital, New Technology, and Public Policy: [https://www.sciencespo.fr/public/en/content/digital-new-technology-and-public-policy.html](https://www.sciencespo.fr/public/en/content/digital-new-technology-and-public-policy.html)

Master in International Management and Sustainability

[https://www.sciencespo.fr/ecole-management-innovation/en/education/international-management-sustainability.html](https://www.sciencespo.fr/ecole-management-innovation/en/education/international-management-sustainability.html)

Innovation, Public Policy and Public Value MPA

I'd appreciate any advice from former humanities majors who pivoted into tech/business for their masters. Are there any skills I can gain in the year before my studies that would be helpful for me if I'm accepted into these programs? And if so, what is the best way to gain these skillsets. I'll be heading back to France in the fall for a second year of teaching, and I have a lot of free time to learn new skills/take inexpensive online courses.

(Also, if I don't get into my programs of choice- what is the best way to move forward. I don't want to get stuck in teaching long-term) "
vfdi2j,10,2022-06-18,"RANT: I love my job, but I hate everything else",An_Unlucky_Gamer,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/vfdi2j/rant_i_love_my_job_but_i_hate_everything_else/,"I love my work. I'm in customer care. Working there helps me relieve a lot of insecurities about my usefulness, I get to socialize with set limitations and expectations, I learn to set boundaries (as to how far I can go for a customer) and I feel good about myself, I feel like I benefit the community.

Yet I hate everything else. I hate the higher ups. They think of us as disposable bc it isn't a job that one makes a career out of, so it has a high turnover. They are sarcastic and discipline you for the littlest thing, just to set an example. We have a bunch of team leaders, but the majority of them (6/7) don't know the ins and outs of the project we (the newest interns) are in. We frequently get told off (even if a customer is on hold) about not knowing or how they know less than us, as if it's our fault our shifts don't coincide with the one team leader who knows. They tell us off for speaking too loud, but the team leaders are by far the loudest ones. 

I was told off, because I raised my voice a bit while talking to coworkers bc my tone was ""unprofessional"", but in the same breath, the team leader told me ""I would be literally kicked out on the spot if it was another company"" as if that's okay to say and not manipulative at all.

We are asked to stay for a couple more things some nights. I've worked at least a whole shift (I'm part time, 4 hours a day) more just by spending 10 and 20 minutes every day doing ""a few last things"", which ofc won't get paid. 

We were told ""three weeks of paid training and you can start working from home"", but I started on May 10th, and only one of us gets to go home this Monday and she was a worker at the company before us. Their excuse is that we don't perform as well as they want us to.

People have been having issues with their pays too. One person was paid one less day and she was given excuses like ""for a month that has 31 days, you'll get paid for 30"", as if she hadn't worked 12 days (and was paid for 11) and not the full 20 that's expected, cause that was the month she begun. Another was paid 10€ less with no explanation. 

And since we're getting to pay, my job deserves more than minimum wage. All jobs do, but this isn't even a ""low skill level job"" either! I'm supposed to know so many things, how the billing works for the electric bill, how online banking works, how the app (which I have no access to) looks like and works, I'm supposed to be knowledgeable on the newest updates like government funds, I am supposed to know all the processes like how to change electricity provider, stop a house from having electricity, how to add someone as a contact person, person verification, how to explain the 20 different fees on an electricity bill. 

I have 10 minutes break time, it barely is enough to go to the bathroom and drink some water, I can't even eat. I get paid 4.28€/h mixed (3.50-3.80 with all the government cutbacks, depending on your luck with the department that pays you) to get yelled at by customers and team leaders. 

Since I work only 4 hours a day, I have a maximum of 6 days paid leave a year.

I am supposed to do and know so many shit for such little reward, I'd rather go be a cashier if that's the case. At least if I'm a cashier, the worst that can happen is for someone to accidentally overpay or underpay, not misinformation that causes their house to not have electricity.

My time is worth more than 4€ an hour. An hour I'll forever lose deserves more than 4€. 

Part of me is pisses bc I feel like I have almost no choice, I either struggle to make ends meet for each month without a job, or I keep this shitty hellhole of a workplace, bc I'm disabled and can't stand for long hours.

Talking about standing, it's one fucking hour away from my university or my house. I spent 2 hours a day using buses and subways to get to and from there. That's 50% of my time there. I spend 6 hours of my day, each day, for less than 16€. 

TL;DR: I work in customer service. I'm getting underpaid to be abused by my higher ups, I was promised work from home within 3 weeks, but it's been 40 days and still nothing, I spend 2 hours a day to and from my workplace, all while I have 6 paid days off per year. I feel trapped here, because I struggled a lot to find a sedentary job, which is my only choice because of invisible disabilities. I love working in customer care, I just hate being exploited for customer care."
vfdnuq,31,2022-06-18,Resigned today!,Calm-Theory-324,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/vfdnuq/resigned_today/,"[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/vhv9ut/resigned_today_update/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)



I started working at a job pre-pandemic that raised some red flags from the start... but the gig was easy, paid the bills so whatever.  I got furloughed for a couple months during covid, then brought back on. Work was painfully slow and boring, but they were letting us work from home with ""no plans"" to go back to the office. Our ""supervisors"" are all at least 10 years (20 or more with some of us) younger than the entire department and only got their jobs because of their personal relationship with the director.  Came on as interns,  and were immediately promoted to management even if it meant demoting someone. The director starts filling their heads with how much better they are than the rest of us, encourages them to not answer our questions so we can learn how to think, and they both jump in full throttle.

Then the micromanagement started. Ok fine. It's wasting your time,  not mine if you want to approve every step of the process. However, things quickly became beyond frustrating. Send for approval on 2 identical files, one is approved, the other isn't.  Every question is answered with a question. They decide instead of set weekly mtngs, they'll just spring them on us because ""if we're actually there working, it shouldn't matter when they decide to have a meeting.""  They both pretty much stop answering their phones. Take hours to respond to emails. Insist on having a group chat but they both ignore questions or when people were having system issues. If it wasn't affecting them, they all but called the person with an issue a liar. 

The director makes it known that they're her golden gems, nothing they do will get them in trouble and we must respect them because ""they're your superiors.""  They have 3 hour meetings during  the working day (we all know they went to lunch), ""last minute mtngs"" the day before holidays (catered parties with the bosses and owners of the company), marketing events that only selective people knew about and were invited too.  Literally, a hot mess on the daily. They both screw up constantly, costing the company a lot of money, but no one is keeping eyes on them, so it's all swept under the rug. They talk down to and belittle us, some who are old enough to be their parents,  every single day.  Like I work from home and my environment is toxic. I'm pissed when I wake up, pissed all day, pissed when I walk out and shut the door.  Every move I make is micromanaged and if it's not done the way they want, or you miss something, you're yelled at, put on probation. If you try to defend yourself, you're told your just making excuses, threatened to have to go back to the office to work, and that they don't want to hear what you have to say. Keep in mind, these are mid 20 year olds talking to mid-30, 40 year olds with way more life experiences and work experiences in their little finger than these two. 

Sounds fun, right?  By happenstance, I ran into a friend and was offered a new job. Better everything with this one but I have to go into an office so I'm torn... then I missed something on a spreadsheet and processed something wrong. I got ripped a new asshole, and told I was just ""making excuses"" when I tried to defend myself (it was an honest miss - it was on the spreadsheet ONE time under a different name than I was given), and can no longer do anything without approval first. 

So I resigned. They have no idea I was even looking to leave. Sent that shit in after hours so they'll get it first thing Monday. I'm already scheduled off a day next week and my last day will be Friday. I'm taking a week before starting my new job. 

Best part is, I'm one of only 2 people that can do my job and no one else is trained for it. My department is now at a 100% turn around rate with me leaving, and everyone that has left has been in part because of them. We're a small department (8 total, plus the 2 supervisors) and we've gone through over a dozen new employees in 2 years. According to the director, its because no one wants to work and she refuses to acknowledge the common denominators. 

I can't wait for the phone call I know I'm gonna get on Monday...."

I know I shouldn’t be comparing myself to him, but I should get an internship next summer (2023), and I don’t know if I’ll be able to get the experience I need for it, given I’m in school and not majoring in CS (cant switch, major is too competitive to get in to). 

Just looking for some insight on my situation or advice on what I should do to prepare. I do plan on taking the CS curriculum available to nonmajors at my university."

So months passed and tasks from last year were still there as 'uncompleted'.
I want to fix it that. I got an internship for the summer and It'll get busy. (Senior year in september so will need it more than ever).
For my junior year, I just remembered everything in my head and relied on my friends to tell me whens our exams etc.. Had I had not them, id have failed 100%.

I have a few questions:

1. Is it just me, or are there hardly any IT internships available right now?
2. Why do so many internships seem to require such advanced qualifications? It seems like the classes for my degree haven't prepared me *at all* for most of the internships I'm seeing.
3. How do you find internships? I've been using LinkedIn, Indeed, and Handshake and as I said I haven't been finding very many.
4. If there truly is a shortage of internships right now, should I postpone getting an internship and just continue my studies in the fall?

Thanks for your advice, everyone!"

I'm 20 and my GPA is 3.7

Recently I've been thinking a lot about my future and what I wanna do after I graduate. My plan since I was in HS was to get my Physics degree and get into a PhD program afterwards, and keep doing physics. However, I've been reading and hearing that after you get your PhD you're more than likely to start at $70k per year, and to me that's not worth it. The way I see it is that getting a PhD in Physics is very hard and after you get it that's what you will be making? Not thank you. 

Now, the reason I didn't choose aerospace engineering since the beginning was mainly because I really love Physics, but also the aerospace program was not available at my university until Fall 2021.

I think Aerospace Engineering is very interesting and fun, and you also need to know a lot of physics, but the reason I'm unsure to do it is, if everything goes well then I'll be graduating on December of 2023, but if I change my major that might extend it till 2024 or even 2025...

Also, I need to note that I've been doing research at my university, as well that I'm part of a very good internship of nuclear physics at this moment and I'm learning how to code and particle physics. I really like it, I'm working at the lab doing some ""engineering"" stuff and I really like it. 

Maybe I can just finish my major in Physics and then get into a PhD program for aerospace engineering, but I also know that they made you take some undergrad classes to get caught up. 

What do you guys think I should do? 

Thank you for reading."

i can’t see myself ever getting the motivation i need to get a fucking job so i can fucking die. why does it have to be so hard. why do i have to care so much about my family. i wish i could just do it right now.

Interning at a big defense company in an ASIC/FPGA team doing RF. I am enjoying it a lot and got assigned to help R&amp;D something new, which is exciting. Plenty of projects that I've helped on within my first month. However, I'm very interested in semiconductors, comp arch, RTL, and the verification side of things. I really want to intern next summer at big tech like AMD/Intel/ARM/Qualcomm/Xilinx or even a FAANG doing RTL or verification.

Does anyone have insight on what they could expect interviews/expectations for an **intern** would be at those types of places?

Though it's still early in the summer, I want to apply in August and expect to interview in the fall. As of now, I'm polishing my fundamentals in digital design (comb/seq circs, timing, boolean and k-maps, FSM's) and plan to move onto comp architecture fundamentals later. I have confidence that I can get at least a call back with the experience I will have by then.

I have to admit, my analog skills are weak. I still have trouble with nodal/mesh... basic questions I fumble that should be elementary. This is also going to be one of my focuses.

Thanks!"

vfkdyf,1,2022-06-18,Boston University MBA vs Florida State University Ms MIS,amrua,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/vfkdyf/boston_university_mba_vs_florida_state_university/,"I got accepted to both BU Online MBA and Florida State Online Masters in MIS. Both programs cost around 25k and employer is paying almost full price.

To provide you with some background, my Bachelor is a B.S. in Accounting, but apart from a few internships in  that field, my first role out of college in 2017 was as a IT Oracle Business Analyst in P2P accounting systems implementation. From there I took on different roles In the banking industry and worked on SQL, Unix, ETL, and current focused on Data Governance systems implementation. 

If you are familiar with Data Quality scorecards, I did some technical implementation using an Ab Initio built customized proprietary software, and recently transitioned to more of a management role overseeing technical teams. My role today mainly focuses on business process management, product management, and light data work in Unix/Linux to troubleshoot problems. I’ve also had some experience with ServiceNow/Ticket management but nothing too heavy in the sysadmin side.

Sorry for the long post, but I am really interested in the BU MBA but worried that because I don’t have a technology undergrad, my 5 years experience in tech will count for nothing if I get an MBA. I don’t want to end up in HR or Sales. I wouldn’t mind Marketing or Finance but I have little to no experience there. Ideally I’d like to be in Operations or Strategy but I know how competitive those roles are.

Any thoughts on what the better path would be for me? MS MIS from FSU would complement my experience but MBA from BU seems like a really strong brand for my resume. I would also enjoy the MBA more."

If you know me, shh! I'm gonna keep my ec's and stuff vague though!

**Demographics**

* Gender: Female
* Race/Ethnicity: Chinese American
* Residence: Bay Area, Cali
* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): None

**Intended Major(s)**: Computer Science (but for some schools like ivies + stanny, i applied for STS)

**Academics**

* GPA/Rank (or percentile): 4.00 UW, 4.8x W, no ranking
   * I got the top 9% for california students or smth like that, guaranteed a UC (I think?)
* \# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: 14 AP's, all 4's and 5's (I got a 4 on AP Calc BC)
* Senior Year Course Load: Many AP's, increasing difficulty throughout 4 years

**Standardized Testing**

*List the highest scores earned and all scores that were reported.*

* SAT/ACT: no SAT/ 36 ACT on all subjects + full score writing
* SAT II: none
* AP/IB: again, 14 AP's w/ 4's and 5's (I think I had a good amount of 4's too)
* Other (ex. IELTS, TOEFL, etc.): none

**Extracurriculars/Activities:** 

* I wrote a book on AI and independently published it, I got top 20 new works for my category
* Published AI paper on student journal &amp; research w/ machine learning professional
* Founded virtual volunteering organizations
* Co-founder of regional winning robotics team
* Internship at virtual tutoring company under marketing (I helped w/ website and wrote blogs)
* 1/3 Editor-in-Chief's of school journalism club
* a lot of volunteering stuff
* Radio Interview + presentations (about being an author)
* I also put that I was a member from 9-10th grade of my school's AI club.. no leadership haha

**Awards/Honors:** 

* AP Awards: I got all the AP distinctions possible
* Gold President's Volunteering Service Award
* In late April of this year, I got a highly selective national recognition based on my stats (won't be naming... if you know, shh!)

**Essays/LORs/Interviews:** 

* Essays were okay, I thought my best were my Personal Statement and Stanford Roommate essay
* LORs: 6-7/10 at best? The professors knew me, but I don't think I was a favorite. The teacher I wanted to write a LOR for me quit
* Interviews: 
   * Reed: 8/10, the interviewer liked me I think, but didn't really let me talk about my accomplishments
   * MIT: 9/10, we talked for the whole 90 min and he was really curious about the fact I liked writing and rhetoric, but I think he knew I didn't have a lot of technical knowledge (like competitions, etc.)... he did say I would make a good fit for MIT's STS program though.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

* *Acceptances:* (list here):
   * UC Irvine (target), still one of my favorite schools, and was my initial commitment! 
   * Reed (target) :)
   * RPI, RIT, SCU (safeties)
* *Waitlists:* (list here):
   * UC Berkeley EECS (reach)
   * CMU SCS (reach, priority wl) --&gt; accepted --&gt; enrolled!! &lt;3
   * GA Tech (reach)
   * UC Davis (safety)
   * UC San Diego (target)
* *Rejections:* (list here):
   * HYSM (reaches)
      * I REA'd Stanford (dw, I was over it in about a day :))
   * Pomona (reach)
   * Brown (reach)
   * UCLA (reach)

**Additional Information:** I should've done more research with competitive targets rather than focusing too much on the wildcard reaches. Accordingly, I also applied to schools just for what I heard about them and their prestige (Harvard, Yale, Brown, Pomona) even though they might not be top of the top for CS, and I might not even like the schools themselves. I also wish I did more research into the schools I was applying to. My top choices (Stanford, Yale, and UCLA), were only based on impressions. Of course, I don't regret anything, but if I were to do the college process all over again, I would have focused on schools more known for CS like UIUC, Purdue, and others. 

I think my application stands out among other CS majors because I don't actually have any strong competitions or technical awards. It just goes to show that you don't *need* anything to make it into a top school. Of course, having them is a plus, but it's not always a determining factor. Also breaking the CMU SCS stereotype of this regard, esp with my application heavily weighted with humanities-related ec's and essay themes.

All in all, I ended up at what I didn't know was my dream college. Small student to teacher ratio, supportive CS students + faculty, top for CS, etc. I love where I ended up, and even if I was rejected and ended up going to UCI, I would still be happy. I chose CMU in the end for the reason of having stronger academics and being a smaller school. 

If you have any questions, I would be happy to answer them! Again, sorry I am very vague with my ec's , and go Tartans! Also Scotty our doggy mascot is one of the cutest mascots out there, change my mind :)"

Our one summer intern just got sacked for stealing coffee pods. It was about 2/3rds of a 96 count case.

I got a ticket that ""my  doctor says I need to stop using a laptop, I need to switch to a PC and get a second one setup by IT at my home.

&amp;#x200B;

I ask for clarification, in a HR approved copy/paste format.

&amp;#x200B;

""In order to best accomidate your disabilites we need to know what exactly the issue is so we can properly accomidate it"".

&amp;#x200B;

""My doctor says it's causing discoloration on my legs and I need to stop using it""

&amp;#x200B;

\*Insert pictures of overweight hairy leg I can't unsee\*

\*insert note from a real dermatoligist\*

Attached link

[https://www.healthline.com/health/toasted-skin-syndrome#causes](https://www.healthline.com/health/toasted-skin-syndrome#causes)

&amp;#x200B;

He's claiming that he must stop using his laptop and needs to be issued a PC for use at home, for IT to come to his house and set it up, so he can work from home without exaserbating his issue.

&amp;#x200B;

My first response is to run to the bathroom. My right leg has the text book example of  ""toasted Skin syndrome"" I've known about it for a while but my doctor did a test on it and it came back negative for cancer.  He wasn't sure what was causing the discoloration. It sure as heck wasn't exposure to the sun. Being on a part of the thigh that hasn't seen the sun since early 90s when shorts were significantly shorter for men and young boys. It's also only on one leg.

&amp;#x200B;

I come back to the IT batcave and come up with a solution.

&amp;#x200B;

* ***Prolonged use of a laptop on the thighs.*** *This is usually evident on the left thigh since most laptop batteries and vents are located on the left side of the device. With the recent increase in remote work, it’s likely that this will become more common.*

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, it appears as if the solution to your problem is available in the web MD article you sent, It appears as if we could easily accomidate your disability by simply having you put your work computer on a hard service, such as *a table*.

&amp;#x200B;

An added bonus is that this improves air circulation and may improve the lifespan of your device.

&amp;#x200B;

The good news is that I now know what this discoloration on my leg is, the bad news is that i'm second guessing my doctor.

&amp;#x200B;

Also i spent too much time with a laptop in my lap."

I soon realized the only way is for me to get rich and to take her far away from everything. I enrolled in all of the STEM classes, started the Engineering and Robotics Club, won 1st in multiple statewide engineering competitions, won 2nd in the state and 7th out of 100 of the best teams in the nation. All while I worked a fast food job, was junior class representative for a coalition for positive youth development in the county, and was selected to take part in a program for a few students to take a college class with a professor who would come to the school after school and teach us the same thing he taught the other students. I graduated 11th grade with multiple STEM honors, national awards and accolades, an A in college sociology, some recognition for youth development, work experience, and finally a passion for creation and web development.

I moved to the city and found an internship my Senior year at a pretty notable E-Commerce company building websites for companies such as Heineken, Sanrio aka Hello Kitty, Urban Outfitters and so many more. I learned so much and graduated to a full-time position.  I felt I earned it. I started making 45k a year and moved out of my moms at 17(2018). Then got promoted after an acquisition. Was able to move my grandma in (2019) and she stopped doing drugs...she just wanted some love you know. My family been gave up on her in the 90s. I had a girlfriend I loved and life was great. She got pregnant I felt like i was doing well and was self sufficient for a while. Plus I put in all this work over the years i'm so responsible and i'm in a career not fast-food or something that's not a career.

Then Co-vid hit and I was furloughed due to budget cuts, lost my apartment due to furlough, had to put my granny in a senior place where she went back on drugs, I got shot in a bad neighborhood after defending my family from drug dealers, and then had a baby all in 3 months.  My girlfriend complained about me not being there in her final months while I recovered she was going through postpartum without much help from me. I just wasn't visiting her enough. I got gofunded $8,000 from my job and was able to help move my mom from the neighborhood I got shot in and get the things I lost from my apartment like clothes and baby stuff for some months. My job tried to hire me back (late 2020) but with the baby trying to WFH while my GF finished HS, PTSD leading us to move around every few months with fear i'd be found and finished, and straight up lack of communication it barely lasted.

I got let go again Early 2021. I tried to freelance for a while and barely made anything. Started doing small contracts and was able to use unemployment to get another apartment. Then we constantly argued because all I did was ""stay in the room all day on the computer"". ""You don't even have a job how are you on your computer all day"" . I was so miserable unemployment was running out and so was she taking care of a child and doing HS from her computer while others were able to go in. I barely have any pictures with my daughter from this time all i was worried about was trying to network, find a job, contract, gig or something we couldn't move back with our parents. They told us not to have a kid and we weren't ready. She left me after a fight and went to my moms with the baby. I had to leave by the end of the month. I started thinking about everything and went crazy everything was connect the numbers, the colors, the license plates. I started walking to Canada to become a professional snowboarder and ended up in the hospital after walking 40 miles across the the state sleeping outside multiple days just to make it.

I was there from January to March. Then I got out feeling so disconnected from everything and everyone. My family heard about how I didn't pay attention to my family and started ""going crazy"" from my girlfriend. My own mother seemed like she couldn't recognize me. Everyone said I wasn't the same anymore.  Now we're with my in-laws living rent free and i'm bouncing from small contract to small contract. Borrowing money from my mom between checks and barely able to take care of my kid. I just found out my girlfriend had sex with some guy while I was in the hospital because she ""thought we broke up"". My mother-in-law keeps telling me about grocery store jobs and how I can work for her since she's a manager at a retail store. My girlfriend asked me the other day if I feel like I'll ever be myself again or if my career in development will ever be the same. I honestly don't know and it hurts because this is all I know , I love it and I've been giving it all I got. I know all it takes is one company to give me a shot and life isn't all about money but it really feels shitty when you go from the bread winner, the one everyone's proud of and looking up to ...to the one asking for ""$20 until I get paid"" or for if someone has a ""spare cigarette"". Not sure where you're life is headed and no say in anything because you're basically being cared for by your girlfriends parents at 21!

I just feel sick and want to break something and cry. I just stole a box of diapers and wipes a few days ago. I never though i'd say it but I feel like a bum or someone who never accomplished anything in life."

I usually ask my mentor a lot of questions, but I try to avoid asking questions right away for the sake of developing my problem solving skills (which I feel are also lacking), which is why I feel it takes so long for me sometimes to figure stuff out. Thankfully, my mentor is very nice and helps me out in any way he can.

When I asked her about repaying the money, she said that it was her money originally since I’d earned it working for her therefore I’m not entitled to anything back. This led to her saying that I should be greatful she even allows me to live in my childhood home still and told me that she would be firing me from the family business and kicking me out of the house and cutting me off even further financially.

He offered us an internship at his place for 6 months. It was good until I inquired more about it. There will be 2 of them. And we can choose. Either do an unpaid internship from 12-6 for 6 months or have a paid internship with timings from 9-6 or even more depending on the work. The starting salary would be 10k or 15k.

It sounds good but i also have to attend college so doing both will not be possible.

Now, I’ve reached out to some people in my personal network and have been interviewing with some companies. Likely to get an offer from one, but all the companies I’ve been referred to are either startups, or startups that were just acquired by a larger company. The positions have the work I am interested in and want to do (Frontend / fullstack) and almost equal base salary as my old offer, but the products and software they create and work on are not compelling to me and honestly don’t really… interest me I guess?

This sub seems to think the new grad roles are increasingly getting difficult to get so I’m wondering if I should just take what I can get now, as apposed to waiting.

My question is: would it be better to take a job opportunity as soon as I can, even if I don’t feel interested in the company’s work/product but get close to equal compensation, or wait until August when the next round of new grad offers open up and just grind leetcode and such until I can apply to other places that will have new grad offers open?

I know that for a real job, it would be laughable to talk about Rosalind problems, but I am just a community college student with no real experience and the internship just wants to know that I know how to code. I actually wrote article-style explanations of 10 different problems, I even made my own animated demos to explain the algorithms and am really proud of them. I uploaded to GitHub, but then I realized that the honor code for both Rosalind and Coursera says we are not allowed to post solutions so I made my repo private. But since I have no real experience this is all I have to show and I don’t know how it is possible. It seems cringe worthy to just email a folder with my files…. The internship gives us the options to share a GitHub handle or link to a blog. I was thinking that maybe I could start a medium blog and post my explanations there, without the code, and hopefully that wouldn’t break honor code even though they are basically walk throughs with examples on small datasets. It would look really bad on me for them to see me breaking an honor code but as a beginner I am not experienced enough to be doing original creative projects, at this point I don’t have enough time to do one anyways and still be able to apply.

However, I recently got accepted for a paid internship at a large tech company  with a decent role which I’m not sure if it’ll be better than COSMOS in terms of uniqueness on application (the internship was achieved through winning a contest then interview). Doing this would also give me more time to do research with a professor and save my parents thousands of dollars, but it would be less fun.

In terms of college applications, I was wondering which would be the better choice for this summer. I’ve also had the thought that after the internship this summer, I could always reapply to COSMOS and other prestigious summer programs next summer.

I'm majoring in engineering and graduating next april, and the difference is basically between two different fields within my engineering major. I can do both, but the products coming out of the two fields are vastly different and the work would be different. I may have a pretty decent guaranteed job coming in on the higher pay side after my internship ends this summer, but to be honest I don't find myself being super interested in this field. I want to work more in the other field which I also have some experience in, but I don't have any sort of concrete chance of landing a job in that field after graduation like I may have with the higher paying field, and the annual salary likely won't be as good based on what I've heard. Think of a difference between like maybe 85k and 75k a year (rough estimate)

Do I take the chance and go after the job that I'm much more interested in, feel more dedicated to, and feel like I would align better with? Or do I just take the more concretely guaranteed job if it gets offered to me with the work that I don't necessarily care as much about or don't feel nearly as interested in? My parents told me it would be ""stupid"" and a very ""entitled young kid"" thing to do to turn down the job offer which would likely pay more but I don't necessarily have as much interest in, and that work is work and nobody necessarily likes working, but they do it anyway to pay the bills. This is all hypothetical, as nothing has been offered or directly told to me yet, but the higher paying job option has very very very heavily hinted that I will be given a full time offer after my internship ends this summer and before I graduate."

I graduate in December and my current boss told me that I could apply to their 2022 roles instead of their 2023 roles because I already have a degree in IT which satisfies the ""or similar"" requirement for most positions. I was wondering if the same would apply at other companies because I have my eye on a few companies and want to apply, but am worried they will say no because I haven't finished my CS degree yet.

Thanks in advance!"
vg841e,1,2022-06-19,"My friend wants to be an animator and show runner but seems to lack the skill and growth based mindset to get there. I, an animation major, wanna help my friend but I don't wanna provide unsolicited criticism. However I'm constantly worried about them and I don't want them to go down the wrong path.",Asleep-Sandwich4447,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/vg841e/my_friend_wants_to_be_an_animator_and_show_runner/,"Disclaimer: First off, I think this issue applies to most careers, especially creative ones. I think I can see people having similar problems in pursuits such as athletics or academia. Both my friend and I are also disabled with mental health issues which poses an extra hurtle. To be specific we each are diagnosed autistic which can make it harder to change our routines. My friend also has financial issues and lives with their overworked parents under social security. While I'm the son of a professional artist and was born into a well to do middle class background, my friend may have never had access to the same tools and opportunities I could afford. They also only recently got serious a couple years ago but they still have a long way to go and have been drawing on and off since they were a little child.

....

Anyway, so my friend (sophomore) and I (senior) are each studying for an undergrad diploma in Fine Arts and Animation. The way this works at my college is that after spending freshman year building up a portfolio and the necessary credits, you then apply to the three year animation program over the summer. I've already gotten in two years ago but my friend has not. They failed getting in the first time for reasons I will explain, but still can try again this mid July. However I'm afraid they lack the skills and resourcefulness necessary to be admitted, and might be doomed to always fail if they don't change their approach.

As far as their skills are concerned, they seem to lag far behind most people in the art program. They hardly ever experiment with new techniques and primarily draw flat colored anime characters/furries on a white background in the program Pixlr. While I don't have a problem with these said subjects, I think it becomes a problem once you avoid drawing other things. For those who don't know, Pixlr is not the art program I would recommend due to its limitations, and there are far better programs that you can also get for free. However, they seem allergic to Googling tutorials and researching how to use certain tools. Their anatomy skills are also very lacking and characters often have backwards hands or misshapen heads, they use absolutely no shading in these drawings, and they even seem to have a lack for basic design principles despite having passed a foundations course on that subject. For instance, in their comics and character designs you might see low res neon red text on a navy blue background overlapping the character it's describing. Also, when I showed their portfolio to my pro artist mom, she agreed that my friend at least needed one more year studying the foundations, except they don't seem to want to.

After my friend submitted their portfolio they got a quick response back from the art department stating they'd failed to put it in the right format. They then went to others to ask for help, except they never once read the instructions. As someone who wasn't keeping an eye out for the current instructions document since I was finishing up my last projects in the very same program they applied to, I gave them the wrong advice based on outdated knowledge I had from when I applied. I still regret this mistake seeing how I told them they didn't have enough credits to apply yet and they took my word for it and then missed the first application window. They then were corrected by another student in my program about a second window which didn't exist at the time I applied, and that the credit I had taken and said they lacked wasn't necessary until their senior year. They then shared their portfolio which was still in the wrong format. I basically had to nag them into reading the instructions for over an hour, which while I understand how hard it can be focusing on instructions as an autistic person, this is pretty critical stuff and I'm not sure why they weren't more concerned about it. I'm still not sure they have it in the right format at this point either.

While I'm autistic as well, I've been fortunate in the sense that I knew I wanted to be an animator since elementary school. During my freshman year of highschool I may have had a similar issue where I knew what I had to do, but with college seeming so far out I was hesitant to study the fundamentals until my Mom nagged me enough. I honestly don't think I can thank her enough for that. I also repeatedly pushed myself out of my creative comfort zone, realizing what skills I lacked  and deciding how to go about earning them, which admittedly is not something many autistic people are willing to put themselves through due to the amount of burnout that can come with it. However, I've known I have to push myself to do things that are boring to get somewhere exciting and fulfilling for most of my life. I think my friend is still holding out hope that there's an easy way to get to where they want, but there really isn't, especially considering their situation. I've suggested they get a job but they seem reluctant and want to stick to their routine of developing their potential animated franchise and playing Roblox while hardly ever leaving the house. They say they're not sure they'd enjoy it, even though the point is more to make money and improve their situation at least partially. They also hoped to get hired by Vivzipop after college and have her studio produce their dark fantasy anime project without prior industry experience. Fortunately I'm taking them to an industry convention with me this fall while I apply for internships so hopefully they get a better grasp of how the animation industry works. I've also asked if they wanted to sketch from observation with me, but they said they're used to digital; and when their laptop screen broke they opted to not draw at all. Despite all of this I've mostly stayed quiet about it since I don't want to give unsolicited advice.

Unfortunately, If they can't keep their scholarships due to their poor grades and continue failing to get in year after year they could rack up tons of debt that they're in no healthy position to repay. I'm very concerned about them but I'm not sure how they'd take any of this. I'm debating whether or not I should feel like a crappy friend for feeling this way and not telling them, or if I really should wait to see how they figure things out on their own."

Team asked us to be in office next week. I’m a little confused on the dress code expectations because we have been told opposite things by different people. For example, Human Resources told us to “business professional” because clients will be coming in and out of the office all day, so very formal dress is required. But others have said to dress business casual, as in basically casual- jeans and sneakers. For my office, some of the interns that already went in said everyone was wearing vans, t shirts, and jeans. I’m so lost. I don’t want people to laugh at me if I dress up and everyone is casual and I don’t want the inverse of that either. So confused/a little frustrated on lack of consistency in direction.

I then remembered that she said to get in contact with her after I graduate and she would invite me to come back. I have had an interest in Marketing since this internship but unfortunately, I couldn't major in it as an undergrad. I stalked her LinkedIn and saw that she now carries a director role.
I want to message her and see if she can help me out with finding an opportunity in the company again, but I am not sure how to message her. Should I do an elevator pitch about my interests and ask if she knows of any openings or should I message her asking how she is doing? I want to be respectful and not rude or entitled.
If anyone can help me find the right words I'd greatly appreciate it!!"

He offered us an internship at his place for 6 months. It was good until I inquired more about it. There will be 2 of them. And we can choose. Either do an unpaid internship from 12-6 for 6 months or have a paid internship with timings from 9-6 or even more depending on the work. The starting salary would be 10k or 15k.

It sounds good but i also have to attend college so doing both will not be possible.

So do internships usually have this kind of timing or is it a red flag and i should not go ahead?

To me, it seems like I should be at least at a somewhat intermediate level in programming as a whole... but every single project I've worked on was absolutely winged on the spot without much thought put into designing them.

I don't know anything about designing an algorithm. I have no clue about time complexity, how to use big-O notation in practice. I don't know basic algorithms apart from bubble sort. I don't know what binary trees and graphs are. I know nothing about paradigms other than OOP and the names of some other paradigms. I don't know any design patterns and when and how I should implement them. I know all the abstract shit languages like Java provide (things like interfaces, genericity, abstract classes...), yet I have no idea how to use them.

Other than the fact it’s a well known company, I know absolutely nothing else about it and can’t seem to find much online. Is it a prestigious place to work at and would it help me hopefully secure good jobs after uni? It would be great if you could provide comparisons as to what tier it is in relative to MANGA, Uber, etc.

If it isn’t a ‘good’ company to work at, I have a couple other opportunities I could try instead, so any advice would be very helpful.

(P.s. By ‘good’, I mean in terms of prestige and reputation within the industry. I don’t really care about work-life balance or salaries too much as it would only be an 8 week long internship)."

Should I just send my resume and hope for the best? Should I explain my situation in an email, and that I'm willing to work for less?

Every company is short staffed but doesn't want to actually hire people for what they will be willing to work for.  This is in almost every job I see, although lower wage jobs seem to be pushing up gradually (like the unionized Starbucks), office jobs have been in stasis for 5 years at this point, and these are the jobs people are looking at to pay off their 5 figure student debt.

I'm trying to leave my company because they're so short staffed but keep playing with ""hiring interns"" and ""internal promotions"" so that everyone's wages get driven down.  It doesn't work, so they just end up not hiring everyone and allowing the quality of the business to fall further and further.  The whole company is short staffed, from the work shop to the office.  Our partners are short staffed, the truckers and steel people, our IT company.

I'm trying to get out because, logically, I am in high demand, if I leave my company they will literally have an entire department of their company not functioning until they hire a replacement.  This is a position which acts as a hinge for a large workshop and several designers.

But I'm leaving because they can't afford me after all the inflation increases, and keep putting me off and telling me to wait.  So I'm leaving, and they'll go under, but it's hard to leave because everyone is hiring but every company just wants to keep playing chicken, hopeful that people will eventually get desperate enough that they'll get their 30000/year Omni workers doing everything from flipping burgers to designing your sewer systems and cleaning them out.

Hey everyone, I'm new here, so apologies if my question is broad or a bit obvious. I'm a biotechnology graduate doing an internship for the summer. I have some limited experience in bioinformatics, but I've spent the last month learning QIIME, reading papers and getting a sense of 16s rRNA analysis.

I am looking to create a library of 10 pathogenic bacteria. the aim is to identify with accuracy if the 16S rRNA sample is one of these 10 or not.

I was thinking the best way to do this would be to get 100 sequences of each of the species of interest (E. coli, Klebsiella) from SILVA and run an MSA. I've done this with Seaview. From this MSA I would like to create a representative 16s rRNA sequence for each species (think of it as an average of all of them). From the 100 seqs MSA, I was hoping to be able to identify conserved/variable regions for each species, that I can use to accurately identify if the sample contains one of the 10 bacterial species or not.

I was wondering how best I can go about this. I found this 2012 paper entitled ""Fast discovery and visualization of conserved regions in DNA sequences using quasi-alignment Nagar et al ""Here, they use some R packages, including ""Quasi Align"". Following the links provided, it shows that these tools were last updated in 2015 and are no longer supported by R.I then tried to look up more recent papers, but nothing of interest popped up.

What I've done today is use the alignment tool from MEGA11. Here I aligned 10 sequences of a species e.g E.coli, then I recorded by hand, the areas of variability, with the self-determined pre-requisites, that there are more than 3/10 of the aligned sequences having different bases at that position. I did the same thing with another species as well. I then put 2 species together and aligned them, I took down by hand, the bases that were found ubiquitously in E.coli but not E. faecium for example. As you can imagine, this took a long time, is there a better way to do this?

In conclusion: I want to identify 16s rRNA conserved and variable regions of 10 different pathogenic bacteria, so I can accurately identify if they are in a sequenced sample or not.

I was wondering if you would be so kind as to share your knowledge and give some constructive criticism on shown best to go about this.

Thanks a lot - Rob :)"

vgpl3p,0,2022-06-20,Stuck between 3 opportunities,JersieYT,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/vgpl3p/stuck_between_3_opportunities/,"Hello everyone! I just recently graduated HS (17F) and also recently had my main post-secondary plan derailed. (That's a story for another time) I've always had a mild interest in computers/IT support but I was pretty set on my first plan, so frankly, I am unprepared. I'm probably the most technologically fluent in my family, but I'd still consider myself a noob. I've only solved my own tech issues through googling and sheer willpower, but I haven't even built my own PC yet. 

I'm kind of on a time limit for deadlines and I doubt I can take a gap year, so I've dug up 3 potential routes I can take if I want to do IT, but I'm not sure which one I should take. I've always been more interested in the troubleshooting/fixing aspect of IT, and not so much coding. (Took AP Computer Science in HS, it was ok) so I'd probably be content with a helpdesk job. If I could eventually make 30k-40k a year, I'd be content.   
Here are my options: 

1. **Go to a local community college and get an Associate's Degree.** This one is probably the most convenient for me location-wise as it is 15 min away from my house and literally across the street from my job. The degree I've been looking at is, ""Networking Systems and Technology, Associate in Applied Science"" but I'm not sure exactly what the classes/career paths entail. I'm fortunate to have the ""Star Scholarship"" in Chicago and could basically get this degree for free, but I have signup ASAP as it won't be applicable once the fall semester passes.
2. **Yearup Training + Internship.** Also a free program, I have a friend already in who could refer me. It is downtown but the commute would probably just be 20 mins by train. They have a program specifically geared toward Helpdesk support. The program lasts one year, 6 months studying/6 months internship, with even a little weekly stipend (better than nothing!) I've heard it was rigorous, which means I might have to quit my job/significantly reduce my hours. But  I don't mind focusing all on my studies since I live with my parents.
3. **Independent Study/Working Towards Certs.** I've self-learned some skills to a respectable level (Art, photoshop, video editing, Japanese) but I haven't gotten professionally far in any of them since I focused most of my effort on school/work. So I was also thinking of maybe doing online programs (Like the Google IT Cert program) at my own pace while also working as an option too. Since this would be my main education in place of college, I could fully dedicate myself to it. 

Thanks so much! Any advice or feedback is appreciated."

I’m so terrified for my future I’m gonna die alone and friendless. I’m probably gonna have to take my own life. These worries prevent me from even doing work on my internships how can I stop it. 

Any tips? My head hurts. I’ve started hitting myself too. I just can’t believe I ruined my 20s it’s just crazy."

vgs8oi,24,2022-06-20,Use the summer to plan your escape route!!,cevanii,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/vgs8oi/use_the_summer_to_plan_your_escape_route/,"I promise, this rant will turn into advice at the end.

I (F19) have your typical South Asian parents. I live in Sweden and I'm legally Swedish and just don't relate to Indian culture as much as they would like. Very typical problem between first gen immigrants. But, I have always argued and 'rebelled' for the things I want and believe in. And do you know what those things are? Being able to wear ripped jeans, crop tops, not wearing a bindi everyday, makeup, growing out my nails and not having my hair in a braid all the fkn time. Before moving out for uni, this was just part of life for me--the constant arguing and vying for what I want. But once I tasted true freedom, I just *cannot* tolerate being back in that atmosphere.

Now that I'm over 18, they don't limit where I go to hangout with friends as much but, I still can't go to sleepovers and I can't go on long vacations with friends. I thought this would have changed now that I lived an entire year alone. So I made the mistake of asking them if I could go on a sleepover. There was a huge argument albeit, it was a mature one without shouting and yelling which is usually the norm so at least that was nice. They kept giving me the 'it's not in our culture' argument which I refused to accept. In the end, my mom straight on says 'I'm scared if you go, the males of the household could take advantage of you'. What the hell can I say to that?? I know that's their reason but once my mom says something like that out loud, I can't argue back. I've been on my first sleepover a year ago at 18. Can you believe that? Most people experience something like that at 8 or 9. I have missed out on having a colourful, fun childhood. I most certainly don't want to miss out on having a fun twenties. Why are they so damn overprotective? With their logic, something bad could happen to me every time I step out of the house. Creepy men are everywhere. If I lived life of that constant fear, I wouldn't *have* a life.

And their behaviour is affecting me even when I live alone. I started dating at 18 because I couldn't date in peace before (I can't ever date, they want me to get an arranged marriage). I had my first kiss at 18 and my first drink, my first experience of going clubbing etc. It was SO MUCH FUN! But, every time I'm with a guy, I can't help but think it's a ticking time bomb so I end it before it can get anywhere. My parents will find out, and I can kiss goodbye to freedom or whoever I'm dating won't be able to understand if I can't go on a week long vacation to Greece because of my parents or even a damn sleepover. Obviously, I'll be fine when I'm in uni but what do I do during the summer? Most people visit their bf/gf over the summer but I won't be able to do that.

Which is why I'm making the decision to go to med school in a different country. Right now, I'm studying biomedicine in a university 2 hours away from where my parents live in Sweden but that's not good enough for me anymore. I need to move countries. That's not going to fix my relationship issues but hopefully it gives me more courage to date. And, medicine is very demanding so I won't have time to think about all this and I can always use that as an excuse if I don't want to go home in the summer. Medicine is also my passion so I'm not just doing this for freedom, it's just an added bonus. And if I need to fund my own studies, I can apply for a loan for very low interest rates which is a godsend of being a Swedish citizen.

So, I guess, what I'm trying to say is, you need to create your own escape route. This is mine for the time being and looking forward to moving countries is the only thing that's getting me through this summer of being back home. So start plotting your own escape route because trust me, there is one. You just gotta find it.  And no, you don't need to cut your parents off completely if thats what u want. Get enough distance that u can see them on your own terms, not theirs. If moving countries is what works, then move. If getting a loan or a job or an internship is what works, do it! You know in your heart what do. It is a difficult path but tolerating your parents behaviour is just as difficult, if not more. This does not mean you don't love them or they don't love you. All it means is you love yourself enough to do this for YOU."

My standing is pretty good. I have received scholarships and I’ve been involved in various extra-curricular activities throughout college. 

Although, I have an excellent background on that, I feel incompetent when I compare myself to similar job seekers from prestigious universities who experienced internships in multinational companies and have experience exchange programs. 

Since I missed the opportunity to take internships in college and most big companies only accept students in internships, I am trying my best to be industry-ready by I am finding opportunities to participate in international training programs.

However, I feel like what I do is never enough because my school is not on the top. I just I have a good head-start. 

I have seen fresh graduates working in big companies. And it makes me discouraged sometimes because I graduated from a small school. 

Please know that I am really trying. I hope you understand.  

How should I respond from this job search emotions? Is there any people here who have similar experiences before? How did you respond from it?"

Before I start with my details, please, please brutally chance me. Don't just say (you can or can't), just fully honestly give me your opinion. 

And also, this is a throwaway cuz I am rather specific.. don't dox me, like don't

and a clarification about my situation, I am on a h4 visa( i moved to the US when I was 2 years old, but I am not a permanent resident yet so I will be classified in the international pool)

**basic demographics-** female, citizenship= Indian, Public school(one of the best in state).. I don't have any hooks, unless being from Idaho(a rather underrepresented state) a hook?

**Finances- EFC= 20k.** 

**Intended major-** for lac's, Ivy leagues I will be applying as a ""history of science"" or ""science, tech, society"" major (or some variation of these majors) 

for MIT, Caltech- I will be applying as neuroscience/ linguistics/ cog sci

This is because my Ec's are evenly split between humanities and sciences, I will further explain in the following Ec section

**Stats-** test scores and GPA- I have a 4.0/ 4.0( no rank, my school does not rank or do weighted GPA) however I have a rigorous schedule(taking IB math HL, IB chem HL, IB phy HL, IB bio HL, ib history HL, ib english sl, IB german SL)..

I took the english, APUSH exams this year

My coursework from freshman and sophomore years- CALC BC(5), bio(5), chem(4), phy C(4 on both), US gov(5), human geo(5)

note- will these 4's hurt me? I self studied both physics C because school does not offer them, but I did take the ap chem class(ngl, chem isn't my favorite lol)

**SAT, ACT =** 1540, ACT=35

EC's:

BWSI summer program @ MIT- I am doing the Cogworks class- one of 20 students selected nationwide to participate in the program

Enjoy writing science fiction, was featured in some national exhibit thing

**AWARDS:(kinda weak here, I know)**

\-USABO semifinalist- 10 percent nationwide(Ok, so I was really prepping hard this year, and was expecting to make it to camp because of over 3 years of prep, but I wasn't allowed to take the semifinals exam because I am not a citizen/ resident and they require it.. it was really sad because I have never thought of myself as anything but american, and maybe plan to write my college essay about this? does that sound good?) 

 British biology olympiad( got top 10 percent worldwide)

\-Science olympiads- 10th place @ invitational, numerous top 3 mentions at state(even one first place) and state brain bee 3 place

\-National history day- one of top 2 in entire state to be selected for nationals.. They only have like 100 students worldwide that qualify for nationals.. I wrote a history paper about a scienctific thing + paper got a special award for best ""science tech"" project in the state from over 600 entries

\-Research- so I have done some bioinformatics research (genomics) and got 3rd place at state in the CS/ comp bio category.. I did the entire thing myself(like no mentors and help, from the idea to the actual research)- this research also won a special award from the Navy, called the naval science award

**LORS/ essays:**

My science teacher has a statement in his lor, ""strongest student in my decade of teaching"" and my german teacher's rec is pretty strong too..

Meanwhile, as soon as I leave work and head home after going to the gym my mood is 100x better. I think as to why I'm depressed is that my job has an insane amount of unpredictability (I was literally just told I need to be into the office at 7am tommorow, and I also literally do not know my schedule a few days ahead), the work I am doing is extremely menial and I don't feel that a 4 year degree is even close to being needed (stuff that a high school freshman could do), don't really talk with my coworkers much, and I'm dealing with the elements for 8 hours straight (heat, poison ivy, ticks, etc.) Am I just overreacting or is it something serious?"

international students got supremely screwed with the rescinds.

I wanted to ask if there are any consequences of rejecting full time roles after signing the acceptance letter.

Let's says I say yes to an offer in July. In August, I get an offer that is better in every way. Obviously the best thing for me to do is to renege on July offer as the newer offer is better. How does one do that with least fallout ?


With summer internships, my college warned us not to renege on offers.

With full time, I am sure they will say the same to protect their relationships. 

But if I renege, what can be the consequences?


Is there like a blacklist where they keep track of candidates who reneged?"

My gpa is 3.6 and I was a student athlete in college. I’ve also had two internships one internal and one for a msp. I keep hearing that the current workforce has a shortage of people for entry level jobs but I somehow am really struggling to get a help desk job. I’ve applied to over 50 different companies so far an I’ve only got one offer. I’m also about to take security+ soon and I spend a lot of time doing tryhackme boxes so I know a little, but nothing crazy. I do those so I have chance to get into security at some point.

vh1q9y,2,2022-06-20,Graduating in December,BadNewsBalls,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/vh1q9y/graduating_in_december/,I've been taking classes for a major in CS in an effort to make a career switch. The company I work for has paid for it so I can't really complain but I feel like once I graduate I'm going to be overlooked because of my age (35...Jesus its weird typing that) and because I have no real industry experiance.  I can't take a huge pay cut either or do an unpaid internship as I have dependants. Any advice for someone who isn't going to a traditional uni and looking to break into the industry?

My university has a program that allows students to get a masters degree with only one extra year of studies (by overlapping many undergraduate credits with graduate requirements). I applied for this program and was rejected, so I have to decide if I’ll apply again, knowing that I would have to go for one more semester than I was anticipating. I have scholarships covering my tuition, but will run out for this final semester. Additionally, I am currently a web dev intern at a mid-large sized tech company, and could potentially receive a return offer for a full time position after I graduate with my undergrad this spring.

I’ve heard graduate CS degrees are mostly only useful for AI, data science, etc which I’m not interested in. Would it be worth it for me to get my masters degree in 1.5 years (would cost about $20k)? Or should I just go work full time?"

I started my summer internship 2 weeks back and I am kinda feeling lost . On top of that I am paired with another intern who is a pain to work with and is hideous af (she tries to f me up during meetings , like she would say to me that i have nothing to showup for the standup call but ends up doing the opposite also she backbitches about me to other interns) . Also the mentor is a architect level guy who speaks so much high level stuff that most of the times i fail to understand. Plus the manager has no clue whatsoever the mentor speaks about . Also the mentor is not from my manager’s team . He is some different entitiy . So last week i was assigned a task to make a react clone of a certain tool . At first i was panicking as to how will i do it(have no prior knowledge of it) but slowly i started picking up the pace but still i don’t know if i am doing it right , i mean if certain thing should be a component or not , am i following good coding practice etc . Everyday i come home and spend the evening being anxious and worried . I need advice on how do I sail through and not f up badly .

vh2enw,87,2022-06-20,I feel like a failure.,Brace12,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vh2enw/i_feel_like_a_failure/,"Hey CS folks.

I am currently a 4th year computer science student who can't graduate until I take an additional course in summer. I have been job searching for a year now and I had no luck with all of my applications. Applied to 100 companies, got to take a test assignment for a few of them and only got to an interview for one. All of them rejected me. 

I don't understand what I am doing wrong. I am trying to be a jack of all trades, learning web development, software development, databases, etc and I think it is coming back to bite me in the back. Maybe it is better to just be a master of one. 

Recently, I had lost motivation to continue with my job search. Family pressure has caused me to break down and now I feel lost. Am I overthinking this? Is it really this hard to get an entry level job (or an internship)? How good do you have to be in coding to land in one of them?"
vh2seg,13,2022-06-20,How to make the intern a 'Solution' person instead of a 'Problem' person?,MoneroThrower,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vh2seg/how_to_make_the_intern_a_solution_person_instead/,"One of the interns I'm mentoring is taking larger amounts of my personal work time with their questions. 

I expected 20% of my time to be spent mentoring the intern(s), when it's starting to push 35% (which I will bring up with my boss come our meeting). In particular, the intern in questions comes to me with a lot of problems. When given a medium-sized task, she is able to identify problems, but rarely provides any solutions. She has at least a years worth of experience programming in a formal setting using Java in a similar industry (we are using C++) and I expect more from her. 

Ideally, I'd like an intern to come to me with:

1. What the current problem is
2. What their approach is
3. (Optional) Some code as to how they solved the problem

Instead, what I get is:

1. What the current problem is
2. No potential solution (me thinking about how to solve the problem for her, providing 80% of the logic)

The last time I mentored interns, both were primarily solution people, and would often come up with ideas as to what to do, providing working-code for me to review. As such, I spent around 10% of my time mentoring, with the rest of the day being spent by them on programming. Don't get me wrong, I'm incredibly patient and polite with the interns, and always make sure they feel welcomed and understood, but I'm starting to become distraught. I'm afraid if the interns don't complete their internship project, it'll reflect poorly on me.

Am I holding the current class of interns to too high a standard? If it is not, how should I communicate politely to the intern that they need to do the task themselves ('struggle through it' is probably not the best way to put it, but that's what I want to communicate. I want to see them atleast try to provide a solution, even if it's poor)."

I was originally planning to specialise in Marketing because of interest and I have done some case comps + completed a marketing internship. However, after my recent internship, I now feel that marketing seems abit fluff haha so I'm looking into Finance as well. 

I have planned it out and if I take 24 MCs for Y3S1, Y3S2 and Y4S1, I will be able to complete the 20 MCs each required for MKT and FIN spec, and the conditions required for my second major. 

My CAP is 4.06 right now and I am not sure if it will be worth it to take this double specialisation. I got A- for FIN2704 so my experience with finance hasn't been that bad. 

Any advice will be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

I'm working on my resume for the summer recruiting cycle. Targeting FAANG sophomore programs, but mostly just want SWE cuz my internship right now is QA Dev (Java/Selenium). Would prefer to do ML &gt; Python &gt; Backend &gt; Everything Else

I've already decided two projects I want to put on

1. Sentiment Analysis REST API built and trained from scratch (Python, Tensorflow, Flask, Docker, AWS)

2. Huge Image Webscraper/Database project that involved setting up a cloud data pipeline of 100k+ images, interacting w bunch of API's (Python, Selenium, Google Cloud Platform)

Here are the rest of my projects I could put on.

- Shitty fullstack hackathon project using ML for art recomendations (Python, Flask, Tensorflow, HTML/CSS, Docker, Firebase)

-Minesweeper game w a super optimized solving algorithm (C)

-Robotic Arm Controller for school design team. Mostly mechanical/electrical project as only software involved was mapping sensors

-Compiler built as a discord bot w a download website (Python, HTML/CSS)

-In depth analysis of a real world client problem using ML/data analysis (Python, Tableau)

-Shitty webgame (HTML/CSS, JS)

I also have the option of making a new project using whatever relevant stack to diversify the project list. Lmk what you guys think thanks for the help 🙏"

I told them I don't know C and they said sorry and it is fine, moved on to the next questions. There were some unknowns model comparison which ive never heard those terms before and they explained me in details, so I could answer them almost on every question. 

So, I asked them to give feedback on me and they said my communication skill is great and I would be a good teammate. But one of them said it was difficult for him/her to find out if I an skill but I seem to have very good CS fundamental in DSA. (Because I answered almost everything in DSA question)

One of them gave me a feedback it was great and even though I had some but in code, I fixed it early and got it so thats's fine. 
He/she asked me where I'd like to work for there department and after my answer, he was verry happy for that and said great to hear. 

Any red flag or good sign?
Thanks :)"

I spoke to some people who are working good CS jobs and they are women and they often have said that this summit here:

Is a good way to make connections for internships or jobs. Hence I’m wondering if I should attend. I missed the opportunity to get a scholarship and attend in person but there is a virtual option for 200 dollars. I’m a broke college kid and I’m careful about where I spend my money so unless this virtual connecting opportunity doesn’t yield some good connections and maybe internship referrals for next year, I wouldn’t attend. I’m asking if anyone on here is familiar with this conference and if it’s worth it . Thanks"
vhduwf,2,2022-06-21,"Rejection and rejection, where do I go from here? How do you overcome rejection?",nonymous1199,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/vhduwf/rejection_and_rejection_where_do_i_go_from_here/,"I was hoping to get some advice and I’m really hoping I don’t sound bratty here. 
Education - mba/cfa (finance focus)
Experience - 4 years in credit, 1 year in accounting (back office), and 1 yr in strategy (present work)
Location - Canada 

I have 4 years experience in credit. During that time I got my cfa charter and decided to get an mba soon after to pivot into strategy/transformation roles. I joined a 2 year internship-like program after my mba at a bank but it’s not going well. The experience I’m getting is not meaningful at all. The pay is decent (100k+ bonus etc.). The program is designed to learn different areas in the bank and exit into a permanent role. The bank isn’t really hiring permanent roles out of the program so all in all it’s not worth the time commitment.

Here’s my dilemma: I have been applying to a broad range of jobs, some of which are a manager level. I get through to the last round of interviews and I’m told that I don’t have enough experience. In other words I’m too young to lead. I feel like I’m qualified, I know I can learn quickly, and clearly if the recruiters don’t see that in me they wouldn’t be pushing me to the last stage of hiring. 

It seems like this internship brought me the pay but no one else is willing to match it. I know it’s a dead end, and I know I have to move soon. I just don’t know where to go from here. I can’t justify taking a pay cut but at the same time I don’t know what else to do. I’ve been applying for 6 months now.. I’ve reached the final stage 5 times now. I’m honestly not picky at all, I just need to get myself out of the internship I’m in.

I’m feeling more discouraged than ever. Am I permanently screwed? Is 6 months a long time to be rejected for? Should I take a pay cut? Any advice would be appreciated."

vheuox,10,2022-06-21,Advice Needed: Have Master's from good school but life precluded internships - now I have no experience several years out,RemoteConserve,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/vheuox/advice_needed_have_masters_from_good_school_but/,"Gist is in title. I finished classes in regional environmental governance (+ foreign language &amp; area studies, kind of a double major in terms of focus) for my M.S. from Cornell in 2018, but due to incarceration of my partner + her pregnancy -&gt; our baby, I was unable to mentally/logistically find an internship or anything of the sort. Additionally, these life events hit during my final semester and my studies suffered. I've spent the past few years raising my son who is now going on 4 and working odd jobs like night janitor and delivering for Amazon.

I am not struggling financially, but I am extremely discouraged about my envisioned career arc - I had hoped to use my language skills + policy work + data analysis stuff to work in conservation internationally. Now, I can't get call backs for even local land trusts; I even got rejected for Americorps in favor of some college students (tbf, I can understand that).

I am at the point where I'm throwing ideas at the wall - should I go for a doctorate AKA reset my academic position, should I just try and get remote work such that I can live overseas and maybe slide into a position once in-country or at least get to live there or travel often, should I give up on the gravitational pull towards humanitarian/environmental work that I've felt since high school and just teach myself a bunch of programming? Should I just homestead (I have the space for it) and forget all this?

Some things I'm working on: improving my LinkedIn, reaching out via the platform to try and network w alums that work at international orgs like WWF, WRI, etc in hopes of securing an internship (though I would need to work PT still), refreshing my skills, etc. I have not taken advantage of networking like I should have been both because I haven't felt like I could relocate the way I had planned and because I am suffering from a lack of confidence given my situation and rustiness; it's not imposter syndrome per se but it's along those lines.

Any advice, thoughts &amp; prayers, critical feedback, insight, wanton ad hominem all welcomed."
vhg7rf,3,2022-06-21,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (6/20/2022),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/vhg7rf/weekly_job_qa_thread_6202022/,"Hi all,

Here is the 124th installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

\--Nick

Bit of a backstory here: I'm done with my 12th CBSE boards. Myquals:

* got \~93% in 10th, 
* got \~82% in 11th (maths + cs), 
* got horrible marks in 12th term 1 (almost all the subjects were arouund 20ish and foreign papers were absurdly difficult but that's beside the point)
* didnt do that great in term 2 either

Currently, I have no idea what to do in my life and I'm not going to expect great marks in JEE either because I didn't put any effort into it mainly because there's no time for me to learn.

Now to the main part, I came across **SRM** and their entrance exam, SRMJEEE, which is in \~5-6 days and I believe I'm preparing decently for it. My main aim right now is to not slack off for this and get an admission into the **CSE batch at Kattankulathur or Ramapuram** at the very least.

I read quite a bit of posts on how SRM is this, how SRM is that but SRM is my **only choice** at this moment with the horrible grades I have and cut throat competition in most of the other decent Indian universities. I'm not really into enjoying college life and not like I enjoyed my high school life either *(ahem covid ahem).* I dont really care if the teachers are mediocre or not, would be great to get above average teachers but whatever. I am prepared to learn enough on my that's required for me to pass or get decently good grades and I've been doing so since 9th because of how my teachers were. 

My main aim is to gather as much experience I can in CS via internships or whatever within the 4 years I'll be in SRM. I've done plenty of projects in CS (github profile backs it up) and is well versed in a few languages as well. This is why I don't really care about what or how they will be teaching and will focus on learning and passing the other subjects that are being taught.

If there's anyone (**SRM alumni/current SRM CSE students/anyone else who has written SRMJEEE and has gotten into the uni**) willing to guide me through this, please assist me with this by **commenting down below** and I'd be greatful if you are willing to provide advice via **DMs** on reddit as well. I've been a total failure so far and SRM is last chance atm"

Hello all, I am thinking about applying for the cyber corps scholarship for service and was wondering if anyone has any experience with the program. I am entering my second year (technically 3rd with the accelerated program) majoring in Cyber security at the University of Cincinnati and have come across this program. I want to know if there is anyone here who has gone through the program and what they thought about it. Was job placement easy? Did it help to find future jobs after you served your time? Was it easy to find internships with the government?

Unfortunately, there isn't much information online about people who have done this, and the last post I saw about this was from 3-4 years ago. If you know anyone who has done this, or have done it yourself please let me know what your thoughts are on this because I am looking for a way to pay for school but also don't want to be roped into a job that isn't worth it for 2 years.

Cincinnati has a co-op program that requires 5 internship periods (one semester-long each) before you graduate. I am on my first paid internship right now for my first credit and my next internship will be next summer. So I have some time to think about it I just would like to know as much about this as possible. Thank you so much for your time, I appreciate it more than you could know."

vhj8ms,0,2022-06-21,my adopted son (M22) believes he is trans and it’s really starting to hurt all of our relationships,throwaway1171138,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/vhj8ms/my_adopted_son_m22_believes_he_is_trans_and_its/,"my adopted son believes he is trans and it’s really starting to hurt all of our relationships  


i have a 22-year-old son who thinks he’s trans and it’s ruining our lives. he nonstop has started wearing his girl clothes around us, claiming “they’re unisex” when they obviously aren’t. he never really talks to us and whenever we express concern for his well-being, he gets irate and begins to yell and blame everyone else. his sister has pretty much stopped talking to him and his father doesn’t really know how to talk to him. i’m the main one he talks to and he’s always trying to talk about trans things and i’m at my wit’s end. he’s obsessed by it, almost consumed with this idea he’s trans and it’s just so upsetting.  


we adopted him 22 years ago and at some point he lost his mind. he went and found his birth mother and met her and now she won’t even talk to him. he reaches out and she says she’ll talk to him but she never calls or texts him and i know it makes him upset. but why did he have to go and find her?? i do everything for him and he just decided that i wasn’t good enough? he blames her for it but i don’t have enough knowledge to know and preferably do not want to reach out to her and find out what happened there. she allegedly made him several promises which all went unfulfilled and he now has this burning resentment towards her. i personally feel it has more to do with her husband (he’s probably just uncomfortable with the idea that his wife does have this son who she gave up and he’s a man now), however i’m not sure of the whole story.  


he used to date girls but due to a few bad experiences with them he just doesn’t like women, seems to have a complete repulsion to the idea of being with a woman. he’s gone on to tall about how if he ever married one, his life would be over and he’d probably kill himself at some boring dead-end job with a wife who doesn’t respect him and children who don’t love him.  


one of his breakups resulted in him cutting himself up and down his wrist and face. it was awful and i can’t look at them the same. i feel so stupid and guilty that i saw all the signs but didn’t piece it all together  


we sent him to therapy and the woman said that he might have some sort of abandonment issue related to his birth mother “leaving him”. i keep telling them that we sent them there so that he would stop cutting his wrist and face, but he says he just went there to learn how to recover from his breakup  


christmas of 2020 he lied and said he might have covid and didn’t want to get us sick, but instead he went to his friend’s house to dress up as a girl. he didn’t even call or wish us a merry christmas. when we talked to him about that, he said that we didn’t call him either. he talked to all of my family however and wished them merry christmas. we were the only ones he did not reach out to  


my daughter and i found his instagram page of him wearing these clothes and going by his ‘girl’ name. he came home the day after christmas and told us he had been taking estrogen, without even telling us! we had to find someway to convince him to stop taking it cause we think it’d ruin his life. eventually we got through and he agreed to wait a year (he didn’t, but each time he took it it only lasted a week).  


that same day he came back, he came out to us as trans which shocked my daughter and i. my husband, at this point in time, assumed my son was confused and it wasn’t a big deal. my son tearfully told me that he saw me as a role model and wanted to be like me but when he came out he started having a panic attack. because he said he might have covid, and he went to a place where we didn’t know if the family had covid, we couldn’t really console him. i wore a mask on my face but he took his off because he was hyperventilating. he nonstop will bring up the fact that after he came out, i said: “i just want to d\*\* right now”. he takes it out of context and applies it to the trans thing but it was more so just the heartbreak of realizing that my son is dead.  


my husband and i were going on a trip in january that christmas and asked him to watch our elderly dog, but he became overwhelmed by the responsibility. the dog peed multiple times on the floor, and when we checked our ring doorbell, there was poop all over the snow-covered front porch, so all our neighbors and the delivery men had to walk through that  


he got a new therapist around this time and they were strictly there to help them workout this trans thing but it went nowhere. my son tried talking about his birth mother but the therapist seemed to inept to understand any of it and this he just kept probing the trans thing. eventually my son just stopped scheduling appointments with them and tried to “figure it out on his own”.  


additionally, he went on a summer road trip with his friends last year and went to visit my parents and sister. while he was there, i know for certain that he was saying incredibly awful things about me and his father to them all  


he doesn’t take care of his body, being incredibly skinny. when he eats a lot we take note but he ends up doing trying to stop himself from eating. my husband and i think it has something to do with the wanting to be a girl thing.  


he doesn’t seem to understand social cues either. in public spaces he’ll have loud outbursts of laughter at something they find funny which causes us some embarrassment. but when we tell him about it he says ‘i don’t care’. how can you not care??  


he continuously brings up the fact that he “doesn’t care” about a lot of things. he says he’s really intelligent but doesn’t apply himself, but to be honest, i don’t think he is all that smart. they’ve had a LOT of help from us, i don’t know how they haven’t flunked out of college. they’ve made dean’s list a few times in recent years which is shocking since he failed two classes  


he’s flunked two classes in college which set him a semester back. strangely when he got a job as a bartender at his college, his grades improved. he also began smoking pot on a daily basis (never getting high and going to work though, allegedly). now he uses the excuse that because all of his friends are gone and he’s all alone in college that he just wants to have a relaxing summer of doing absolutely nothing before going back and working and doing school. i still feel as though he is being lazy and using it as an excuse  


he talks back to us now more than ever, being very rude to his father/my husband and i. he claims we don’t listen to him but all he does is ramble on and on about movies, star wars, video games, trans stuff, clothes, smoking weed, and it’s just like too much. when we try and change the conversation he becomes upset and confrontational saying that he’s trying to find something in common for us to talk about but i just can’t think of any interests we have in common  


he’s recently tried to get us to go shopping with him while he’s dressed up as a girl and we’ve made it VERY clear that we don’t agree with it nor do we want to be associated with him in those clothes. all of our friends are very republican and he just says that everything they talk about is utter nonsense and garbage. i don’t agree with everything states on FOX news, but anytime it’s on when they walk in, they make a snide comment and say that we should watch a different channel  


he’s grown his hair out incredibly long which everyone in our social and family circles ask if it’s getting cut. my daughter told him one time that the whole family suspects he’s trans but i told him i did not know anything about it.  


my father (his adoptive grandfather) was going into surgery recently and everyone in the family reached out to him to let him know that we hoped the procedure would go well. all of us except my son. when we asked him why he didn’t say anything, he said it was because “he knows how annoying it can be getting a bunch of messages from people and didn’t want to overload them with another one”. this is YOUR grandfather going into surgery, and you felt that you shouldn’t send something?? then he said that he thought it was clear that my and my husband’s messages were enough to warrant not sending a message because we had already reached out to him.  


we’ve told him on so many occasions that his family members would not approve of him being trans and thus we’d have to say he’s off somewhere else so that he doesn’t show up in girls clothes. to which he’s accepted this and i feel as though he sees no problems  


he’ll come back at us sometimes with “so you’re saying i have to wait until everyone dies?”. “no, no one said that”. does he not get that we don’t want him to do this? we raised him as a son, not a daughter.  


my son really likes to make his opinion known. when we were in the store the other day, i asked him to go to the deli to get some meat and cheese for his lunches. when he came back, he was rather annoyed with how some woman was talking to her child. she was saying something along the lines that “this generation’s not the same as the previous ones because communication is so much more different and no one reads a book”. i was trying to explain to him that he doesn’t know the context of what she was saying and that he just heard a blurb of it. but he continued to say that he still didn’t like how she was talking to her kid and her argument, while somewhat arguable, still didn’t warrant her to be so aggressive to her kid  


he tends to be alone by himself and get high and watch movies and shows but show no ambition. he has one semester of college left and has shown little progress in getting a job or an internship. we tried to tell him to get a job this summer, which he put little effort into claiming that he “wanted to wear his girl clothes at work”.  


he tries to show me pictures of his girlfriends and them all going out to bars and drinking and meeting people, but i could care less about that. he always says how it’s to “get me comfortable with the idea” and “try to find a middle ground” but seeing my son in tube tops, ripped jeans, dresses, full face of makeup is just not of interest to me  


he sent me a picture of him wearing a pair of pink/purple bed shorts, a white crop top and a white zip up cropped sweatshirt one night and i didn’t know what to think. they replied that they “didn’t mean to send it” but they follows up with messages such as “but do i look cute?” and “do you like my outfit?” so i don’t know what to believe. i said they looked disturbing and they bring that one up to me a lot as well  


sometimes when it becomes too much of the trans thing, i just can’t take it and kinda snap. like i don’t care about it anymore, i want it to be done. i tell them they’re delusional and they get irate with me saying i just don’t care and don’t love them. is it not love to have to deal with this on an all the time basis?  


he’s always been a little weird and seen things differently. he was bullied in grade school and middle school and in high school his friends left him. he still has two good friends but they don’t know about his trans thing and he says that he doesn’t care if they don’t know about it  


oh, and the other day he told his father that he’s been dressing this way for two years. this is completely not true. they haven’t lived as a girl for two years. if anything they crossdressed in their bedroom and a few times when he and his girlfriends would go to cincinnati and do god-knows-what  


his grandfather texted him to remind him that his fathers birthday was at a certain date and my son was extremely upset by this. i confronted him, asked him why he was moody and he asked if we was autistic or retarded to which i said “you aren’t either”. he feels as though his family believes he is a complete idiot or can’t remember important dates, even though my son says he remembers birthdays.  


i tell him he’s depressed and he just says it’s because we’re “always on him about a job and his school and we’re not supporting his decision to transition”. we gave him a house to stay in, rent free, jobless, he sits around and does nothing, we pay for his food and car, like we could’ve kicked you out a long time ago. so to say we aren’t supporting him is a little ridiculous. i’ve read many trans people are kicked out of their house and he’s living like a bachelor in our homes.  


he spends all his money on these girl clothes and makeup and wants us to refer to him by the pronouns he wants to go by and his preferred name. he spends a bunch of his time on gay dating apps and some bigger social media pages posting pics and reading the creepy comments that strange men leave on them.  


i keep asking who he thinks will want to date a trans woman and i swear he never knows the answer. i say no gay or straight men and he says straight and bisexual men but i still don’t really believe the stat on that one.  


we recently built a house in florida (yay!) and my husband and i were trying to convince our son to get a job so that, as a reward, he could come down and visit for looking for getting a summer job. instead, they didn’t do anything but lay around all day and go visit some friends on some trips. he also had his best girl friend come stay, unknown to us until he let it slip. he then said that he was wearing his girl clothes around her and all of our neighbors. he also thinks he passes but i just don’t see it. i feel as though his girlfriends are just doing it so they can say they have a gay or trans friend cause it’s “cool” nowadays. they’ll go shopping, use girl pronouns and his girl name for him. it just seems like it’s messing with his head. he says he gets a lot of “likes” and “comments” from people but i think they’re just bots, people messing with him, other trans people, or creeps.  


he swears/curses constantly too, dropping f-bombs, shit, hell, all day in any kind of company. he was on the phone the other day with Spectrum about late fees for returning his wifi box and was casually swearing to the person, which shocked my husband enough to say something to him, which resulted in our son saying some excuse like “oh, well, uh, the guy on the phone was being really cool and casual so i just didn’t really care”. sure, that’s what it was.  


he also mumbles SO much, and super quietly. we can’t hear or understand him a bunch of the time and he gets upset when we have to ask him to repeat what he said  


sometimes it feels like he holds me hostage and tries to beg me to let him be trans. it’s like why are you doing this to me?  


i miss my little boy who used to smile. now i don’t even recognize them. i feel like a stranger moved in and my son died a long time ago. i’m looking for advice on what to do. thank you"
vhjqe9,1,2022-06-21,What can I do to stand out when coming from a Liberal Arts School,cglavin,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vhjqe9/what_can_i_do_to_stand_out_when_coming_from_a/,"(Sorry if this is in the wrong place, happy to remove and repost) I’m currently going into my 3rd year at a very well known Liberal Arts school, however their CS program is super new and virtually unknown. I got a cybersecurity internship this summer, however it essentially became just reading legislature working with the media team to make recommendations, whereas I’m realizing I really want to stick with the software engineering/programming path instead. I’ve been doing leetcode during the work day when I have free time, and started on just a basic tic tac toe python project this weekend, but what can I do in the next year or two to make myself competitive with those coming out of the top tech schools?"
vhjswj,5,2022-06-21,What should I do with my Career? [+ Recent Awakening due to Adversity],anotheranon17,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/vhjswj/what_should_i_do_with_my_career_recent_awakening/,"Hi,

I've asked this question before but I've a different perspective now that is even confusing for me so was hoping some folks could offer insight. I'm currently a frontend software engineer at Mastercard. I've been a SWE at MC since graduation for 2.5 years. There were tiny aspects that I enjoy about CS but I felt numb/bored at my job. I never seek CS outside my 9-5, look up newest tech/updates, and that will never be me. That will hinder me in my software career mostly because I don't care enough about this. I thought a PM job would be better: I'd be able to understand customers, truly assess and research their needs, and create something substantial. The last 6 months, I networked with PMs, took a PM course, and got my resume rewritten as well. But I'm skeptical about a PM career as well. I've heard a bunch of people switch back into coding because of high stress/politics/and being responsible for everything without being able to control everything. They're always the one who is pointed at if anything goes wrong, work hours are long because you're in meetings all day (which is exhausting) and maybe in the evenings/nights, you've time to do actual work. My plan was still to move forward with PM to just try it out even though getting an entry-level PM job was proving to be difficult and I wanted out of my company too. I've been at MC since my internship in 2019 and I'm ready to leave.

Things changed when my dad had a very unexpected cardiac arrest on 5/29. He's been in a coma since and my family, friends, and I are praying and hoping every single day (please send prayers my way too) cause my dad is my best friend, my closest confidante, and the funniest/wittiest/most wise person ever. But I at least came to know of my strengths. During extreme times of crisis, I effin step up. I’ve been taking care of my family, doing everything that needs to be done, and communicating with external parties for legal stuff and I’m good at this. This further proves that in my career, I need to somehow be in charge of stuff. During crises, I don’t shut down but drive on full acceleration. No wonder I felt so disconnected from software engineering.

I'm in a conflict, though. Being a software engineer has given me amazing flexibility as I take some time away in the afternoon to go to the hospital, am on pickup/dropoff duty for my little sister through her swim meets in summer. My mom doesn't have that flexibility in her job because she is a Product Analyst and has a bunch of meetings. I'm confused now though if I should stay in SWE because of its perks/flexbility during 9-5 even though I will never code outside my hours cause I just don't care enough and my hobbies, family, friends matter way more. I don't like being a SWE anyway. I thought about consulting because I am outgoing and extroverted but again my #1 priority is always going to be my family and very few jobs give that. What should I do?"

i am currently a corporate Student at IBM Germany studying Business Informatics - Data Science in my 6th Semester. Our Program allows us to rotate through different business units every 3 Months.

Normally we have the opportunity to gain practical experience abroad in our 4th Semester sponsored by our BU. Unfortunately due to covid we were not allowed to be on site. For our 6 Internship i am now searching for an opportunity to gain this experience before starting Full-Time at IBM Germany.

Would be happy to connect to someone how may offer a cool opportunity for a student in order to expand my network and gain experience abroad.

I have managed to get myself trapped in a internship where my boss will literally be bothered by how I structure a basic sentence for invoices and that my outlook is set to dark mode because I find it less straining on my eyes. 

He does not use my computer at work or my outlook but seems dead set that every little thing I do has to be exactly as he wants it literally to the letter ( you think I joke but i put a costs in a sentence once for a invoice and he demanded i remove the s because it made the sentence not sound how he wanted it to sound.)

Every time i make a mistake its a game of guess what you did now instead of just being told look this is wrong fix it here is why it is wrong.

I am stuck here for 7 more months and i don't know how to handle this insanity any more."

The company uses a tech stack that I am not familiar with. I was assigned a ticket in my first week to fix some broken functionalities. I am feeling a little overwhelmed trying to navigate few massive repositories trying to identify the bug and fix it.

There is very little documentation available and my boss wants me to sink my teeth into the ticket. They get annoyed when I ask them questions (some of my questions are basic because I am not familiar with their stack).  I am trying to put extra hours after work to learn the tech stack but I am not sure if I can even google the right questions at this point. I know I can pick it up but just need some time to find my footing.

I'm getting a little worried about my summer. Is this usually how things work in the real world? Can any experienced devs in here guide me on how I can navigate this situation?"

I have a bunch of stuff that I did like fundraising at events for people with disabilities, I and I volunteered over 500 hours at a hospital, and I was in the university symphonic band, and I have a whole bunch of other things I did that are not internship or research related. Do admissions committees care about this stuff? I used to be premed, where ECs are weighed heavily, so that's why I have so much other stuff on my CV.

I am an intern and it is my first job, so I am wondering how many hours to enter. I usually work every day of the week and in total it is like 50-60 hours per week. I am wondering whether I am supposed to enter these extra hours rather than simply sticking to standard 40 hours in spite of me actually working more. Since the amount of work I get done so far is pretty low, I do not want my firm to think that I am dumb/unproductive worker to have to work that much. Or even worse, I do not want them to think that I lie to get paid more (overtime rate is twice standard rate).

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Sorry for bad title of the question. I have meant to ask ""Should I report overtime hours?""."

vhs3rq,1,2022-06-21,Should I stay in this friendship or get out?,sfvbud,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/vhs3rq/should_i_stay_in_this_friendship_or_get_out/,"Let me start with a lot of back stories, basically telling the whole life story of us. So I (18M) met my friend (18F) during the last few months of our senior year in high school. And during this time we talked a lot. But at a later date at like midnight, she sent a text saying that she knew that I was interested in her and she was interested in me but she was not ready for a relationship. I was sad about it, but I understood. I thought that that was the end of our friendship or it would be very different, but not even 24 hours later she invited me to go on a day trip with her. At first, I was hesitant because she just rejected me and now we going somewhere, what is this all about. In the end, I decided to go and ask her why she even invited me. We went and during the trip, I asked her and she said that we talked about going on a day trip and we were friends. After we come back she was going to drop me off and then she ask me if we could go somewhere, I said yes and we went to this place called the view. There we just sat and then she asked Why me? I told her and then we started to hold hands and cuddle a bit. I thought this was going to be the breakthrough in our relationship, but no, she still didn't want a relationship. We had a friend group meet-up, and there we were holding hands and we even went back to the view. Later, I tried asking her out on dates but she would just say no, and I said we could just do it as friends so we can truly get to know one other, but she still refused. She said that she was afraid to just hurt me and that she was taking advantage of me, I told her that I would be fine and she didn't have to worry. We would still talk through text and even sometimes meet up during our free period to just talk. Then out of nowhere, she told me to stop talking to her after school because she didn't want to keep on leading me on. I was bummed but I kept the promise, but I saw her and told her that I missed talking to her, and she said that we can talk again, but that she didn't like the good nights and what are you doing because it reminded her that she was in a relationship, I told that I said those things because it is common courtesy and that it also gave me a topic to talk about.
So we keep on talking and we helped each other with some stuff. Then prom came we didn't go as a couple but we went in a friend group, at the end we left prom early, and we went back to the view and spent time there cuddling and handholding. a couple of days went by and we meet up and she asked me what would you say if I already had someone else that I was seeing. She came out as poly, and I am ok with that but then she said that she had gone on a couple of dates with someone else and if he asked for them to be exclusive that she would agree. That broke me because I liked her and I thought she liked me, I know that we weren't exclusive but do you hold hands and cuddle with someone and then go on dates with another person. And she wasn't making a bad joke or anything. I couldn't say anything and I just texted that I needed time to think and that It really hurt me that she said that like nothing that we did meant nothing to her. after a day of thinking I still talked to her and we back like nothing ever happened. and then Gradnite came and first nothing happened but We started to hold hands and at the end, we sat together and slept together. On my birthday, we went hiking and we hold hands and we were cuddling. And we even met one last time before she left for an internship. I told her that I was sacred for all the changes that going to happen, like what if she gets a partner there, and she made seem so easy to change as we would just have to stop holding hands, and you just got to stop saying that I like you. Before she left I told her that I would be her friend and even if I have the person that has to text first I would and that I wouldn't leave until she told me to. Now she is over in Florida for her internship for the rest of the summer, and it looks like she already moved on, she has gone a bunch on tinder dates and even said on her Insta why I am I going on more dates here than back home, and I wanted to say because you never agree to go out with me. she has told me little but some things about the dates and I know that I am her friend but it makes me feel like she doesn't know that I like her. A part of me wants to leave this friendship because I know that I can get hurt again, but another part of me wants to stay to be a man of my word and also because I am an optimist.

TLDR: This girl and I liked each other, but she wasn't ready for a relationship. We talked and hand holds, but nothing ever happened. She is now in Florida for the summer, and it looks like she moved on. But I said that I would be there for her until she told me to stop. I want to keep my word but a part of me wants to leave because I know that I can get hurt again. 

 So what should I do? Should I stay or should I leave? 
If I stay should I just give up on any hope of a relationship? and If yes How do I Do that? 
If I leave, how do I do that, I don't just want to abandon her."
vhs5qy,2,2022-06-21,School &amp; Finances,Hopeful_Somewhere_50,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/vhs5qy/school_finances/,"~~I'll try to keep this brief but I feel like I'm in a rut and I don't know what to do.~~

In high school I fell apart, I was deeply suicidal and depressed. In a way it's a miracle I survived let alone graduated.By senior year I was feeling guilty about letting my passion for math &amp; science fall behind. But I felt like I could go to college for a STEM degree and recover from my mistakes. It would have to be a community college, without scholarships, taking out loans, and working to pay for my car and groceries because my high school grades made it nigh impossible for anything else. But I wanted to do it so I did.

Fast forward a couple years. I did alright (\~3.0) at community college and I transferred to a local university. Unfortunately, I never addressed my depressive or suicidal tendencies and they manifested again. I got kicked out of university for poor grades (\~2.4?). I didn't fully realize at the time but because I was trying to ""make up for"" the time I missed in high school I held myself to impossible standards and added unnecessary pressure on myself. It was dysfunctional.

I became directionless for a few months. I then spent about a year working \~60hr work weeks saving money just to afford classes out of pocket at the community college. I had to because I was ""non-degree seeking"" just to take classes to raise my GPA and get my readmission approved. I took some of this time to address my mental health. I still struggle with it to this day but I understand it better now because I took the time at this period to talk to professionals.

Okay, so I took the classes got all A's and got my readmission approved. I changed majors to Computer Science since I took all the required math &amp; science classes already, I wanted to learn to program, and financially it's probably the only thing that could get me to a good place at that point. I was on probation which got lifted after a few semesters of all A's and one B. I hovered a B+ average since then. I had a lot of A's off the bat but some higher level classes net me a couple C's and B's. At this time I believe I have a 2.8 gpa.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay finally we're at present day. I have been unable to secure any internships, I think because of my subpar gpa. That could be wrong but how would I know? My biggest issue is that I have a group project I have to do to graduate, a capstone project. This thing is such applied knowledge and they did not teach us any of this. The major is very theoretical but then the last year you have to start doing very applied things without any real guidance. I guess that's the point but I feel so lost in comparison to a lot of other people. My peers somehow pick this up so quickly. Maybe they learned at internships? I have no clue...

So now I'm feeling like crap. I can barely contribute to my capstone project. I want so desperately to be useful but I don't have much applied experience in software, I for some reason can't seem to pick up development as quickly as my peers, and I'm still working \~30hrs a week just to maintain expenses. At best I try to be sort of managerial (i.e. make sure meetings go right, nobody is blocking anyone else from getting things done, we're moving at good pace) but it feels like a petty job and it certainly won't help my prospects in landing a gig after graduation. I need to figure out how to contribute.

For reference my expenses are something like this:

I've been leasing my car throughout this experience. I don't know how to take care of a beater and I suspect the cost of maintenance in time, anxiety, discomfort, and actual payments to mechanics will be the same as lease over time anyways. Obligatory car insurance payments. I also went out to eat a lot my first two years in college. I didn't learn how to cook and I felt I never had the time or money to learn or afford a burnt meal if I messed up. I've slowly gotten better and I have a few staple meals I cook a couple times a week on a good week, then eat out on the days I don't have leftovers. But I'm not really capable of meal planning consistently or anything. Best I've done is a few month long periods of doing subscription meal plans (blue apron,  green chef, etc.) and then they would pile up and I'd quit.I've also had a fair amount of health (cardiac &amp; GI) complications since my sophomore year of college as well.  Several thousands of dollars and a few daily medications later...

I don't go out or spend money on frivolous things, I cave once maybe twice a year to pay for something expensive like a concert or a AAA video game. My family and I have a tense relationship but I've been able to negotiate staying with them while I've been dealing with this so no rent. That said, they often throw last minute errands at me so idk how much I've lost in time over the years. They're better about it these days but I used to feel like their butler. Everything else I spend little money on or no money on for as long as I can put up with it (i.e. clothes, little things around the house, etc).

All the while I've been racking up student loans from the majority of classes I could not pay out of pocket.

So really what I need advice on is how do I keep this all together? How can I better balance working, graduating, and finances to make my situation work? I feel like I'm about to crack again not being able to keep up in my classes.I just need to survive my last year of college and maybe with a bit of luck I can land one of those cushy software jobs I keep hearing about. I can't think of how I can ease the load any more.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:I am someone that struggled for years in college and persevered, if not barely. But a mix of financial stress, working, and trying to complete a banger senior project makes me feel like I'm going to not make it to graduation. What should I do?

Edit: Apologies. I said I would try to keep it brief but I didn't.

Edit: I unintentionally exaggerated a detail upon review. Fixed it.

Edit: Clarifying lease wording."

vhsu6o,0,2022-06-21,Top Tier School Odds?,RapHon27,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/vhsu6o/top_tier_school_odds/,"So a bit of backstory, I was raised in a small southern community and have had aspirations to go to a top tier school since I was young. My GPA fell hard my junior and senior years of high school but I managed to get into the state college thanks to my ACT scores. At this point it looks like I am going to be graduating with a double major in Finance and Economics with a 3.6-7 GPA. I do plan on working for some time before I apply for further education, but as is now my highest achievement is an internship for the state senator this summer in D.C. It's my dream to end up graduating from Law School at Harvard or Stanford but I have been told by multiple people that it ""Won't be possible for you."" So my question is if anyone has any insight into the process that could tell me if it's just a pipe dream or not? I'm not worried about any test or any scores I will need to make like LSATs because I tend to test well. It's the lack of a 4.0 GPA and living in a rural community with little opportunities growing up that worry me."

I am a fresh grad, with only my degree, an internship, and some experience as a PC tech. I would be replacing the retiring previous programmer who worked for 30 years there. Upon hiring I was told I would have the help of a business analyst (with dev experience), a consultant, another programmer, a few more admins. I was also told I would be getting a free Oracle Learning Subscription, a huge part of why I accepted that job, a 5000 dollar certification subscription that could benefit me in finding my next job. I have very little job experience otherwise. I am 21 years old.

Nothing has come to fruition. The subscription is stuck in purchasing, the analyst quit, the other programmer is over 70 years old and only maintains legacy systems, and is never there. Only other person to help is a DBA, not programmer, so it is limited. The consultant will not work on my projects for weeks at a time, no matter my persistance.The department is very small and has no budget.I am solely in charge of customizations, bug fixes, new inquiries and integrations, and maintaining several large crucial campus-wide custom projects that i didnt create, and would cause severe loss of service if not maintained. New coding languages I have no experience in. No experience in PeopleSoft, which is 90% of the job. I can never get ahold of my passive agressive boss, who is the CIO, and also 60+ years old, and seems to have no idea of what I actually do everyday. All of my coworkers are at least 20 years older than me, and treat me like an annoyance. I am suprised I have even made it 6 months with how much responsibility has been thrown on me. I cry often and it stresses me out considerably. It is hard to meet deadlines when i have to start everything from scratch. I am always so swamped with work. Community threads are not helpful for me ever. I have tried so many times to convey ""i just need some ******* help"" to my boss, she doesnt seem to care or understand. I am exhausting my options. I dont know how else to advocate for myself.

Should i stick it out for a while for the subscription and experience? I feel like this place literally sucks, which is very disheartening. I feel so used and mislead. I did not lie or exaggerate my skills on hiring so i have no idea how my boss was so irresponsible as to hiring me, as the past programmer was very skilled and had a huge campus wide role. I got this job because i knew people, and I am scared to explore other options. What would you do?"

vhu6bx,204,2022-06-21,3 mistakes I made early on at UW that I regret now 5 years later,interino474,udub,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/vhu6bx/3_mistakes_i_made_early_on_at_uw_that_i_regret/,"Before I start, incase you missed it in the title, these are mistakes ""I"" made. They are mistakes for me and it doesn't mean they are mistakes for you if you do so otherwise everyone's situation is different but maybe this can serve as some food for thought if any of it applies to you. 

*Mistake #1: Working part time.*

Absolute waste of time and energy. Literally my biggest regret in my 23 years on this earth and here's why. 

A 3 month full time internship will make you just as much money if not more and set you up good for your future. I wish instead of wasting my time at a grocery store getting paid $16 an hour I would spend an hour a week applying to internships instead for the summer and practicing interview questions. 

It would have paid dividends by multiples of magnitude in every aspect and I would have all the time in the world to socialize and focus on my classes instead. 

Ever since I quite my job, I have done significantly better in school because I actually now have the free time and energy to study. 

If you absolutely must work for some reason, look into work study. Not only uw needs student workers now more than ever, but also they are super flexible with your class schedual and you can study while ""working"" specifically if you are working at the library (a lot of downtime) 

Edit: Just to clarify, I get people need to work. I had to work and did work for 4 years. But my point is, you should be able to save a few thousand after doing an internship over the summer. Even a basic intenrhsio at a 40k salary, should net you 9k or so working 3 months during the summer full time and last you the rest of the year hopefully. Also mentioned work-study as an option to fill in any gaps. 

*Mistake #2: Not living on campus*

I'm not rich either, I took out loans the one year that I did live on campus but it's worth it in many aspects. The people you live with and your classmates are the same people who go on and do great things in life. Having and making these connections will help you a lot in your career down the line not to mention building social skills is literally invaluable. 

If your compute is anything longer than 20 min tops in heavy traffic, you should consider living on campus. For me in hindsight, anything longer than 5 min is too long. 

It's not just the time you are in compute that is a waste of time, you also get exhausted. Trust me, I've drove to UW for 4 years with having an hour+ commute each way during heavy traffic. 

You can even pay for the majority if not all of your dorm cost by spending the same time you are saving on commute and do work study and you'd still be ahead when considering the social aspect of living on campus. 

Having room mates and friends close by to help with studying is also incredibly useful. 

*Mistake 3: Not knowing when to stop.*

When I wasn't doing well, I kept thinking I need to just push through and took classes over the summer to make up for my bad grades and I just kept digging my self a bigger hole every quarter. 

The world will not stop spinning if you take a quarter off or a summer off to regroup and rejuvenate your self, before going back to school. You can take one quarter off anytime and still be enrolled as a current student at UW. 

I wish I had taken some time to reflect on what I'm doing wrong and take some much needed break instead of going into every quarter more exhausted and disappointed in my self than before and end up doing bad again. 

In short, don't take classes over summer specifically if you are doing so to make up for a bad quarter. Just take your break. 


I know a lot of people here might feel pressure from family as I did in the past but at the end of the day, it WILL do more harm than good if you don't actually take time to figure stuff out and try to brute force your way around UW and college in general. 

If you feel like you have to finish school in x years but are doing bad, if you don't actually take time even for a quarter to reflect on why you are struggling, you will not only, not finish in time, but also end up taking longer. Speaking from experience. As the title suggests, I've been at UW for 5 years and will be here for another year."

vhuus5,0,2022-06-21,How do I best prepare for internships next summer after I just changed majors?,dumbcoder123,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/vhuus5/how_do_i_best_prepare_for_internships_next_summer/,"Basically, I just changed my major to CS from Finance after my junior year finished (long story as to why), but I am only graduating in Fall 2023 instead of Spring 2023 like I would originally. I finished my “freshman” CS classes (discrete and intro to CS) and next semester (Fall 2022) I’m taking DSA and 2 other courses (programming languages and computer architecture). I currently have an finance internship at a tech company (not FAANG or Microsoft but still a very large company) and didn’t get the chance to appply for CS internships since I was just accepted into my major. 

I want to get a solid swe internship for next summer and maybe a co-op squeezed in (and potentially push my graduation an extra sem to do that instead), so what should I do this summer while I am not working to be prepared? I’ve been taking CS50 to learn python because my school teaches C++ primarily and I feel like that would be a pain to do leetcode/interview with and was going to do an online DSA course so that I can start leetcoding before internship recruiting season starts.

my resume for CS is pretty bad because i have no projects and 2 prior internships that aren’t CS related.

has anyone gone through something similar? what do y’all recommend?

edit: also should add my current internship is remote so i’m very flexible during the day and haven’t had to work too much so far."
vhvov4,128,2022-06-21,Why so many people drop out of engineering and premed and how you can avoid being one of them,peculiar-maple26,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/vhvov4/why_so_many_people_drop_out_of_engineering_and/,"Graduating senior here. In my high school, about half of the seniors are planning on pursuing either premed or engineering majors in college. Obviously, doctors and engineers don't make up half of the population. Some quick googling shows that indeed, [attrition rates](https://www.rise.hs.iastate.edu/projects/CBiRC/IJEE-WhyTheyLeave.pdf) for [these majors](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0243546#:~:text=Only%2016.5%25%20of%20students%20who,students%20take%20more%20advanced%20courses) are very high, meaning that most people who enter college intending on engineering and premed end up switching majors.

Why does this happen? I posed this question in r/AskProfessors, to get their insight as to why so many students drop out of these majors. You can read the post and responses [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProfessors/comments/vgy9nx/why_are_attrition_rates_so_high_for_certain/), but here are the main takeaways:

1. Many freshmen pick degrees that are ""known"" to make good money without actually being interested in the topic. One professor stated, ""I've had numerous students come in thinking that they will become a doctor, and then they take a class in international economics, politics and government, or sociology and -- having learned that that major exists -- switch to one that they are truly interested in.""
2. There are misconceptions about what different degrees entail. CS is not just copying snippets of code or learning a programming language, it's studying high-level math and theory. This ties into the above bullet point, that many students don't know what they are getting into.
3. Engineering and premed classes are hard, and many students are not prepared to do the work. Calculus is where a lot of students fall off the wagon, as they just don't put in the necessary practice and utilize their resources. Anyone can succeed in these majors, but it takes a LOT of work, even for those who have always been at the top of their class. Professors emphasized the importance of understanding the theory, getting enough sleep, and asking for help.

So how can you avoid being an engineering or premed dropout? 

First, ask yourself why you're pursuing this major. Are you doing it because of family or peer pressure? Do you know what the job is actually like? Have you looked into related careers to see if they might be more interesting? Do you know what kind of classes you would take? Are you aware of the internships, research, clinical experience, MCAT, personal projects, and other things you need to do throughout undergrad in order to actually get into med school or get a good job?

Now, if you're sure about the degree you're pursuing, put your all into it. Don't be the person who slacks off, crams before the test, and forgets everything afterwards. Take the time to understand the theory of the math and science you're learning and practice the content until you can solve problems in your sleep (do make sure to get enough sleep). One professor advised spending two hours in the library every day, even if you spend the first hour scrolling reddit, just to get in the habit of putting aside time to work.

You may look around and see other people getting NASA internships, partying until 4am, volunteering in hospitals, or bragging about barely passing classes. But it is ultimately up to YOU what YOU want out of YOUR college experience and life. Don't choose engineering or premed if it's not truly what you want to do. If it is what you want to do, take it seriously so that you can accomplish all of your dreams."

I was having random hallucinations and weird dreams. The first two days were beautiful. The morning felt dreamy and everything around looked beautiful, fresh, and nothing less than a paradise. I had high motivation and my mind was flodded with ideas. I have never felt so positive in my life. I was grateful and expressed my gratitude to my friends, family and my gf verbally or through mere presence. 

A week goes by and I started having a lot of coincidences. I started dreaming in vivid details and it somehow started manifesting in the real world. There was a point where i would dream about things i do when i wake and it look so real. I could feel myself as a run along the track and my legs rebounding against the concrete. I could remember every detail of conversation I have with people in my dreams and this is were I had troubles differentiating reality from dreams. Once i went to grocesary shopping in my dream and bought a load of munches and kept it in my night stand. When i woke up o was already ready for my classes and decided to skip the lunch and have some cookies that I thought I bought yesterday. After getting fresh, i looked at my night stand and there was nothing there. It was certainly perplexing but i didn't make a big deal out of it. 

And now the coincidences started to kick in. I started meeting the same people from my dreams in the exact location in my reality. I started getting call from people just AFTER I thought of calling them. My thoughts also started aligning with the real world. I generally meditated when i was doing nothing. I didn't have a lots of thoughts in my mind but whenever  i thought of something my friends started to talk about the same thing. Whenever i thought of an old movie. My friends called me and played me the same movies when met and this went on for a month or so and still sometimes. Everything changed for me. This was completely different from what i was used to. 

I started to recognize other patterns in life. I started seeing the same people everyday when i walked outside and even when I went outside just randomly the pattern didn't stop. Then i started predicting what could happen the text day. What could someone say to me when they saw me. And to my bewilderment, they said the exact same thing. 

After few weeks, i noticed my friends always called me when i cut of the call with my gf. They called me for no particular reason. It sounded like an excuse everytime. And after a while I started to see that my gf texts someone when we're on video call. She makes me wait for 10-20 sec while she's on it. And then i would get a call and she would hang up saying that she need to go to bed or her mom called her and sometimes along the line.

My friends started telling me the same thing me and my gf talked about. They started acting suspicious and making jokes around me. I felt something shady is going on and i felt dumb for not knowing about it. After some time, i also started suspecting that my friends are texting me from my gf's account. I started analysing the body language and facial expressions while they type and started counting the keystrokes and space as i sat across them. And after sometime, my friends started making fun of me in every little way. I wasn't doing good and I couldn't sleep well and they stared making fun of the way i spoke, walked and the way i looked, squinting. At this point i hadn't shared about anything to them. I but the people who inspired me and hung out with me for 2 years treated me like I was never anyone to them. My girlfriend stopped picking up my calls and whenever we had a conversation she told me that she hated me. The entire reality shattered for me. I plunged into hell from the vintage of paradise in a matter of two weeks. 

I felt played, betrayed, and unintelligent. I wanted to talk to someone but I had no one who was serious with me all this time. I started communicating it with my gf and she had mixed responses. When i confessed that i felt like i am a bad person and I haven't been living up to the expectations of people around me, that i felt dumb and played and manupulated. She told me that i am dumb. The next day she texted me like nothing happened. As if i never said those things to her and she never asked me why i felt it. She texted me that she loves me and she cares about me when ever she wanted to change the topic. I felt my relationship wasn't real although i have been with her my entire life. I have been worh her for 7 years. She was my very first love and I never expected her to act like this. I felt like i never paid attention to anything that was having around me. As if i was living in a fool's paradise. I stated noticing these pattern alot and it gave me paranoia and anxiety attack to the point when i couldn't breathe. I spoke to my sister about my gf and turns out she shared every detail of my conversation with her. All the bad and the good thing i said about her in a state of paranoia. My gf staryed distancing herself. My friends started making fun of me in the most indirect way possible. It was clear to me that it was directed towards me. They said things like ""we have a cartoon character in our friends group"" and started laughing. I was the only one with a straight face. I loved my friends before, i helped them in every way possible. I helped them with assignment and financial matters. I made a presentation for them when I could even breathe properly. Actually they called me to make a presentation for them when i lost it all. I was questioning my self-worth, my identity. I didn't even know my name. It felt foreign and weird when they called me by my name. And even during these times, i helped them with the most purest intentions. Once i was making a presentation for my friend and i had a break down because if everything that's going on. I couldn't stop tears rolling off of my eyes but my friends didn't give a shit about me. They didn't even look at me. I stood up and left the room immediately. After few hours, i called q friend of mine to talk about my problem and after listening to everything I told him. He showed me the most paranormal clip of video i have ever seen. My heart was racing like never before but i kept a straight face with million thoughts racing on the back of my head, questioning my friendship and my inability to make friends, and deep and meaningful connection. I felt awful and i had no one around me. I felt so solipsistic that i saw no one around me about myslef. I felt like i was the only person in this plannet and went to bed with this thought for a month. I suspected that i was being spied on by my friends. They started talking about my internet search history and the videos i watched before meeting them. They did tell me to go to therapy. But they were to listening to everything i told my therapist. They talked about the color of my underwear and things i do inside my room. Everyone started acting suspicious around me and i couldn't understand why. My mental health statrted getting worse and my girl friend started texting me 30 a day always at the same time. It was like a schedule. I got sucuidal and wrote a poem about drowing and my gf asked me to drink water. That was the rock bottom for me. I didn't know what to feel. After four month of confusing my gf started calling me. I was getting better in my own but i had deep trust issues. I didn't get better but the situation was normalised i was in a constant state of paranoia, severly anxious and demotivated. I was in college so had to keep up with my course and exams and internship during this chaos. 

This is how it all started."

On top of this, a slightly more rigorous schedule. However, the average for Engineering Students is 16 credits/semester, I would have to do 18/per semester, so not all too different in the end.

Also, Im in the scholars program so that should make getting research opportunities much easier, as well as help me get to know professors well.

Ideally, I would do the ms at Stanford/Harvard/Princeton/MIT, otherwise, it would be better for me to just stay at Columbia and do the bs/ms combined program

\*The main reason for graduating a year early is financial. If I do it early I would get out with less than 20k, while, otherwise it would be 60 - 100k debt

I’m a business major who’s gonna be a senior next year, and I applied to a bunch of places and even got interviews, but I bombed all of them, and didn’t get a single offer for this summer. This is the second summer in a row that this has happened to me, I manage to get interviews at really good firms, then bomb my chances. My GPA is great, but obviously you’ll need more than just a GPA to get a job.

Now it feels like I’m not gonna be able to get any job when I graduate, which is incredibly vexing. I’m teaching myself software engineering in the hopes that I could maybe use that, but at this point it’s looking really bleak. My college’s location additionally makes me incredibly depressed, so I don’t feel like I could bear another year there just to get an internship for this summer.

And, for the record, I don’t really have any familial connections I could take advantage of. My parents are immigrants… so it really feels like I have no time left, because I don’t have much of a support system to rely on.

It's so upsetting to me- 
I got thrown out of the internship where I *wasn't* even paid for my work, I told my dad and he sounded so upset as well. i've been on edge the entirety of the weekend to the point of me sending my s/o away and literally leaving him on the sideroad (figuratively) because I was so down. 

i refused to talk to him, I can barely raise my voice at all. 
I'm starting to barely eat anything as well and, when i eat anything at all, I feel like I'm gonna puke it all up again. 

I might have been clean of selfharm for a while, but I have the feelin that it's not gonna stay this way for long anymore. I have the feeljng that i'm gonna do so much more bad to my body and it's frightening me. I'm frightening myself. 

It's all so scary and I'm afraid of growing up because of all these other people around me. 

People who glorify my severe depression and anxiety, my need for attention because I'm scared of being left alone in the dark, yet I dont want to be the center of attention. I *do* want recognition, but for what? 
what good did i give out to the world? nothing. 

I'm so bad at this shit that i cant even maintain my body in good shape. 

What happened to my dreams? My wants and Needs when i was a kid? I dreamed of owning a little café where i would sellf little pies and cookies together with some sweet drinks, or maybe if I did art I'd be happier?

Tw: mentioned method of self harm, not graffic.


I hate that i developed as stubborn idiot who doesn't accept his mistakes and wrongs in argument or in things i do, but at the same time a frail who can't stand for himself in social situations and constantly self-sabotaging, self-loathing, avoiding conflict at any cost, cuz it's so uncomfortable and when facing with the conflict either dissociate or open fight o' flight response. Moving from parents at age of 19? As if! I totally burnt myself out in *A MONTH*. And it was my fault. And at was a useful lesson, that ""healthy"" money will cone if yiu put enough effort, but not too much. Settings hopes too high, like ""my schedule is 8 hours, but if I'll work overtime I'll earn more and they'll like me"" won't do. I was never paid and was told all my time working was an unpaid internship sort of. I was so madly in love with working i burnt myself with matches to stay awake during shifts. I thought I'll make a lot of money if I'll put a lot of resources and time, but it was a mistake. I learned i have to passively sit in class and maintain my grades low enough so i won't seem like pet peeve and asked every time someone don't know the answer=need to study everyday, but high enough not to be a stupid kid, who you can call out at any moment and make fun of cuz you don't know ""obvious"" stuff. I thought it's a school thing only, but seems i have to go like this all my life, if i want my last 2 braincells to survive....and it's my fault, i accepted it! It's my fault i put myself all into work, it's my fault i didn't talk to director about my wage and overtime and how work operates in general(my college provided me with work and i thought the main conditions were already discussed, but seems like they left me alone to figure that out), and it's my fault to staying overtime in the first place. I can't build courage to say ""hey chef, you and i discusses this and it's my time to leave, so I'm cleaning and say byes, okay?"". **I can't say that.** At the previous job chef and cooks knew when they and i had to leave, cuz i was(and am still) a minor. But at this current (ex)job, chef knew i had to work 8 hours, she checked the clock during shift, saw there's 5-30min before i leave and she only tells me to leave when i overworked 1-2 hours. The longers i worked is 11 hours and i had to run, cuz i could skip the last bus home and walk for 3 hours by foot. Next time I'll establish my boundaries, salary and time. I understand now that burning myself out in the first month, when you have to get to know if they pay fairly or even pay at all, is stupid. I was told by friend and mother to stop working overtime and they just using me. People are nice, but I'm easily influenced by others moods and opinions and i knew  i was, so i wanted to think who's right. My mither said I'm just and idiot and they use me as a naive minor, at previous job she made ""jokes"" how my favourite cook i admired a lot didn't like me that much and didn't want me at our kitchen. She has a massive problem of attitudes. She may be saying something smart at times, but the finish it off with ""we'll see"", or argue with attitude of ""ur so stupid i can't"". It's never about parent's advice, it's never about she sees this situation, it's always bringing the point across with insensitive joke's and in general talking so annoyingly i can't take her seriously. My friend, on the other hand, having the same opinion, bring it across with logical argument and made me uncomfortable in a way ""yes...i guess you right, but i can't help it now I'm scared"" and not in a way ""you just want to humiliate me in the end, so I'll keep doing what i do, cuz it doesn't matter if I'll be in right or in the wrong, you'll humiliate me, and in future conversations you'll use my past mistakes to build the current and future argument"" like i feel with my mother. My mother makes comment about my weight. I'm overweight, 5-10 kg and I'm official obese. I'm aware of that, but she fails to understand her comments are no good and make me give up on myself even more. It seems like she fails to see I'm hurting. Yes, parents may not realise something bothering the child, and I'm that child who can keep it in. She always says I'm impulsive, even tho most impulses she sees are controlled in order to not burst. Most if the thought and feeling actually experience are represented till next rants or till i rage it out by myself. If i made an entry every time she made me mad, it'll seem I'm ungrateful. And i am. I hate her. I hate the fact when she or other people give me presents or praise me or talk good about me, i like them, but when I'm bad or fat, or did something wrong, i hate them as if I'm about to commit mass murder. Sometimes i even had an urge to hit her in the face so hard she'd pass out and just shut up, but i would rather harm myself then others, so that's never happened. And my mind just goes ""you ungrateful child"", ""no, she's actually a b_tch"", ""no, it's just you worthless"" back and forth and i can't help it. I hate feeling emotions, so much, but i crave them so much. I haven't cried properly since 15 maybe, i feel good and happy occasionally and whenever i feel huge stress, my brain erases the feeling at the end of the day and the next day it seems like it never happened. And sometimes i don't know if i actually felt the emotion at the time, or its just me making the memory of said emotion. No matter how much i talk, it never goes away, i never feel easy. Some people have the audacity to say i don't need therapist at this point, cuz therapist only for serious cases, and my problems can be solved by me without anyone's help. No. I can't. I don't feel like it. If i think i need help, that's the answer. 
Im not much hurt woth my father now, as i  am hurt about past. It's funny, how my father figure is a minecraft streamer(who knows knows), who is the completed opposite of my father - a bit more talktive, accepting of different people and sends positive vibes in general(and paints his nails! He's gorgeous handsome sir who gave me a push to explore my less ""traditional"" masculinity and i am so grateful for that). And here we go again with the presents. I hated my bday cuz i felt i gad to be alive cuz everybody bothered to buy me presents. Unlike mom, dad never speak to me. We don't greet at the morning, if we do talk, then it's chores/college only. I don't know his likes and dislikes, if he has friends or not, what he believes, his opinion. I don't like when people talk to me about college when i eat my dinner(mother does so), but i feel uncomfortable talking to him in generally. I feel like my chest wad squished by external force, it's hard to breathe. Not a panic attack, maybe anxiety attack. And it's not i did something bad - i just want to ask help with buying online! With my own money! Why am i nervous? But for some reasons it's like that every time. He doesn't know about me either - i don't like makeup and girly things, cuz I'm a trans guy, in closet that is, but was tomboy as long as i remember. He screamed at me cuz i didn't understand math and English very well, he was releasing his short temper on me, and my mother just took it as a meme. ""Regularly every other day all neighborhood was studying English with you guys"". She tried to say something sometimes, but really rarely and half-assed, as if it should be like that. I always cried in the end. If you don't understand - ask me. But when i actually said i don't understand he tried to hint and nit explain much and burst as i tried to at least guess the answer, or bursting as asked. Im really sensitive, so when i was told to say if something hurts and when i said my head hurt in the car due to smell and speed of the thing, i was told ""and what do you want me to do? We won't stop till we there"". I hate adults so muck i can't imagine i ever grow up. I feel like this will never heal, and I'm just stuck in thus misery.

 The more i grow and discover myself, the more i ask myself why they don't see their methods as wrong and harmful. I feel emotionally neglected, despite my parent always being near me. I feel at times the future is endless doom for me, with no way out. I want my therapist, but i can't let them know, cuz they will ask why i need it. And i don't want them in my business. I hope I'll end one way or another.

**TL;DR:** *I hate myself, have unhealthy work patterns(or whatever it is), my mother is a b_tch, from who i learned to ignore and avoid my problems, and my father taught me to repress my emotions, till i burst and make everyone and myself uncomfortable.*"
vi6dg1,1,2022-06-22,My first GF of 2.5 years doesn't feel like setting up with me after I found a job,KronenbourgThrowaway,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/vi6dg1/my_first_gf_of_25_years_doesnt_feel_like_setting/,"(using an old throwaway account for this)
I(M 23) live in France, in a town located about 40min away in public transport from the main city of the region, in a pretty small studio. While I don't mind living there, it gets pretty tight when my GF (F 25) visits me.
We are both very depressive people with low social skills and motivation, but we share this very similar bond which links us in personality and interests. I truly love her and she's my main source of motivation for what I want to do in the future.
For a really long time though, everytime she came over to my small appartment from Paris, she would mostly spend time on the bed, snoozing, watching her phone or straight up sleeping during the day. Our intimacy started to decay, as I told her I felt like her love for me seemed to decrease, or at least she didn't show it to me as much as she used to, while qi do still love her with all of my heart. Not taking it badly, she responded that the size and location of my appartment makes her really bored and unhappy, which might make her less happy to be here, meaning she has less energy to love, which I can understand, as she used to check different appartments often that would fit our condition more.

Fast forward to current month, and I now just started working a full-time job for the first time, my main motivation being to provide this more stable and pleasant life for her, which is really difficult for me as I've never worked besides some internships and a summer job.
However, a really sad news came recently, as she just learned that a really close friend of her died, which really impacted her in a lot of ways. Wanting to show her support, I tried to make her next visit the best she could have, even though she wasn't staying for too long.
Now, she arrived yesterday, and I made sure to do everything I could to make a day better and brighter, which worked really well, as she was responding nicely to everything I did for her. But after some time after returning to my appartment, she told me she doesn't actually want to live with me, at least yet, and she wants to take a break from visiting each other, but keep our relationship.

At that exact moment my heart shattered, she says she wants to first have less support from me so she has to work too and stop being dependant on someone, before feeling better and coming back to settle in. But I do not feel like that's the whole truth, as I really feel like her love for me has been decaying from lover to ""person I admire, but not in a romantical or erotic way"", and that the thought of us finally settling in a bigger and closer appartment would mean she has less way of leaving me if she doesn't feel like continuing the relationship.

Now, I am an extremely anxious person, so I might completely be wrong, but currently my only way of dealing with work stress is by motivating myself thinking of a brighter future for us, and hearing her say words like these truly made me feel ""way less loved"" than I thought, and just made my stress and anxiety level go through the roof, I had to hold tears even while going to and being at work, and I still don't know how to deal with this

I come from France but I am doing a dual degree in partnership with Lancaster University , where I do 2 years in France , in my business school and 2 years with the partner I have chosen(Lancaster uni in that case). 
Next Year will be my last year as an undergrad and my last year at Lancaster. I enjoyed so much the time I spent in the uk that i want to finish my study in the uk and, therefore complete a master degree in the Uk. 
I am really interested in the field of data science, as such i already did, during my undergrad two internship in data science (one as « assistant data scientist » and the last one as  « intern data scientist », both in big multinational corporation). I made my research on the related Masters and I discovered the MSc in data analytics in Warwick which looks interesting. I wanted to know if some people could share their experience regarding the application for the master degree and if with my background ( Dual degree BBA France and uk, and Optional modules in data mining and optimisations, being also part of a computer science society) I could expect to study in that university , as I know it is quite prestigious university.  I am really not familiar with the way the selection is made in the uk, so if people want to share their own experience with me , and give me some tips , it would be a great pleasure.

Ps: I also had 2 reference letters from my first internship and 1 from the last internship, i don’t know if this can enhance my application."

I got accepted to intern at University of Coimbra and University of Lisbon. 

I am really stuck between them. Both of their fields are very interesting to me.

At Lisbon I'll be with a research team and at Coimbra I'll be with a faculty member.

Both universities are ranked pretty well but Lisbon is always  ranked a bit higher. But I like the location and feel of Coimbra a bit better.

\-Is 200ish rank difference worth it to make a difference in grad admission?

\-Does working with a research team make a big difference than working with an individual professor?

PS: My university has a much lower ranking than these universities."

I am assigned a **TECHNICAL phone interview** with Google, but I have some silly questions about it as I have never dealt with Google before.

1. Is the technical phone interview conducted via the PHONE? Do they call me on the phone and then ask me to solve algorithmic questions verbally? Or will they give a link ahead to where I will write the code, and they will see it?
2. What environment will I write code in? Does it look like in the OA? Will I be able to compile code there to test my test cases? 
3. What are the possible algorithmic questions? Do they ask for operating systems/math questions?
4. Should I prepare for algorithmic questions only?
5. Is ""LeetCode Premium Google Questions"" enough to prepare for possible algorithmic questions?
6. Are there any behavioral questions? 

If you have experienced this type of interview for the Google 2022 Fall Internship, could you share your experience? 

Thank you!"

Apart from this, I have a masters degree in Cybersecurity. However, the job market hasn’t been kind to me as I’m only getting internship roles (previous experience: 6 months help desk and 3 months as an infosec trainee which will end this month). My focus is to work in security, and I know it’s difficult to land a security role without relevant experience. I have been applying for every IT related job though, be it help desk, entry level networking, L1 soc, etc. 

I thought of going for CCNA as it’s heavily respected by employers. I finished watching the videos and took some practice tests. I can honestly see a lot of overlap with Network+ (apart from Cisco CLI commands of course). Now I’m wondering if I should pay for CCNA, or keep trying for entry level roles and hope for the best. Eventually, I can try for more security certs like CySA+/PenTest+/CISM/CISSP.

Thanks for your opinions!"

viaw34,4,2022-06-22,My experience so far in my first IT job; from hobby to job,racegeek93,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/viaw34/my_experience_so_far_in_my_first_it_job_from/,"I apologize if this is the wrong place to post this. 

I started as a enthusiast in 2012 and really didn’t get deep into computers until 2017. I did my first upgrade on my tower which was ram and a GPU. I was a gamer as the kids would say. I decided that my job was making me want to run head first into a wall because it was unfulfilling and pointless for myself. It was machine operator, manufacturing type stuff. I also had some schooling and job experience welding which I still enjoy doing but don’t have anywhere to do that for fun without starting something on fire. 

The end of 2018 rolls around and I was doing some studying on my own and lost on where to start really. CompTIA was in my sights but I struggled with it because reading a book and memorizing things isn’t my jam. I was doing hands on stuff which I didn’t realize then was a home lab. Some light virtualization and other odds and ends. By the end of the year I made the decision to go into cyber security at a local tech school. 

My first semester was spring 2019, which I don’t recommend starting in the spring but I was impatient. Fast forward a year and I did my first internship. I didn’t learn much there except on getting yelled at for downloading freeware to monitor my laptop because it was getting hot enough that it would start to burn.

Fast forward to now and I’m still going to school and got my first IT job at a small company as the one and only IT person. I was nervous at first because it would take all the things that I learned and forgot to get this company up to speed on how a business should operate. 

I have built out the network and using best practice as much as possible using a radius server and soon adding MAC address filtering.  Built and installed a AD, DC, DNS servers (using virtualization). Getting everyone on the Domain. While waiting for parts I was doing some scanning and enumeration on the network to see if there was any low hanging fruit which I did.

My point is of this post is that the field of IT is wide and ever expanding. Choosing Cyber security has forced me into learning a lot of different IT things. Because of that I am a Jack of all trades but not a master at one. That line has been known to a lot of people but it turns out that it is not the whole quote. 

“A Jack of all trades is a master of none, but often times better than a master of one. “ -Shakespeare 

This is very true in my experience. I am not good at one thing. I can do a lot of different things that are good enough to get me by and continue to learn on the job. 

I want to thank the community, my instructors, podcasts and all of the YouTubers that give away the knowledge either cheaply or even free in order to better myself. Don’t give up and always look to learn new things.  There is no single path that is right in this field."

I would like to take a class about networking (I'll just use one of my electives) in Fall at the college and maybe another in Winter, studying for CCNA as well in my free time (I'll check the resources in more depth from the wiki later). I wanted to do IT remotely, if it's possible to even get an entry level job remote. will companies demand in-person for entry level or will they accept remote next year?

I understand they want experience, that makes sense, I have none. I will ask the college system if they have any intern or work program for this. 

my plan was; take classes at college (i need 40 more credits for aa, then i transfer and get bachelors at some point, not sure what to do with that so i wanted to try IT for at least a few years); while doing degree, take ccna and start applying to every IT job i see remotely or locally (not there are more than one or two available locally at a time, but maybe they just aren't posting it on indeed... we're an island though so not getting my hopes up). i don't think the college will be a big help here because there has to be jobs to find jobs? but maybe they have internal IT student that i can try, idk, id be ok with being helpdesk as long as it counts as exp for getting that remote it job at some point

I made the mistake of saying I wanted to learn more about how to do something but in all honesty I really suck at it. I sit at my desk and try to understand stuff but most of it is over my head. It's getting so discouraging that yesterday I almost got up and walked out. It's only week three and I can already see that things are going to continue to go downhill. It's not that I don't have resources and people to ask, it's me, I simply cannot understand half of the stuff they're asking me to do and I certainly don't understand the technical side of it. How the fuck I made it this far in engineering is beyond me. I'm frustrated every day, it's hard to even get out of bed to bring myself to work. I'm actually embarrassed because the other interns seem to be having a ball and getting by. I'm the only one that's struggling. I have a deadline to reach and I'm absolutely crumbling. This is a harsh sign of how I'm gonna be in the actual work place.

I told a mentor that I wanted to quit and asked about the process and she said it hurt her feelings that I wanted to leave. I know it might burn bridges and it might take me a while to recover since I have no experience but I have to raise the white flag. I already have a feeling that they won't offer me a full time position at this rate because I'm basically scamming this company. I've been suffering behind engineering for so long, I am so tired.

Should I write an official resignation letter? Has anyone else left an internship before?"

i have adhd so as a child i would always get labeled as the “bright but inattentive / lazy” student

still i was getting pretty good grades throughout primary &amp; middle school, then my parents stopped having as much of a grip on my education. i also started experiencing my first depressive &amp; dissociative symptoms. i was becoming progressively more &amp; more apathetic towards school. i also started exhibiting signs of queerness that i got bullied for (i’m assigned male at birth and transitioning to female, so around that time i was read as like an effeminate gay boy). the bullying made me isolate and develop social anxiety so i never talked to anyone in high school except for a couple of close friends that seemed interested enough in me to get me out of my shell.

i also gout outed pretty early in my teens so all throughout high school my parents were verbally &amp; sometimes physically abusing me for being transgender, kicked me out a couple of times, cut off the internet for months and took my phone, didn’t give any money and grounded me, etc etc 

this made my mental health go even more downhill, and with it came my academic performance. i barely did anything at all, cut class, never handed in paperwork, etc. etc. 

i do have a kind of natural charm that made adults have a soft spot towards me + a lot of the teachers knew about my family situation and my mental state, so that helped me get through HS, but i really barely managed to graduate.

i didn’t go to uni right away because i wanted to get in a better headspace, gain more independence from my toxic parents &amp; start transitioning medically. 

i worked in customer service for a while, sucked at it because anxiety + sloppiness + adhd

then managed to get an unpaid internship at an (independent, not propaganda) tv channel (i’ve always wanted to be a journalist) that was going pretty well, i could even get hired eventually w nice salary too, but i fucked up and decided to stop showing up because of some stupid ass made up excuse. the underlying reasoning was my anxiety acting up &amp; telling me i’m not good or qualified enough to do the job. 

see this is what always happens. i can’t tell you how many opportunities i’ve wasted because of a combination of laziness, impostor syndrome, anxiety, getting bored quickly and not being able to do things on time cuz of adhd

i got a lot of chances that seemed like miracles: i could study abroad, write a piece on something that actually interests me for my favorite fucking magazine ever and get paid a lot for it, participate in cool projects etc. etc. etc.

but i always either get scared &amp; back off 

or procrastinate on doing things until it’s too late and turn people away from me 

i used to have quite a few close friends.  mostly short-lived intense friendships that often ended because i wasn’t a reliable friend. i forget birthdays, i can disappear for months, i can be super fucking late unintentionally, which people interpret as not caring enough about them but in reality i always care a lot. i now only have one \*actually\* good friend and she lives in another city, the last one i had here in Moscow i cut off just this week because he’s genuinely the asshole for once. i have acquaintances i talk to quite often, a bit of an audience on social media, i’m generally a likeable person, but i feel so empty all the time that it’s hard to form a meaningful connection. 

i realize i’m this horrible at everything due to mental conditions but i can’t keep making this excuse, its not my fault i have it but it’s within my power to work on myself instead of always playing the victim and wallowing in self-pity. 

right now it’s summer, i haven’t had a job in months, the last one i quit after getting cheated on and going through a rough breakup that made me bed-ridden for a while.i just came back from a neighboring  country where i spent 3 months (escaped i was speaking out against  because of the Ukraine invasion, got detained at protests etc.) i thought it was going to be a nice opportunity for a fresh start, but i couldn’t find my place there, my anxiety was also so bad that i felt panicky every time i went outside, tried to go to gatherings but literally couldn’t muster up the energy to speak to anyone. had a brief fling that ended up with them ghosting me. so most of the time i spent inside the cheapest room i could rent, sleeping 10+ hours a day, barely eating anything because i had no money and doing the tiniest bit of remote english tutoring that helped me survive. 

i came back because it was relatively safe for me to do so. i really missed Moscow and didn’t feel needed or welcome abroad. i don’t know what to do with my life - i can’t get an in-person job because my ID says “male” and i look &amp; sound like a woman even if i try to butch it up. employers in Russia aren’t exactly accepting of trans people. changing the gender marker costs a lot of money and i would obviously need to have a job to save up for it, so there’s a vicious circle. 

food delivery is an option, there’s apps you can download &amp; just take orders. you don’t need to go to interviews or anything, you’re basically self-employed. but the thought of dealing with rude/transphobic customers makes me scared, for some reason even the smallest micro-aggression really unsettles me. like im fortunate enough to pass well but they would still see the male name on the app.

i can’t get a job that’s not customer service because i don’t have much experience in anything else, or a degree. 

i got into college for journalism but idek if i should go since all of the independent media outlets in my country got shut down after the war started, and the only option is working for propaganda or writing about something completely unrelated to politics, which i don’t feel passionate about. 

the apartment i’m renting is a constant mess, i never have energy to clean at all,

my past roommates literally hate me for that. 

my health is bad. i have gastritis &amp; gerd and i still don’t maintain a diet because i’m too depressed to cook and the only takeout i can afford is kfc or burger king. 

i’m tired all the time, my brain feels like mush, idk if its permanent damage or just a result of my lifestyle but i’ve been catching myself making dumbass spelling mistakes &amp; slurring my words. 

i stopped taking any kind of care of myself. its really gross but i only manage to shower or brush my teeth like once a week, i haven’t done laundry in months, my face is covered in acne because i’m not even bothered to wash it. i lost a lot of weight cuz i couldn’t afford to eat like i mentioned above, so that made my face really skinny which highlights my somewhat masculine bone structure and makes me wanna cry. i still pass to strangers on the streets and acquittances i’ve asked say they haven’t noticed a change but i just don’t feel like i look anything like a girl at all anymore. dysphoria is hard. 

i’m just so tired of living like this, the pain is unbearable. 

every area of my life is fucked, career, relationships, health, etc etc

 there’s so many things wrong with me that i don’t even know where to start fixing myself. 

i’ve gone on countless “self improvement streaks” but they all end up with me going back to my old atrocious lifestyle. i don’t have the willpower and it also seems like i’m just making small cosmetic changes to the house while the roof is leaking. 

i know i’m not the worst, i’m quite smart naturally, well rounded even though i have many gaps in my education, my english isn’t bad for a non-native speaker, i’m a good writer in my language. others tell me i’m funny. my voice is nice and i’ve been told to pursue voice acting a few times. i have surface level interest in a lot of stuff but i don’t have fundamental knowledge about anything because nothing interests me for long enough.

i just don’t know what to do, everything new terrifies me and i always feel like i’ll fail. because of how things went in the past. i just know i fuck everything up. 

i don’t feel like a good person anymore because i’ve hurt a lot of people due to my irresponsibility. 

idk how to crawl out of this rut i’ve gotten myself into and looking at people my age doesn’t help, some of the people i went to school with are literally like business owners now, and im entering my 20s having accomplished nothing.

i don’t feel like a good person anymore because i’ve hurt a lot of people with my actions, even though unwillingly.  

idk how to get out of this rut i’ve gotten myself into and looking at people my age doesn’t help, some of the people i went to school with are literally like business owners now, and im entering my 20s having accomplished nothing.

i’m posting on here because idk where else to get unbiased advice, my friends &amp; acquaintances tell me it’s ok and i’ll figure it out and that they like me anyway, they’re way too soft on me 

while my parents just keep insulting me and saying i’ve already wasted my life and it’s too late to change anything, which doesn’t help either lol.

i need advice on how to make changes and actually stick to them this time, and on what to do with my education/ career. 

i’ve been thinking of just ending things a lot, but even with this i feel like i’ll fail because i’ve had unsuccessful attempts in the past. and i don’t wanna end up in the men’s ward at the mental hospital again."

I tapped my clipboard as I looked up at Earl.

""So...Earl?"" I faked a confused look.

""What's your credentials"" I said looking back at my workstation

I couldn't help but to smile a little. I knew so much more than he could even imagine.

""Ehm, I-I"" he said with a slight stutter

""I used to work with nuclear reactors and I've had an internship for the past year at an atomic research facility"" He continued.

I smiled again and turned around.

""No no, not professional credentials"" I said shaking my head.

""What do you do in your spare time?"" I asked with a smile again.

""W-What?"" Earl smiled and slightly chuckled

""I'm not sure I follow,"" He said, looking at me with a slight smile.

I smiled back and looked at him with a serious face before that face turned into a faked hopeless smile

""I have no choice you've convinced me"" I said shaking my head and waving my hands in the sky.

""You're Hired!"" I said pointing a finger at him in a joking matter.

""Oh..Alright? No actual questions?"" He said with a surprised look.

""What do you mean? I've learned everything I need to know already"" I said with a serious face.

""I got everything setup in the lab for you"" I told him, ushering him out of the office.

We took a walk through the facility and I showed him around all the rooms he'll soon come to know. My thoughts drifted away as I started to ask myself what I'm doing. I started to doubt the career choice I'd made going here. I miss the simple life I thought before I heard someone calling my name.

""Paul! Paul!"" I hear Miranda call.

""What's up?"" I gestured for Earl to stay.

""How's he looking?"" Miranda asked, glancing over to Earl.

""He's a good kid"" I said with a smile of remembrance.

""Alright she said, So what do you think? Should we hire him?"" She asked. She looked like she didn't like him that much.

""I already did,'' I said"" Smiling back.

""He might save your life one day!"" I said with a smirk.

""I highly doubt it, but alright"" She said with a chuckle before going back to the nursery.

I walked back to Earl and continued with the tour. We talked about old television shows we watched when we were young as we made our way through the long corridors.

""This place needs some white walls,"" He said while looking around the rooms.

I laughed a little before I finally spoke.

""Yeah sure Earl, I trust your judgment"" I said looking down at the floor with that same thankful smile.

You see I haven’t known Earl for very long but I knew I could trust him. I mean he did save both mine and Miranda’s life after all. So that counts as something good in my books. 

A few hours went by and I got no work done. I just stared around the room not thinking about anything besides the past days.

""Why do I do this again?"" I thought to myself as I scratched my head.

""Sure It's cool and all but I'm not up for this shit"" I continued to myself.

I stood up and started walking back and forth in the room.

""I'm going to quit"" I stopped as I thought it.

I walked quickly over to a cupboard I had in the corner of the lab. I picked up a notepad and started writing.

""Hey Earl. I can't do this anymore. I need to get away from this stuff but trust me. You'll fit right in. That's why I'm giving you full control of this project and everything that we've established so far. Everything you need to know is in the laptop and if you have any problems with Miranda, Tell her I told you it was fine, Alright? Anyway, We'll meet one day and I will tell you how everything went. But all you need to know is that I won't know you, I won't recognize you. That's all you need to know. God's speed friend, I owe you my life.

//Your friend Paul""

That's what the note said. I ripped it off the notepad and unlocked my laptop. I quickly wrote out a message and sent it to Miranda.

""I'm sorry, but I can't do this. I'm putting Earl in control of this project and you must trust me. If you do not let Earl work on this thing I'll be dead and so will you. So listen to me carefully. He's the key to time travel, He's the one that will invent it I know it. I can't tell you how I know I don't have time, you just have to trust me. Good luck old friend, I wish you the best."" I pressed send before leaving my laptop in the lab with the note attached to it folded in half.

Right as I was about to walk out of the lab I met Earl in the doorway. He had a look of confusion and concern as he looked at me and then at the laptop, then back at me again.

""You good there boss?"" He asked with a raised eyebrow.

""yeah yeah, I'm alright I'm just hungry, are you hungry?"" I said with a stressed voice.

""Come let's get something to eat!"" I said, dragging him along towards the dining hall.

""Oh shit I almost forgot"" I said to Earl, He turned around as we approached the dining hall.

""I need to do something!"" I said turning around.

Earl looked at me strangely but he let me leave.

I walked hasty towards the stairs that led to the exit. When I reached the stairs I walked up them trying to look as normal as I could.

""Good day fellas"" I said bowing my head slightly to the guards standing at the exit.

""Good day, Paul"" The right guard said with a slight nod.

I opened the door to the exit and walked over to my car. I started it up and drove off. I drove for I don't know how long before I came out to a small town gas station. I filled my tank up and continued to drive off. I drove for hours upon hours before I finally arrived at my destination. My old warehouse...

You see I'm writing this from my old desk where I once conducted business and I feel like I need to explain some realizations that I've come to know recently. First of all let me clear up some things about Jakob. You know how in part 4 of this story one of the hypotheses was that time travel basically only splits the timeline in 2 equally probable outcomes of an action. You see I now know why I recognized Jakob. Jakob isn't really Jakob. He's, well, me. But older and from one of the timelines where I hold a grudge against Miranda for dragging me into this mess. A grudge big enough for me to travel back in time to kill Miranda before we had the ability to invent time travel. I mean It's my best guess and I think I'm not far off sadly.

Another thing that I want to clear up is why I even write this. Well I had too. If I didn't, the future wouldn’t turn out as it’s supposed to. So now you might understand why this all has happened and I will give you the pleasure of knowing my real name, I mean I don’t exist anymore anyway. Miranda made sure of that. So let me tell you a dead man’s tale.

My name’s Charlie, Charlie North. I’m still a dark-web courier, and these were my stories."
vidtf4,1,2022-06-22,"adhd + depression + anxiety ruining my life, idk how to start improving myself",amazingalmond,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/vidtf4/adhd_depression_anxiety_ruining_my_life_idk_how/,"so i’m 20 years old and i’m the worst fucking mess of a  person i know + i live in Russia and i’m transgender with a bunch of  other factors that make it hard to function. i feel stuck, hopeless,  suicidal at times. i don’t think i’ll ever succeed in life. 

i have adhd so as a child i would always get labeled as the “bright but inattentive / lazy” student

still  i was getting pretty good grades throughout primary &amp; middle  school, then my parents stopped having as much of a grip on my  education. i also started experiencing my first depressive &amp;  dissociative symptoms. i was becoming progressively more &amp; more  apathetic towards school. i also started exhibiting signs of queerness  that i got bullied for (i’m assigned male at birth and transitioning to  female, so around that time i was read as like an effeminate gay boy).  the bullying made me isolate and develop social anxiety so i never  talked to anyone in high school except for a couple of close friends  that seemed interested enough in me to get me out of my shell.

i  also gout outed pretty early in my teens so all throughout high school  my parents were verbally &amp; sometimes physically abusing me for being  transgender, kicked me out a couple of times, cut off the internet for  months and took my phone, didn’t give any money and grounded me, etc  etc 

this made my mental health go even more downhill, and with  it came my academic performance. i barely did anything at all, cut  class, never handed in paperwork, etc. etc. 

i do have a kind of  natural charm that made adults have a soft spot towards me + a lot of  the teachers knew about my family situation and my mental state, so that  helped me get through HS, but i really barely managed to graduate.

i  didn’t go to uni right away because i wanted to get in a better  headspace, gain more independence from my toxic parents &amp; start  transitioning medically. 

i worked in customer service for a while, sucked at it because anxiety + sloppiness + adhd

then  managed to get an unpaid internship at an (independent, not propaganda)  tv channel (i’ve always wanted to be a journalist) that was going  pretty well, i could even get hired eventually w nice salary too, but i  fucked up and decided to stop showing up because of some stupid ass made  up excuse. the underlying reasoning was my anxiety acting up &amp;  telling me i’m not good or qualified enough to do the job. 

see  this is what always happens. i can’t tell you how many opportunities  i’ve wasted because of a combination of laziness, impostor syndrome,  anxiety, getting bored quickly and not being able to do things on time  cuz of adhd

i got a lot of chances that seemed like miracles: i  could study abroad, write a piece on something that actually interests  me for my favorite fucking magazine ever and get paid a lot for it,  participate in cool projects etc. etc. etc.

but i always either get scared &amp; back off 

or procrastinate on doing things until it’s too late and turn people away from me 

i  used to have quite a few close friends.  mostly short-lived intense  friendships that often ended because i wasn’t a reliable friend. i  forget birthdays, i can disappear for months, i can be super fucking  late unintentionally, which people interpret as not caring enough about  them but in reality i always care a lot. i now only have one  \\\*actually\\\* good friend and she lives in another city, the last one i  had here in Moscow i cut off just this week because he’s genuinely the  asshole for once. i have acquaintances i talk to quite often, a bit of  an audience on social media, i’m generally a likeable person, but i feel  so empty all the time that it’s hard to form a meaningful connection. 

i  realize i’m this horrible at everything due to mental conditions but i  can’t keep making this excuse, its not my fault i have it but it’s  within my power to work on myself instead of always playing the victim  and wallowing in self-pity. 

right now it’s summer, i haven’t had  a job in months, the last one i quit after getting cheated on and going  through a rough breakup that made me bed-ridden for a while.i just came  back from a neighboring  country where i spent 3 months (escaped i was  speaking out against  because of the Ukraine invasion, got detained at  protests etc.) i thought it was going to be a nice opportunity for a  fresh start, but i couldn’t find my place there, my anxiety was also so  bad that i felt panicky every time i went outside, tried to go to  gatherings but literally couldn’t muster up the energy to speak to  anyone. had a brief fling that ended up with them ghosting me. so most  of the time i spent inside the cheapest room i could rent, sleeping 10+  hours a day, barely eating anything because i had no money and doing the  tiniest bit of remote english tutoring that helped me survive. 

i  came back because it was relatively safe for me to do so. i really  missed Moscow and didn’t feel needed or welcome abroad. i don’t know  what to do with my life - i can’t get an in-person job because my ID  says “male” and i look &amp; sound like a woman even if i try to butch  it up. employers in Russia aren’t exactly accepting of trans people.  changing the gender marker costs a lot of money and i would obviously  need to have a job to save up for it, so there’s a vicious circle. 

food  delivery is an option, there’s apps you can download &amp; just take  orders. you don’t need to go to interviews or anything, you’re basically  self-employed. but the thought of dealing with rude/transphobic  customers makes me scared, for some reason even the smallest  micro-aggression really unsettles me. like im fortunate enough to pass  well but they would still see the male name on the app.

i can’t get a job that’s not customer service because i don’t have much experience in anything else, or a degree. 

i  got into college for journalism but idek if i should go since all of  the independent media outlets in my country got shut down after the war  started, and the only option is working for propaganda or writing about  something completely unrelated to politics, which i don’t feel  passionate about. 

the apartment i’m renting is a constant mess, i never have energy to clean at all,

my past roommates literally hate me for that. 

my  health is bad. i have gastritis &amp; gerd and i still don’t maintain a  diet because i’m too depressed to cook and the only takeout i can  afford is kfc or burger king. 

i’m tired all the time, my brain  feels like mush, idk if its permanent damage or just a result of my  lifestyle but i’ve been catching myself making dumbass spelling mistakes  &amp; slurring my words. 

i stopped taking any kind of care of  myself. its really gross but i only manage to shower or brush my teeth  like once a week, i haven’t done laundry in months, my face is covered  in acne because i’m not even bothered to wash it. i lost a lot of weight  cuz i couldn’t afford to eat like i mentioned above, so that made my  face really skinny which highlights my somewhat masculine bone structure  and makes me wanna cry. i still pass to strangers on the streets and  acquittances i’ve asked say they haven’t noticed a change but i just  don’t feel like i look anything like a girl at all anymore. dysphoria is  hard. 

i’m just so tired of living like this, the pain is unbearable. 

every area of my life is fucked, career, relationships, health, etc etc

 there’s so many things wrong with me that i don’t even know where to start fixing myself. 

i’ve  gone on countless “self improvement streaks” but they all end up with  me going back to my old atrocious lifestyle. i don’t have the willpower  and it also seems like i’m just making small cosmetic changes to the  house while the roof is leaking. 

i know i’m not the worst, i’m  quite smart naturally, well rounded even though i have many gaps in my  education, my english isn’t bad for a non-native speaker, i’m a good  writer in my language. others tell me i’m funny. my voice is nice and  i’ve been told to pursue voice acting a few times. i have surface level  interest in a lot of stuff but i don’t have fundamental knowledge about  anything because nothing interests me for long enough.

i just  don’t know what to do, everything new terrifies me and i always feel  like i’ll fail. because of how things went in the past. i just know i  fuck everything up. 

i don’t feel like a good person anymore because i’ve hurt a lot of people due to my irresponsibility. 

idk  how to crawl out of this rut i’ve gotten myself into and looking at  people my age doesn’t help, some of the people i went to school with are  literally like business owners now, and im entering my 20s having  accomplished nothing.

i’m posting on here because idk where else  to get unbiased advice, my friends &amp; acquaintances tell me it’s ok  and i’ll figure it out and that they like me anyway, they’re way too  soft on me 

while my parents just keep insulting me and saying  i’ve already wasted my life and it’s too late to change anything, which  doesn’t help either lol.

i need advice on how to make changes and actually stick to them this time, and on what to do with my education/ career. 

i’ve  been thinking of just ending things a lot, but even with this i feel  like i’ll fail because i’ve had unsuccessful attempts in the past. and i  don’t wanna end up in the men’s ward at the mental hospital again."
vieydw,1,2022-06-22,Can't forget her,Arrow0717,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/vieydw/cant_forget_her/,She was an classmate in my college for a first two years I have never spoken that much with her but she and my friend are very close. My friend often teases me with her but never really cared that much. Then I had a chance to work together with her as an intern so we talked so much in those period that how we became best friends She and I really got close. I never knew that time I got feelings for her. After the intern period we went to college for a final year and I was normal. But when the lockdown got imposed for first time it really changes everything. She and I never really talked in lockdown and I really got hurt. That's when I realized how important she was to me. I tried to talk but she avoided me but I tried relentlessly. After a while I found she also got feeling for me that's why she wants to avoid me. I confronted her she says its true but and also asked me to forget about her. I got angry and avoided all the contact with her. She didn't contact me at all after that. But I cannot forget about her My last relationship gotten bad because of it. I tried talking again she talked like a stranger to me. I couldn't feel the connection with her. Now even though I talk with her it hurts Its like I have been constantly thinking about her not being able to forget. I don't know how to move on from here.
vifcf9,2,2022-06-22,Work Assessment,slurpadurpblurp,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/vifcf9/work_assessment/,"Hello,

I was recently invited to take an assessment as part of the selection process for a Mainframe Software Engineer Intern position that I had applied for at a bank. This would be my first internship related to CS so I'm pretty excited, but I'm a little worried about the assessment itself.

There is no info in the initial email about what the assessment is about (only dates and times to take it), so I was wondering if anybody has been in a similar situation.

From scrolling this subreddit, I know companies like to do coding assessments and whatnot. I am wondering if you guys think this assessment will be similar? Each time slot is two hours long. If so, this would be my first coding assessment and I am wondering how I should prepare. Would an assessment for mainframe differ from other areas of software engineering?

Thanks for any help."
viff49,1,2022-06-22,Phone screen tips?,Missing_Back,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/viff49/phone_screen_tips/,"I have a 30m phone screen next week and I'm trying to get prepared for it. As I understand it, this isn't a technical thing so all my LCing won't help here. 

Concerns:

- I hate phone calls in general, and especially something like this I'll be nervous, and I'm worried by voice won't be as steady as it should be, which would suck because that's all the interviewer will be going off of.

- It's an internship (listing said Fall 2022/Spring 2023) and I'm still in school, but it says full-time in person in a different state. Not sure how that would work. Would I be able to afford moving for a brief stint, would I need to take purely online classes, etc

- The job seems to be pretty low-level and in the embedded side of things. This isn't something I know much about, but I have been really interested in learning more about this side of programming recently. 

How do I do my best in the phone screen given these concerns?"
vig7hh,12,2022-06-22,Scared and nervous about the future. Any advice ?,Cookies_n_Cream33,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/vig7hh/scared_and_nervous_about_the_future_any_advice/,"I’m 21 years old and female if that matters. After a lot of introspection and ruminating on what I should do as a career and what degree I’ll pursue, I still feel scared and nervous about the unknown- the future after I graduate.

I started out in community college on the pre-nursing track and I got into the nursing program after 2 years, getting my general associates degree in the process. It was hard but I thought it was worth it if I could still pass and finish (getting Cs right on the cutoff to pass) until I couldn’t even barely pass. It only got more difficult and I tried to keep going until I couldn’t anymore. It was a lot of stress and pressure. I stopped and realized I was not interested in anything. Nursing was the only career in the healthcare field I wanted originally due to the stability and taking care of others. Since I was so set on Nursing, I didn’t do any internships or extracurriculars during this time. I thought I was set.

Now, I’ve looked at other majors and careers that are profitable and they all deal with hard math and sciences. My talents lie in English and writing, yet this is what most say isn’t profitable at all. I’ve taken an interest in technical writing as a career since it deals with English, writing, and technology. Computer Science is another difficult degree that deals with advanced math, and I cannot fail again. I settled on computer science as a minor, but I’ve learned employers don’t even look minors. 

I don’t want to find myself in a position where I can’t have a real career after I graduate. But it seems like a real possibility and I’m definitely scared."
vig81c,8,2022-06-22,Finding Your Niche?,ChaneyChonga,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/vig81c/finding_your_niche/,"Hey all, So I've been thinking lately about finding my niche in my CS career. I'm on my second internship working with devices and generally QA. This is not my passion as I found out by working, but I am doing it to get my foot in the door of this industry. Thinking about it now, there so much tech out there, cybersecurity, web dev, mobile dev, game dev, blockchain, low-level os, etc. And I do really kick myself for not doing more exploring in college (I'm graduating soon). Anyway I do realize its not too late to learn these things and I should just start now by picking one, but I have a few questions to ask the community:

1. What tech do you enjoy? What tech do you hate?
2. How long did it take you to find what you enjoy?
3. Any recommendations on what I should explore first? (I'm really open to anything, try to convince me)
4. Is it enough to do the basics of a tech and, if you don't like it, then move on? Or is it more like, the more you know of something/the better you are, the more you will like it? I personally feel you don't really know what something is like until you have spent many many hours beyond the basics.

Thanks for thoughts in advanced!"

vijf7k,1,2022-06-22,Nothing is going right,True_Button_6644,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/vijf7k/nothing_is_going_right/,"Warning: this is a long rant as I just need an outlet 

I'm wanting to break into IT or tech or business.. something like that based on my previous internships. I'm searching for an entry level job in ANYTHING in these fields. Applying on LinkedIn left and right, nonstop for two days straight, hoping to find anyone to give me a chance, hundreds of jobs. I'm applying for the simplest roles, like data entry. Yet, all of the jobs that get back to me are either MLMs or Indian scam agencies. For example, today I was excited to interview with someone who, at first, i thought was a small business owner. I get to the interview having practiced, nervous, and turns out it's an ORIENTATION for a TRAVEL AGENCY. On how to ""become your own boss"" within their agency, but really it's a huge scam where they take your money for using their ""agency"" as a parent. The position i applied for was a customer service representative.

 Then, i get a text from another recruiter who had previously contacted me. They ask if I'm *insert my full name.* I say yes and thank them for getting back to me. Then, they try to register a Google voice number with my phone number and ask me to send them the verification code from Google to ""confirm my identity. Blocked. I'm guessing they run a scam agency somewhere abroad and that they sell these google voice numbers of legitimate U.S. numbers or they use them for themselves to send spam messages to try to scam people. Then a bunch of other recruiters are contacting me from companies I've never heard of, and they're all huge scams once I research a bit more.

This job market is incredibly disheartening. I've been hearing about people quitting in masses, but seems like all the legitimate positions in companies are filled up. I went to my local Kohls today, and even they're not hiring. Why is this? Where is the huge worker shortage I was hearing about?

I just can't believe, for someone with 3 internship experiences and 1 position as a website developer at a small company, that it's so hard to find an entry level position?? I'll take anything at this point. If you or anyone you know needs any entry level position on tech or business be to filled, please send me a message.

Also, what websites are best to find real legit jobs? I'm looking on LinkedIn so far, and I've probably applied to every entry level position involving the keyword ""data."""

Just a couple of things about me before I start my rant: I hate lying, I hate writing resumes and looking for jobs (it would be my personal hell if one existed), I get very anxious about things that might or might not happen, I am smart and learn very quickly, but at the same time very insecure, I am a procrastinating perfectionist.

This is going to be a long read. Sorry.

So if you don't mind, I'll tell my story from the beginning. I moved to the US when I was 22 right after graduating with BS (bullshit) degree from my eastern European country. I worked fashion retail for 2 years where I was bullied, then took a job at a dental office because I didn't think I was good enough for corp jobs. Then I went to school in NYC for a second BS in fashion business. I graduated when I was 29. In my last semester I got a paid internship in sourcing, though it was not my dream career path: I wanted to be in buying, or better, marketing. But I took it. I was quickly promoted to assistant ahead of other interns, and only after a couple of months one of the directors pushed me to have an interview with her former colleagues at a very well known American luxury fashion brand. I got a position as an associate in apparel production right away. I was moving quickly and was happy, though it was not my preferred role. I figured with them on my resume, I can get a job I like afterwards. I worked there for 3 years. It was not horrible, but still quite shitty. The promotions were given to suck ups, the whole corporate politics and the fact that I was called into HR because I took an extra unpaid day off two years in a row, made me really hate it. Though for some reason I now wish to be back. Haha. Then in my 3rd year my department moved to NJ from NYC. It was a 4 hour commute daily for me, plus I got pregnant and after maternity leave I left the company. I was a SHM for 2 years  and I didn't keep myself up to date in the industry contrary to popular career advice.

So after 2 years at home I started looking for a job again. And it was hard. Due to my aforementioned hate for job search , I took on the first offer I got at a small textile firm. My son was always sick in day care and they didn't allow me to work from home, taking my PTO and then taking it from the next year when it ran out. They suggested I get a babysitter, but we could not afford one on top of the daycare, plus where can you find one for just once in a while. I quit after 10 ms, it was January 2020. So they all went to WFH 2 ms later. Joke's on me and them. Then in September I finally got an offer for contract job at another major fashion company. I worked remotely, my boss was awesome, she had a small child of her own, so she knew the struggle. She pushed for me to get hired permanently, but the execs had a different idea: first after 9 ms they demoted me in my responsibilities, making me an assistant, reporting to associate, so I was really demotivated, and stopped making an effort, so they ended my contract without notice, then they laid off all of my former bosses as well. It was a shit show. I developed depression, and could not do shit for half a year. When I finally got on AD and started looking in December, I felt absolutely inadequate with all the half ass jobs I had. I had a lot of interviews: contract and permanent, even worked for a few companies very shortly. Finally in March I was offered a permanent position at a small sportswear company as a production coordinator, which is lower than the associate I've before. But it was finally a permanent job, with benefits and the pay is bigger than I had before. My boss (director) promised a promotion in a year, we hit it off during the interview process because I am a bit OCD and a perfectionist. She instantly liked me and I did her. They told me they needed someone with my experience and to improve the processes for them. I've been there 3 months, and I realize I was duped. My boss is much more OCD than I am. There is a lot of micromanaging. When most of the office leaves at 5, she makes me stay till 5:30  even if I'm done. The job is menial and very entry level. My suggestions are not considered because they are either out of budget or she prefers things to be done her way. I had several major sick days for me and my husband right from the start and asked to work from home. I was allowed, but theb were given ""the talk"". We have 3 days in office and 2 days WFH, which was one of the major factors for me to accept, but now there's a talk of going back to 5 days in office. Every time my son is sick, I struggle and feel guilty that I am not being productive. I work very late just to have everything done, but she doesn't like it, because she does not know if I will do it eventually or not. At the same time she comes to office at 7am and leaves at 8pm. She has no life outside of work

My friend tells me that I will never be promoted to manager and that there's no growth, based on what I described. I am 37 and been stuck in entry level positions for 9 years now. I am ready to move up, but I can't waste time waiting for them to promote me if they do. But I have been jumping a lot since I became a mother: 10 Ms here and there, and a lot of gaps. He tells me just to fill these gaps and nobody will know. I know I am capable and smart. And the same time I'm scared shitless to fuck up and have a major imposter syndrome. I know the companies don't care about employees, should we care about being honest with them? 

Thank you for reading if you got this far. I am drunk, and scared, and feel like I lost a lot of opportunities, and now it's too late."

vip22q,40,2022-06-23,Advice to those approaching the college process,Alphawolfz_,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/vip22q/advice_to_those_approaching_the_college_process/,"**Background:**

*You can skip to the advice section if you'd like, this is not necessarily essential to the post, but I did include it for better context of the overall post.*

Hi, I'm a graduating senior and I thought I'd give some advice that I wish I knew before going into this process. The college process is terrible, and some handle it way worse than others. I was one of those who thought held it together pretty well, but in retrospect was an absolute disaster. I'll give a little perspective on my application process before getting into the main part of my post.

First, here were my stats since I know that's all everyone cares about:

* Attended a top 200 public HS in the country
* 3.8W GPA (rising)
* 6-7 APs, depending on if you consider macro/micro Econ one or not: APUSH, lang, lit, macro/micro, Spanish, environmental science
* Held an internship highly related to my intended major (which *was* marketing), gave a great ROI from the president of the company (\~2,000 employees)
* Was a 2 year captain of track/basketball
* Other ECs, not as highly regarded

My result:

* Attending Michigan State University (MSU) on academic scholarship (pays 15k/yr)
* Going for an economics (BS) major, with a minor in data analytics and wealth management

With those stats I thought I was pretty solid for my 2 targeted schools, Wisconsin and Minnesota, both of which had an acceptance rate of over 50%. Ended up waitlisted at both and eventually denied at both. I was devastated to say the least, I thought that getting denied from one was a nightmare scenario, but getting denied from both left me really shocked, disappointed, and honestly was a huge hit to my self esteem. However, time healed all wounds, and I'm going to a university that I'm absolutely psyched about. I wanted to use the lessons I learned from the stress, disappointment, and eventual excitement that I experienced to hopefully help a community that helped me.

**The Advice:**

*I ordered them from what I felt was was most to least important*

**1) Have honest, clear discussions about finances**

Debt is a big deal, and big debt is a really big deal. No, 100k is never worth it for an UNDER graduate education (and I'd argue it's rarely worth it for a graduate education). You need to fully understand how much your parents intend to pay, and formulate your plan around that. Top schools are very expensive, even with financial aid- which I'll get to soon. Apply to any school you want, but always apply to at least a couple of schools that you can 100% afford. Financial aid is really spotty sometimes, I was lucky to get a very good package at the school I'm enrolled in, but others weren't so lucky. Don't always rely on historical numbers and what you *think* you'll get, that's a VERY dangerous game to be playing.

We're heading into recession, by the time we graduate we'll barely be out of it if we're *lucky*. Finances have never been more important.

**2)** **Stop basing your life around USNews**

I get it, if I was able to even think about a top 20, I'd probably do the same. However, the honest truth is that what you put into college will matter just as much as the school on your diploma. Yes, the top schools have a head start, with amazing alumni, but those alumni are amazing because they are brilliant people, not because they went to a good school. There are brilliant people everywhere; in fact, our valedictorian went to a top 100, and he legitimately could have gone anywhere. The school does not define these people, their work defines them.

Base your decisions off other factors, because fit really matters. If you don't fit into the school, you won't put everything into it, and your results will suffer as a result of it. Yes, rankings should come into consideration, but if you're using the USNews top 20 as your exclusive list, that is an issue. You will miss out on some awesome schools that could very well be a better fit for you.

**3) Try not to spend hours on end worrying about college results**

'll try to keep this one brief since there really isn't much to say. This will be the hardest part, the waiting game. Hang out with friends, get a hobby, do your homework, do ANYTHING but stare at your email and portal. If you ruin your senior year stressing about decisions, you will regret it.

**4)** **Get excited about multiple schools**

Take it from me, try not to have your heart set on 1-2 schools. Even if you think they're locks, have a 100% safety school that you'd be ecstatic about attending. Putting your eggs in one basket is never a good idea, you need to have backups. I was initially disappointed with my results, but overtime I became genuinely excited about MSU.

**5) Choosing a major**

Explore your interests in high school and college, that is literally their entire reason for existence. I took AP economics which completely shifted my intended major on it's head. I had an internship on marketing that never made me feel the way basic economics did, and I'm absolutely grateful for that. Use high school classes as a trial run, and see if you enjoy them or not.

Of course, be sure that you have a job market after graduation. Don't necessarily prioritize money over all, but money and employability should certainly be a factor. Many people here look at CS and engineering, which are generally great majors, but even CS is becoming oversaturated. Do your research on how to supplement your major and value it to greater heights, especially when prospects aren't always so great.

**6) Try starting early, especially for essays**

Essays are pretty hard to come by just through an hour of brainstorming. Mine came up pretty naturally, almost by accident. One day, it just made sense and I drafted it within a week. That was after nearly a whole summer of struggling on topic ideas.

There are TONS of resources for essay writing, and they're usually pretty solid. Don't discount the people in your life either. Teachers, parents, counselors, etc. are fantastic resources to read and critique your essay. If you're ignoring them, you're simply making a bad decision.

In addition, get your letters of recommendation early. If you're younger than a senior this especially applies to you: make great relationships with teachers. Don't be a teachers pet, no one likes a teachers pet (even teachers!), but develop a real connection with them. I bonded with my business teacher through sports, and that connection ***along with my class work is how I got that internship.*** While your relationships may not get you that far, it'll very likely land you a good LOR

**7) SENIORS: Remember to have fun**

It's your final year of high school, you need to enjoy it. Senior year, especially the second semester, is so much fun. Enjoy it as much as you can, especially in a relatively post pandemic world. Go attend high school games, hang out with your friends, go to a party, ask that girl out, this is the last opportunity you're going to have.

**8) Apply a filter to your email**

[**https://github.com/Blendify/college-filters**](https://github.com/Blendify/college-filters)

This is a genuine life saver, I don't care if this is your only take away. Apply this and filter all the spam from your inbox.

**Conclusion:**

A little disclaimer that this was written in an hour at midnight, so if there's any inevitable typos call me out on it. Despite that, if this just helps one person, it'll be worth it. You're entering an exciting but very stressful time in your life, but you're not alone. If anyone has any questions about the post, or my admissions process, feel free to DM me!"

Thanks everyone for your replies. I get it, it's too early in my career to be worries abouta stipend in an internship.

It's just that, it felt bad when I saw the difference, cause that higher stipend would have been quite helpful right now.

So as the title explains, I am curious as to what you guys think is the best approach to achieving this. Should I hard focus on the curriculum to where I am deep in the books and most of my free time is occupied learning in college/maximizing GPA to transition into internships?

or

Is a large part of what I learn in college not going to be a close enough translation into the work-field that I don't need to spend most of my time absorbed in it (B's/C's get degrees mentality) and instead working on projects, leetcode, etc.?

I just don't want to graduate and feel like I am super incompetent and unreliable as a member of a team; likewise, I don't want to stunt my growth to where I can't land a respectable earning/position as a dev.

**Edit: Also in regards to internships Do you guys think school prestige/ranking plays a large role in this? GPA? What factors do you think contribute to internship acceptance primarily?**

**Edit Lastly, I am between saving a lot of money at my average state school UTSA (University of Texas at San Antonio) or trying to transfer to a bigger named college and having an opportunity cost of at least 30k to attend A&amp;M or UT Austin (I'd wager unlikely I'd get into UT Austin seeing as how near-impossible it is). Does the ranking/prestige actually matter enough to justify these costs?**

Hoping to grab some advice from some more tech-angled people in here.

I’m about to graduate in a year or so, and have sort of divided my studies between two fields of tech that I enjoy. 

I am majoring in web development at a tech-oriented university, and will graduate knowing JS, PHP, and Python. 

I also landed an IT internship this summer at an MSP and have an A+ certification. 

I don’t know which one I want to do. Jobs and pay are abundant in both fields, and both are driven by portfolio/experience/certification. 

I can easily land a web dev job/internship during the school year, or continue to work IT certs. 

I really only care about the pay/prospects in either one because I enjoy both equally. I know there’s good money in IT higher up on the SysAdmin/CyberSecurity/Consulting ladder, and Web Dev has more opportunities for WFH/freelancing and tends to be driven by clients and what they’re willing to pay for. My Web Dev degree will help me land IT jobs since I’ll be able to script easier, so that’s a plus, but I don’t think IT certs will help me land Web Dev jobs.

Any help is greatly appreciated because I don’t want to end up not specializing in anything!"

I was a teacher for several years mostly following in the footsteps of my family. I liked teaching and my students but hated everything else about the job. I decided to go back to school on scholarship for computer science, and I genuinely enjoy the coursework. 

However, everything I’ve seen on starting a career in software engineering (what I’d like to do) says that it’s extremely hard to land your first job. It’s discouraging because currently I have a family; and I’m worried I’m making an impulsive decision with this new degree and risking our stability. 

To get experience, I’m trying to get a job teaching coding to children while I go to school and then I plan on applying for internships in a few years. I’m also planning on applying for the masters program in software development once I have the needed prerequisites. I also have a secret clearance (hoping that helps).

Is getting this degree unwise especially since I have to consider my spouse and child?

Is my plan on making myself more marketable a good one ? How can it be better?"

Bit of background: I am a Help Desk Intern, soon to be Cybersecurity bootcamp Alum and I am an IT-Cybersecurity student at my local community college. I started pursuing my CS degree last year, but I changed majors to IT because I was wanting to break into Security. However, I really enjoyed the one comp sci course I took in the beginning of my freshman year and I have realized that I am way more interested in programming then working with switches, etc. I’m thinking about switching back to CS but the rigor of the course load intimidates me. The CS degree I was going for last year contained chemistry, physics, and lots of calculus courses.

So IT or CS? Is CS worth the back breaking work it requires? Is it worth it if I enjoyed it? Or should I stick with IT which seems much easier (IMO)."

I am willing to quit if not doing so would prevent me from getting an internship, but since I am a frequent user, I wouldn't be surprised if the drugs still show up in my system on a drug test in a few months.

If anyone knows if most of these internships for companies that have government contracts generally require drug tests, or if having used marijuana at any point in the past could potentially disqualify you, I'd appreciate if you could give me more information."

vj1joa,420,2022-06-23,[Amazon Offer] - My experience interviewing for entry level DevOps position at Amazon,copiumimporium,devops,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/vj1joa/amazon_offer_my_experience_interviewing_for_entry/,"Hey all, posting this because I haven't seen much talk about the interview process at Amazon in terms of DevOps (the official titles at Amazon are DevOps Engineer and System Development Engineer).

I recently accepted a position as a System Development Engineer 1 on one of the teams at AWS, and just want to outline the process. For some background - I have 1 year of experience as a software engineer at a small, not well known company.

This may vary by team, since each team / department at Amazon / AWS is pretty independant from one another.

**Step 1 - Online Assessment**

I had 2 Data Structure / Algorithm questions to complete on Hackerrank. They gave me 90 minutes to do so. 

I could not find them online, but they were extremely similar to these two:

[https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-right-side-view/](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-right-side-view/)

[https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-length-substrings-with-no-repeated-characters/](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-length-substrings-with-no-repeated-characters/)

I answered both with optimal time / space complexity in approximately half the given time. So I made sure to comment as much as I could explaining my thinking process

**Step 2 - Phone Screen**

Brief introductions and small talk, then she asked me about my past work experience, projects and internships. Again quite brief.

I was asked a Leadership Principle question ""Tell me about a time when you couldn't meet your deadline?"" with follow-ups

Then I was asked the two following questions:

[https://leetcode.com/problems/score-after-flipping-matrix/](https://leetcode.com/problems/score-after-flipping-matrix/) (this was the exact question asked)

[https://leetcode.com/problems/design-browser-history/](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-browser-history/) (not exact, but very similar to this)

I struggled with the first one, I was able to come up with a brute force solution but needed the interviewers help to arrive at an optimal solution. She was extremely kind and helpful to me so I appreciated that a lot.

The second question I answered optimally (constant time for all operations) and she seemed satisfied.

We closed the round by having brief small talk again.

**Step 3 - Onsite Round 1**

Brief introductions / small talk.

I was asked the following questions:

[https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-steps-to-make-two-strings-anagram/](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-steps-to-make-two-strings-anagram/) (exact question)

I was able to solve it with optimal time / space complexity in around 15 minutes.

Then I was asked various questions about Object Oriented Programming concepts as well as Database Management System concepts. I had to design a small system with OOP (ie: name the different classes and their relationships) as well as a database schema (er diagram) to support the system. 

After that, I was asked a Leadership Principle question ""Tell me about a time when you innovated and exceeded the expectation""

**Step 4 - Onsite Round 2**

Brief introductions / small talk.

I was asked a Leadership Principle ""Tell me about a time when you had conflicting ideas with your teammates and how did you resolve them?"". With several follow-ups

I was asked another Leadership Principle ""Tell me about a time when you were mostly through a project and realized you had the wrong goal."". Again, with several follow-ups

Then I was asked about troubleshooting questions / system design questions such as:

1.  ""What would you do if your website was getting unexpectedly large traffic, how would you handle and scale it?""
2. Explain concepts like database indexing, sharding, nosql vs sql, horizontal vs vertical scaling, etc
3. Explain the OSI model’s layers with protocols of each layer, what are protocols of the transport layer, explain what is TCP and UDP, explain how the TCP mechanism works. 
4. Explain OS concepts such as process creation / management, memory management, different scheduling algorithms and the data structures used to implement them, etc.

After all of this, I was asked the following question:

[https://leetcode.com/problems/design-in-memory-file-system/](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-in-memory-file-system/) (pretty much the exact question)

I struggled with this question a lot, and the interviewer was not very helpful. I was not able to come up with a solution with the remaining amount of time I had left. I was extremely disappointed and thought I had failed the entire interview process because of this.

**Step 5 - Onsite Round 3**

Brief introductions / small talk.

I was asked to solve the following two questions:

[https://leetcode.com/problems/find-root-of-n-ary-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-root-of-n-ary-tree/) (exact question asked)

[https://leetcode.com/problems/network-delay-time/](https://leetcode.com/problems/network-delay-time/) (exact question asked)

I solved both of the questions with optimal time / space complexity pretty fast. I could tell the interviewer was happy with my solutions and pretty impressed with how fast I completed them.

After that I was asked the following Leadership Principle: ""Tell me about a time when you made an important decision without consulting your manager"", with several follow-ups

After that, because we had some extra time, I once went over my DevOps projects with him and I talked about tools and technologies that I've used (docker, kubernetes, AWS, terraform, etc).

**Step 6 - Offer Letter!!**

After the interviews, I was so mentally exhausted and tired. I felt like I was not going to get it, but I did!

Unfortunately the job is not remote, so I will have to relocate (they provided me $10,000 relocation). 

In terms of compensation, the offer was for $150k , which is more than double what I am making now so I obviously accepted it.

**Final thoughts**

It was a really grueling process. I had to know so many different concepts, from Data Structures, Algorithms, Databases, Networking, Operating systems, Programming, etc. But I am glad that I spent so much time prepping, it was all worth it in the end."

I didn’t lie on my resume, the technical interview I did alright but not great, but hey they hired me so I must be what they’re looking for, right?
the first week was a bit over my head but I kept up somewhat. it’s me and 3 other interns and we get split up to work on various tickets. one of the others was here last year and knows what he’s doing, and the other two seem to know a bit more than me, but I feel the dumbest by far. my program at school didn’t teach about git or what the hell an API is or how to do anything other than code in Python or js and do algorithms and discrete math. my practical knowledge is 0. and now we’re in week 5 and I know nothing more than I did in week 2 because everything’s too far above my head. I try to break it down and research what I don’t understand but we move on to the next thing too quickly for me to grasp any significant chunk. I can handle feeling un knowledgeable, but not stupid like this. not so far behind the curve. I don’t know anything and I can’t learn fast enough. I don’t think I can do this life after this summer. hell, I’ve had to talk myself out of quitting every single day for weeks now. my college experience seems like a waste. i got so far only to realize that I can’t hack it in a real software engineering role. or maybe I could and this is badly structured internship? I don’t know how to know.

Now, whatever efforts I am trying to make for my colleges ( which is actually 2 1/2 years from now) just feels worthless.

1. Breadth-oriented courses from all domains
2. Considerate/helpful professors (again, might be subjective)
3. Great location with companies like Google/Amazon/Salesforce having offices in the city.
4. UC brand name (might only matter for the first job)

UCI Cons-
1. Limited depth in curriculum, few advanced classes
2. No TA/RA opportunities (other academic jobs available)
3. Non-thesis program with little research involvement
4. More expensive


Please feel free to share any more pros or cons for either. I would appreciate any suggestions helping me to decide!"

vj8yvz,2,2022-06-23,"Who would have thought leaving an ""internship"" would feel so good?",lena939,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/vj8yvz/who_would_have_thought_leaving_an_internship/,"Hi, long time lurker, first time poster here. I've decided to share my story, even though I'm not from US. 

TL;DR at the end. 

For a few months now, I've been working as an intern for a company, let's call them company X. As a rule, they hire interns as contractors, not as employees. That means interns get 3 months contracts, with an option to sign for another 3 months once the time is up. 

Now, a little background info: due to legal regulations in my country, contractors have no paid leave, no vacation days, no sick days, no employee rights that are guaranteed by labor law, they aren't even legally required to have set working hours or a set place of work (it all depends how the contract itself is constructed - if it inclines both parties agree to certain working hours and certain places of work, it's fine, but if it's phrased in a way that suggests the company is making the contractor agree to these conditions and the contractor has no say in it, that would be grounds for the contractor to sue the company and reclassify this situation as official employment). This particular company, as many other companies, also decided that additional benefits such as private health insurance, gym memberships, lunch cards etc. are only for employees. You also can't have a detailed job description with scope of responsibilities written into your contract, because again - grounds for reclassification as employment - so these contracts usually have some general stuff written in, like ""administrative responsibilities in department Y of company X"". 
There are some upsides to being a contractor though - legally, you're only required to give your best effort to achieve all set tasks, as only employees can be judged on the actual results of their jobs. And, as both parties have to agree to the time schedule and place of work, it's technically a great loophole in times of WFH, especially in companies that decide on hybrid work and only allow a certain amount of days spent on home office. This means you have quite a lot of flexibility as a contractor, compared to employees, which means a lot when you can't really take a sick day or PTO to take care of your private matters. For tax reasons, it's also a better idea to work as contractor as long as you're a student (until you reach a certain age - then having a student status doesn't matter anymore, the full amount of taxes is taken out of your paycheck anyway). It's also worth mentioning that this particular contract was for barely over 5% of minimum hourly wage, which quickly became unreasonable due to inflation, and once the taxes kicked in, the money I was making was barely enough to make it from paycheck to paycheck.

Seeing as I've been working as a contractor for many years in different companies, I've come to learn quite well how to use the loopholes mentioned above to my benefit. As it turns out, that doesn't really go so well with some people who spent most of their work lives as emoloyees. 

Getting back to the main story - my internship consisted mostly of taking over some responsibilities of senior employees that can be considered as mundane busy work that no one wants to do, but it still has to be done. Seeing as I was the youngest and the most tech-savvy in my team, I've managed to quickly adjust those processes to maximise my productivity and take on more tasks. Meanwhile, the more work I took on, my colleagues began to slack off more and more (although the amount of complaining to the boss about how busy they are also rose - coincidence 🤔?). One of the reasons I had more and more work was a new project that was in it's final stages - it consisted of a new process for a key part my division is responsible for in this company, which meant someone had to take over the old process until the new one can be fully deployed and implemented. 

After a couple of months, the amount of work I had started weighing me down and took a toll on my health - both physical and mental - which meant I had to take several hours or days off for medical reasons (illness, doctor appointments, tests etc.) and I took more WFH days than the employees were allotted by X. 

Before the end of my first 3 months, I asked my boss if it would be possible for me to transition from being a contractor to being an employee, seeing as my tax-free period was almost over. My boss said he doesn't have enough justification for his superiors to ask for a new employee opening yet, seeing as the new project wasn't advanced enough. Because of this, I agreed to stay as a contractor for the next 3 months, during which the project has developed significantly. Besides taking over the old process, I also took on some parts necessary for the project deployment. I was tasked with preparing and creating some functionalities without which the project team (consisting of members of other divisions, as well as some higher ups and corporate people) would never let the project be deployed. Needless to say, the results of my work were judged, not the effort. Before the next 3 months were up, I again asked my boss for a transition to employment. That's were things got interesting. 

At first, my boss told me that due to X's management decision, all internships are indefinitely suspended and I wouldn't be able to continue for the next 3 months. He also said he put in a request for a new employment opening, but due to unusual circumstances and company policy, he needs to have management's permission, which will be very hard to obtain. 

Meanwhile, some of my ""colleagues"" (the ones whose responsibilities I've been taking over) started becoming cold towards me. They would complain to my boss about the WFH and off days I took, saying it disrupted their work and that it was unfair, because I took more WFH days than they were allowed to take. They'd ignore me whenever I'd try to start or join a conversation, and even though our social interactions outside of work were fine before, they became practically non-existent at this point. Some of them would keep separate windows open with conversations with each other on the work-related chat app we use, only to minimise those windows as soon as they noticed I was within sight. 

My then-current contract was almost over, yet there was still no response about employment. Few days before the contract was up, my boss called me and said management needs more time for a decision, so they made an exception and decided to extend my internship by one more month. Still hoping for the employment and needing the money, I agreed and stayed. Later, boss said he'll offer me employment on a trial period, but we'll talk details once he's back from vacation (meanwhile, he hasn't been in the office for a few days - WFH).

All hell broke loose when he was at home office. I got even more tasks dumped on me since my boss wasn't there to see, and some members of the team would either slack off even more, come in late or go home earlier. Second day of his WFH one of my team members screamed at me - in an open space office, for a couple of other divisions to hear - because I said the instructions they gave me were unclear. Next day, I called my boss and told him I'll be on home office for the rest of the week, and for the first time ever, decided to tell him about the team members' attitude towards me. His response? ""Everyone should judge themselves and mind their own business, don't judge others, they had a lot to say about you too"". 

At this point, I started wondering - wtf am I even still doing here and why have I not been looking for another job? This isn't really an internship in any part other than it's name (seeing as internships are usually meant to introduce people to company's processes and work and should come with growth and potential), and all my efforts to help my team are either downplayed or not acknowledged at all. I work my ass off and struggle, while other members of my team slack off and treat me like shit for using any means necessary for managing the situation I'm in. These same team members also decided to be some kind of self-appointed HR department and dictate what conditions I should work in, just so it would be fair to their own conditions, even though it's none of their business, I have none of the privileges they have and my compensation is most likely less than half of theirs. 

Boss comes back from vacation. Even though he's told me he'll employ me, he never actually got the management's permission. I guess he realised that even though his team is falling apart (due to it's own stupidity), he still needs me, and hiring a new ""intern"" will take a lot of time which he doesn't have since there's a shitload of work to be done and he's still convinced his team is overworked already. He offered me a 1-year contract with ~10% increase of the hourly wage (which didn't even begin to cover the hit my compensation took once the taxes kicked in, not to mention inflation which tripled since I started the internship), told me to think about it. I declined right away. 

My current contract ends with the last day of June. I haven't felt so free in a long time. 

TL;DR: never believe your boss or two-faced people in you team, know what you're worth, benefit from the rights and privileges of your contract, exploit loopholes if you have to, never settle for barely getting through - physically, emotionally and financially."

So the only interviews i've done so far are front office so i know which technicals to prep for. However this is the 1st time i'm doing a strategy/ operations interview so i'm not sure if there are any 'technicals' that i need to be aware of. This role is in the sovereign wealth fund of my country with an emphasis on ensuring ESG of investments if that helps.

Also have a **lot** of inner demons/ insecurities i have to get over with. I got no front office internships in my first year after networking very hard and thus got a very bad depression in my second year so i applied to very few internships this year all of which rejected me without interview.

I only started picking myself up recently and so my desperate ass turned to family connections to push my CV in middle office roles for this summer. Therefore i'm dealing with a huge imposter syndrome by being a 'nepotism candidate' with these firms which are interviewing me rn. I didnt apply formally to their program and i feel like i dont deserve to be there even if they take me on.

I've learned a great deal thru my depression and no job is beneath me now. I have ntg to lose and all i want to do is to learn as much as possible about this industry which i've set my heart on since age 17. I'll take any middle/ back office role with enthusiasm, knowing that i still have time and can always work my way up to front office. But idk how to tell my story and explain the imposter syndrome situation in an interview"

I’m the type to work on productive tasks towards long term goals to avoid feeling stagnant so I’ve been making it a daily routine to brainstorm personal projects and/or put in an hour on Code Wars/Leet Code to keep my skills sharp for interviews.

vjenue,3,2022-06-23,Software development certificate / associates / bachelors,ImJake438,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/vjenue/software_development_certificate_associates/,Hello I’ve been thinking about going back to school for software development as there are some career options where I work and I’ve always had an interest in it. Now I was going to go associate degree then possibly a bachelors if I needed it. I learned that an associates has a bunch of gen Ed’s in it for a bachelors path. I hate gen Ed’s and was thinking of getting a certificate or two instead. What are your opinions interns of eligibility for jobs on just certificates?
vjfckw,2,2022-06-24,Options should I get laid off a month into my first job out of college,Mimikyutwo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vjfckw/options_should_i_get_laid_off_a_month_into_my/,"Hello cscareerquestions!

I'm a new grad who accepted my first role out of college with a company that I loved. After accepting the offer I kind of focused on research and graduation, and didn't pay attention to the company I had signed on with. 

Well low and behold, between signing the offer and my start date, the company sold out to a vulture capitalist with the deal closing on my literal start date. RSUs? Worthless, Benefits? Up in the air. Job security? Ha! 

The worst part of this is that this job was going to be my first bit of industry experience. I swapped into CS late in my degree, and all of my internships are in EE roles. I did work as a TA for classes like DS&amp;A and Systems Programming. I also worked on a research team that develops an API for machine learning researchers. I feel like I can frame that experience for industry roles because my responsibility was to actually program a lot of the API and develop unit tests and CI/CD pipelines for the entire code base, but to do that I actually have to get my foot in the door.

My question is this: Should the worst happen and I get laid off... very eminently, how screwed am I when it comes to being hirable? Am I over-reacting by considering going back to school for a masters, just to get more opportunities for internships?

I appreciate any insight this community can give me."

I’m a really strong student, good at STEM especially math, and have experience tutoring elementary schoolers and high schoolers, idk if that helps.

A lot of jobs I’ve seen are only open to 16 and up. I was wondering if anyone had any ideas for places I could apply? I’m also open to doing internships or volunteering if job hunting is impossible.

vjgke8,2,2022-06-24,Deciding on references for an important job application,Son_of_Laurian,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vjgke8/deciding_on_references_for_an_important_job/,"I am interviewing for my first full-time software engineering job. I've gotten to the on-site of a job and now they require 3 references. Problem is, I don't have great references. I do really like this job though, and I'm not in a good position to let job opportunities pass. (as you'll understand in the background section)

Here's some background about me:

I had an SDE internship in summer 2020 that didn't go very well. Then I graduated in May 2021. I took some time to explore non-software related things that didn't go anywhere. Then I worked full-time on an organic farm. Left that to now apply to software engineering jobs, which I have been doing the past couple months while working at a cafe. I can code, but I'm having a rough time applying with my background, so I'm really trying to do what I can. I realize I've put myself in a bad spot.

Here are some potential reference options:

1. A highschool friend I've kept in touch with who worked as a software engineer for a year and then worked with me on the organic farm for a couple months. He said on the farm that he would be a reference for me. I think he would have very good things to say about me.
2. Old professors. There are two CS professors I saw at office hours often, and they have both said they like my curiosity. However, I took their classes in Fall 2018 and Fall 2016. I didn't really get to know any other professors well. I got to know a couple TAs. One Kinesiology TA in Fall 2020 who liked I way I think. And another CS TA in Spring 2018 who said I could email him for any advice at all. But I haven't kept in touch with any of these teachers.
3. Cafe manager. I haven't asked her yet, but I think she would have good things to say about me. I'm a good worker at the cafe, and a number of the employees have said as much. But of course this is not related to software engineering, so I am unsure if putting her as a reference would be a positive point.
4. University school friends. I'm fairly reluctant to put this one because I haven't worked with them at all.

Assuming these references all respond that they would be my reference, who would you put on there?

Any and all advice about my situation is appreciated!"
vjgm0s,4,2022-06-24,Am I aiming to low? What to do?,Tech-tard,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/vjgm0s/am_i_aiming_to_low_what_to_do/,"TLDR:
I have 1 year plus experience with AD and Cisco products. Are true entry level jobs ""beneath"" me?

My experience is 1 year working with on prem AD, Ubuntu, Cisco CLI, Python, Powershell, and Bash scriptting.  I have worked with DHCP, DNS, FSMO role transfers, File and Print Servers. I currently have both the Sec+ and CCNA. My experience is primarily from an internship where I picked up everything rather quickly.

I moved to a higher paying role, that hired me due to my IT/Network knowledge. Sadly this is more a Project Management role, that requires little IT knowledge. Most IT work done here is maintaining a SonicWall, one Exchange server and occasionally creating mock networks to replicate clients environment for device setup. 

I have applied to about 80 positions and received about 15 callbacks for interviews. Although it is hard to do interviews as client calls can vary in time as a 30 min call and easily reach 2 hours. I have probably applied to more entry level help desk or support than sysadmin and net admin jobs. Yet, I have received more calls from the latter. Even a help desk interview lead to them considering me for their sys admin position instead. Am I aiming to low looking at help desk roles? Should I aim higher? 

Most places have rejected me as I have little to no experience with O365 and MDM. I have been studying it quite a bit and I am looking to get my AZ-104 soon so I can get a better understanding of the cloud. 

Prior to IT, I was a Customer Service Manager and a bit of IT support for consumers. Previous to that was miscellaneous positions and I have no degree."

I am done with my third year majoring electrical power and energy engineering. I am planning to intern abroad next summer 2023, and I wanna start preparing for it from now because I feel it's not that easy getting a 3-month intership as an international student.

I am thinking to get an internship in the field of power electronics/ electronics/ or control and im thinking Europe or US. How can I start searching for a good internship and it doesn't have to pay well, I just need the experience. Preferably with accommodation and travel expenses covered.

I just need some advice and direction, and how easy or hard this is gonna be?

Thanks in advance"
vjhgwl,0,2022-06-24,Graduating soon and feelings of a lack of direction,ToshiBoshi,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vjhgwl/graduating_soon_and_feelings_of_a_lack_of/,"I've  been enrolled in college as a computer science engineer since 2018 and I  have mostly focused on just doing well in classes and making sure that I  didnt fall the same pitfalls that I went through during highschool and  made sure that I did well. Surprisingly with my track record I did  pretty well and made sure that my GPA was kept afloat and I did my best  to learn in class and do all of the work required.

Eventually  during my computer science lap my TA made it a point to make sure that  we should delay our graduation as long as possible until youre hired as a  software engineer internship.

I  have been shotgunning my resume for the past 2 years with hundreds of  applications and multiple revisions to my resume with absolutely nothing  to show for except for a IT job I was at for 6 months. I need only two  classes left to graduate and I have no idea if I should delay it longer  just to find some kind of internship or at least code up projects. If I  do code up these projects that I have should I even try showing some  kind of fancy product or just anything to show that I have a basic  concept of something. Im approaching the end of my college career and Im  very scared for my future, especially when i know people who have  graduated from the top schools only to work a minimum wage job because  they didnt have projects or an internship before theyve graduated.

I should mention how I've only gotten one interview in the span of 2 years and I've been leetcode engineering since. What sucks about it is that studying is not consistent or done well enough for me to get good at it. Besides leetcoding and feelings of dread/doom about my future career, any tips?"

vjhzxp,11,2022-06-24,How to compensate for lack of internship experience as a nervous soon-to-be graduate?,Ok-Parsley-9258,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/vjhzxp/how_to_compensate_for_lack_of_internship/,"I've been having some worrying thoughts about what I can do to get a good job in CS after I graduate, especially since I have no internships at all. Possibly an overreaction, but ig I want to get this off my chest

I'm set to graduate this December. I have a 3.3 gpa and switched into CS a couple years back after being undecisive about my career choices. Because of my late switch, I've always felt behind, and sometimes feel like I don't have enough to prove myself (really ik I do and am able to, but my mind works against me at times). I've only gotten into the habit of practicing for real job interviews since last summer, and even then I can be frightened by the notion of having to talk to interviewers. Despite getting some interviews (most of my applications are for SWE, some Data science), I believe my lack of confidence and inability to sit through half my interviews without shaking an earthquake has put me at a disadvantage when getting job offers (in a couple cases, I've had to cancel interviews because I felt incompetent). I'm still working on not being as anxious at interviews. 

For some background: last year, I worked as a TA for an intro data science course (helped non-programming students with basic DS concepts via Python), and a ""help-desk""-ish job where I basically troubleshoot shit in computer labs. As of now, I'm doing a machine learning research project with one of my professors and am hoping to start another research project when I return (unless I get a last-minute internship/co-op by chance). I've also taken the steps to work on some personal projects to improve on my software development skills (rn I'm making small apps with different frameworks like Spring Boot/Flask, hoping to crank out some ideas I've wanted to try out).

Ik it looks like I just typed my whole work history and life story, but ig if it at least shows that I'm willing to work hard and to be dependable, and improve my interview skills, is it possible that I can still get a good job within the next year?"

I work as Network and System Administrator but I am guy who gets called for anything related to servers, phones, printer, zoom call, adding ssd and RAM, setting up computers. This company terminated my job without any reason. I got email saying ""We regret to inform you that we will be ending your term of employment with us"". I have told my senior, who is CIO, (who has resigned) that I will leave office in few months but before that I will fully train my replacement. Now they want me to train one of the colleague, who has little knowledge of networking and no clue about Linux server, in a week. Type of work I do needs years of experience. I have about 10 yrs of experience in computer field. 

while at work, my other manager would call me to ask what I am doing and why are you not at your desk and roaming around office. 

I would tell them I finish my important work before other arrive(like checking backups, network switch, thumb print device etc). They claim that I am getting paid for very little work and no putting extra effort to take other responsibilities like taking tack of clients complaints. I don't know how our HMIS system works because no body bother to tell me and CIO has said it was not my job responsibility. That manager and even CIO doesn't know what actually System Administrator does. CIO used to defend me before but now he is gone.

&amp;#x200B;

This has happened to me before after I came back in Nepal. My previous company was the same. Boss over there had big ego and isn't willing to change with time. Whenever I suggest him to try new technology, he would it working since 2003 or so when company started. I warned him that one the Raid disk in old server is down and other disk might fail any day. We need to replace the disk or move server to VMware esxi host. Then, the day came when sever HDD crashed and lost data from 17 yrs. It was data of government office (DHM). I managed to revive server and data as well, but I did not get credit. Instead he told Gov office that I crashed the server because of my negligence and he will take legal action against me. I told this to one of the junior System administrator, he resigned next day. That company paid very little for amount of work we did. Boss was cheap. But that place good for interns, newbies who want to make career in IT. That company is the first house on  left if you go from Dhobighat road towards DAV college.

&amp;#x200B;

So, now I am in process to return back to the US and take up job as Middleware Support or DBA or DevOps support.

vjova6,7,2022-06-24,Never working in Care Homes AGAIN,ReasonableContact121,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/vjova6/never_working_in_care_homes_again/,"I moved in London in 2017 and was looking for an office job. I come from years of free-lancing and contract work with ridiculous pay, therefore I was on the hunt for something more stable, also because rents in London are high.   


Landed an interview for an office job in a Care Home in Westminster - is part of a larger organization that handles various care homes around England - £24000 a year, Monday to Friday, 9 to 5, which for me was more than ideal, because when I come home, I want to chill and dedicate to my hobbies. Passed the interview and the background checks, I started in February 2018: for the first months, it was mostly what I expected and I was more than happy with it, but I still started to notice a few things, like the home manager cared much more about showing off the home on Social media, fluffing up pillows and  rather than making sure all operations ran smoothly or the finance aspect is healthy; also, we have a front desk but no receptionist, the office is open for all the staff to just come in whenever they want and the Admin needs to take care of the calls and appointments, but again, at the time it was okay. It was at a human level.   


Starting from July 2018 though, slowly but surely, they started to pile up on me more and more duties, even those that are not contemplated in my job role - the guy in charge of Activities for the residents and social media left to ""deal with a sick friend"" back home in Italy. I found out months later, he never left UK at all as he drove me back home from a pub evening and he confessed he just didn't like the work because of increased emphasis on extra tasks that are way beyond his skills, I didn't pay too much attention to it, but as soon as I came back to work after holiday I have slowly realized how they considered the administrator in that care home: I am basically the staff's punching bag, especially when pay is involved. They will come to me angry telling me their pay is not right at the end of the month when they need to complain to the home manager instead. My manager instead of listening to them just sends them to me and it kept happening month, after month, after month.  
And not only that, sometimes I'd need to order them something and they'd come to me with the most pissed off face ever, standing in front of me looking until I took care of anything they needed. Telling them I'm busy with calm wouldn't work, because apparently, that's how the previous admin was treated as well. THAT WAS NO GOOD.  
Also, my manager really is ignorant in terms of technology and sometimes I would have had to stay beyond my time just to help her send a single email. And she would just delegate me tasks I have no idea how to take because I have never been trained for them and hear ye hear ye, THE MANAGER IS SUPPOSED TO UNDER TAKE. This led me most of the time to call some of my colleagues from other homes for assistance and they would just ask me why the manager is not taking care of those tasks.   


Soon my manager would force me to take courses about dementia, taking care of mentally challenging elderly, first aid, all things that seem a bit excessive for someone just working in an office, then my manager one day told me ""Well, in case it was needed for you to help the staff"" and I have suddenly realized her plan was to use me as care assistant as well.   


I just wanted an office job. Just allocate payments, write emails, plan appointments, maybe yeah answer phone calls, but that's it. What they were looking for really was a glorified intern and a little gopher for all of the staff. Also, our home is so desperate for business that we have some very awful cases, violent customers, some of the most racist, unbearably posh idiots of London, some of them would come complaining to me they haven't got their copy of the Sun, one even threatened to shove his walking cane up my bum. We should be more selective for them, but my manager just wants to show off how many people how much better our home is compared to the others. The head office turned all this into a competition and who works in the office is forced to take part in it. And also this, there's no career opportunity in this job. How did I find out? One day I called an admin from another home asking about it and he laughed in my face. That broke me.    


Then COVID hit, and since we are in social care, even admins and managers are supposed to come to the office. I spent 2 years feeling depressed and defeated and feeling utterly jealous of those that were able to work from home and avoid to deal with situations like awful customers, nasty staff that won't let you concentrate on your work and not to mention, I started to see some of the customers pass away one after another. I hated it so much; in these 2 years I gained weight, felt powerless and had suicidal thoughts more than once because of this job. I am going to therapy 3 times a week in order to overcome this.   
I even tried to tell my manager that I don't like working with old people that way and I was expecting a more traditional office job, there are too many responsibilities on my shoulders and that would have helped if we got a receptionist.   
My manager not only just brushed off my concerns, but just told me ""In this job, there are no thank yous"".  
That, pissed me off and made me incredibly sad and depressed.   
I came back home that day and just broke down in tears in the arms of my partner, I just needed to.   
I had enough. I started to look for a new job right away, and thank goodness my 4 years of experience are giving me some chances for interviews, but I am making sure that I have to not be trapped again into some weird 360 ""I do everything"" kind of role and that they can offer me remote working, decent pay and career opportunities. I am done with social care, now more than ever. This job made me hate old people and social services so much and I will never be coming back.   


TL;DR - I been tricked into a dead end job in a care home and made me hate old people and social care. I'd rather staple my eyebrows to the ceiling rather than work in this setting again."

There is no info in the initial email about what the assessment is about (only dates and times to take it), so I was wondering if anybody has been in a similar situation. 

From scrolling this subreddit, I know companies like to do coding assessments and whatnot. I am wondering if you guys think this assessment will be similar? Each time slot is two hours long.

I see a bunch of videos on tik tok of various full-time people and interns in FAANG companies posting their work where they barely work and make a lot of money. The reason I am asking all these questions i because I am trying to see if it is worth pursuing a double major in CS and Biz, so that I can have SWE as a safety career in case I don't like my time in IB/PE/HF/Consulting

1) Is there really barely any work hours in SWE? or are the tik tok posts just outliers

2) What do people do with all that free time? I know most high finance careers demand long work hours but it's a fratty type of culture work hard play hard. after working co-workers from the same teams/classes mess around hit up clubs or grab drinks

3) Are your co-workers in tech chill and easy to kick back with as the ones in finance? I saw a lot about SWE co-workers basically being very isolated/introverted

4) How hard is it getting a job in SWE at one of the FAANG companies? How much networking is needed? I know for p much all finance careers networking is very important.

5) How much do you have to grind to secure a FAANG SWE job? I spent some time understanding the IB and recruiting timelines, and I know they require a sort of stepping stone type of internship to secure a spot in the top group. I felt really bullish for no reason so I unnecessarily grinded and secured a fintech/corp fin internship @ JP morgan this summer. Will SWE recruiting require a similar stepping stone kind of internship to get an SWE job in FAANG?

And that time, I got some hope from those of you who commented and told me to hold on. I am grateful for that support. But nonetheless, things didn't immediately get better, but I held on.And after a while, things did change, and here is what has happened and what is lined up for me: 

* An 8-month-long internship at a space company in Europe, along with a stipend that covers food and rent, allows me to travel. My professors are also shocked at how I got such an amazing internship when I am just a second-year student. I start in January 2023.
* I had my first kiss. The kind you dream about after watching disney movies and in a perfect location after a beautiful date. 
* I travel back home in a few days and get to meet my extended family after almost a year. I have a road trip planned in western India along with multiple parties planned with my friends. 

I don't want the readers to think that I don't have any problems right now. I most certainly do. But today is the day to celebrate all the blessings life has bestowed upon us.I am aware that trials and tribulations are never actually over, but it is also important to acknowledge all the good that is out there. I felt hopeless and thought I would never measure up. And that was my mistake. I let my circumstances define me. Today everything is great, but there is a possibility that everything will blow up in my face tomorrow.But that will not change who I am as a person. 

So to all those who don't see light at the end of the tunnel, I want you to know that I have been there and I understand the pain. But hold on, because it will get better.I owed it to myself and to those anonymous people on reddit who have helped me out to write this.

But, after my experiences in high school, college, studying abroad, working customer service, etc. I feel that I generally act pretty normal. Maybe slightly less chatty than average in some situations, but nothing out of the norm. However, it seems that every time I THINK I am coming across as normal, someone points out how “shy” and “reserved” I am.

For example, I just started an internship a few weeks ago at an engineering firm. It's been a bit awkward (being the only female and by far the youngest in the office), but I’ve been enjoying it and thought I was doing really well. Asking lots of questions, accepting every invitation to go out to lunch, greeting everyone in the morning, and having what I thought were pretty normal conversations while still trying to keep a professional vibe.

Well today I was talking to an older guy in my department and he was giving me some career advice about speaking up about what I want, not being afraid to ask questions, yada yada. I said that’s definitely good advice, and kind of jokingly said that I’ve been working on being more outgoing, and how I was a quiet kid. Well that set off a whole thing about how he apparently had a whole conversation with another guy about how quiet I am NOW and how he’s been hoping to “break me out of my shell”. And the other day, I was chatting with another guy and he asked how I was liking being an intern. I said I really liked it (in a pretty enthusiastic voice, mind you), and he looked at me in disbelief. He said that it seemed like I really DIDN’T like it and that I seemed bored and, again, really quiet.

I am so done with this at this point. I don’t see any problem with how I act. I think that I’ve been doing the best someone could in my situation. It’s not exactly easy for a 20 year old girl to casually chat with a group of 50 year old men who’ve known each other for years, many of whom are WAY quieter and more awkward than I am. Especially when there’s a lot of pressure on me to remain professional. And what am I supposed to do to look more enthusiastic, skip around the office all day with a big fat smile on my face? I hate having this reputation, and there’s so many more examples that I’m not even gonna get into where I think I am acting totally normal, maybe even a bit TOO casual and chatty compared to the people around me, and in the end still get labeled as the quiet one. Could it be my voice, or my body language? Is it that I’m small and look really young for my age? (another CONSTANT comment). Is my perception just totally off? And more importantly, how can I fix this reputation going forward, especially in the office environment?"

&amp;#x200B;

I am about to graduate and have thus far not been able to land a single interview with any company I've applied to throughout my entire CS career. This includes internship applications at a number of companies, and more recently job postings. I've tried applying to everything from research positions to entry level positions that should be attainable with a B.S. (though I'm actually aiming for a research position). I've tried both FAANG and smaller companies, and have only gotten email rejections before entering a single screening.

The formatting on this version is a little messed up, especially the top where text overlaps - this is not the case on the original.

Thank you for your help

This Is my first time posting something on reddit , so If I make any mistakes , please , let me know  :) .

**So...  let me explain the context:**

I've  been working as a Junior developer for like 2 and a half years , my  first Job was as an Internship , using Php , Laravel and codeigniter as  tools, It was pretty cool , and I've learned lots of things.

And  currently I'm working at a company that I've learned/improved lots of  stuffs aswell , and I'm greateful  for everything. But unfortunately ,  From six months ago , until now , I've been dealing with a burnout and  my performance decreased a lot. And It all happened when we began to  work on a project that everybody was putting preasure upon us to finish (  and when we finished , the return was not the promissed by the sales  team :p).

Since then, I've been  feeling demotivated asf , because my boss said that my performance  decreased so much , and that He though that I was going to evolve faster  , despite the fact that he already know that I'm dealing with this  burnout issue.

Thankfuly , I'm on  vacation until next month , and I'm currently at a countryside in order  to recover from this burnout , but I'm pretty frustrated because I've  already delivered great projects , most part of then have made a good  income for the company , and still , It feels like I'm just another  peace of the game...

Maybe this  post Is more about taking something off my chest , than for asking this  question... , but anyway , what would you guys do in this situation? ,  because I'm pretty lost right here , I don't know If I should quit ,  take some time to rest and find another job , or If I should stay , and  try again.

Being  honest , I like my team and the most part of my bosses , but  unfortunately , I can't live with this frustration of not being valued. I  can't become demotivated about programming , because It's something  that I love doing.

Anyway , thank you guys for reading this , hope u guys can help me with your opinions."

vjzr5v,0,2022-06-24,Stuck with hard choice between finishing school and getting a job,Dareak,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vjzr5v/stuck_with_hard_choice_between_finishing_school/,"I am in a hole of my own making, so I’m here to ask for advice and rant a bit, sorry if it's long but there is a tldr.

I’ve been away from school for a year and I feel like I’ve made no progress forward, so I just want to make a decision and sprint toward it. I have two directions that I’m considering, work or school, and I would be tremendously grateful for any feedback I can get. I am currently working just to get by and I live with my parents, school is not in the area.

I feel ashamed and like a failure, and my parents absolutely cannot understand ‘why’ this is happening. They support me but I also feel insane pressure because they're immigrants and they're going through their own troubles.

# Path A: Work

This is my hail mary path. My goal would be any position or internship that could lead into a dev path.  



I have a partial BS(105 credits) in CS, which I know nobody is ‘looking’ to hire, but is not unhireable. But I don’t have the coattails, no internships or independent projects.   



I have decent experience with Java, C, C++, Python, testing and git. The plan would be to review what I know, and look into other areas to get a start in. Right now, JavaScript is attractive, but I need to look into more. I would make a website and/or throw together some projects on GitHub. I would also need to grind Leetcode and polish my resume. After that I would be busting my ass doing applications, studying for interviews, and hopefully getting an offer.    

**Are my chances worthwhile? Am I naive?**

**Other than an entry dev role, what are other good options into the field? What are good options for new things to learn?**   

   

Not sure how relevant it is anymore with WFH, but I do live in an area with a lot of both private tech companies and government contractors.   

I also have a couple of good friends in tech, and connections to people in tech through my parents, but I am reluctant to use these because I am not graduated and feel inadequate to throw myself as a candidate through their connection.   

Going for this could require considerable time due to the amount of prep work and time it takes to get a job after. I would also need to explain to my parents how I am not going to school even though I’ve been “on the cusp” of graduating for years.    

Going to school for a semester simultaneously might put me there for a year due to a lease, unless I find a sublease for just a semester.   



I do have 2 months before school would start.    

# Path B: Finish my degree   

I wish this was the easier option to choose. I started my CS degree about five years ago and I have been unsuccessful in graduating due to mental health and financial problems. My current academic standing is 105 finished credits and a &lt;3 GPA.   

My school is not local, I would need to keep working on the side to pay for housing and to get by. I would probably need to take out private loans to be able to pay for school, which is a bit scary but something I am willing to do.   

I’m about to speak to an advisor to iron out a roadmap to finishing my degree. My current understanding is that I am at least 3 semesters away from graduation due to the way class prerequisites are stacked.    

Another option I've considered is transferring to a local school, but I have not looked into it substantially and I doubt it's worth the extra time it would take.







I am confident in my interviewing skills and I am ready to work hard as hell if I can get a job, but I'm just not sure if it is the best option. I'm also confident that if I return to school I can work hard and get my degree. I do still have 2 months before school would actually start.

I got an admit to the MSDS program at DePaul and wanted to know a few things before I accept it.

* What is the course curriculum like? Do we get to work on the practical application or will it be just theoretical?
* How are the professors? Do they teach the tool or do they go in-depth about the maths behind concepts?
* How is your experience studying the program?
* What is the alumni network look like? what are the chances of getting an internship during the course?

I am thinking to opt for a **computational or healthcare program.**

Any help will be appreciated.

Thank You. :)"

So as mentioned in the title,
a group of us are looking to start an ebook specifically for business students. We want to provide an internship experience for those who are struggling to get one.

We would love some feedback in relation to:

1. The burning questions interns have.

2. What you think should be covered.

3. How your academic experiences match up with practical experiences.

4. Your own anecdotal experiences (good and bad, what you valued the most etc).

5. Would you recommend an internship? why or why not?"

In my past year or so, I realized that I would much rather work with code in my day to day than do engineering stuff and I definitely have a knack for it- I took a couple years of computer science in high school and excelled at it; I just happened to like physics more back then.   
   
Previously, I was intending to work for 8 or so months (less than a year), quit work, do a full time bootcamp (I’ve really been looking at Codesmith) and then look to find jobs after that. However, I realized that I have another option: from what I learned during my internship, the firm I work at is pretty flexible with people crossing teams and exploring, so I could start to self learn some computer science/software engineering skills, get some professional software development experience at work, and then go on from there (the firm is much more structural engineering focused and software engineering is not what it’s known for at all so I probably wouldn’t stay too long for that).   
   
My dilemma is that if I stay at my job, I would have to self learn everything and I fear that what I learn at the bootcamp could be very valuable. On the other hand, I know that having real professional  software development experience would similarly be invaluable to have."

vk6dn7,4,2022-06-25,Research Internships?,Due_Baker1976,phcareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/phcareers/comments/vk6dn7/research_internships/,"Hi. I'm currently an incoming grade 12 student and I've been watching vlogs about international students getting research internships in prestigious labs in their country. They usually only shadow researchers and do grunt work but I became really interested so I was wondering if there's anyone here who has an experience with research internships/apprenticeships?

For context, I plan to go down the CS/IT-related research career path. I want to reach out to tech laboratories of select universities. However the downside is, although I have a great enough resume (internships, volunteer work, part-time, and freelance), nothing in it is related to tech and research LOL (except online courses). But I think it highlights the soft skills and minimal hard skills that I would need for a SHS internship. 

I would wait until I'm in college to apply as a research intern but I'm determined to get to know the field before committing my next 4 years to a course that I might not excel in. Is this a smart move?

Undergrads and alumni, do you think university labs here in the Philippines would consider high school students for internships? And for those in the tech + research field, what is it like? How did you get involved in research? Any tips or advice?

Sorry for the long post but I would highly appreciate your insight, suggestions, or questions. Thank you!"

I am from California. I'm currently a student at a university. I'm currently facing an issue and would like your advice on the subject matter at hand.

The beginning: I was looking for a place to stay for my internship. I saw a craigslist post that was cheap and I thought it was okay because I was only going to stay for 3 months. I gave him my SS and ID and signed the agreement (foreshadowing the gray area later). He showed pictures and it wasn't the cleanest but I thought I could deal with it. I couldn't attend the showing because I was six hours away. When I talked to him on the phone, he was really conversational so I thought it would be alright. All he told me was that he will be there but often travelling - when I got there, there were two other roommates.

Side note: the lease is month to month. The payment is on the 15th and the 1st of every month. The deposit was $950 along with the rent but split into $475 for bi-payments. I paid both.

Red flags: When I arrived he was an hour late to our meeting spot, it was really dirty. Way beyond the acceptable condition for a tenant to live in. I stayed there for two weeks and his wife moved in the final week with her two cats - which was not stated anywhere in the Craigslist post. She also left period blood, hair in the bathroom and did not clean up after herself alongside the husband. The laundry washer and dryer had clothes piled on top which was not shown anywhere in the Craigslist post, again. The kitchen (countertop, stove) was greasy and no space in the fridge. He stated he would bring a cleaner but never did (and lied that he did, I know because there was no difference in cleaning). I asked him to clean or discount the rent because of the conditions but bombarded me with grammar-filled paragraphs and in a pompous attitude. He would compliment my roommate and my appearances - made me feel EXTREMELY uncomfortable.

Gray area: I stayed there for a total of two weeks. In the agreement it states I had to give him a 30 day notice prior to leaving. I moved out 2 days the next rent was due because the smell was rancid, there were bugs, I couldn't take it anymore. 

The end: He stated my deposit would be pro-rated to ""protect himself from these situations"" but is not willing to provide any proof that there is no one living in my former room. I asked him to take pictures of my room and ensure there is a phone on the side of each picture to showcase today's date but refuses. He states the law is on his side and he's very ""knowledgeable"" about the law. He's a scammer and extremely misrepresenting.

My questions: Is it even legal to rent out your apartment unit (the manager doesn't know and the ""tenants"" names aren't on the lease)? How do I get my deposit back? Is the agreement even valid? What are the consequences when you rent out your apartment unit without telling the property manager? Who's in the right or wrong? Should I report him to the apartment complex? Take him to court? What should I do?

Thank you for reading if you have made it this far. Any help would be appreciated!"

Regarding the laptops, do I need to declare them as I have been or will be using them for over a month (except the gaming laptop which I will be using for a week)?

I know I'm not an amazing programmer, and I know I have yet to graduate. I know I don't deserve more than what I can earn.

I'm an intern at a small company. We have 4 interns. Of them, I am the only software intern. The entire software team is roughly 6 people. We usually contract other companies when we need a large software application. I am very hands on with my company. I'd even go as far as saying I am an asset. A very large piece of our main project was created by a consulting company. Of that work, they created an HMI for our main machine. I worked with understaning and modifying that HMI and recreating it for other smaller machines. Since we no longer consult that company, I am the go-to person when it comes to anything related to the HMI of any machine we work on. I am the only one completley familiar with the software for the HMI. Compared to other employees within the software department, I am doing equivalent work. Not just busy intern work, but actual contributive work. I am paid $20/h which is fine as this is a small company. It's been a few months and we had a meeting with our 'intern advisor' at the company. He was telling us about asking for promotions/raises with reasoning to why you should be given a promotion/raise.

I am deeply thinking about asking the head of my department for a raise. $25-30/h is what I am aiming for. While this is a small company, they are by no means short on funds. I don't want to make a fool of myself, but is this even a thing or acceptable for an intern to ask for a raise? Currently, I live off this income while I am full-time during the summer."

I’m 20M living in the US right now. I’m studying for a bachelors in mechanical engineering and I graduate in spring 2023. I’m planning on getting my masters at this same school which should only take 1.5-2 years. Moving out of the US is more of a long term goal, I know a lot of countries need several years of experience that I just don’t have right now and won’t for a few years, unless internships and lab research at school count. 

I don’t speak any languages besides English but I would be willing to learn pretty much anything. I know engineering is an in demand field in a lot of places, so I’m hoping I won’t have trouble finding a job. I’m specializing in a particular field of engineering, and I know there’s a lot of companies in Germany in this field, but the general bachelors degree will hopefully open up jobs outside my specialization.

I would prefer a warmer climate, preferably near the ocean, like Australia/New Zealand but I know that’s not a guarantee so I’m open to anywhere. 

I know it’s generally a good idea to visit the country before moving but I don’t know that I will have the time or money to do so.

I’ve looked into citizenship by descent but I don’t think I’m eligible, my closest immigrant ancestors were my great-great grandparents from Ireland. 

High cost of living isn’t a huge drawback, I’ll probably be living on my own and I don’t need a ton of space.

New Zealand was the first country I thought of when I started thinking about moving away from the US, so I’ve looked into the types of visas and things a little bit, but it’s still pretty confusing to I know I would need to talk to a migration agent or something.

I hope I’m doing this right, like I said moving is a more long term goal and I’m trying to get as much info as I can. Thanks!"

I have been working at a small company as an SDE for the last 3 years. I joined here as an intern and was offered a full time position, which I accepted because it would help pay for my college tuition. Everything before pandemic was very nice, I had a helpful manager, helpful teammates and I was learning and contributing a lot. After the pandemic though I was asked to change teams and managers and I did not feel as connected with the new work or the people. Over the last year or so my motivation to work here has tanked. I have been in a loop of feeling that - I don't like what I'm working on -&gt; I'm earning less than what I can be earning -&gt; I haven't learned a lot -&gt; I don't have cool projects to show -&gt; how will I get a new job if I'm not skilled enough -&gt; atleast I have a job that pays

Over the past few months I decided to respond to recruiters and prep for interviews. I interviewed for an SDE2 position at AWS purely based on what the recruiter said I should be interviewing for. I did pretty bad on the System Design as I only had theoretical knowledge of how to scale systems and did not trust my own knowledge because of no experience. However I was told they want to offer me an SDE1 position. Currently I have ""sell calls"" scheduled with hiring managers to pick the team.

I personally still feel like a junior or a new grad and have a lot to learn. I'm excited for an opportunity to work with some very talented people and hopefully start my career over. AWS also means almost a 90% TC increase and a 30% increase in base pay (or more if I can negotiate). I do not have any other offers at the moment, I only have a few phone rounds lined up. Should I settle for the downlevel or sidelevel(?) at AWS and take it as a chance to learn and reshape my career? Or should I reject AWS and continue looking for other opportunities in the face of uncertainty?

Thank you for reading! I appreciate any help or advice from more experienced members here.

Edit: if someone from AWS happens to read this, is there anything you wish you knew before picking a team?"

I don't want to put them in daycare so I'm considering having my MIL watch them while I'm home. Anybody have experience with this? Terrible idea? Thanks in advance!"

I already know a lot about programming and I am currently a data science intern, but I'm looking to teach other students, girls specifically, about basic coding/comp sci/ computer knowledge. I have done Girls Go Cyberstart and CyberStart America in the past, which provide really great game-like environment with interesting challenges to teach kids about cybersecurity. Does anyone know of programs or websites similar to this that may be useful in teaching more than just cybersecurity? 

Also, if anyone else has been part of a programming club or started a club, what kind of programs did you use?"
vko22d,156,2022-06-25,Helpdesk can be an invaluable place to start. A 15 month journey to Cybersecurity,TrueYorkCity,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/vko22d/helpdesk_can_be_an_invaluable_place_to_start_a_15/,"I wanted to write this after lurking for so long to give some perspective on different ways to go about getting where it is you want to be, and what my experience was. I’m in tech (cyber security, specifically) but I’m pretty sure the principles and mindset work in any profession.

TLDR will be at the end with timeline and salary info if you don’t feel like reading.

Prior to 2020, I had no experience whatsoever in tech (I did, however, work as a software developer briefly in 2015-16 which is where I learned Python – though I do not use that at all currently and haven’t coded since)

When Covid hit in early 2020 (US) I was working as an event manager. As we all know, the shutdowns caused massive layoffs, and I wasn’t exempt. June 2020, I found myself unemployed and not sure where to turn. I always found cybersecurity interesting but knew realistically there was no way to get an entry level job in that field, so I started applying to regular helpdesk jobs. I must have applied to hundreds over the summer of 2020. At some point I realized, looking at my resume, that this isn’t going to happen at this rate, so, to give my resume a boost and up my knowledge, I decided to go for the CompTIA trifecta, as I had heard that is a good starting point for people looking to break into that field.

From October to December of 2020, I took and passed A+, Net+ and Sec+, as well as the ServiceNow certified Administrator cert that I had a voucher for. In early 2021, I updated resume and started re-applying, and was eventually accepted as an IT Intern for an MSP’s helpdesk. At the same time, I was also looking for Cybersecurity programs because I wanted to learn more. I eventually came across WGU’s Master’s program in Cybersecurity and Info Assurance program (already had a Bachelors in an unrelated field) and liked how it was structured (self-paced). Not knowing if I was qualified, I applied anyway, and to my surprise, was accepted with a start date of March 2021. My admissions counselors stated that my limited experience as an IT intern, combined with my certs and past job as a software dev all played a part in the decision.

So, by March of 2021 I was fulltime in school and working. It is important to mention that both my job and school were fully remote, which helped immensely in making this possible. After about a month I was promoted to a full-time helpdesk consultant.

Helpdesk is hell. However, I learned a shit-ton, more in the first few months than any other period in my life. The company was aware I was going to school for cyber security and one day my manager approached me about my interest in joining the security team (which, duh). Our MSP is divided into teams that generally manage a specific industry. My team was healthcare. Coincidentally, my prior software job was at a medical school, so I was already familiar with a bunch of the regulatory issues in that area. So logically, I became my team’s security analyst. This was in June 2021.

I finished my Masters in March of 2022 just a little over a year after starting full-time. With school out of the way, I focused more on my job and took as many extra projects and OT that I could, as well as started sending out my updated resume to any and all full-time security positions. I worked dual roles as an security analyst and helpdesk consultant until May of 2022 (with one raise January 2022). In May 2022, I was promoted to a tier 3 specialist (basically highest level of helpdesk).

Since graduating in March of 2022, I’ve had a very large volume of call backs and recruiters reaching out for various helpdesk and security positions. I was fielding about 2 to 3 phone interviews a week since graduating at the end of March until the end of May, when I finally secured my first security-related offer as an assistant manager of Information security at a huge telecom company. Up until then I was offered various offers, but they were all still helpdesk positions at other MSPs – some did have slightly higher salaries but not high enough for me to jump, considering they weren’t 100% remote. I start my new position next month (mid-July).

**TLDR, here’s the breakdown:**

**March 2021 – IT Intern (remote): $12/hr (\~$24K/yr)**

**April 2021 – Helpdesk Consultant (remote): $35k/yr**

**June 2021 – Consultant/security analyst (remote): No pay raise**

**January 2022 – No title change, but pay raise: $40K/yr**

**May 2022 – Tier 3 Specialist (remote): $52.5K/yr**

**July 2022 – Asst. Mgr InfoSec (hybrid - 1 office/4 remote): $102K/yr**

I consider myself extremely lucky to have caught multiple breaks and opportunities along the way to go from no exp to infosec mgmt. in 15 months, but I wanted to write this in hopes that inspires others who are trying to break into security that helpdesk has been a great (and grueling) experience and that it is possible with the right mixture of education, experience, hard work, and most critically luck/opportunity.

Networking is also a huge one that I didn't really mention because, oddly enough, in my case it didn’t really seem to be a factor (score one for introverts). I knew nobody from the first job at the MSP, and as for the offer I just accepted – a recruiter had reached out to me!

Anyway, first time posting on this sub after lurking for quite some time but am willing to answer any questions! Also, if anyone can has any tips for this type of transitions I'm all ears."

After looking into a bunch of different roles and career paths. I'm most interested in becoming a sys admin  then later a cloud engineer.

In the mean time I'm going to be interning in a help desk role in a cpl of months as part of the Year Up program.

During that time I'd like to upskill as much as possible in order to eventually get into cloud(long term goal)


From my research my first step should be getting into a jr sys admin role.

I've already started getting familiar with Linux and learning bash( upskill challenge and learn to cloud) while also studying for the rhcsa and sec+ cert
I have a rough idea of what certs and skills I need to do so and at the moment im starting with the Linux up skill challenge while also studying for the rhcsa. And eventually learning python and getting the sec+ and some AWS certs.

I know I probably won't use most of this during the internship but I do want to learn them and become proficient since they seem to be the precursors to what I actually want to do.


My question to you guys is, does this sound dumb? Am I getting too ahead of myself? Is there anything that I should add or consider?

The more I look into things the more I find conflicting info so I've just decided to at least start some of it. I would like to see what you guys think though."

vku9cx,15,2022-06-25,Graduating college with CFA L2,fookytown,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/vku9cx/graduating_college_with_cfa_l2/,"Hi, I will graduate next year summer and I will have an internship of 3/months. I plan to sit for L1 in November and L2 if I succeed L1 after graduating. 

Best case scenario is succeeding in both. I will graduate with a bad GPA of 2.3 .

It's a choice between studying a masters in Europe, which I can't do because of my GPA plus that's costly and not interesting. And I personally want to do the CFA because it's what interests me. 

Internships in my country in finance are rare and there aren't really companies that value the CFA. 

I want to have the level 2 to be able to secure an internship abroad (Europe preferably but really just anywhere out of my country).



In this case, does having level 2 really makes me able to secure a job/internship? What choices do I have after abroad with having a bachelor in finance 2.3 GPA, CFA level 2, advanced level in MS Excel and an internship of 3/4 months? 

Thank you.

Edit: added some information."

&amp;#x200B;

PART 2

Chapter 4 - THE H1B PROCESS: The unpleasant news of the demotion and salary reduction had a silver lining - She agreed to file for my H1B. I'm an optimist, so I decided to focus on the good news. I started finding out contacts of immigration attorneys who could help me out with the process and not charge me a bomb - since I was going to be paying them, out of my own pocket, with a salary equivalent to peanut shells. Found a tried and true attorney based out of Pittsburgh who agreed to do it for $1800. The process started. It was a long arduous process which I had to somehow manage outside of work hours, and everything was due ASAP.

The application was finally sent out on the first Monday of April, the deadline. After about a few weeks of awaiting the results, I heard the news.

Chapter 5 - THE NEWS: My H1B application was PICKED in the lottery!!! I was among the 80,000 people whose application was randomly picked among approx. 250,000 applications that year! I was happy - something good came out of this!

I contacted the attorney, thanked them, told my boss, my colleagues. It was '""Rum all around"" season! I asked the attorney, what's next? She told me that we now await the approval. I was happy. I went back to my boss, expressed my gratitude for retaining me, and agreeing to sponsor my visa. I forgot that I was dealt a bad hand. I was just chirpy, grateful, and filled with positivity. I had started thinking about how happy and exciting my life would be here for the next 3 years, and that I will able to get a better pay, get promoted, I was even ready to start thinking about getting married to my gf at the time, if everything worked out well. Now my troubles will be over, I will be eligible to live and work in this country for six years, my life seems good now....or so I thought.

* Well, you see, my reduced pay had a huge impact on my financial planning in general. But, I was content about how my H1B was selected for official processing and convinced myself that the salary can be negotiated at the one year mark or later, based on my performance. I mean, she was a just person after all, right? Americans in general are...or so I thought.

So much for the ""soft power"" of Hollywood and their projection of righteous Americans.

Anyway, this reduction in my salary severely impacted my H1B application as well. So, when I finally finally heard back from the USCIS, instead of an approval notice, I was served with a Request for Evidence (RFE) to prove my abilities or occupation ""special enough"" for the government to consider granting me a work visa.

* The way the USCIS sees it is that you need to make certain amount of money based on your place of work, your title, and your education. If you make lower than the standards set by the department of labor (DOL) then they can ask WHY you're getting paid so low? Are you so insignificant that you're being employed at such a low salary? Are you even legitimate in that case? Do you have any self esteem? Couldn't you work at a place that valued you? Maybe you aren't worthy. Well, here's a chance to prove you are, you nonexistent piece of nothing.

The lawyer had told me about this before applying. I had told my boss about this, and was hoping to use this as my last bargaining chip towards my salary. She said, leave it or take it. I took it. We went ahead with the process. And now, I was in this position.

The lawyer and I started gathering evidence to prove that, yes, people who graduate out of grad school do get employed at an Intern position in the Architecture industry which is one of the standard titles used in the precedents, and that the $42,490.68 salary may be lower than your standard, but there are people in this area that get paid that low. We planned to prepare letters of recommendations from other firm owners..... wow! I dread even thinking about the hoops we were planning to fly through. Thankfully, the USCIS gives you 3 months to prepare a solid response and send them, so we had time.

Chapter 6 - THE DRAMA: Now the USCIS sends this notice to two places: Your attorney AND your employer. When I was discussing something about gathering the evidentiary info from my office manager, she casually told me that they had already mailed the response back to USCIS.

WTF!!!!! I was like why didn't anyone tell me? What did the response say? What all info did you send out? She told me some screenshots and a written letter. I was furious! I called my lawyer ASAP. She said nothing can be done now, all our efforts are down the drain. The USCIS will not accept two separate mails, and we're still miles away from drafting a full response, so they'll base their decision on what they receive first - the mail my office had sent over.

I was in tears. I picked myself up, and asked the attorney if they can do anything to prevent the letter from falling into USCIS' hands, Hollywood style. Nope, she said. I requested them to continue drafting my response since I'd already paid them for this added service. Yes, the response was costing me and additional $1000. They said ok, and we hung up.

Politely, I told my office manager what a big mistake that was, and my boss overheard this conversation, only to pass a remark, ""I knew this was going to be a headache, what a waste of money, effort, and time"".

That evening I stood at the great river in the middle of the city and yelled my heart out, in public, for 10 minutes straight. Quietly returning back to my normal self thereafter and walking to my train station, dejected.

Three weeks later, my office manager calls me at her desk first thing in the morning. She says, ""The letter never made it to the USCIS. The USPS sent it back, for the postage was not paid fully. There was a 30c stamp missing.""

This company's negligence (and/ or cheapery) had saved me.

Miracles? Yeah I think they do happen...

My body had a cute little non-lethal heart attack hearing all that, I think. My lawyer couldn't believe any of this.

She told me the response was ready.

I asked to see it.

She said they sent it.

I was like, if this miracle can happen, my visa is meant to arrive...or so I thought.

This post is half venting and half plea for advice, but I really feel like I needed to get this of my chest and I have no one else to talk to.

Growing up I've had a lot of messed up stuff happen in my life. I lost my dad when I was young and since then I've lost even more people, most recently including someone I grew up with and was really close to. My siblings and my other people in my family have become very mentally ill and have left my mom to deal with the fallout. 

While I was growing up people around me would always tell me how amazed they were at how normal and successful I turned out given the chaotic environment I was raised in. I genuinely believed that too, I've always prided myself on being logical and introspective and thought I just learned to cope better than those around me. However, recently I'm not so sure.

I'm now going into my senior year of college and though I am making it through, I am struggling. Ever since middle school, I've had an awful procrastination problem. For a while now I have been bouncing back and forth from completely lacking any and all motivation to do anything followed by bursts of positivity and inspiration. I've been finding that even during my periods of inspiration I haven't been doing anything productive, just simply lost in my thoughts as I bounce from idea to idea instead of sitting down and accomplishing the tasks sitting in front of me. While at school I do astonishingly little work compared to my friends and class mates. I've skipped too many days of class to count, instead just lying in bed all day. The threat of deadlines and due dates have been slowly losing the ability to motivate me to do my work. I struggle in my day to day life as well. I put off chores and other simple tasks for weeks. I struggle to maintain contact with close friends and family members, even simple leisure activities feel like a chore. 

I'm scared to even get a job at this point, since I completely embarrassed myself by not completing any work at my last internship. I feel like I'm completely wasting my life away and utterly failing to live up to my potential. There are so many things that I want to accomplish, but I feel like I've completely lost control of my life. I'm afraid that I might just completely breakdown someday. 

As I mentioned earlier there is a long history of mental illness in my family, and I think I'm beginning to develop bi polar disorder. I was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid though I refused to take medication for it until recently but it doesn't seem to be helping that much. I'm starting to realize I need help but I simply don't want anyone to know. I really don't want my mom or anyone else to worry about me, and I don't want anyone to change their view of me. I feel like I've been slowly letting the people in my life down, but the one thing I could always take pride in was the appearance of stability. 

Is there any way I can get help without anyone knowing, at least temporarily? I know I'll probably have to come clean someday, but for now I just really don't want anyone to know. I know I'm being stupid about this whole thing, but I'd really appreciate any advice or stories from people who have had similar experiences."

Strictly in terms of employability, which program is better at finding jobs and internship opportunities? From what I've heard, McGill has a more global reputation, whereas UBC is better known in the Vancouver region. In terms of ranking, UBC's CS program ranks slightly ahead of McGill, but I don't know if this matters in the eyes of an employer. For reference, I am aiming for a software job in the US.

Which program would be better for me? I apologize if my post may come off as ignorant or immature and I appreciate all your advice and suggestions!

Additional note: I'm not sure if this matters or not, but McGill has a financial advantage over UBC. I have received scholarships from both schools, but there's still a major difference in cost. If I attended McGill, I would only have to may \~$20K in total, whereas I would have to pay $60 - $80K for UBC."

M-am gândit sa fac postarea asta ca sa aduc putina lumina cu privire la salarii, asa ca voi vorbi despre salariile începătorilor.

Un junior dev fara experienta câștiga undeva intre 4 si 8 mii de lei in functie de cum se descurca la interviu dar si mai important in funcție de bugetul firmei.

Sunt si destule firme care ofera mai puțin de 4 mii de lei dar pe acelea le-as recomanda doar in cazul in care nu aveti alternativa.

Mai exista si opțiunea internshipului. Aici lucrurile stau putin mai prost dar la finalul celor cateva luni, cat durează internshipul veti primi o oferta care sa fie egală cu salariile enumerate mai sus.

In general un internship este remunerat cu sume intre 1500 si 3000 de lei. Pot exista si exceptii precum 4000 de lei sau neplatit, de cel din urma va recomand sa fugiți."

I’ve been browsing around online but was hoping people could help me sort through what my options are. I was mainly looking at Canada just because it’s close, and I assumed it would be the easiest place to go as an American.

I don’t know how much of my work experience would count towards any chance of immigration, so I’m going to list it all (even if it seems stupid) just so people can tell me whether any of it will count at all.

- June 2020-May 2021: worked at a high school in the technology department providing tech support and setting up equipment. June-August 2020 was full-time, rest of time was part-time (16-20 hrs a week while part time).

- August 2021-December 2021: I worked for the university tech support desk (essentially took phone calls helping people with their problems) and was a teaching assistant for a intermediate-level programming class. Overall was part time, added up to 20 hrs a week.

- January 2022 - August 2022: working a full-time co-op (essentially a full-time paid internship instead of taking classes) as a software developer in the analytics department for a professional sports team.  

- January 2023 - May 2023: don’t know yet, but it will be another sort of full-time internship/co-op in software development I will have under my belt before I look into moving. 

I’ve lived in the US my entire life so I’m fluent in English. My original plan was to get a job after graduation and do a master’s degree online (looking at Data Science or Applied/Computational Math programs). However the current + potential future political climate makes me want to move, and while I’m guessing the easiest way for me to move is to just do a full-time master’s degree in Canada (and if that’s my only/best option please say so), I’d prefer to be able to stick to my plan of immediately going into a job if possible. I don’t know if my work experience would add up to be enough for Express Entry, so I’m assuming I have to go some other route. Please let me know though, I would like to know what my possible options are.

I may have some other questions after this as well, but I’d at least like to find out my options first. Since I’m a year out, I’m guessing now is a good time to start looking into things and get the ball rolling once I know which direction to go in.

That being said, I plan to complete projects, be involved in CS clubs, and partake in internships/research, but will I truly be competitive as a SWE applicant to major internships and jobs against other Cal CS majors?

Maybe this is not the right place to ask about job guidance, so please share if there is a more appropriate place to ask such questions.

I'll start with the problem now.

Many of my friends took BSc Chemistry, Microbiology, Zoology, etc as their course for graduation. After the completion of their 3 year course, they are really confused about their future path. 

Unlike my friends, I did Information Technology and I really love working with computer software. After my graduation, I could easily find plenty of sources like Internshaala, Hirect, angel, naukri, etc where I can find internships, and jobs. I can even filter companies on these websites based on the technologies that I know and love. Many resources for learning are also available online for computer science.

The same wasn't true for my friends and they're struggling to find a work or proper career path. Some have great academic scores but couldn't pursue a degree that had high fees due to severe financial issues and that's why they decided to take a break and work to earn some money for financing their education. 

Even the batch toppers are struggling to find either work, or a course that they should pursue. These kids are really hardworking and can do well with whatever task given to them and that's why I think this problem could be because of lack of guidance/career counseling.

I was wondering if there was a source where my friends and others facing a similar problem could get help for their career or for finding work they'd love."
vl4kj7,275,2022-06-26,Our Petty Revenge against a Toxic Supervisor did not go as planned,Colourblindness,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vl4kj7/our_petty_revenge_against_a_toxic_supervisor_did/,"________

I knew working at a call center meant I would be surrounded by eccentric people, but my boss Bartholomew Haggarth takes the cake. 

He’s a fifty something overweight hot head with more compulsion problems than a therapist could possibly handle. Thankfully, I only see him when I work the second shift so I’ve done my best to keep my distance, keep my head down and just do my job. Get paid, go home. Easy right? 
I thought if I did that, Haggarth wouldn’t bother me. 
But I seriously think the guy is a magnet for causing friction in the workplace. 

I’ll give you an example of just how irritating this guy is : my coworker Beth was chewing on ice chips just the other day to keep her awake. She’s got two kids and working late doesn’t do her any favors. 

Haggarth was walking the cubicles, acting like he owned the place. His belly jiggling, his nose stuck up in the air, grunting like a bull elephant. I swear if there was ever a need for a poster child for obnoxious people, he would be first pick. 

When he spotted Beth, who was on the phone with a particularly irate customer, he zeroed in on the ice chips and started shuffling his body toward her. 

She was midway through calming the customer down when Haggarth grabbed the cup of ice chips and shook it loudly next to her ear and in that high pitched Boston accent snarkily asked, “Does everyone know what policy thirty three means??” 

The whole floor got quiet. His voice tended to echo and he also repeated it so many times that ignoring him wasn’t possible. 

“Maybe Miss Flaren can remind us exactly what the policy says food and drink on the work floor,” he commented, snapping her work headset off and shouting to the customer on the other end of the line. “Please hold, we’ll get an actual trained professional to call you back in just a minute.” 

Beth sat there, frustrated and too upset for words as Haggarth crossed his arms and rattled the ice chips again. 

She sighed and reiterated the policy in a low voice. “Employees are to keep their cubicle space…”. But then he coughed so loud that you thought he was about to spit up a lung. 

“Please, I don’t think some of us can hear you!” he said, yanking her up by  the arm. 

“Employees are to keep their cubicle space neat and organized at all times. This includes limiting any food and drink to a minimum of one or two items…” Beth said through gritted teeth. 
“So how many ice chips do you think Miss Flaren has here? Ten? Twelve?” Haggarth asked. 

Needless to say, no one responded. He then proceeded to pour the chips of ice straight into her trash can and walked away as if he had just killed a deer. 

So yeah, this son of a bitch deserved some karma. And that incident was a soft example, I only shared it because Beth gave me permission. 

Anyway the point is that none of us like him. 

And I think he gets a boner picking on me every time I’m there. 

Whether it’s berating my quota or chastising how long I stay on the phone with a customer, it just seems like I can’t do anything right. 

After one particular tongue lashing I was so upset that I excused myself for a 15 minute break. Even as I clicked for the request on my monitor, Haggard was reciting how the break was only a suggestion and mildly reprimanding me how I was wasting company time. 

I stormed into the break room and slammed the pantry open, grabbing the strongest coffee I could find. 

As I waited for the cup to brew, I started to use the leftover ground as my personal punching bag. 

Behind me I saw Robbie, a guy an aisle over from me on the work floor, enter with a stiff smirk. 

“Hogsloth is on the rampage again I see.” 

I nearly burst out laughing. “Oh wow. That’s… that’s perfect.” 

Robbie laughed back and leaned against the counter. “I know right? God, that guy is so wound up! I even made a meme of it…”  he chuckled as he pulled out his phone. 

“Better put that away or get a disciplinary hearing,” I joked. 

“Ahhh doesn’t matter anyway. Don’t have any bars in this place,” he said slipping it away. “What the heck is his problem anyway?” 

“Your guess is as good as mine. You’d think that we killed his grandma or something,” I said angrily. 

We started to share anecdotes, a small competition to see who was on the chopping block for him next. 

“I don’t understand how a guy like that can look at himself in the mirror at night,” I lamented, more disgusted by each story we told. 

“You know I actually heard a rumor that he’s terrified of mirrors,” Robbie responded. 

“You for real? That makes total sense when you look at his fashion sense,” I laughed back. 

After a few more laughs, we heard Haggarth’s voice bellow across the work floor and I sighed, realizing my break was over. 

“I would give half my paycheck to take him down a few notches, I tell you that,” Robbie said, the fun being sucked out of the room as we heard our boss going off on another tirade. 

I flashed a devilish grin. “Maybe we should just fill his office up with mirrors,” I suggested. 

Robbie laughed for a second and then noticed how serious I had gotten. “Nah, we could lose our jobs,” he sputtered. 

“Over a harmless prank? What’s he going to do? He wouldn’t even know it was us,” I replied. 

Robbie didn’t respond, but for the rest of my shift I kept picturing Hogsloth pissing himself just because of a mirror. It was enough to help me push through the last few hours. 

The next day, Robbie pulled me aside before I clocked in.
“I thought about it. I’m in. Let’s make Hogsloth squeal,” he told me. I smirked back and said I knew of at least two more girls on my aisle that had a bone to pick with our boss. 

“You sure they’ll keep it a secret?” Robbie asked. 

“One girl said They’d be willing to get fired just to see Haggarth cry,” I responded.  

And with that, our pact was set in motion. 

The two girls were Merle and Susan, and I made it their task to find out more about how Haggarth’s office was designed and the logistics of getting a large vanity style mirror in. 

Susan knew the guy that worked down at the loading dock and said she could give him a BJ so he wouldn’t bat an eye. 

Robbie was the main component because he knew who made the schedule and asked a few favors to get a print off of when Haggarth was off. 

“Three day weekend coming up at the end of the month. That might be our chance,” I said as we discussed it in the break room. 

“There’s still a kink to this whole plan. Where are we going to find a mirror?” Rob asked. 

“That’s where Merle comes in. Her uncle owns an antique shop downtown. We’re just going to borrow one,” I said. 

Rob sighed, clearly growing uncomfortable with this plan. “I don’t know, this feels like it could blow up in our faces.” 

“Relax. I told you a thousand times that no one will ever know it’s us. All that matters is making Hogsloth pay for being such a pain in the ass, right?” 

Rob said he was still in, but I made a mental note to keep an eye on him. One weak link could break the chain. 

Two days later, it was go time. Thankfully Rob had also arranged for all four of us to take first shift and then meet up at work during graveyard hours. It meant we could move around without any nosey supervisors. It was always dead and everyone was way more lax. Honestly, if it wasn’t for the fact that I had a kid at home; I would have preferred that shift altogether. 

So after I double checked with my babysitter, I met Rob at the loading dock. 

“Any sign of Susan or Merle?” I whispered as he took a smoke nervously. 

He gestured toward the nearby back office where I heard soft moans and I resisted the urge to roll my eyes. 
“Well at least one of us is giving it their all,” I joked. 

Merle arrived about ten minutes later with a small Uhaul truck and backed up right next to the loading platform. 

Rob grabbed a dolly and I pulled the grating of the back panel up to reveal the mirror. 

It was beautiful. At least as tall as me and ornately crafted from the finest wood, coated in a glossy finish and made of the sharpest clearest reflective glass I had seen in years.

“This thing probably costs more than all of our salaries combined,” Rob said as we carefully moved it toward the freight elevator. 

“Which is why we are going to gently move it up,” I reminded him, a bit miffed that he was taking the joy out of our prank. 

Haggarth’s office was on the sixth floor and as we rode the freight elevator, I stood next to Merle and smiled a little nervously as I saw her toy with her cross necklace. “Hey, no need to be guilty.” She smiled and put it down against her skin, asking, “What do you think his first reaction is going to be?” 

“Probably cuss. Maybe faint?” I guessed with a chuckle. “Lord I hope not, he weighs a ton,” Rob lamented. 

I ignored his fretting and pushed the antique mirror up to the door, jiggling the handle and cursing to myself. 

“It’s locked. Fuck.” 

For a moment it felt like our plan was going to unravel, then Rob snapped his fingers and said, “The janitor normally has the master key. Be right back.” 

Merle and I waited leaning against the wall and probably looking like two complete idiots in our work clothes next to this huge mirror as a few coworkers strolled by. 

“So much for keeping a low profile, now everyone will know it’s us,” Merle snarled. 

I was trying to not get nervous so I reassured her that it would be fine. “Everyone hates him anyway. This is poetic justice being served.”

Susan arrived five minutes later, beaming with pride for the part she got to play and Merle remarked, “Must be nice.” 

“What can I say? I’ve got a good way with my tongue.”

Rob returned before any more banter continued amongst the girls and showed the key, commenting, “I had to spin a stupid story about how we had to find some file in his desk for a project. I think our cover is blown though, at least three other people heard me say I was going into Haggarth’s office.” 

“Will all of you please just chill,” I said as I unlocked the door. 

“You act like he’s the damn company president. I swear this was supposed to be fun,” I growled. We slowly pulled the mirror into the room and Rob flicked on the lights. 

Haggarth’s office was as dull and dreary as I expected it to be, there weren’t any plants or seating furniture. Just a drab black desk with a wide wingback chair and behind it on the wall, a self portrait that nearly made me want to puke. 

It didn’t look anything like him, instead in the picture he was muscular and tall with silver hair and looked like he probably would have if he actually took care of his body. 

“What an egotistical maniac,” I said, shaking my head as we adjusted his furniture to make room for the mirror. 

Rob was watching the door and Susan was staring at the painting, clearly confused by it. 

“Does he really think he looks like that? No wonder the man doesn’t like mirrors. If he saw the truth it would probably break his heart,” she chortled. 

“Shit! My back!” Merle snapped as she struggled with the heavy desk. 

I told her to take it easy as I got the mirror in place and said, “We should find a way to cover it up so he doesn’t see it.” 

Rob took off his coat and tossed it to me, nervously glancing toward the hallway. 

“Let’s just hurry up and get out of here…” 

“Guys, problem,” Merle said as she looked out the window. 

“Now what?” I said with a sigh. 

“Haggarth. I just saw him pull into the parking lot. He must have come back from vacation early,” she said, turning to us in a state of panic. 

“Shit. We need to get this thing out of here now!” Susan said, rushing to the mirror. 

“Hold on! This doesn’t change anything! We just leave it here and watch the show unfold in live action, that’s all,” I said pointing toward the nearby supply closet. 

The girls seemed to think that was a good idea so we all ran across the hall to the closest and hid, getting a peek of Haggarth’s office as we waited. 

Five minutes passed and Susan began to complain. “It’s hot and stuffy in here and you stink Rob, no offense,” she snarled. 

“What’s taking the fat oaf so long anyway?” Merle asked. 

“Probably had to stop and take a shit or something,” I muttered. 

“Nah he never uses the bathrooms in the building. Too many mirrors,” Rob commented. 

“What a weirdo,” I sighed. 

Ten minutes passed and Rob said, “I think Susan made a mistake. He’s not coming.” 

“Give it five more minutes,” I insisted. He got out of the closest and said, “You guys can sweat here all night if you want. I’m getting my stuff and going home. See ya.” 

I was about to shout that he come back as he went into Haggarth’s office to grab his coat when I spotted our pudgy boss trudging down the hall. 

Shit. He saw me, I thought as his eyes zeroed in on me. 

“Annette? What are you doing here so late?” Haggarth asked. 
I panicked, not sure what to say. The world seemed to freeze until a moment later Susan grabbed my arm and said, “We were just leaving, weren’t we Ann?” 

I nodded and Haggarth didn’t push the issue, instead opening his office and walking into the dark room. 

“Show time,” I said, squeezing my friend's hand. 

“Shit but what about…” 



“Robert? What are you doing in my office?” we overheard our loudmouth boss say. 

Too late, I thought as I apologized mentally for the heat Rob would get. 

“And what is this…” 

“Sir. I can explain,” I heard Rob say. 

Then I heard Haggarth laugh. 

It was this weird mix between sinister and toxic. Enough to make me reconsider our entire prank. 

“So you thought this would give me a good scare, did you?” our boss asked. His voice sounded younger all of the sudden, rich and filled with anger and bitterness. 

“Who do you think started those rumors to begin with?” Haggarth snarled, his voice now dripping with menace. 

“Sir… please…” 

Then I heard what sounded like a gagging sound. Followed by what sounded like a bone snapping. 

“Shit!” Susan said, reaching for the office handle. Before I could stop her she flung the door open and we saw Haggarth standing there, holding Rob up by his necktie off the ground. 

And behind them, in the mirror… we saw only Rob. Dangling in the air, held by an invisible ghastly menace that stood in front of us. 

Half of Rob’s neck was in our bosses mouth, blood dripping off his lips as Rob struggled to break free. 

Then Haggarth’s eyes darted to us, filled with rage and bloodlust. He pushed Rob backward into the mirror, the impact shattering the antique glass all over his body. 

Immediately, before I could even process what I just saw I ran out of the room and toward the freight elevator. 

Behind me I heard Susan let out a scream, followed by the sound of her body slamming against the wall. I pushed the button hard, desperately looking back toward the hall to see how close Haggarth was.  

The man was moving with the velocity of a freight train, barreling down the hallway and cackling like a hyena. At the last second the elevator doors opened and I jumped inside. 

His hands grabbed at the door, pushing it open as he towered over me. His entire appearance had changed, his clothes hardly fitting now as his taller fit form revealed itself and he picked me up and put me against the back of the elevator. 

“Give me one good reason why I shouldn’t slit your throat right here, Ann,” he whispered as he showed me his fangs. 

“Hey Hogsloth!!” a voice said behind us. 

Then Rob slammed a piece of glass into the old man’s right eye from behind. 

Haggarth screamed and tossed me down the hall as he pushed his foot down hard on Rob, cracking his ribs. 

Then; from the supply closet Merle made an appearance, flashing her cross necklace toward the ancient beast. 

Haggarth shrieked and backed away, toward the elevator. I stumbled to my feet to help her, grabbing some of the broken glass and jamming it into his sides. 

At the last moment as the elevator doors began to close, Haggarth grabbed Merle and ripped her arm off, tossing the cross away from him. Then he pulled her into the elevator as it slammed close. The last thing I saw was his black eyes as he hunched over her bleeding form. 

I ran to Rob’s side, checking for a pulse as I pulled out my cellphone and was about to dial 911. 

NO SIGNAL. 
Damn. 

I pulled him up and started to drag him toward the next hallway, but he was far too heavy for me to do it alone. Susan was the only other person on the floor, and it looked her the blow to her head had caused permanent damage. 

“Shit,” I said as I saw that the elevator was starting to climb back up. Haggarth was coming back. 

I had to run. Run and hide. 

I slipped into the supply closet just as the doors opened up and I smelled fresh blood. I saw Merle crawling out, half of her body ripped to shreds as she called for help, and Haggarth climbed over her and on the ceiling like a bat out of hell. 

He twisted his head a full 180 degrees as he called out my name, my entire body trembling with fear if he found me. Then he dropped down over Rob as my friend wheezed and tried desperately to fight back. 

“I’m afraid that we will have to terminate your employment,” Haggarth snarled as he snapped Rob’s neck. I stifled a scream. 

My boss froze as he looked around the floor and then began to move the bodies into his office. Over the next hour I heard the sound of a hungry animal devouring their bodies. I couldn’t dare move out of fear that he would find me and finish me off as well. 

I sat back and tried to remain awake, the injuries to my own body so severe that I dared to close my eyes for just a few seconds. 

In Between consciousness I heard Haggarth give orders to our janitor, and I saw his face in the hallway. He didn’t see me but he seemed to have reverted his regular pudgy self. Except now he seemed full, as if he had just come back from a buffet. 

It made me want to vomit, but instead I fell back into unconsciousness. 

When I did wake up, I slowly moved out of the hall and tried to search for any clues to the massacre that I had witnessed. 

But there was nothing. Not even a scrap of broken glass. I went into his office and double checked. The janitor had scrubbed every nook and cranny. I found myself wanting to vomit for real as I looked toward the parking lot and saw Haggarth  pulling away in his Buick. 

And then he looked straight up toward his office. Toward me. 

I rushed out and found the nearest bathroom, hurling my guts up as I realized everything I had experienced wasn’t some fever dream. 

Susan. Rob. Merle. They were all dead. 

“Pull yourself together, Ann,” I told my reflection as I tried to think as I pulled my phone out. 

Would the cops even believe me? Or would they lock me away in the asylum? 

I didn’t know. Instead I washed up my face and left the office, trying my best to remain calm as I passed by coworkers to the parking lot. 

I convinced myself to file a missing persons report, and then filed an email announcing my two weeks notice. 

I told myself I would never step foot in the building again but the next day, I got an email from another supervisor, telling me to swing by for my final paycheck. 

Just as I pulled into the parking lot I got a call back from the police department, giving me the usual rigmarole about how they couldn’t search for anyone missing until after 48 hours. I was staring up at Haggarth’s office, and I told the officer thank you as I saw my boss looking out toward the parking lot. Then I slammed my phone down and marched inside. 

Get in, get out. 

Get in, get out. 

Those words rang in my head as I reached the proper floor and rushed to the HR office. 

I kept looking over my shoulder, thinking Haggarth  would appear and slice my throat open. 

“You okay?” the HR lady asked, noticing I was sweating. 

“Sorry. Just this summer heat,” I said as I grabbed the paycheck and started toward the elevator. 

Get in, get out. 
Get out. 

Get out. 

The elevator door slid open and I felt the color leave my face as I saw Haggarth standing there along with a young intern. 

“Ann, what a pleasant surprise,” my boss said, flashing me a leary smile. 

Nervously I stepped into the elevator and pressed for the ground floor. 

As we rode down, I could feel his wretched breath against my neck. I was trying to not cry. 
“I heard you were leaving the company, Ann. Is everything all right?” He asked. 

“Just got a better job offer,” I think I said. 

“Hmm. Well, seems like we are losing more and more employees. I hope it ain’t a sign,” he said with a queasy laugh. 

Then the intern stepped out of the elevator on the next floor and we were alone. I could feel the air suddenly grow colder. 

“Please…” I begged as the door closed. “Please don’t hurt me.”

His hand rested on my shoulder and a tear dropped from my cheek. 

“I think we both know how this is going to end,” Haggarth whispered. 

I could feel his teeth about to pierce into my neck as I closed my eyes and prepared for the inevitable. 

Then the elevator door opened and he instinctively stood back. 

I pushed out of the office as quickly as I could and raced to my car. 

That was last week and I haven’t been able to sleep a wink since. 

The police did finally open up a missing persons case about Susan, Merle and Rob, thanks to calls from family members. Not that they will find anything. 

The only proof I have of any of it is the nightmares. And the fear that this old shitbag is still out there, and he knows I know his secret. 

I think it’s time to invest in some silver and wooden stakes.

vl6vu8,1,2022-06-26,"Good at algorithmic thinking, struggling with implementation and speed; what do I do?",2sUp2sDown,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vl6vu8/good_at_algorithmic_thinking_struggling_with/,"Hi CSCQ, I'm about halfway through my undergrad and I'm looking to search for internships and full-time offers in the next quarter. My current employment is a research placement that I got through networking and solo work, and I've only done a handful of tech interviews since starting about a year ago. 

I looked into current interview styles through things like the tech interview handbook, and tried out some leetcode problems. The good news is that my intuition and problem-solving skills are letting me clear hards and mediums, but the actual implementation of the code and explanation, especially under pressure and time constraints, are seriously hampering me. On a day to day basis I work pretty extensively with both data structures and algorithms, so it's not the identifying patterns or being familiar with theory that's the overarching issue (aside from some more niche problems that are CP-aligned, since it's been many years since I last wrote a math or CS contest).

What can I do to self-train for performing well in interviews, aside from interviewing more? Do tech interviews care if you can code fast if your reasoning is sound? I'm getting a strong gut feeling that my strength is in thorough exploration and planning, which doesn't carry over well to time-constrained interviews. Thanks!"

It's second to actually wanting to meet people around my age of similar interests or field of study. This includes all of tech, like UI/UX, product manager interns, etc. 


I'm live in NYC. My office is in Manhattan, but there are few interns where I work, and most don't go to office (which is strange because the office is really nice).


I hear from friends in other cities how a lot of interns from different companies just find each other somehow. How do you exactly do that? I could always just hit people up on LinkedIn but that seems way to formal especially considering professionalism is not my priority here."

1. Are internships counted as YOE when applying for jobs that require x amount of YOE?

2. What is a good way to balance between spending my time on leetcode vs personal projects? I know this question is subjective and different people feel differently about how to best invest their time here, but I'd like to hear your personal take on this!

3. I graduate in about 10 months. What's a good time to start mass applying to jobs on LinkedIn/jobsites out there? 

Thank you so much in advance, and any tips and tricks for fresh graduate job applications are much appreciated!"

I was having no luck up until May 2022 when I was offered a job and an internship on the same day. I ended up taking the internship because the permanent job was going to have a crazy schedule and I have children and wasnt ready to be away from them for extended periods of time. The internship is for 6 months so it would conclude in Dec. I started it 3 weeks ago. It is in a chem lab and though it's very interesting I dont see it having a future unless I want to be a chemist, which I dont. 

Well last week another internship called me and offered me a position. This is an engineering position in land development.  This is more closely aligned with something I might want to have a career in. Initially I turned them down because I told them that I had already accepted an internship and I wanted to fulfill my commitment.  I thanked them for their offer and moved on with my day. 

They called me again the next morning and pretty much told me there might be a vacancy for one of their permanent positions and that in my role as an intern I'd be able to shadow the person that may be leaving. This would put me in a better position to apply for that job. I want to accept their offer but I dont want to put my current internship in a bind. I dont know what to do. Any advice??"

This was for a data science summer internship role.

One week ago I received another offer from another company for being integrated into the machine learning research team. I think I would prefer to do the latter as people seemed friendlier and very knowledgeable so I said yes to this last offer.

I know I can revoke the contract on the one I’ve already signed because I read it carefully before signing, but how bad would it be? Would I 100% burn bridges with the one I’m reneging? 

They are not bad people at all and I feel like I would learn a lot with them too, but in my opinion having a “machine learning research” position in my cv would look better for future job prospects right? (Assuming I want to do either ML or DS in the future)"

-Comp Sci major 3.8 GPA
-Accepted to Georgia Tech Master’s in CS
-AWS Cloud Practitioner Cert
-Undergraduate TA for 2 years, covered classes like Usability, databases, and into to programming
-Verified Nexus modder 
-Multiple python based projects most recent one being made in pygame. 

I’m unsure on what I should I focus on and what to do next to better improve my chances of landing a job. My goal is to have a job that pays at least 40k a year with health benefits since right now I make around 15k a year.

I was thinking if I’m not qualified for a full time job I can focus on unpaid internships and volunteer work but I’m having finding those postings. Does anyone know of good resources to find unpaid or volunteer work so I can get experience?"

Some things about me: Have an internship where I have a lot of experience with React and Javascript. Have kept my internship for 11 months. Have two React projects completed: calculator that can solve simple expressions and algebra and derivatives and the second project is an ID generator.

I’ve recently been looking into going back to school after having completed most of my general education requirements at a local university, but then having to leave due to personal reasons. Any issue with me attending college has been pretty much resolved, so I’ve been printing out academic maps and comparing with my old transcript to determine if going back was viable. I applied to two universities, one a community college, and I’ve pretty much determined that it would take roughly 60 hours to obtain a full bachelors degree in computer science, I only 19 credit hours to obtain and associates in computer science. In terms of the finances, I believe with my states system for handling people coming back to college, that I can get enough support to pay for it with relative ease. The only question left to answer is, would an associates degree in computer science be really worth anything? 

To give some additional context, I have a pretty good understanding of python scripting, and a bit of JavaScript as well. I have found though that learning for me is a bit more difficult when I’m on my own. As a person, I have always benefited from a little bit more of a structured learning environment. Another reason I think this might be a good choice.

Lastly, the community college I’m considering is well known in my state for having some good resources in regards to internships and job placement, which is a system that I have always struggled with in pursuing my computer science career. So to have some guidance there I think would be helpful as well. 

So with all that being said, do you think that associates degree would be helpful? Or that it would be ultimately unnecessary?

TL;DR, should I go for an associates degree if I can finance it well?"

I don't have many AP classes but that's because in my specific magnet program I don't have space to take any extra classes outside of graduation requirements.

vldzhe,3,2022-06-26,Trying to get back into SWE industry (iOS preferred),jessietee123,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vldzhe/trying_to_get_back_into_swe_industry_ios_preferred/,"Hi everyone — 

I’ve spent the last week trying to create a game plan for my next career move, and want to get advice/be given a reality check as to how much of an uphill battle this will be. 

Long story short I graduated with a SWE degree at the height of pandemic in 2020 and struggled to land a job. I had a year long iOS development internship, but due to working full time and going to school full time throughout my degree I did not have any time to build a portfolio, which definitely did not help with my job search. An opportunity fell into my lap to become a loan officer, which I took instead of being unemployed, made a lot of money, and felt good about helping people make a genuine smart financial decision with rates as low as they were. I also felt like I enjoyed the critical thinking it required, as well as the large learning curve of learning something new quickly. 

Fast forward and as one can imagine it absolutely sucks being in mortgage right now. I hate my job, I don’t feel like I’m helping people, I feel like I’m desperately trying to convince someone to make a poor financial decision so I get a paycheck. It feels gross, it’s unfulfilling, boring, and unnecessarily stressful. 

I would like to fall back on my SWE degree, but since I graduated back in 2020, only have one internship, have not been keeping up with my skills (no time since I have been working 55 hour weeks), and obviously cannot just start blindly applying for jobs. I feel like I’m going to need to spend a long period of time re self-teaching myself everything I’ve learned + fear that because I left the industry to do something else and now want to come back it will be a red flag for employers…

I really enjoyed iOS dev, but entry level jobs are not very common in iOS dev…I was going to try and do a refresher Udemy course and try and build a portfolio/cram LC to pass an interview. Or should I ditch the pipe dream of being an iOS dev and self-study more traditional SWE concepts/languages? I feel like even though I have a degree since I took 2 years off I’m irrelevant and not desirable. And advice or guidance would be helpful and appreciated!"

I have talked to my professors and I'm not sure which internships or unis I should apply for if I'm considering careers in any of these fields. I feel like I should clear my mind before I make a choice but I'm not really sure. Is it worth giving up your dream for later?"

I'm coming up on 2 years working here, but I've always wanted to really work in Computer Science or Software Development or a related field.  

The more I work in IT, (if you even could call this IT and not glorified customer therapy work) the more I realise that this is only paying the bills, and not actually advancing me towards what I want.

I've had some college experience but no degree, I've tried to use online bootcamps and such to teach myself the skills, but I find it hard to dedicate time to such a broad spectrum of skills.

I've come to a realization that I probably need to find a niche, or specialization to focus on before I can really sell myself.  I need to get good at something specific and built a portfolio with it, but I don't have much insight as to what I could even research or specialize in.  

The first thing that comes to mind is making browser or desktop plugins, or mobile device application development, but I don't really have any information as far as how that would pan out.  

Can I please get some advice?  Should I focus on specializing? Should I put myself out there for internships?  Should I stick with my current job until I can go back to college?  I'm getting really tired of life and money getting in the way, but I want change."
vlhntb,4,2022-06-26,Army COOL and Certificates on ECE,Tyrone-fishbricks,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/vlhntb/army_cool_and_certificates_on_ece/,"Good Afternoon 

This post is more geared to members of the Armed Forces, however if anyone has advice to share I would appreciate it. Short summary about myself, I am a specialist in the Army National Guard and am currently pursuing a bachelor's in electrical and computer engineering. My MOS is 35F.

First, are there any certificates in Army COOL that would be useful to get while I pursue a degree that would help me land internships, or a job after graduation. I've been eyeballing the CompTIA certs (Sec+, A+, etc.), leadership certs, and management certs. There are some certs on the information collection side of my job that are interesting, however I am not terribly interested in them.

Secondly, I'm not terribly satisfied with my MOS and have been considering 35T to reclass into. This would give me experience in Solid State Electronics, Digital Circuit design, and troubleshooting PCBs. I already have experience with these, but what's the harm in getting more experience. I will get fiber optics certified by 3M and learn how to build and build cat-5 cables. I will gain experience with Unix, Sun Solaris, and Windows networking. I would also gain an Associates in Electronic Technology. I feel like I could confidently handle this course.

I am looking to develop my skills as an electrical/computer engineer and become marketable in the civilian market. I don't mind working in a SCIF.

Any advice or questions are appreciated. Sorry for the long post. Thank you for any help."

* 10	Careers in History and Geography. Courses offered and opportunities to work.
* 11	How to figure out what one wants from their career?Like I see a lot of students who want to do Engg or Medical and stuff and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that provided YOU are interested in the subject! I am a PCMB student and although I'm going to appear for JEE and probably NEET too next year I don't think my heart lies in either of those streams. And the thought of spending the rest of my life doing something I am not even interested in the first place, really disturbs me. But, again at this point I'm not sure what I actually want to do in life. So, yeah maybe I'm the only one but it would be of great great help if I could find a detailed article about this.
* 12	Everything you need to know to apply to foreign schools and how to estimate your chance of getting into one.
* 13	Why are JRFs forced to do a PhD?Is it just because the university wants save funds as it is cheaper to have a PhD candidate than a JRF? Or are there other motivations?
* 14	Actuarial Science, exam prep, scope and experience in India
* 15	Future of academia in Mechanical Engineering. (Preferably from people who are just now completing their PhDs and looking to get into academia, the obstacles they're facing etc)

* 19	Undergrad overseas or foreign universities and Hybrid courses (Few Semesters in India/ and Few abroad)
* 20	Courses for Power Engineering. PhD in the Energy industry. Options after undergoing a diploma course in the same industry. Job prospects, not necessary, but if indicated will be gold.
* 21	Any info on sports mba and is it really effective? How can someone with btech get into the sports industry?(For ex, working with ISL through IMG Reliance as data analyst or something)
* 22	Economics and what can people majoring in economics do to be more employable.
* 23	Alternatives to CA for commerce kids
* 24	Alternatives to medical for PCB kids
* 25	Stuff/programmes to do in India as a gap year student
* 26	MSc in quant Econ Vs MBA in terms of ROI, job opportunity etc
* 27	MBBS from foreign country
* 28	How to prepare for SAT
* 29	MS experience from abroad, special focus on Jobs
* 30	career path and scope of engineers working in VLSI design and computer architecture in India.
* 31	different career paths for a computer science student or a computer science engineer. It should give students an insight about what they may have to do at work or to try for a different position.
* 32	Part-Time sources of income for students in schools and colleges \[advices concerning an Indian-Specific environment\]
* 33	step by step guide on foreign education after high school in india
* 34	Could we have people who are working in some xx field post a detailed guide on  1. how to find employment off campus in their field, and  2. what online courses/projects etc we could do while still in school to be more competitive
* 35	Detailed review of &lt;your college/university&gt;  1. Which course/year you are in  2. What are the Pros and Cons of your college, in academic, non-academic and placement scenarios
* 36	BCA vs B.Sc (Computer Science) vs B. Sc (Information Technology) vs B. Tech (Computer Science Engineering)
* 37	Which engineering branch is right for you? This is so that people don't blindly run after cse and actually choose the branch they would enjoy and can excel in it
* 38	Scope of BDS course and books, instruments required in it.
* 39	BDS vs BAMS course, which one is better?
* 40	humanities courses in delhi university? Their scope? Course over college? How to maximize the experience?
* 41	CAT and general MBA advice. Like is MBA right for you, when is the right time to pursue it, what should be the expectations, what are the pros and cons.
* 42	Using various digital platforms and softwares to aid learning by visualization, active learning,using other blended learning techniques etc , especially for science students.For ex- There's desmos a graphing calculator and similarly geogebra for 3D calculator, geometry etc, these softwares can enhance student's math learning experience.Similarly there's molview for chemical compounds and bonding visualization which can enhance chemistry learning experience.Likewise there would be many such services/softwares and we should also make a list of them to help students learn better!
* 43	The unequal relationship between Profs and students with no safety net for students
* 44	Syllabus needs to include real life topics like parenting, mental health, home maintenance, how to enjoy life, financial planning, etc
* 45	lesser-known professions or sector which the general public think aren't good enough, but surprisingly pays well or have some other advantage like good work-life balance.
* 46	Which countries are best to study PG in as an Indian Graduate. Based in affordability/quality of education/difficulty in getting admissions
* 47	What the education system is not teaching.
* 48	Career in Public Health , prospects and career graph et al
* 49	IPMAT Preparation

vljq1b,13,2022-06-26,Salary negotiations for intern into junior role?,D_Doggo,DevelEire,https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/vljq1b/salary_negotiations_for_intern_into_junior_role/,"I'm at a tier 2 company as an intern and my internship is ending soon. I'm hoping that I will get a job offer as my team seems to like me and think I've done a good job so far. I would say my salary currently is quite satisfactory for an intern. 34k at the moment.

How much would a junior make compared to an intern? Should I aim for +10k or be more modest?"
vlk538,3,2022-06-26,[WeWantOut] 29M and 28F USA -&gt; Anywhere,limin4lsp4ce,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/vlk538/wewantout_29m_and_28f_usa_anywhere/,"My wife and I are based in the Midwestern US and we are interested in relocating to virtually any place that has a stable democracy and a good human rights record.

I am on the verge of graduating with my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Information Security. I work as a lead PC repair technician (it's a pseudo-managerial position) for a major company, although I am currently in search of an internship or junior position that is more relevant to my field of study, such as software engineering. My wife hasn't attended college, but she does plan to begin working toward an engineering-related degree once I graduate in 2023. She has worked for a Fortune 500 e-commerce company for several years - first as a heavy equipment trainer and now as a manager.

We have about 15K in savings and we could likely *at least* double that by the time I graduate. We are fortunate enough to outrightly own our home, so we don't have a mortgage. However, we do live in one of the most economical real estate markets in the country - if we sold our house today, we'd probably get about $150K for it. If the right opportunity came along (AKA, a solution that has a decent chance of resulting in permanent residency elsewhere), we would be comfortable with selling it.

Although we currently earn just over 100K per year, we are relatively low maintenance people and require very little beyond having our basic needs met. I understand that software engineers make comparatively lower wages in Europe and other places than here in the US, but we are fine with that. We are also confident in our ability to learn a new language - we have been taking online German classes together for the last several months and we are doing well with it. Also, my wife speaks conversational Mexican Spanish.

Any advice whatsoever is greatly appreciated!"
vlk9az,3,2022-06-26,Best time to apply for 2023/when is too late?,clinical27,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/vlk9az/best_time_to_apply_for_2023when_is_too_late/,"I ask this mainly because I am pretty busy with an IT internship this Summer + Summer classes - I have had little to no time to study CS lately, so I plan on going hard in the Fall. Only problem with this is I don't know how fast I'll be able to build a few decent projects to go with my resume.

Where would be the sweet spot for me in terms of getting some projects on my resume but also not applying to places too late? Is December/January a bad idea? I could maybe start applying October/November but I'd really like to give myself as much time as possible to study for coding questions and also build some stuff for the resume.

Also I will be a sophomore hence why I don't really have anything on the resume project wise yet, and yea I'm aware that brings my chances down. But still, would love to know when the latest is I could apply to most places and still be in a good running."

I am currently trying to make a move out plan after I graduate from university (going into my 3rd year now). I have lived at AP’s home and commute ~2h total (sometimes more) to get to my campus ever since starting my program during covid. 

I feel very conflicted going into this year, and debating on if I should get a room for myself to save my mental health, or just endure another mentally challenging year. I would need to finance all of this myself (no financial support from parents bc they think it’s a waste of money and also don’t think i’m capable). 

Technically, I can support myself and get by for a full term since i’m doing a internship this summer, but it will be very tight.

My question is should I hold off another year to save up for a big move after graduation, or just gtfo now? and maybe work overtime on summers again? 

Curious to hear how some people do it and for those who moved out successfully after graduation, what were some unexpected surprises or things you’d do differently? 

Anything helps x"

If any kids are interested, I'm teaching an intro to coding class this summer beginning July 8th. I'll be teaching the basics of Java and making sure to go slow and understand all the concepts in a clear and concise way with visual help. Learning coding isn't about memorization, but practice so I will be assigning HW every week. 

I'm doing this for free because I also had a private teacher and he has had such a huge impact on my life. I'll be having classes on zoom for 2 hours every week, along with 2-4 hours of homework.

My qualifications: I've been coding on and off since 7th grade, but have really stuck to it and been coding for about 2 years now. I've done USACO, a robotics and computer vision project, built a game of chess, chatbot for real estate agents and currently have an internship at a Medtech startup. I just graduated from Bronx Science and am going to the University of Buffalo.

I trained for one year within my company from a guy who had never written a line of code to a tested React developer, and am currently 2.5 months into a six month internship with the same company. I don't have a CS degree, and am sort of... bad at trivia? I code by muscle memory.

The projects I work on are no slouch. They definitely don't pull the punches. I get the same tasks as any dev at the company, they just give me longer to do it. For my last assignment I had to learn D3 from the ground up and build data visualisations for an in-house site, and I'm currently building out API calls for a webapp that scrapes social media for data.

My last review was glowing. We hold space in our sprint retro to be constructively critical in both directions, for me and for my team leads on where improvements could be made. The only feedback I got was that I exceeded expectations at every point.

I feel hireable, and I am consistently proving that I am a competent programmer, but I'm horrified at the deadline since my contract is up in October. I need a long-term job. Are there roles I can be focusing on that will have a lower standard of entry, or types of companies that are more likely to hire a dev with only 1.5 years experience when the time comes?

A consultant who used to engineer for Google gave a lecture to my cohort recently and the barriers to entry are astounding. I'm moving to Chicago in a couple weeks so I habe already been looking on MeetUp for dev groups so I can network and meet others in the field. Are there steps I should be taking to bolster my chances of success? Are there opportunities to prove my mettle that don't hinge on anxiety inducing psyche evals and live coding challenges for 10 year + experience devs?

I am confident that I am ready to work, but I'm not confident that I will be hired. I love coding, and I don't want to do this wrong and go back to bartending."

I read through a couple of his papers, scoured his twitter, linkedin (I sent him a connection request and he ACCEPTED) and youtube. He seems to be a fantastic person to work with. He is working in a research field that very thoroughly excites me. I am planning to reach out to him asking if any opportunities are open in his lab. 

A) Should I do it over email or should I write the same message on LinkedIN?

B) Should I tell him how big of a fan I am and that he is perfect for me in the email? Basically how much thirst can I show in the email before it gets weird?

Am terminat facultatea ( de inginerie ) la Sibiu. Acolo am fost 2 ani și ceva ( în timpul facultatii ) pe partea de automotive ( c, matlab etc ) la Continental unde am plecat din internship din anul 2 de facultate. 

A fost pandemia, și după ce am terminat, aproape un an am stat pe bara, dar nu degeaba.  Am făcut proiecte personale și le am încărcat pe github, în mare parte proiecte cu Angular și Spring Boot ( java ). Deci un portofoliu as avea.

Acum... treaba este ca mi am dat seama ca nu prea vreau sa am de a face cu C sau chestii low level. Ceea ce ma atrage e partea asta de front end, back end, chiar full stack ( dar asta pe viitor ca știu ca nu angajează nimeni full stack cu 0 experiență ).

Sunt conștient ca experienta mea de 2 ani de matlab e egala cu 0 la un interviu de JavaScript sau angular sau java python etc. 

Care sunt șansele mele sa ma angajez pe treaba asta ? Cunoașteți firme care accepta începători și nu i lasa chiar sa moara de foame ? As accepta și un 3500 4000 știind ca in 6 luni 1 an îmi creste salariul și ca am ce învață de acolo. Internship cu 2000 nu prea îmi mai permit acum...."

vlrdnm,103,2022-06-27,I just accepted an offer to work at a dream internship but...,Seek_Bot123,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/vlrdnm/i_just_accepted_an_offer_to_work_at_a_dream/," 

They're asking for an unofficial transcript to verify my GPA is over a 3.0. Well to be completely truthful: it's not. It's currently at like a 2.7 at the moment. I slacked off a lot during Covid and my grades took a deep hit for the 2 to 3 semesters I was from home. I know I have no one but myself to blame for this. I was supposed to transfer fall of 2021 but got held back an extra semester to transfer to my current university (because I failed to pass one of the classes required to transfer) and that's when I really started to focus up on school again. I went back to take the extra semester that Fall and passed with straight As. Then I took a gap semester for the spring and am returning to school starting this summer (I'm taking a summer class right now before going into the Fall semester 2022 full time).

Right now I'm really trying to focus on my future right now because I know I screwed up bad with my grades and I feel like I'm falling behind. That's why I was constantly applying to internship after internship this summer trying to find a place that will take me. And that's when the place that I just accepted to reached back out to me for an interview. It's a really nice accounting firm based in a pretty rich affluent area close to where I live where other really nice and prestigious firms and businesses are also based. On LinkedIn it has a pretty high rating and everything I've heard from this firm regarding it's customer service, work culture, and work life balance for its employees are really good. Needless to say that interview and the second round technical review that came after went really well. I really got along well with my interviewers and specifically some of the guys in the IT department that I would be working with. One of my interviewers even gave me his phone number and reached out to me personally to say I got the job. The internship was half remote and half in-person so I could come in the office on days where I don't have my summer class and work from remote on days that I do. Not to mention the internship is paid and pays pretty highly.

This is literally a golden opportunity for me to get my foot in the door and get some real quality experience under my belt and on my resume at a real turning point in my life. This position has everything that I could every ask for and then some. Not to mention the company itself offers future pathways for interns that they like and want to stay with them. And the best part was, is that some of them expressed I would be the perfect person to take this position with them right now. They emailed me the official offer agreement and I've already accepted and signed off on it. The problem is now I have to go through a screening and background check which includes having to email them a copy of my unofficial transcript. Although they never specified in their initial job posting or in their application about a GPA requirement, I probably should've known this would come back to bite me in the ass at some point.

I thought about maybe editing or forging my transcript in order to pass but then as I was researching this I found a bunch of people who said doing that even for an unofficial transcript for an internship is career suicide and can potentially get me in legal trouble. And for someone still in school and doesn't have any professional work experience yet that doesn't seem like a smart move for me to run that risk LOL. So the only option I have is to submit my unofficial transcript as is and hope they still take me. It sucks because I feel like I did everything else right from my application and resume to the interviews and emails but it'll be a waste because I didn't take my classes seriously. And the most frustrating part is that the classes I did flunk were all the extra GEs/electives I thought I didn't need to care about at the time. Again, I know it's all my fucking fault because I didn't give enough of a shit about school during Covid.

I guess my question to those who are in my position or people who are recruiters/employers looking at an intern like me is how likely are the chances they still give me the position after this? Or is there anything more that I could do to convince them to keep me? Or what do I say if they start asking about my GPA or classes? Or any other piece of advice you can think of. Sorry if this is a bit long and thanks if your still reading lmao but I'm kinda freaking out right now knowing that I could've avoided all of this if I just paid attention and tried in some of my classes."

It’s a relatively small team, and I’ve taken on a fair amount of responsibility, being the sole developer on projects  used in key areas of the business, as well as carrying a similar workload as the rest of the team.

My yearly review is coming up and I feel like I deserve a greater level of compensation at this stage as I’m taking on the same work as regular developers, but is it acceptable to ask for a raise when I’m technically still an intern?

If so, by how much? My current comp isn’t exactly great, less than the average for an internship year in my city, and significantly lower than a graduate salary at my company. 

Especially given now that I’ve a years experience with the code base, what do you think?"

So if anyone knows how to run away and not get legally found again, pour in some some advice for me. 

I'm M22 living in India. I'm currently doing post graduation diploma in marine engineering after completing my mechanical engineering. I come from a lower middle class family, and i have been in a long distance relationship for the past 4 years. 

After my graduation was complete in September 2020, i got a job as an apprentice in an OEM company, but seeing the current job market situation due to saturation of mechanical engineers many of you might know what is the state of employment in this country. Low level pay with almost no respect. 

So after that I decided to seek other options. So I searched, talked to some people in the industry and decided to pursue marine engineering. One point to note is that at this time I was in really bad terms with my gf and didn't consult her while taking this decision. So I studied really hard for entrance exams of some companies and colleges and finally got into a college (in june 2021) which is probably the best in the country. The college is owned by a huge ship manager operating our of Hong Kong. And with admission they give trainees employment as well. So my future income source was assured. Coming from a lower middle class family of four owning a small 1 room kitchen house I have always thought about earning decent money and improving my life. The fees of this course are 6.5 lakhs for one year and i had to take an education loan to finance my education.

My college was about to start in January 2022. My gf is a dentist and she was doing her internship during July 2021 and said that I should come where her college was so we can live a few months together. So I again found one temporary job and went there. Now at this point she knew that I'm taking admission in marine engineering. 

When I was living with her, sometimes things were good sometimes bad. But still it was what it was. Now my college started in January 2022 in online mode, and offline mode in April 2022. Now the problem was that the course is residential, so they do not allow you to go out unless they give a one day leave for everyone on Sundays every two weeks. So after going to my college within two months I met my gf twice. 

But then suddenly from last one month she has started telling me to leave this since she can't live alone without me. And i have tried to convince her to let me continue. As if i leave this now i will be left with a huge debt with no source of income. Plus the jobs currently available for freshers are really bad, it feels like i will be burdened with emi's for the rest of my life. 

When she pesters me to live this, she threatens me that if i don't listen she will commit suicide. And really don't know how to respond to that. Again she has really had it tough with her family too, feeling unloved most of the time. She comes from a rich family and doesn't has to think about money as much as me. 

So right now i have told her that let me complete this course, and once it's finished I'll leave this career. But doing that certainly feels impossible for me, it has become a torturing experience for me . So I'm thinking about running away from everything and going somewhere where no one can find me. 

So I need advice from you guys how can I run away and not legally be found. I have thought a lot and dont see any other option."

Overall, I've pretty decent grades from 9th -11th - 94.5, 98, 93 ( PCM)

Here is the sucker, I was always considered ""smart"" by my peers but something about me and SAT english doesn't sit right. I gave once and got a 1460 and again and got a 1470 ( 790 math 670-680 eng). I'm loosing hope and it is indeed very stressfull managing all my ecs with sat and school studies during senior year.

Intended major : econ

Overview of my ECs :

Non profit related to civic innovation with funding from multiple organisations. - i don't wanna dox but pretty cool, we do offline programs and have a lot of actual impact!

Spring fellow - Civics unplugged and now a builder - helps in further engaging in the international community.

2 paid jobs one in 11th summer , one in 12th. ( one with a us based startup and one with a unicorn startup in my country)

Vice president and president of Econ club of my school ( 11th and 12th)

Director of community services of my school - plan multiple drives of volunteering, including multiple students to give them exposure and also make impact in the local community

MUNs- pretty cliche but participated , won and organised in mulitple MUNs ( 9th to 12th)

multiple volunteering/leadership positions : country director of a dubai based NGO, event head of a local ngo in my city, and other volunteering positions at few of them.

I have my own clothing brand- not big , we have currently 30+ sales in a month - it's clothes related to gen-z humour that aren't cringe( i MEAN most clothing companies have cringe millenial humour clothing in the name of

My life has been difficult, so so difficult. The first few weeks were miserable, too miserable to even define my state of mental and physical health, then I could feel myself moving on from this state. I deleted all of my social media accounts in the month of march(except reddit since she isn't here), also deleted hers and our pictures together. I fell in love with this woman so deeply that I forgot to love myself and I used to define my happiness with her, I had planned everything with her and even she did. She named our future kids and also planned the wedding. Thinking about this makes me cry from the bottom of my heart but I won't feel bad anymore. This is where the mistake and problem occurred, I was needy and my goal was to marry her and settle in life. Well, she did dump me stating that she couldn't see a future with me. That's fine and I've started to accept the reality. In the month of April, I did an internship at Zoho for a month and eventually ended up getting the job with a great pay. My job starts from Jan 2023 as a SDE in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.  


Why am I talking about this? This is because, today behaving like an arse, I stalked my ex on Instagram, I saw her profile picture. Well, reality hit me too hard. She has been to UAE. She always spoke about this to me because I've been to the UAE and also been a resident when I was young. I'm happy that she got what she wanted for a long time, but here I'm still feeling like a loser. I'm not saying she's moved on easily, but it seems like I've haven't moved on.

I've decided to work really hard from here onwards. This is not to prove her or anyone, but to prove myself that **I'VE BEEN SHITE ALL THESE YEARS AND I'VE TO CHANGE**. Yes I'm being too hard on myself, because I want to become the best and get the best out of me because I can.  


I'm a porn addict, a huge procrastinator and a junk by my mental state, but **I'LL CHANGE**. I'm going to come to this reddit post 2-3 years later and reflect on how my life has been.   
What I want in my life is -

1. Secure a CGPA (Indian Education System) &gt; 8.5 
2. Hit the gym + cycling + swimming.
3. Learn Spanish.
4. Work on my designing skill (Product designing).
5. Work for a while in Zoho and save a good amount of money for myself.
6. Get good scores in GRE and IELTS, secure a college seat in a good design college in the USA.
7. Invest on stock and learn more on personal finance.

I CHALLENGE MYSELF TO BECOME THE BEST VERSION, lets see how I fair!  
Not a lot know what men go through during depression, but I can say confidently that when a man says he's done with being weak, he will get better, **he'll become the best**.
**I'LL GET BETTER AND STRONGER**

I'm an intern at a company I only planned on working at while i was in school. I let them know that when they hired me. My internship will end when I graduate in the winter. I haven't been happy at my job for the past 3 months. Mainly due to lack of management. I started looking for a new job with the intentions to work both at the same time. I got an offer on the spot for a job that pays more and would give me benefits. With my new jobs shifts I wouldn't be able to work two jobs and go to school so I wrote my two weeks notice. When I gave it to my boss he tried to get me to stay by telling me how much they need me but I had to stay firm because i wouldn't be able to start my new job. As required I had to send an email to my coworkers letting them know I would be leaving. Since then I have gotten a handful of backhanded comments about leaving when we're busy and how the whole schedule will need to be redone because I couldn't make it work. Our busy season is May to June. My last day is way after that. With everyone saying that me leaving is messing with schedules I feel guilty. Even my boss has made comments on how since corndog is leaving the schedule will be out later than normal. I feel like I'm letting a bunch of people down

I used this stack in a bootcamp some years ago and naturally mentioned it in my application. I applied directly on the portal for the backend engineer role becaue there was no email to send an application to and i was just trying to cold text them.
then next in just a few moments i got a reply which i assume is automatic asking me to do a coding challenge first,  "" The test will be to write MongoDB, ExpressJS, NodeJS API based on some requirements ..."".
So this is probably not a senior role or something but how fucked am i really? Should i just try to do the challenge and get as much practice for it as i can? Where can i practice for that stack in the first place? Right now i am redoing the bootcamp in hope to grasp some stuff but yeah. Should i try and reach out personally to them? I never did a coding challenge and my experience is just code along."

I did not start from complete scratch but my previous experience was mostly playing around and writing only rudimentary code. At that point the biggest program I've ever written was no bigger than about 10 lines of code.

I am a very distracted person and have huge trouble focusing (performed poorly at school, inconsistent results) I have been suspected to have ADHD but never bothered to get diagnosed as I'm otherwise pretty functional. The biggest hurdle for me was not the difficulty, it was finding the motivation to write something useful. Every time I thought about something, I would discover an existing program that was much better written and that would actually work beautifully and had no idea how the code worked. It was very demotivating. 

Following comprehensive tutorials felt like filling a colouring book, sure they produce great looking results and all but teach nothing. I would even argue that full A-Z tutorials are more suitable for intermediate programmers who can understand the whole picture.

Where it really clicked is when I stopped looking at those full tutorials. I instead tried to come up with my own sauce regardless of how bad my implementation was. It is far more satisfying to come up with your own designs even if the end result is ugly. This forced me to break down the project into much more targeted learning sessions, seeking feedback and continuously trying improve. Instead of chugging huge 10 hours tutorial, I focused on learning how to write **individual components** regardless of the language used. I also stopped listening to conventional wisdom and picked up C++ and wrote a very basic 3D renderer in OpenGL and a parser which I eventually want to make it parse a very small subset of HTML5. I'm definitely not claiming it was easy but the difficulty is a bit overblown. For example front end web is typically considered easier but it too has its own complexities that are often overlooked once you dive deeper.

Finding long term friends wasn't easy. Forming a team with complete strangers to create something didn't work well at all but I eventually met a few people whom I am still in touch with. This probably was one of the bigger factor that kept me going even if we didn't necessarily worked together, the Discord server I started sort of turned into a casual programming themed community which I think is for the better anyway.

I grew the habit of committing at least 5min to a programming related activity every morning, this often leads to much long sessions on days I feel like it and on days I don't well, it's just 5min. Also taking a few months long hiatus actually turned out great. I felt ashamed at first, especially after revisiting my old repos and not remembering anything I wrote but my overarching understanding of how programs worked actually improved. I always came back with a fresh mind with better ideas on how to make things run better. So don't be afraid nor ashamed to take long breaks. Pondering is not a bad thing.

The following **definitely** **didn't work** for me (as a beginner):

\- Comprehensive hand holding tutorials

\- Pure language tutorials when the goal is learning to program, even if labelled as beginner friendly

\- Long arbitrary code marathons

\- Writing code for the sake of writing code

\- Starting complex projects with complete strangers

\- Problem solving challenges unrelated to what I was doing

It has to be said that as a beginner, everything feels like drinking from a fire hose and it's normal. Programming is not natural to humans and it feels unintuitive at first but I promise **it gets better**. It does not require superhuman abilities to get something going, just the desire to learn and improve.

So just try to have fun doing something you find interesting, don't rush and don't do it solely for the money. Of course none of the above applies if you are a student or already working as an intern were external pressure do matter. I am fortunate enough to have the time to learn at my own pace. Still, life is too short for burnouts, so no matter the goal, there is no need to push too hard

Anyway I have few questions and hope to get some advice about CS modules from CS seniors here.

background abt myself (so that answers provided can be more relevant): I enjoy maths esp solving maths questions and proving stuff. Did some basic online computing course (cs50 etc) so i consider myself a beginner in programming.

1. Is taking MA1521 and MA2001 during the same sem manageable?
2. Should I take CS2100, CS2030S and CS2040S (the trinity mods) during the same sem?
3. How should I plan my modules for my 4 years (I wish to do orbital if possible and not keen to do SEP)?
4. Is doing internship during Y4 ""weird"" or should I clear it during Y3 which I assume is more common?
5. How's the modules under swe and computer security focus areas (currently looking at doing these 2 focus areas) and are these 2 focus areas popular hence lowering my chance of getting when I register them?
6. Is using my UEs to do more focus area mods worth it (to gain more knowledge) or i shld just use it on easy mods from other faculties?
7. Is doing double major in cs + maths common in nus?
8. what mods shld i take to ease myself into nus cs for y1s1?
9. should I use my s/u on general/common curriculum mods?

I know that's a lot of questions but I hope to get some answers cos I'm clueless about what mods to do. Thanks in advance for the answers!"

I know some of you feel a sense of urgency – like everything has to be done right now for your applications, but you have time. I promise. Of course, stay within your high school’s guidelines for submitting applications, but honestly, the best thing you can do for your applications at this point is to take a break. Allow yourself time to unwind, settle in, have fun, and recharge for when you do have those real inevitable time crunches. [Read more about taking care of your mental health here. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/v3a6c2/you_are_not_alone_belated_thoughts_about/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

😎Summer Plans: Now’s the time to finalize your summer plans if you haven’t done so. I suggest a summer job, community service, reading books for fun! -- and an independent project of some kind. If you’d rather do research or an internship of some kind or volunteer somewhere, that’s all good. It’s just time to get organized. [Be sure to read this post on Summer Plans for much more info.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/nenai9/so_lets_talk_about_summer/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

📧 College-Admissions-Only Email Address: Make a college-only email address if you haven’t already. I suggest firstname.lastname.college@gmail.com. Use that to request info from all the colleges on your list or that you're considering so far. And use it to create your common app account. Do not use this email for anything besides college admissions! You will be overwhelmed by emails and it needs to be easy to find info from colleges. I suggest giving your parents access to this email address so they can help you stay on top of info from colleges!

📕Read and Research: Time to Research and Read! If you haven't yet gotten these books, I suggest you start reading them now: *The Fiske Guide to College Admissions, Colleges That Change Lives,* and *Where You Go is Not Who You'll Be.* [Link to my post about reading and my favorite admissions (and non-admission related) books. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/oab6jp/admissionsmoms_summer_book_club_come_read_with_me/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) For research, be sure you are thinking about what’s important to you in your college educational experience and spend time looking into that: size, programs, student and social vibe, location, geography, weather, and state laws may all be important factors for you. This is time to dig in and figure out what you care about and then learn more about colleges that fit what’s important to you. 

📝 Standardized Testing: Complete your SAT/ACT testing or make your plan about testing  -- I think many colleges will continue to be test-optional next year, so go with your testing comfort level.

💻 Net Price Calculators: Start exploring net price calculators on college web pages so you can see what works best for your family in determining costs. Before a school’s finalized on your list, make sure it’s in the range of affordability by using the net price calculator on the college’s website. If it’s not and they don’t offer merit scholarships, I suggest taking it off the list. You really don’t want to saddle yourself with debt or face great disappointment about not paying for a school if it’s unnecessary. I have net price calculators linked to over 500 colleges on my website, collegevizzy, or you can just google net price calculator and college name to find it too (usually). 

💌 Letters of Recommendation: Think about who you want to ask for your Letters of Recommendation if you haven’t done this yet. [Be sure to check out this post with more info about LORs](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/nh2ihv/hello_juniors_its_time_to_think_about_letters_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) \-- especially if your school doesn't follow a particular protocol. If you’re already out of school, just start thinking about this now and make your plans to ask in the fall. You can begin working on your brag sheets and cheat sheets for teachers. 

📚Course Selection: You need to finalize your senior year course selection with your school. If you’re already out of school for the summer, just do a check for your courses for next year. You can regroup with your advisor when you head back if they are already off. I realize everyone has different plans for college lists and circumstances, but in general, I like to see: [(Post with more info is here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/t82ppp/happy_sunday_juniors_and_sophs_and_freshies_too/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

* Math (preferably Calc -- especially if you’re applying to Highly Selective (rejective colleges)
* Science (doesn’t matter what it is as long as you’ve had at least one year of physics, chem, or bio (especially if you’re applying to highly selective colleges)

I have been working recently and have been putting aside $2500 a month exclusively to be put towards a down payment in around two years time. Two years is arbitrary but that is when I expect to buy a house. It could be later but it won’t be any sooner since I graduate in May 2024.

I’m saving for the next year so I expect to save $30,000 total for a down payment by May next year (my internship term will end by then and I will return to school for my final year).

I currently already have max contribution to my TFSA and will have another $6,000 independent of my down savings payment to put towards the next year’s TFSA contribution. This money in my TFSA also is invested with the goal of using it to buy a house one day.

My question is what I should do with my down payment money so that it isn’t just sitting in the bank. It currently is in a high interest savings account but last month it made 40 cents on the first $2,500 that I had in there. I’m hoping to put it somewhere so that it can grow for the next couple years. 

Any suggestions is greatly appreciated and I thank you all for your feedback!"

In regards to my mother, I honestly think she is a caring person. I believe the only reason why our relationship is bad is because there is no one in the family to tame our egos at times. I've treated my mother very cruelly since I get pissed at the fact that she never fully understands where I am coming from and because she sometimes intrudes on my privacy. I've taken her for granted as she's always there for me financially and she sometimes brings me gifts that I reject in a dismissive fashion (yea I'm an A-hole). However, she has done things under my name without my consent (ie apply for internships) and forced me to do various things that ""other successful kids do"" without encouraging my own interests.  I realize her advice and the things she forces me to do always come in a manner of conformity which, depending on the situation and context, can be either good or bad. I sometimes get very angry at the fact that she gives advice in this manner and I have had some really explosive arguments with her which in hindsight were very unnecessary.

The main problem lies with my father. I don't think I know my father well and I don't think he knows me very well. His English isn't very good which might be why I can't communicate with him well as well as why he doesn't have a very stable job. When I do talk to him about life, I find that he is a very opinionated person (perhaps I am too). He seems to be someone who acts and talks like he knows more than he does (me projecting). I only say this because when I talk to him about computer science and mathematics (my majors) he acts like ""he knows his shit"" when in reality it's just a bunch of random stereotypes that people say. Also whenever we talk about philosophers, he seems to have a very anti-Semitic world view and a very pro-China world view. Perhaps this is just the difference between being raised in China vs being raised in the US.

Despite these language barriers and educational and cultural differences, I find it very hard to see him as nothing but a narcissist with OCD. He's rather cold and distant and I doubt that I have ever heard him say anything nice and caring out of his mouth for a very long time. Every time my mother cooks food, he always complains about how my mom must clean the kitchen before serving a meal even though before this he wasn't doing jack shit. He also appears to always need to make things orderly for the sake of doing so and even gets pissed when I don't do the laundry his way or if I don't fold the blankets his way. It gets pretty bad because every time I get mad, he always says in Chinese ""you have a mental health problem"" or tells my mom ""It's your fault these kids have problems"". Sometimes whenever my mom and I have an argument, he would make assumptions, and tell us to ""shut up"" which just makes things worse. Maybe I have some really high expectations here but I wish that my father would at least be a chill dad who ""listens"" to the argument and acts as a moderator or advice-giver rather than an annoyed and anxious person.

I haven't heard my father say anything positive about me for a while. I've heard him ridicule me a lot and there have been times when he puts me down to complement other people. It seems like he can't find any positive traits about me, maybe because all the characteristics he judges me on are all negative in his eyes. A big example is telling me how much I suck at Chinese when I've heard the opposite opinion from Chinese international students.

I guess this leads me back to my mother. My mother never acknowledges any of this and if she does, she never admits it. She always tells me how successful my father is and praises him even though all he does is complain and gets very triggered when things just get too stressful (I have this characteristic as well tbh). She does show at times that she gets annoyed by him but it doesn't seem to make her question or admit that this relationship is just toxic. I think because of this sole reason, I just view my mother as less competent.

Honestly, typing this made me realize that perhaps my relationship with my family can be improved if everyone went to therapy and if I improved my Chinese. What are yall's thoughts?"

So I am currently doing my Masters degree in computer science (International student)in Malaysia and have 2 months left. So I started applying for jobs just to get experience in interviews. So one company liked me and the hr dept called me ( full stack ). They asked about my visa status and i told them the truth. Now as an international student i cant do a job on a student visa and since i have 2 months left I can't apply for a work visa now either. They noted this and said they will look into it and will notify me later. It has been 3 days ( 5 including weekends). So my questions are-

1. Should i call them to know what they are going to do ? (Is 3 days enough or should i wait for 1 week or smth)
2. Can i suggest something like ""Maybe these 2 months I can work as an intern and later offer a full time job after my graduation? "" 

I still do not know everything about the malaysian laws about   jobs for international students. So forgive me if i said anything wrong. Any feedback is appreciated. Thank you."

Gonna format this a bit weird just to make it less of a read/allow people to skip around.

I'm 21 (but I'll be 23 when I graduate with my bs in comp sci) and I was born in the US. Been living in an abusive household all my life and with the way things have been going in the US (both with respect to being trans and in general), I have no ties here and I've been looking for an out/a fresh start. Canada is my first choice (I have friends in Ontario and Quebec, so ideally I'd go there, but I'm really open to anything) and since I also speak French, I'm open to other options in Europe, particularly any English or French speaking EU countries that are at least somewhat trans friendly.

**Basic info:** 

* Will be 23 when I graduate.
* I'm trans/nb
* Will graduate with a BS in Computer Science, want to be a software dev/programmer
* Already have an associates deg in arts &amp; in science (2 separate degrees)
* Native English speaker
* Roughly a B2/C1 in French (never been tested officially, just going off of online tests)
* Been studying French since high school, was at one point majoring in french (in short, I'm confident in my French ability)

**My various questions:**

* *Applying/Getting Jobs:* When it comes to getting a job in Canada/abroad, will internships alone be enough to get hired off of or would I have better luck working for a year in the US before trying to get a job elsewhere?
   * I'm starting an internship this coming school year so I'd have somewhere just under 2 years of internship experience under my belt by the time I graduate (hopefully)
* *Trans Healthcare:* How does trans healthcare transfer over from the US to Canada (or other EU countries if you know), if at all?
   * I live in an informed consent state so while I'm not currently on hrt, I could theoretically start anytime in the next 2 years. (Probably won't due to my parents, but if I knew I was moving abroad, I could probably get away with doing a few months of HRT without them knowing)
   * I've seen a therapist through my college (not currently seeing them though since we're on summer vacation)
   * Will immigrating reset all my progress? I.e. will I have to go through another 2 years of therapy (or something like that) before I can get access to hrt again? If so, do records of me going to therapy now count for anything?
* *Being trans and trying to immigrate:* Is being trans a hindrance at all to getting a visa/citizenship?
   * and if so, is it worth stealthing through the visa/hiring process?
* *Living in Quebec while trans/nb:* is being trans/nb in Quebec significantly less safe than being trans/nb elsewhere in Canada?
   * I think living in Quebec could be cool given my French language abilities and because I'm friends with a few people who live there, but I know Quebec tends to be a bit more conservative than the rest of Canada.
   * Are there specific places in Canada/elsewhere that you think are best/the most safe for trans people?
   * Inb4 any comments, I understand Canada/Europe isn't a trans utopia, but I'd argue that it's at least somewhat better than the US.

If you have any other tips/advice/questions after reading all this, feel free to ask. I might be a bit slow to respond though. I'm especially interested in hearing from other trans/nb expats if you're willing to share your experiences with me. Thanks!"

For a bit of background, I have recently started my degree and have been finding it quite easy for now (I am self taught). In terms of the bootcamp, it is 12 weeks long, and I dont have to pay for it but it has the typical catch where I dont get to choose where I work. They choose somewhere for me to work for the next 18 months, after this period I can leave or if I leave earlier I have to pay for the remaining duration I didnt work (e.g. if I leave after working for 1 year, I pay $6666) which I am fine with.


Is this a bad idea? Should I stick with just doing the degree + side projects + apply to internships once I have taught myself more in depth front end development or should I expedite the process with the bootcamp?

I should add that my degree is online and quite flexible. Thanks."

So my plan is apply for a normal full-time, and then in September I would tell them something like ""I ended up applying for university so I was wondering if it's possible to reduce my working hours to part-time?""

vm4kiu,2,2022-06-27,Great experience for new grad but no luck,ManiAmara,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vm4kiu/great_experience_for_new_grad_but_no_luck/,"I could really use some help here. I'm a new grad that was planning on taking some time off and going to grad school, but the situation changed and now am in need of a job and have been applying like crazy. I transferred from a school well known for CS to a smaller one that is less well known, and had Machine Learning related research positions and \~3.5 GPA at both. My junior year summer research was published in an academic journal and I had internships freshman and sophomore year at telecoms in Software related positions. I have been using Linux for about 8 years now and am a contributor and maintainer of a couple of fairly large open source projects (&gt;10k stars). All of this is on my CV.

Despite all that, I can't seem to find a decent paying SWE role for my life. I've sent out probably 50 applications the last few weeks and the only one I got a response from was a local company that wants to do a phone interview for a ""Software Test Engineer"" position that will likely pay &lt;80k. The only ""coding"" assessment I got was an automated email from Cisco, that I completed half an hour early. Despite passing all the test cases and finishing early though (didn't change tabs or click off the screen either) , I just got denied from the position without any explanation or interview today.

The referrals I have gotten to larger tech companies haven't even gotten me a phone call, yet my resume has been looked over by a ton of people and it is pretty good. I'm really lost and I don't know what to do. I meet the requirements for many level II positions on paper but getting a decent entry level position is absolutely impossible. I'm afraid that if I wait until the next hiring season for new grads I'll be overlooked but that if I take a position that doesn't actually exercise my skills in the meantime they will dull and I won't be able to move to something better."

I've been fortunate to progress from an intern (and 3rd employee) to a senior manager and witness the company grow from start-up to being a globally recognised leader in our field. This progression has definitely hindered my own salary growth though.

Over the first 6 years I enjoyed rapid salary rises moving from an intern to a middle manager (although under-market salaries, due it still being a start-up). A 7-10% bonus was included and a small amount stock options too (the last of which vested 4 years ago).

Since then things have really stalled whilst my role and continued to rapidly progress into senior management. 4 years ago I was given a 17% increase on my base salary, however my 10% bonus was removed. No further options. Nothing has changed since and I know for certain that I'm still around 35% below market rate.

I've recently been offer a 6% salary increase and bringing back a 10% bonus. I'm having issues with this because:

* The combined package does very little to address the gap vs the market
* €420 extra per month before tax does not add up to the increased responsibilities and expectations on me
* The reasoning behind the bonus being removed 4 years ago was that achieving my targets should be the minimum expected in my position - so why is this now being added back in?

Some hires for my team which I feel necessary to achieve targets have been put on hold for now. One of those hires (which I requested and budgeted) is actually budgeted 20% higher than my updated offer. This hire may still happen in September. I would find it unacceptable to have someone who reports to me earning more.

I'm not sure of the best way to address this - the gap between my package and market rate is way too big, yet hires have been frozen as budgets are tightening. At the same time I've been offered something at least... and the company knows that I'm loyal  and unlikely to quit on the spot if I don't get my way."

Towards the end of last summer, I applied for quite a few internships, then got one for my Fall and Winter semesters.

Early this year, around late Winter, I've had a ton of interviews (about 5 - 6) for different companies and some back to back. I applied for these jobs about mid-Winter. Sadly I couldn't take any offers due to complications involving location. 

Now it's the middle of summer and I'm struggling to get responses. I'm not really sure what it is, but I'm guessing the middle of summer isn't a good time to apply.

In school, I was a jack of all trades, master of none. I learned a lot of programs, but only on a very basic level. I made a lot of projects, but most of them were abandoned as soon as they were graded. I was terrible at 3D modeling, but I was pretty good at Photoshop, drawing, and writing.

The main thing that made me stand out was writing. I got a leg up with the head of my department because she was impressed by my writing, specifically an extensive design document I created for one of my senior-year classes. I also had a few other big successes in my Junior and Senior year, projects that went well and instilled me with a greater sense of confidence.

I had been kind of a fuck-up in highschool. I had attention deficit problems and my teachers were always frustrated with me because I could barely stay focused in class, and was always drawing and day-dreaming. So, finding success in college was a big deal to me. It felt like I was finally had direction in life.

Once out of college, my success continued. I found an internship with a game studio in San Francisco. I basically told them I would move out there and work for free just to get my foot in the door. This was back in like 2010. It was the early days of Facebook games, and the company was trying to make games similar to Farmville and other big hits of the time.

I did well at first. I worked my ass off. I employed the ""first one in, last one out"" method. I only had about three months worth of savings to live on, from a summer job. I had no idea what I was going to do if the internship ended and they didn't hire me.

I was working as a ""game design intern"", but I began leveraging my art skills for extra work. Pretty soon I was also taking on some concept art assignments that I would work on after I finished all my game design work. The hours were long, but I loved every minute of it.

To my surprise, one day the head of the studio took me into a conference room and told me that they were really impressed with me and wanted me on the team. They offered me a salary of $55,000. That was one of the most exciting moments of my young adult life. I felt like I had made it. To me, back then, $55,000 was an incredible sum of money. I basically floated home that day.

Shortly after that, I moved into an actual apartment. I had been renting a bedroom up until that point for $400 a month. I found a tiny studio apartment to call my own for $1150 a month. I was a young guy in an awesome city and everything was coming together. The fuckup from highschool had made it after all.

For a while, things were great. There were challenges, but work was exciting and interesting. I got to work with some awesome artists and designers, who I learned a lot from. I managed to get the ear of some of the head programmers, and I realized I had a knack for communication. My unique role as part game-designer / part artist allowed me to bridge those two departments in a unique way.

The only real problem was that I had pretty intense social anxiety. I was painfully shy, but I made it work. I forced myself to speak up for myself and be assertive. For the most part, it worked out.

But then, something happened. My company decided to clone a popular indie game. I happened to have a soft spot for indie games, and I knew that studio in particular. I was a big fan of their work. My company had been courting them to publish their new game, but instead we just copied it, released a clone, and dropped them. 

I was furious, and I was young, and I thought the only right thing I could do was quit. I had dreams of being an indie developer anyways. It was the golden age of indie games, and I worshipped those early indie devs like Derek Yu and Ed McMillen, among many others.

So I quit. I quit despite the warnings of my parents. I quit despite the warnings of my co-workers. I quit despite my own reservations. But I quit anyway and set out to become an indie game developer, despite not knowing how to code, thinking that I could somehow figure it out all on my own and make a successful game.

But then something awesome happened. The indie studio that my former company ripped off reached out to me. They had heard through the grape vine what I had done. They wanted to work with me, and they offered me a job as an artist for one of their new games. I was over the moon. It would provide income for me while I studied and worked in my spare time on my own game.

It was fine at first. But a creeping feeling began to set in that I had made a horrible mistake. I was working from home all the time (a full decade before COVID struck), and I became more isolated and lonely. I missed working with all the talented people I'd gotten to know. 

Then, my former company went under. They had merged with a shady company, and then the shady company laid everyone off a couple months later. It was a disaster.

However, they held a massive hiring fair. Other companies came around. Basically everyone got picked up for a new job. They went to places like Zynga and EA and Telltale Games. I had missed the boat by just a handful of weeks.

Despondent, and increasingly lonely, I struggled emotionally and physically. I felt lost, even though I had a ""Job"". It put a massive strain on my relationship with my girlfriend at the time. 

Things came to a breaking point, and we broke up. She wanted to move to LA, I didn't. I decided to move to Seattle, where a lot of my friends from college were living and working. 

I was able to keep my remote-work job. In fact, a few of my remote coworkers were actually in Seattle, so I finally got to meet them in person.

Things got better. I was instantly less lonely because I had a friend group, and I'd work out of coffee shops and then hang out with my friends at night. Life was okay, for a while.

But my anxiety and depression got worse and worse. I began drinking fairly heavily. Well, I had started drinking back in San Francisco, but it became way more pronounced in Seattle. I started dating a girl who was a party animal, who also made my life more chaotic. 

My anxiety and depression became so bad that I found it hard to work some weeks. My lead began to notice. He was incredibly kind and patient with me. He said I did a great job when I was ""present"", but sometimes I'd just disappear and he had a hard time even getting hold of me.

I felt worse and worse. I had a harder time focusing as each week passed. I found out my party-animal girlfriend was cheating on me. I decided to take a leave of absence from work to try to figure my shit out. 

I went on a few interviews with local game studios. I had one series of interviews that was extremely promising. I got to the final stage and absolutely blew the interview. It was a big blow to my self esteem and I retreated more into myself.

Then things got worse. I stopped working on my remote job completely. I was so depressed that I couldn't do creative work anymore.

I had to take odd jobs. I got a job at a grocery store, and then I got a job as a concierge. I felt like an absolute failure. I felt worse and worse over time as my feeling of failure compounded and got larger. I had gone from getting a great job straight out of college to working as a concierge for a fancy apartment building. 

Eventually I got fed up, and moved to a different state yet again. My home state. Along the way, I got a bit lucky with crypto and at least had enough money to get an apartment and pay for basic living expenses for a while. But I was still horribly depressed.

I fell in with another alcholic woman, this one even worse than the girl from Seattle. I worked odd jobs. I did random graphic design jobs. I got a bit of help from my parents at some points, which made me feel even worse. I barely managed to squeak by, living as cheaply as possible.

Eventually, I got to the point where I couldn't take it anymore. I didn't want the rest of my life to be like this. I wanted to get back on some kind of good path. 

I began working on getting my shit together. I started exercising. I got out of my toxic relationship and stopped drinking. I got a decently steady job. I started trying to do work again. It has been an incredibly rocky road to get back on my feet, but I feel like I'm starting to get in a better place.

But I have no idea what to do now. I have this MASSIVE gap in my career, with about five years worth of odd jobs and month-to-month type stuff. 

I have no idea how to get back on the ""right track"". I feel like my original career has left me behind. I don't know whether to try to get into an all-new field, or try to return to what worked for me in the past. I have no idea how to answer those questions either, or find a clear direction.

All I know is that I'm completely sick of working from home. I'm completely sick of my life not having a clear direction or purpose. I'm completely sick of barely making ends meet.

I want a life I can be proud of. I want a life I that can make decent money. I just want to be on the normal, good path. 

But I don't know what to do to get back on that path, and I'm trying not to feel hopeless."

My only requirement is a private room and not too far away from campus since I don't have a car. However, the problem is there are so many scammers and fake news on UCI housing pages. I scroll down the page for half an hour but 2/3 of the posts are scammers... Only a few times have I found available housing by real students, but the apts already been taken by others:((

I'm so nervous about finding new housing since my summer lease ends on August 23rd, and I will be pretty busy in next month with my internship. 

Does anyone know where I should go to find available housing from real students instead of scammers who try to cheat on your money?? How do you guys find housing?

I’ve been there since August and have been able to impact the company in many ways, surprisingly as an intern and as a senior undergrad, my first choice was for a conversion. I worked about 25 hours a week and was able to balance it with a full set of classes and senior project. However, I prioritized work above all else and was loyal to the company.

I talked to my boss about conversion at the end of last year, expressing my interest. He supported it saying that I was a great performing intern but said that due to company affairs, they won’t hire right now and will let me know the decision in 2 weeks. I made it super clear to keep me in a loop because I wanted to plan my life accordingly post-grad.

I reached out to him two and a half weeks later, but he said that there has been no decision. A couple months came by and no update. In a 1:1 with my mentor, I expressed my interest in a full time and he said he would talk to my boss. However after a couple weeks, no comment. Prior to graduation, I reached out again to see if there was any response and he ignored my message. 

I am extremely frustrated and tired at this point. It’s to the point where I’m rethinking my experiences. It’s been even harder since I want to lift the financial burden off of my family. I think that even if the answer is uncertain, he should’ve kept me updated as I wished. For all the things I’ve done, I think it would’ve been courteous for him to keep his word. I am currently still working as a full-time intern and interviewing at other places. How should I go about this? Should I just count this place as a loss? Should I bring it up to him again? (It gets kind of awkward/uncomfortable after awhile). Express my concern? Should I quit and go full time into looking for a full time? Is it right for me to feel this way?

I think this issue has been affecting me a lot in my self-esteem especially in the confusing times of navigating life after college.

Some advice is appreciated!

vmfmav,2,2022-06-28,Course plan review for newbie,sheepishlass,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/vmfmav/course_plan_review_for_newbie/,"Hi all! I used to be in the finance industry (BA in finance) before having kids and staying home to take care of them. I got A's in intro programming classes in C++ and Java way back in college (20 years ago) and was thinking about a double major in CS. But ultimately decided to graduate on time and start working first. 

Recently started doing CS50x online and it rekindled my interest in programming. I'm now thinking about pursuing OSU post bacc while taking care of kids at home and maybe pivot into SWE when the kids get older. 

Undergrad GPA 3.5, last 60 units GPA 4.0. Took calculus, statistics, linear algebra (course name was math for management), differential equations (course name was math for econ), but honestly by now I only remember very little.

I would really appreciate any advice on my current course plan. To save some $$ and also because I'm under the impression that starting with C++ may be helpful for later courses and overall understanding of what goes on ""under the hood"", I'm planning on taking classes at Oakton/UND first and transferring in 4 classes (225&amp;261&amp;271 plus 161 or 325), which means I need to take a 4th elective to satisfy the 45 minimum credits at OSU requirement. 

What are my chances of getting in? Does my Oakton credit transfer plan work? Also given my age and gender not sure if finding work would be a challenge?

&amp;#x200B;

But anyway here's my plan:

Fall 2022 - Oakton 155 in C++ (OSU 161 equiv.) and UND 208 (OSU 225 equiv.)

Spring 2023 - Oakton 240 in C++ (OSU 261 equiv.) and Oakton 204 (OSU 271 equiv.)

Also plan to self study python and algorithm by doing some MOOCs before OSU.

**Apply to start OSU in Summer 2023.**

Summer 2023 - Oakton 255 (OSU 325 equiv.) which allows me to submit assignments in C++ and OSU 161 (if I transfer in 325) **OR** just do OSU 325 which I understand is all Python now with no option to submit work in C++? (if I transfer in 161).

Fall 2023 - OSU 162 &amp; 344 (plus applying for internship?)

Winter 2023 - OSU 290 &amp; 372 (elective 1).

Spring  2024 - OSU 340 &amp; 361 &amp; (elective 2 - 475 or 381?)

Summer 2024 - (internship?)

Fall 2024 - OSU 362 &amp; 493 (elective 3)

Winter 2024 - OSU 467 &amp; 492 (elective 4)

&amp;#x200B;

Should I do Oakton 255 or OSU 325? Please let me know your thoughts on course pairing and workload. While I'm not working I do have young kids to look after. Thank you so much!"

vmglys,3,2022-06-28,I (23M) want to get away from my mom (58F) because she’s the reason I can’t be my best self.,HungryAnswer1776,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/vmglys/i_23m_want_to_get_away_from_my_mom_58f_because/,"I get that she loves me and I’ll always love her until the day I die, but what I ultimately want is to put some vast distance between me and her. Ideally, I would want to move to another town far enough to where she’ll not see me during holidays. 

The reason I want to move away from my mother is because she has this antiquated black and white mindset along with a disorderly living situation that I just can’t stand.

She’s from Mexico and as a result of her upbringing, she has this unique mindset that I constantly disagree with. If I try to tell her a way to do something better, she either forgets about it, gets distracted by something else, or gets upset about it and tries to walk away. 

Also, she lives in a way where everything is disorganized and does things in unusual ways. She doesn’t want me cleaning her things up because she doesn’t think I know what I’m doing. Her room, for example, is just messy to the point where her bedroom and bathroom is filled with all sorts of clothes and makeup items she never uses. The bed is covered in clothes too and shes been sleeping in the guest room next to mine for over a year. 

I’ll be gone in grad school starting in August but I’ll be returning to moms house the following May to live with her and it’ll still feel like I have a heavy ball and chain wrapped around my leg.

I can’t afford to have my own place away from her right now and once I graduate from grad school my main goal beyond anything else is to get the fuck out of my Mom’s house and find my own apartment/house where I can be the only one that has a say over how I live my life. Just me in my own hard earned domain. No one else. No parents and not even roommates. 

The only problem I have is that I have no idea how long it’ll take from the time I graduate grad school to where I’ll be making enough cash to support myself. I don’t want it to be any longer than 6 months, but that’s just a goddamn pipe dream. 

I just don’t want to live with her anymore because she’s the reason why I can’t socialize or be more sure of myself when doing things. When I make a minor lifestyle decision that she doesn’t like, she goes on this judgment tirade and lecture about how this certain food “causes cancer” or this choice isn’t “Christian,” for example. I want to live my own life the way I feel like it, and as long as I live with her, that’s impossible. 

I have an internship right now which ends in September and then I’ll be living alone in grad school until the following May. A moment of fresh air. After that though it’s back to mom’s and I don’t know where to go from there. 

I currently make around $30 per hour for 40 hours per week. I did the math and that’s an annual salary of around $60k without taxes. Now this wouldn’t be a problem if the internship didn’t officially end in September. I need a more permanent solution. The best thing I can hope for is hope that my current employer can accept me as a more solid full time employee after grad school. 

Now, if I don’t get that full time employment offer, I’m fucked. It’ll be harder to escape from her and more stressful to deal with her disagreeability. It’ll be a lot harder to live comfortably too. I want to find a job, but I’m afraid that I won’t and more afraid of living with my mom forever because of everything being fucking high priced due to the state of the world we’re in. 

Bottom line is that I love my mom and I always will, but I can’t deal with her bullshit anymore. I want a permanent out, but it feels like an eternity away and I feel more frustrated every day."

Hi Everyone!

I'm currently an incoming senior in UIUC graduating next semester. I really want to pursue a Data Science Masters (cuz work is scary). I'm doing a double major in Mechanical Engr and Statistics and have taken programming classes up to Data Structures and took some data science classes in Stat department. My GPA is 3.45/4 (could be better but I kind screwed up my 1st sem :p) and I'm planning to take the GRE soon. I was hoping to get some advice about getting into an MS data science program because no one I know has done a BS in Mechanical Engr and Stats.

 I don't have much research experience but I am doing an R&amp;D internship which I think is like a research project that uses automation and ML.

Any advice would be helpful and I truly appreciate all inputs :)"

I study psychology at uni and have realised after my second year that going into research or continued study just isn’t the path for me.

It’s not what I expected, constantly getting shut down by what are normal tasks for recruitment, repetitive tasks and overwhelmed with the work I can’t stand.

I have been here for 2 months already and just want to leave. But my mum has been pushing me to stay so it looks good on my cv and for the “experience”

Three months in , i have to admit i hate it a lot, from the team to the job itself. 

I basically write Financial Contracts all days and maintain a shitty Python code that an old intern wrote. Since a new client has come , and after they knew that i code quite well ( i did some webscrapping on a tough website and they think I'm superman because of that ,which is strange ) they think i can solve  any of their shitty database problem magically using Python and they will be able to have a special platform for this client. And they have a deadline for it.

Regarding the team , i have multiple times heard them talking badly about old or current interns first week,that made me hold a chip on my shoulder somehow.

My goal after this internship is to do a gap year, i hope to work as Quant in a bank or fund for my next internship (i have interviews) so far , i get asked more on my personal projects (deep learning , although not an expert ,just experimented with hedging options with it) than this job opportunity. During this internship, i thought i would at least improve my Python skills and learn about finance ,which i honestly didn't and I hate this back office job type of work.

They needed someone to do front end stuff and so they told me they will give me a month time to do the internship project(which is to make an app version of their website) and if it works out it will turn into full time. But the thing is that I have no clue about mobile development and they specifically want me to do it in react native. I have been learning and trying to figure out how to do that but it's sooo difficult. I feel so depressed about not being able to figure it out. I sometimes wish they had atleast a senior frontend dev that I could go to with doubts but even the person i work under doesn't have much clue about react native and just keeps asking me to look it up and figure it out. I do like it in a way but having to do all of this by myself feels so overwhelming. And I don't want to screw this up since they said they will be using my project in their work later.

However, in order to qualify for the capstone, I have to be working full time in the tech industry and be able to provide proof. So I asked my manager BEFORE the internship started if I'd be able to get my placement form signed and he said he'd be cool with it only if the internship program manager gave him permission. I spoke to the internship program manager and she seemed to not want to sign it but said she would speak to HR about it. A week or two past and I received no update so I spoke to HR myself and they said my manager should be okay signing off on it. I followed up with the program manager and she said claimed that she hadn't received an update from HR and again, kind of told me in a way as if she didn't want to sign off on it. So I followed up with my recruiter and she said she'd ask the director if she could help get it pushed through. The director then escalated it to the Legal Dept to see how to proceed and since then I haven't received an update. 

From two weeks ago, I began doubting that it was going to be signed and the deadline is fast approaching, next Wednesday, the 6th. So I decided to email the internship coordinator at my school nearly two weeks ago asking if I could enroll in the capstone instead and he did not reply to my first two emails. I then CC'd his supervisor, the chairperson of the department, and the coordinator finally replied to me, basically giving me attitude telling me that he already told me that I need to get it signed. I then explain the entire situation as I did here and the chairperson replied that I still need to get the form signed and to explain the situation to the company. 

I'm at wits end at this point and I don't know what to do. Something that should've taken 10 minutes to do is now taking nearly a month. I've properly communicated with everyone and followed up and still is being stonewalled or stuck in bureaucracy. I'm set to graduate in December and this Summer was my only opportunity to take either internship or capstone and it's not easy to get another internship in my field."

The pay is $16.50/hour and I’ll be working 20 hours a week. 

Note that I’m currently doing an internship at another company that pays about $18.50/hour, and there’s a chance they may offer me a part time position in the fall, also 20 hours per week at $25/hour. But I have a 15% chance due to them only choosing a small number of the current interns to continue with them, and I think my chances are slim. 

And I’m still applying and interviewing for other companies, I’m afraid I’d accept the new offer and miss out on other potential (maybe better) offers, especially since the new position pays relatively low. 

For context I live in (and the position is in) Mississippi, USA. So relatively low cost of life. 

Also, the new position is only hiring 1 intern, so I’d feel bad if I accepted and later on accepted a better offer.

I started a student internship this summer, my first since starting school. I am enjoying it for the most part although it is a challenge because I have 0 experience in this field and didn’t even learn about it in school. So I’ve had to work extra hard to learn the material and be an asset to the team. I want to be considered for an extension and I know I need to work hard and show them that they should keep me on. 

I’ve had the worst year of my life in many ways. I experienced sexual assault in the summer and struggled intensely for 6 months afterwards. I stopped working out, taking care of myself, drinking a bit more and smoking way too much weed. I did go to therapy right away and in the last few months have been doing exceptionally better mentally. 

My issue is my physical health now, and I feel it gets in the way of my productivity at work. About a month ago I was having chest pains and was allowed to work from home for a couple weeks while I sorted out what was happening. My manager is very nice and reassured me to take care of my health. I was told I had costocondritis (or however you spell it) and was put on anti inflammatories for a long time and are still on them twice a day. Things have gotten so much better but still not 100%. I also stopped taking birth control a couple months ago to try to rekindle my mental health and anxiety levels. Since then my periods have gotten worse each month and because I am on anti inflammatories I cannot take Advil or Tylenol to help me through the day. 

I have gotten to a point in my life where due to my mental health I have learnt to do what is best for me, in order to be my best for others. However, my period should be ending today and I feel sick to my stomach, massive headaches, and just overall unwell. I wanted to see if I could work from home for the afternoon, but I know I don’t have a printer or the ability to do my job fully when I am there. And with the flexibility I’ve been given already I am not wanting to be a burden. This has been a hard year for me and I’ve put so much effort into getting my health better that I’m overwhelmingly frustrated with how I feel. 

Should I just be sticking it out, forcing myself until the end of the day (as I’m sure I’ll survive I’m just so uncomfortable) as I do want to be considered an asset and not a liability.

I would prefer going to college in New England or Colorado. But at the end of the day, I’m not too crazy about what state I end up in as long as there is a liberal lean. (E.g. I would enjoy being at NYU in NYC, but would also enjoy being at Cornell in Ithaca).

Major: Elementary Education, Secondary Education, Education, etc. 

Cost: needs to be under 9k per year out of pocket (after aid, direct+indirect costs).

What I will be doing during my gap year: working as a city year americorps member. Basically, will be an academic and behavioral coach at a school for an entire school year in a major city that’s over half an hour away from my home.

3.39 uw, 3.89w (has to do with Covid interfering with schooling previous year and starting different level of rigor. Took multiple courses during the summer. Took multiple APs this past year and GPA went up a lot. Schools will note that progress.)

vmue9a,31,2022-06-28,it's been 2.5 years and I am still not over my aunt's death and idk what's this problem is called,Kvatsalay,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/vmue9a/its_been_25_years_and_i_am_still_not_over_my/,"I am 22(M), I am shy introverted with bit of a social anxiety. I have only 3-4 friends. I don't have any friends in my neighborhood. I had only 1 friend in my neighborhood but since 2020 he doesn't even talk to me and idk why.

I have spent most of my life with my aunt, my grandma and my 2 cousins (till 2020 basically). I was really attached to them. I used to celebrate diwali and Holi with them and not with my parents. This is how much I was attached to them. In 2019 my grandma passed away. In 2020 one of my cousins got married. After this, in 2020, my aunt had a heart-attack and she passed away. Life was very unfair to her. Basically she was a single mother with 2 daughters and had a lot of tough times.
 
Now it's been 2.5 years since the demise of my aunt and every single time I remember her or miss her I just cry. Like I have no control over it. I have made so many memories with her that it just hurts me that's she's gone forever and how life was so unfair for her. I miss her and our family (my grandma, my cousins) so much that I just cry. I used to listen to old songs with her and I have noticed that there are certain songs that just reminds me of her and I just cry. Bc of sudden death of my two loved ones I feel lonely and I had to quit my internship bc of this. When I was doing my internship in November last year, I didn't had any friends and I was still lonely. It was nothing just office-room, room-office. I used to cry in my room alone. All of my colleagues were working from home so it was just me, my hr and my manager and sometimes our ceo. 

I left my internship bc of this and bc of some professional reasons. But this loneliness and crying had a lot to do with leaving my internship. I came to my hometown to live with my parents. I thought it'll help me but it didn't. I think my loneliness is compound with grief. 

These days I am looking for jobs and all I do is just be at home in the day time. Every evening I go for walk alone and feel just lonely. I am lonely for sure but it's been 2.5 years and I am still not over my aunt's death. What's this problem is called ? I can't live like this anymore. I cant tell my parents about all these bc then they'll get worried. If any of you know what's this problem is called and can give me some suggestions, that'll be really helpful. I am planning to go to a psychiatrist really soon.

vmulem,1,2022-06-28,How do I start my data analysis career with a 2:2?,abcd1123581321,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/vmulem/how_do_i_start_my_data_analysis_career_with_a_22/,"I graduated this summer with a bachelors in Math from a top-5 UK uni. 

I had two close family bereavements across my final two years, after losing a parent a few years prior, and my university was reluctant to return to in-person teaching - not a good combination when grieving. My mental health was awful as I spent all my time depressed in my room with no motivation to go outside, which was reflected in my grades going from a high 2:1 to a high 2:2. I failed a couple of modules and had to do summer resits so couldn't apply for internships either. 

(In hindsight I should have deferred for a year but I was not in the frame of mind to do this over email whilst grieving) 

I hope(d) to go into something data science/software dev related but I'm competing against people with firsts in CS from similar places. Even with some good coding experience this is an uphill battle.

Honestly, I feel like the work I did put in was a waste of time and I'm just marked as ""not good enough"" on every application. I can't even express these circumstances to employers without it sounding like an excuse. 

My goal now is to get an MSc in Statistics but my alma mater would be hesitant to even offer me a place on the shorter PGDip. I'm worried that doing this is likely to be seen as another substandard qualification by employers and I'll be in the same position next year. 

Where do I even go from here? It feels like my whole career is screwed before it's started from events that were out of my control."

În ceea ce pare a fi un noroc chior pentru mine, am obținut un internship la o companie pe back-end(Java). Spun noroc chior deoarece nu am nici facultate în domeniu (am în altul) și nici cunoștințele mele nu ar fi cele mai ok.

HackReactor was recommended to me by an old friend from high school. My worry is the timing of it all. My wife is very successful, to the point with tight budgeting, and a good saving, that I can do this full time. Even with our second child coming any day now. 

But are my expectations of landing an entry level job or internship soon after graduation absurd? I know it’s a competitive field, and a boot camp is only the beginning of what I need to learn, but I really want to make this change and we both agree it can be done at this stage in our lives.

vmz3sd,1,2022-06-28,My mother wants me to accompany her to her trip to New York and I'm not looking forward to it.,HighlightUnlikely841,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/vmz3sd/my_mother_wants_me_to_accompany_her_to_her_trip/,"I'll probably get called selfish, ungrateful or privileged scum for this since not everybody has the privilege to have an overseas vacation, let alone to a place as expensive as New York.  But I do not care.  I hope that in venting about it, I get the peace of mind needed to tolerate this trip. 

In a few days, my brother will go to New York (or somewhere in Manhattan) under the context of doing a Shadowing or a form of internship for his Dental School studies.  Our mother is obviously going in tow so he's not alone for the trip.  And our mother in turn, wishes for me to accompany them as well.  

Now I may be using words like ""wants"" and ""wishes"" but that is not really the case.  The have been planning for this trip for a while now, my flight ticket and person was already accounted for, long before I was told about this news.  So I never did have the chance of choosing whether or not I wanted to go with them.  They just told me about it and expect me to be on board with it 100%. 

There's nothing special about this trip, this isn't the first time our family has travelled to the US Mainland, let alone New York.  This would actually be our third time visiting The Big Apple.  The reason why I don't want to partake in this trip is for two reasons. 

Reason 1: The PCAT

On July 7, I will be taking the PCAT exam.  The trip is due July 8th, so thankfully my brother and I's interest, errands and affairs don't contradict each other.  The reason why this exam still plays a role is because the stress is eating me alive. I've been studying for it since late January and do not feel like I'll get a good enough percentile first try.  By the time I'll be finished with the exam, I just want to lay down on my bed and sleep in for an entire day.  My mental fatigue feels like its through the roof and I'm in no position to enjoy a trip to anywhere as of now. 

Reason 2: The orchestrator of this Trip's activities will be my mother

I have always despised my mother's train of thought when it comes to planning for overseas trips.  As I mentioned before this isn't our first time traveling, let alone traveling to New York.  Whenever our family travels, our father is the one who does all the planning.  Due to this, all our trips are filled with ""purpose"" and consideration.  What I mean by ""purpose"" is that there's always an activity in mind, like tourism.  Our last trip was spent in Madrid to celebrate the New Years, and due to my father being the main planner of the trip, we went to culturally enriched places and visited points of interest filled with history.  We traveled to Segovia, Granada, Toledo and learned so much about those places.  It was generally a good time.  And as I mentioned before there was also consideration.  Father was considerate in his planning, he'd make sure that by the time the touring activities ended, we'd still have enough time to return to our hotel rooms to get ready to eat at a restaurant and then return to our hotel rooms once again and go to sleep at around 10:30pm-11:00pm. 

When my mother is in charge of the planning, it is quite the opposite to my father.  She ""commandeered"" (For lack of a better word) a free day from our Madrid trip, and that day was the most tiresome day for the whole group.  It was nothing more than aimless walking, needless shopping and an ungodly amount of selfie taking photos throughout all of Madrid.  She'd ignore my brother's pleas of getting a Taxi since the walking was too much for him, at one point my father was fed up with the idea of waiting for her outside a store that he literally tried to walk away from the group and return to the hotel room alone.  My mother also manages to survive off of 3 cups of coffee and a cup of ""breakfast champagne"" for a whole day.  By the time she finally gives in to the pleas of my brother, father an I to go back to our hotel rooms to get ready to eat, its already 9pm.  Ill never forget this one time where (in a separate, more previous trip) the empty-stomach-aimless-shopping lasted until 12 AM.  It was cold as fuck too so I was absolutely livid about it.  

I never liked New York City.  The stores, restaurants and hotels were expensive even by the standards of 15 year old me (7 years ago, I'm 22 now), so I sure as hell cannot imagine how fucking steep the pricing of this trip is gonna be.  And on top of the pricing, our father unfortunately couldn't join us for this trip because he couldn't find anybody to cover his shifts for the July 8 week and is planning on saving his vacation days for a later trip, so I'll be stuck with mother who's only plans for this trip are aimless walking, shopping, selfie taking and drinking, with her bringing me in tow as her translator because she does not understand or speak English very well and fears that even speaking a lick of Spanish (we're Puerto Ricans) will cause some maniac to attack us for no reason.  But despite that, she insist of wearing her most expensive jewelry (and wants my brother and I to follow suit) to look as aesthetic as possible for the trip, completely ignoring the risk of getting jumped or pickpocketed by thieves.

All I wanted to do after this exam was to lie down and hang out with my friends.  But now I am forced to waste my time and money on a trip to New York, possibly spending the upcoming 8 days doing nothing but having a prick of my ass, being a mindless translator for a woman who will aimlessly walk, needlessly shop, drink and take ""cute selfies"", possibly from 8am to God knows at what point in the night until she gets tired and demand to be taken back to the hotel room, by foot of course because for some reason she doesn't like Taxis or Ubers.  

I know I'm gonna get told that I'm ungrateful, a spoiled brat, privileged or undeserving scum but I straight up don't care.  This trip (and my going of it) is inevitable.  I just hope that by venting about it through any media, I'll be able to get a glimmer of peace of mind and tolerate the dumpster fire that will be a trip to New York with my mother."

* Should I mention volunteer work? 
* In the summary of qualifications, do I mention only what's required in the job posting, or other info like applications I've worked with but that are not required in the job posting?"
vn0cgx,1,2022-06-28,Are coding bootcamps worth it to get ahead?,DaviiSenpai,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/vn0cgx/are_coding_bootcamps_worth_it_to_get_ahead/,"Hi all.

As the title suggests, I am looking to attend a coding bootcamp to expand my coding knowledge and utilize it to land a job. I have been doing some research, but, I am not completely confident in what I am seeing.

A bit about me: I have just learned the basics of python, HTML, CSS, Java, Javascript, and mySQL through coursework. I attend the University of phoenix and have an A.A with a concentration in Information Technology that I obtained last September. I'll complete my B.S in IT in around 2 or so years. 

My goals: I am basically trying to get ahead of the game. I would strongly prefer to not be in a situation where I don't have a job in my field post graduation and I'm stuck with student loans. I have seen some, what seems like promising, statistics from a bootcamp called Hackreactor and then also the UC Berekely extension coding bootcamps. Although, I know that both of these bootcamps cannot guarantee me a job. I just need the ""experience"" that I can show on my resume. 

What is the best route to go if I want to land a job soon keeping in mind that I do have a full time job and still attend university? Are there more effective ways to obtain ""experience"" (that's been the main challenge for me getting internships)?

P.S: I'm aware that UC Berekely extension is actually a company called Trilogy education (2U) which collaborates with UC Berekely and other universities. 

Anecdotes, actual data, or your experiences are welcome. 

T.I.A!"

Semiconductor industry,SpaceExplorer10220,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vn17sd/is_a_1year_software_engineering_internship_worth/,"I received an offer for a full one-year software engineering internship at a large international semiconductor wafer processing company (think one level below ASML, TSMC).

I'll mainly be in their R&amp;D side programming in C and C++ (which is the language I prefer most). I will be trained, have a supervisor/mentor, and have my own projects to do throughout this internship. The internship is fairly standard, around 15 interns per cohort (small-ish cohort so not willing to say the name of company). I'm confident that the internship will teach me ***A LOT*** according to what I see on glassdoor and the job description though it has fairly bad WLB. The company has really smart people doing some really fascinating and niche work recently (I also see lots of openings for 3D C++ software engineers, PhD/MS computer vision engineers, optical engineers, laser process engineers, etc... which all make it seem like the company does cool stuff lol).

I was hoping to land a big tech or trading firm internship offer next summer but if I take this offer, I'll have to push that for next next summer (2024). I'll also have to graduate a year or a semester late.

Also, I do not find back-end and front-end web development interesting, so this is a good opportunity to really explore what I might be interested in.

1. BS CS + math minor (3-years) -&gt; 18.3 credits/sem | 4 years-&gt; 14 credits/semester (the most chillest option to maintain a good gpa, time for projects, internships, networking e.t.c.)
2. Double major in CS and Math (4-years)
3. BS+MS CS (4-years)

I don‘t know how awarding options 2) and 3) will be. Also, the math major/minor will have an **Applied Statistics Concentration**

While the 3rd option sounds the most awarding, I would preferably want to fill the gap between my BS and MS degree with some Job Experience and get admitted to a better University for my Masters than my current University (Purdue School of Science, IUPUI) . Also, most of my cost is covered by a scholarship distributed throughout 4-years. So, some of the scholarship money will be wasted if I graduate in 3-years."
vn1upm,17,2022-06-28,Major-related crisis. 1 year of undergrad left. Should I finish my double major or just drop one major?,esuom_okim,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/vn1upm/majorrelated_crisis_1_year_of_undergrad_left/,"**tl;dr: Was feeling kinda burnt out by my courseload last year. Should I finish my double major or turn one major into a minor?**

*Oops this is kind of a long one...*

I’m having kind of a major-related crisis right now. You see, I’m currently declared as a double major in Psychology and English. I absolutely love Psychology and I like English. However, I’m starting to feel a bit… tired (?) of English. While I don’t believe I ever *loved* reading as much as most English majors say they do, I think I like reading enough to get reading done for class (for the most part).

However, I’m not sure if I want to finish my English major. On the one hand, I had very little motivation for the two English classes I took this past spring, which is probably because I have been starting to do more extracurriculars, so I feel like I have less time to focus on a piece of text and really think about it. On the other hand, I only need to take 5 more classes, which probably isn’t very much (btw, our school year is divided into 3 terms or “quarters”—I feel like 5 classes over 3 quarters wouldn’t be the same as 5 classes over 2 semesters, which is why I felt inclined to include this note). And I’ve already taken enough English classes to just declare English as a minor instead of a major.

The alternative would be to just take more psychology classes. While I have already finished all my psychology requirements, there are so many classes that I still want to take. I suppose this is the curse of having found a major I’m interested in. A significant chunk of the upper division classes I’ve taken for my psychology major have been related to human development, and I would like to expand my knowledge base a bit and learn about areas of psychology that I know nothing about. However, I also realize that I could just spend that time taking classes that count towards my English major rather than spend that time taking classes that won’t count towards my Psychology major (though they could still boost my GPA… hmm…). Plus, I feel like this problem of me wanting to have taken more psychology classes is just probably never going to end anyway, and I’ll have to just tell myself that I can’t just keep taking Psychology classes forever. (I mean, I know I could read a textbook on my own anyway.)

Another thing to consider would be that Psychology tends to come to me more naturally than English does, and I want to be able to spend my last year of college taking classes that I’m pretty much guaranteed to enjoy. I’ve loved most Psychology classes I’ve taken, but my experience with and feelings toward English classes are a little bit more uneven. I also tend to work much harder for English classes than I do for Psychology classes. (Generally speaking, writing for a Psychology class is *much* easier than writing for an English class, in my opinion.) I got very burnt out by the end of last school year, and I don’t want to push myself too hard, academics-wise, especially since I’m going to have to start focusing more on applying to internships and jobs and trying to figure out my post-undergraduate life. I’m also planning to just take 3 classes per quarter instead of the typical 4 classes per quarter to give myself some breathing room in terms of scheduling my life.

However, I do also (somewhat inadvertently) feel like I saved for last the English classes that study the types of literature I’m interested in, so my experience with English classes, if I decide to finish my major, may not be so bad? Plus, I feel like the summer break might help me recuperate from last shool year’s burnout.

Anyway, to summarize here are my options:

1. Psychology+English double major: No room for many more psychology classes unless I choose to take 4 classes per quarter
2. Psychology major: Keep taking more psychology classes (and honestly, if I needed to I could just take 2  ""real"" classes per quarter and just take course credit for the research lab I’m in instead of taking another 3rd ""real"" class)

I’m very conflicted. I’d love y’all’s two cents. Thanks!"

I am an undergrad computer science major from California, I do not attend UCLA.  

It seems pretty clear looking at LinkedIn that most people in this major at UCLA are able to get tech internships somehow, but I don't understand how that process happens.  

Do these software companies recruit at a career fair at UCLA and the other UCs?  Do people apply online and companies hire based on the university on their resume?  Does a UC degree get you just an interview or the actual job?  Is it a mix of all of this? 

I know UCLA played a major part in the invention of the internet, does that have anything to do with this?

I posted this here and not in r/cscareerquestions because I wanted to hear from people at UCLA specifically.

However, I do want to work in tech thus I want to ask my question question on this sub. So I apologize if this question is out of scope for this sub :/

I also want to explain my situation here. I want to get into tech but I don't know exactly what I want to do yet. I'm pretty open to the idea of doing UX Design, Product Management or maybe even a data analyst role. And I have no plans to enter grad school. 

I am currently committed to UCSD for cognitive science, and I recently got off the waitlist at UCLA for cogsci as well. 

From my research, UCSD is one of the best schools to do cogsci and what I really like about their cogsci program is that you can specialize in ML or HCI. UCSD's cogsci classes give you a good mix of psych, neurosci, cs, and data sci classes overall. It seems pretty well rounded to me. On top of that you can specialize in ML or HCI to add more computing or UX based courses if that fits your interests (which it does for me) .

At UCLA, their cogsci program seems more of a glorified psych degree with a few cs classes sprinkled in. I'm looking at the course load and it seems to me that the major is very psych and philosophy heavy.  They have a computing specialization which interests me aswell but the major doesn't feel balanced compared to UCSD's cogsci program. Perhaps I can tack on the data science minor if I end up here. 

I understand UCLA is better overall in terms of prestige/rankings but do you guys  think that prestige has a leg up over ucsd in terms of job placement and  internship opportunities?"

I don’t have a degree and I never worked in the tech industry before; I attended college but after seeing the number of classes I had to take, and the money I would have to spend, I decided against it. I was hoping that after I took my bootcamp it would be easy to find a job, but that does not seem to be the case. So far, I’ve been looking for junior and internships positions for web development on indeed and LinkedIn to hopefully get my foot in the door. I would love to get some insight through anyone else’s experience in the tech industry, I know having a degree gives you an advantage but I’m hoping it is possible to still get into the field without it. I saw some postings on reddit where people were saying that updating your portfolio is a good way to get noticed and that is what I will be working on. I’m currently taking some courses on Udemy to help further my skills and knowledge, as well as working on some side projects to help increase my GitHub activity. If anyone has any other ideas or other job boards besides indeed and LinkedIn, that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read"
vn7her,1,2022-06-29,I don't know if I'm making a big mistake,shininglight10,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/vn7her/i_dont_know_if_im_making_a_big_mistake/,"I am nearing 26 and I don't have a career. I love what I studied in school for my Bachelors degree but unfortunately the field I studied is going through major industry changes and is likely to become obsolete within the next few years. I graduated with high honors, had an internship at notable companies every single summer during college, and saved up as much as I could. Since graduating, I have worked in 3 different career fields. None of them worked out out except for the last one, which I've been doing for the past two years. It is commission based, though, and is not stable long-term. I love it despite this; it's an excellent job and I have a great work environment with my boss and co-workers, but it's not something that provides a stable or survivable income by itself.

When covid started, I moved back in with my mom and her husband. My dad passed away when I was young and we don't have any family near us; my mom and I only have each other and we are very close. I experienced the deepest depression I have ever experienced in my life during this time. It mostly stemmed from applying to over 500 jobs since I graduated and nothing working out. I networked, I let my friends and family know I was looking for a job... I did everything I possibly could, but nothing was working. My mom suggested I go back to school for a career in healthcare. I've always liked the healthcare field and considered it, but I have always struggled with science. But because I was so desperate for a change, I figured I would give it a try after I shadowed in the hospital and loved it.

I started classes almost 1 year ago today; some were online and some were in person. I am going to be honest. In some of my classes, the professors allowed us to use open notes, our textbook, and the internet for homework and exams. I still participated in class, asked questions, and engaged with the material on my own, but I used the resources we were allowed to. Deep down, I think this is the only reason why I did so well in all of my classes. On exams before using any resources, I would put down what I thought the answer was. Sometimes I got it right, others I didn't. There is no denying if I never used the resources, I very likely would not have passed with as high of the grades as I got without it.

Fast forward to this year and I started applying to healthcare programs/schools. I was both shocked and kind of happy when I was accepted to all 4. Also scared shitless because how in the world am I going to pass an exam in these schools without open notes, the book, or the internet? And this is so obvious - of course I'm going to struggle. I told my mom this because it has been eating me up inside.

Ever since I accepted my position in one of the schools I can't sleep and I've lost my appetite. I am anxious 24/7. I spent $10k of my savings on going back to school to complete the prereqs and I think I made an awful decision. I just couldn't find a career and wanted my life to end, I was so desperate for a life change or some hope to cling on to that I think I made a grave mistake.

I am terrified I won't be able to finish the program. My mom has agreed to set aside $20k to help me pay for the program and I will pay $30k for tuition and rent, which is the majority of my savings from the past two years.

My friends and neighbors know I am supposed to be moving out of state in a couple of months for this program. My boss and co-workers know it. My friends are throwing me a going away party and so is my current commission based job. And I want to throw up from the thought of all of it. I feel like a complete failure and an embarrassment. I wake up and go through the entire day trying to distract myself so I don't have to think about starting this program and not being able to finish it.

I have no idea what to do with my life. I'd love to take a job here close to home so I can save up and buy a condo in a few years, but how? I can try applying for some jobs but I'm afraid many of the jobs won't be sustainable long-term. I saw my mom try to rebuild her life after my dad passed away and we both survived very fearful, traumatic times. It wasn't until my mom went back to school and busted her ass to get into healthcare that our lives improved dramatically. But I am so terrified of letting her down. I've expressed this to her and she said, ""well you have to at least try. If it doesn't work out, that's okay, you can find another job."" But I've tried to find a job and though I stopped a year ago when I went back to school, I truly do not know if I'll get hired anywhere that pays somewhat decently and is sustainable long-term.

I feel like a failure and I'm so ashamed and embarrassed. I'm worried I'm making a huge mistake by moving out of state and starting this program when I feel woefully unprepared. I don't want to put so much into my savings without knowing if this is going to work out, but there's no way to have complete certainty with anything in life. I don't know what I'm asking for, I just needed to share this with someone because I feel like my stress is at an all time high and I truly do not know how to cope."

**Question is**: do I keep trying to work on this research internship, or do I quit and spend the last  summer before college graduation trying to recover my mental health?  
Rising college senior (US-based, in translation this would be the summer before my last year of college); the past 5 summers for me have been either studying for some international competition, COVID, or an internship, and this past year's emotional BS has lead me to quitting 2 weeks into my summer internship because I wasn't sleeping more than 4 hours a night.   
Because I was nervous about not doing anything this summer, and because of an out-of-nowhere interest in grad school, I tried to get a research internship with a prof. I found one, and he said that he'd be down to do it after I do some preliminary projects to get myself up to speed with what I'd be working on. (I study / was doing computer science research, for extra context, and am living with my mom.)  
I thought the work would be lighter, and it is I think. However, this past week my mom took me on a trip to help me relax, and it in fact did the opposite. I did not mind spending time with her, but I get nervous on planned trips, and I wasn't able to do any work because I couldn't bring my laptop. It has been 3 days since we got back from said trip and I still feel like shit. Sleep schedule kinda effed, mental health kinda effed, etc. Certainly better than during the end of the school year, but not like healthy.  
I want to back out of the research internship and just do nothing this summer. Maybe instead of doing this research stuff I could just throw all energy into socializing (hard because I have no local friends because I was not raised in the US), applying for full-time jobs in the summer, learning programming languages for fun. I could try to do some research work during my last semester to prepare for graduate school, but also I don't really know if I want to do graduate school at this point because I have tried  so many times to find research work that I like, and I have worked with a couple professors but neither research project lasted because I couldn't make time for them. I also fear that giving up on this research internship will remove more structure in my life that I might need, but also I'm not working on the research anyway because I can't focus. But also this structure is already not kinda there; I spend most of my day alone because mom goes to work during weekdays and I don't have friends locally. I probably talk with friends like 5-6 hours a week, and have no socialization with people besides my mom otherwise.  


I'm writing this at 2am local time because I once again can't sleep so this might just be an incoherent. Apologies, thanks for the advice."

""I mean, what do they expect? A full time employee should continue to perform well at work *while* they take on the work load of a full time MBA? At least for the sake of us, the employers, they should grant y'all a visa!"" She says...

LOL. For a second I really thought she's actually thinking about me and not her business. Sorry. 

My colleagues are happy to see me though. Some even tell me they missed my presence at work! Comforting words such as these would keep me going in the future. My office manager - who'd screwed up my RFE response situation - tells me that she's sorry she acted so soon. Brings in donuts the day I get back to work. I'm being pulled onto some new, interesting projects. I start seeing the value in the work, rather than cry about the money. After all, I'm getting some good experience! Increasing my value in the industry! Somedays it felt like this. On others, it felt like consolation prizes for not making the H1B. But wait a second...what's going on with that!? 

I contact my lawyer. She tells me the petition is ready, but my employer should really raise me up by a few thousand if this case was to be made stronger. After all, a year has passed and everyone is due for a raise, right? 

WRONG! My employer cannot even have this conversation with me right now! My lawyer is even ready to talk to my employer on my behalf, but, nope. She has ""other things"" to think about. I'm getting used to feeling dejected, and so, I ask my lawyer, how realistic does she think she can win my case? She tells me ""quite honestly"" that it's a lost cause and that I should focus on re-applying for H1B instead, because March 2019 is around the corner. I take that as a no. Ask her to stop working on my case, and ""save"" the rest of the $2,000 to be paid to the lawyer for the case. She is a good person. Well-wisher, even. Advices me to change my employer ASAP. Thankyou-s are exchanged, and it's ""that time of the year"" again. 

The conversation goes as anyone would expect. She says, ""...well your salary cannot change this year and so if your application does get selected again, we lose the $2,000 application fee, you lose the lawyer fees, and the authorities will question us again about why your salary is so low. So we could do it this year and lose the money, or next year if/when your salary *may* increase based on yours and the company's performance."" 

I tell her I'm taking a vacation instead, and in a month, while \~300,000 internationals are busy applying for the H1B round that year, off I go, back home, to attend my cousin's wedding. 

Best $2,000 ever spent, tbh! Everyone was happy seeing me back so soon. I mean, I'd been gone, what, 4 months? And I was back already? Fun days. Time flew, and so did I. 

Not from Abu Dhabi of course!

&amp;#x200B;

Chapter 10 - THE PROMOTION: The daily grind had begun. I was going to make sure I get a raise, come 2020. I was handling a number of projects by now. The office was small, and staff was limited. What's more, my PM (Also the VP of the company) had a fall out with my boss, and had left the company. So that project was now completely on me! And what do you call an ""Intern"" managing a project already? Something better than an intern, at least! (If not Project Manager). I mean, credit where credit's due, my boss was actively a part pf the project and she did teach me quite a few things over the course of the life of this project, but I was managing/ coordinating the client, the consultants, the contractor, the drawings, the administrative side, everything! I was actually doing good work now. Learning, developing my skills. Then came another project. Small scope, major coordination, but I learned a few more management skills there. The client was the City! I even singlehandedly proved in a bad finger-pointing situation, how we were never at fault and that the contractor should bear the burden of certain project losses - after spending hours buried in investigating the paper trails of all communication! The boss appreciated my investigative abilities and record keeping. She even called me diligent. The client PMs started to trust me. I was sitting in on weekly meetings with some really big people in there. I started to feel like I'm finally doing something important! Promotion was due. 

Not only was I handling the project work efficiently, but I was also doing quite well at school. Unlike many other stupid, copycat, non-serious students at such schools, I was actually putting in honest efforts towards the school work and assignments, without slacking too much and maintaining my grades. I was barely making any money anymore because most of my money would go towards rent, food, and college fees. It was physically, mentally, and psychologically exhausting at times but I was holding it all together, with an exterior of the jolly ole kid. I had a purpose now! Promotion was due. 

During this, we lost another staff member. The office manager was fired. We hired a part time student worker who came in twice a month to help my boss and the rest of us 4 employees, refill our paper supplies and what not. We desperately needed more staff. Work was on the rise, and we were only 4 of us who could *actually* *get some work done*. My boss even joked about ""body snatching"" from other firms. We joked about how we'd only be able to make someone work for us if we quite literally ""snatched"" them. Because who'd want to work at this shitty place for a disrespectful salary, anyway? Yeah, there were 3 of us who had a secret ""Ranter's club"". Bitching about the workload and the management gave us a sense of...satisfaction, I think. I was doing phenomenal though, professionally. Promotion was due. 

We were even asked to provide our opinions about prospective employees by asking them to go through with a second interview round with us. out of the four candidates we interviewed, exactly, NONE were hired. We loved them all, and they all brought in various sets of skills and personalities. But the boss would sometimes be unhappy about their salary demands, or say, oh they're too young. We need ""Project Architect"" level staff here. My blood boiled every time I heard that word. But, I was doing dope. Promotion was due. 

Sometime in July 2019, my boss decided to sell her stakes in a project that had stalled for a while, and decided to buy a prime office space instead, in the same area as our current workplace. The deal finalized, and the news came. We were moving to a new place down the street! Beautiful heritage building. We were excited. I was put onto designing the project with another PM. This was going to be our space! Designed by us! I had stared feeling a sense of pride, ownership, belongingness with this firm. We were in January of 2020. I had been doing great! Promotion was due. 

The employee handbook mentioned that performance evaluations will be scheduled on an annual basis, with salary evaluations scheduled twice a year. I started back in December 2017. We were in January 2020. I had not had any performance evaluations after my first 3 month probationary review in March 2018 - which led to a demotion and a 20% salary cut. I had not had any salary raise in this period, apart from a one time bonus worth $400 (!) in December 2019. I was naturally looking forward for an appraisal in the first quarter of 2020. I mean, I'd proved myself. I was doing fantastic. Exceeding client expectations (as explicitly expressed by two of our clients, until then), and so, naturally, I was due for a promotion, which would mean my H1B would be re-applied for! Finally! 

Or so I thought... 

&amp;#x200B;

Our performance evaluations had been promised to us in December 2019 MERRY XMAS office dinner. We reminded the boss about this, every two weeks, and she pushed and pushed and pushed the reviews until March 2020. 

And then, it was MERRY COVID-MAS\*! This beautiful period brought happiness and joy to my Boss's life, because, no more performance evals! The economy was royally screwed, you see? 

Promotion was NOT due. 

&amp;#x200B;

*\*We were in March 2020 when the official news about the deadly spread of COVID broke, globally...*

For now, I am thinking about two careers: front-end developer and UI/UX, and I have many questions about them. Little about me:

* I got the title of IT specialist which I got in my technical school (high school),
* I was an intern at a small networking company, and I am going to start right now an internship as a HelpDesk
* I had a youtube channel on which I used Adobe Photoshop to make thumbnails, so I have a little experience in design (but very little)
* I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and JS from freecodecamp
* I designed two websites in Adobe XD.

Now the questions part.

* Are UX and UI always together or you can be just UX or just UI? And does UI/UX developer differs from UI/UX designer?
* Is it better to be just Front dev, just UI/UX, or both in terms of the market?
* For me for the most part the most important thing in a job is how many hours I will be working. It doesn't mean that I don't know how the industry works and that sometimes I will have to work overtime or on a weekend. But I want to have also family outside of work, and need to know how much will I need to put in to be good  So how much are an average to work as the Front-end dev and UI/UX developer?

vnc87m,0,2022-06-29,Optimal path from Service Desk to DevOps,GimmeGhillie,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vnc87m/optimal_path_from_service_desk_to_devops/,"Hi everyone,

TL;DR at the bottom, some additional background here:

I'm looking for career advice as I feel I've hit my first crossroads so far. Last year I did my research and decided that IT is something I'm passionate about, with DevOps seemingly being the best fit for me (I love to know how things work and keep things running smoothly with proactive measures). I started part-time studies in Business Informatics and learn very quickly because of the time I took to identify my goals. Hence the ambition and motivation to achieve my dream role optimally.

Since that realization, I've decided to get an entry-level position at Service Desk and have worked here for 8. months. Long story short, I enjoyed learning all the technical things, but there isn't much left to learn, and there is more repetitive and useless work. The company postponed my pay rise until late Q3, all while new employees I co-train get higher wages without asking. I'm their core worker, and they skimp a hundred bucks a month to even out my pay for this quarter (I'm in Poland, so my yearly income is \~10k USD, which is still probably sub-market). I don't want to be ungrateful, but it feels wrong when a company bans revealing your wages (against law here) to avoid open discussion.

This got me thinking about possibly changing my job, but I don't feel I can land a DevOps position with my skillset yet. I could probably get a summer internship or a 2nd LVL/sysadmin role, but I wonder if such a small step would be worth it. I'm working 12h shifts with 4-5 nights a month at my current job, and that leaves a lot of time for self-development and maybe going straight for that DevOps role when I'm ready.

**TL;DR**

**I want to advance my career as fast as possible (with adequate work and commitment).**

**Should I try for an internship/sysadmin role after 8. months at Service Desk or use my time here to learn and go straight for my target role as Jr DevOps when I get the required skills?**"

Despite this, I really want to have a career sa data science field. So I've been thinking, while I work up my experience with the current internship I have, I will still do a little bit of DS projects on the side. So far, I have done these projects:

- Predicting NBA player efficiency using regression analysis
- Song genre recognition using neural networks
- Predicting medical charges of individuals who smoke using multiple linear reg.
- Emotion recognition through facial expressions(

Will these be enough to be recruited to a DS job here in the PH? Or should I do more data science projects? Any input/feedback is appreciated. Thanks!"

Going to be 1 YoE in August (overall gonna be 2 years since I started my first internship) current TC is 15LPA (base) at a bootstrapped consultancy startup and we have a niche which means clients are plenty and opportunities for devs are plenty.

Currently i feel kinda lost about my growth with many options in front of me. My goal is earning crazy amounts of money cuz im a greedy ass person. So what do I do to make that a reality? I know the most ideal solution is getting a USA salary but can't see a way to get there.

I work mostly in Nextjs and TS and what not, dabbled in Websockets, WebRTC, your everyday CRUD API integration stuff and have scaled up stuff for millions of daily users. Have not tried web 3 the options I see in front of me are:

\- Increase knowledge depth in frontend and explore Web 3 or AR.

\- Move into PM.

\- Move into something else that complements my skillset like BE (which is unrealistic because i would be doing only one at a give time)

\- Do MS and find a full time role overseas (i am against it since it requires me to take a break from my profession and puts me in debt but am willing to do it if it pays off well)

At work currently I am working on an internal project and am kinda working of a lead of sorts with a couple of people under me, how do i really get better at leading/managing, any help on this would be appreciated too.

I am someone who loves to code and do web dev, if ask me 'how was your weekend' I would probably reply with 'experimented with xyz framework or tool' so want something that can allow me to code a lot too.

My job before that which I think might have the most experience for is working at a computer repair shop. I was a unpaid intern and I would do things like fix computers, removed viruses, installed antivirus software, cleaned out harddrives and PCs, answered customer phones. 

Before that I would occasionally volunteer to help my dad at his store by being a cashier, cleaning the store, stocking items, answering phone calls, unpacking boxes, and grunt cleaning work.

I guess I'll go first, but I'm still a student so I'll keep it short. 

Growing up I never knew what I wanted to do and even now that continues. School was always easy for me. The first time I really tried studying was for Russian in high school during sophomore year. Russian was the only thing I ever had to study for, everything else was intuitive. High school was the lowest point of my life, but I was lucky and was able to go to a decent college. At that college, I've begun to try my best. While I was applying to colleges, I put my major as either computer science or business. The deciding factor being which program was stronger at the school and business was the one here. In hindsight, I have some regrets, but not really since I enjoy it more. If high school was the lowest point of my life, college has been the highest so far despite all the challenges. I've learned so much, especially about how important hard work is. Unfortunately, it's hard since I've never been challenged this much in terms of academics. 

In terms of career progression. My gpa after freshman year was 3.2 and now it's 3.5. I definitely think that I wasn't getting looks because of the lower gpa.  Right now I'm interning at a small firm. Their business products are super weird and I'm not contributing too much. Thankfully, I'm not having to pick up the phone to call people because I would consider that a waste. This position was super last minute and I'm grateful that it's paid. I tried to get an internship before this to no avail. Going into junior year this fall, I'm super excited, but also scared because I just started college last January and now I'm halfway through. However, finding that prestigious internship has not been good and I'm re-reconsidering career goals. My goal in life is just to have enough money to retire early.

I don't even know what I wrote anymore, but I'd be grateful is someone else wrote this. I want to hear different ways my life could go."

vnjpzf,104,2022-06-29,"Managers who have hired self-taught developers, what ultimately gave you enough confidence to make the hire?",tQkSushi,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vnjpzf/managers_who_have_hired_selftaught_developers/,"I am a self-taught developer. I started self-teaching myself 1.5 years ago. I've spent maybe 6/7 months now trying to make the transition. I've interviewed at 9 different companies. Three times I've made it to the final round. But no job offers.

In my last interview, the manager was super nice and gave me feedback along the lines of ""You were a great candidate, it was super close, you made it down to 3 candidates, but ultimately we hired somebody else with a little more experience. Not having a CS education will be really challenging for you."" This is not too unlike other feedback that I have gotten which was ""we don't think you're technical enough just yet"" and ""it will be hard to demonstrate that you can jump from making personal projects to doing professional work.""

At this point, I'm thinking I might even go back to school to get a second degree in CS so that I have a better chance at landing internships or coop jobs. Honestly, some of these co-op jobs may even pay more than my current job. But then I realize the programs will be 2-3 years, I might have to quit my current job and it will cost a lot of money.

But anyways, managers who have pulled the trigger and hired somebody who is completely self-taught, what is it that made you confident enough to hire them?"

vnmy2n,1,2022-06-29,New project - setup,MainStreetBrotha,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/vnmy2n/new_project_setup/,"Hi, i am self-educated front-end developer with almost a year now of working expiriance plus internship. My whole work is front-end oriented (of course) and all projects i've been participating in so far are done in React (fe part).

Now i would like to make a website for a friends small bussiness (classic website, who we are, what we do, contact etc. There is no login, authentication and stuff like that).

I can say that im pretty comfortable with creating whatever in React, but i have never done anything related to deployment, back-end, servers, hosting, google optimisation to be in first couple of links.. stuff like that.

I wouldnt say that this website needs some backend, but it would contain a lot of images so i guess thats the way to go.

Can you provide me with some map on what technologies to use and what the process is, because i wouldnt like to end up in tutorial hell and start doing some stuff first that are supposed to be done in the end.

vnocq5,1,2022-06-29,Should I switch from Accounting to Web-development?,OkDot8,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/vnocq5/should_i_switch_from_accounting_to_webdevelopment/,"A bit of background first. 
I've just completed my first year in college studying Accounting and Finance. Tried to do an internship, but honestly couldn't bring myself to complete it. I just....genuinely despise the field now. It's so dull, and all the corporate stuff just seems so hollow to me. I really don't want to continue. So I've been thinking of dropping out and learning web-development/coding, and I'm confident that in 3-4 years (the time it will take me to graduate in accounting) I'll be at a secure place in the field if I go ahead with the plan. Am I wrong?

Now, some questions. Sorry if the formatting is off.

• I am thinking of taking the self-taught route. Is that advisable? 

I plan to use online resources to teach myself. I've an idea of some places where I can start. Plus enrolling into a university to study computer science will get me behind by 2 years, which I don't want to waste.

• What are some qualifications and certificates one can acquire to show their skills aside from portfolio?

• From your experience, how important is it to be a college graduate to be successful in this field?

• Are there any online certification/programs/qualifications, which if completed, stand equal to graduation/college degree? 

The reason I ask this might seem dumb, but a high-school graduate isn't very respected here, even if somewhat successful. So I want to get something equal to a college program, (e.g like ACCA is for Accounting). Something online and cheap? 

• How easy it to find jobs in other countries in this field? 

This is more of a personal wish, but I'd really want a skill that lets me work in different countries and explore them. Oh and again, how much do qualifications/college degree matter for this?

• I'm afraid I'll miss out on college experience, what should I do? 

You know, meeting different people, socializing with people in your field, being part of a highly educated network of people, fun exclusive events. Do i just accept I won't be able to experience anything close to it? 


If you read this far, thank you. Any advice or feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

However I have no experience whatsoever. I took classes in college so I'm familiar with mySQL and graduated in Computer Information Systems but that's about it. 

I'm applying for internships to try to get some hands on experience but those almost are always looking for people that are still in college.

I even got so desperate I tried one of those trainee to hire programs kinda like Revature where they pay you to train you and then ship you out to any place in the country and you're under their contract for a few years. However I got rejected and I don't know if that's a blessing in disguise or not.

When applying for jobs I always see they require at least a few years of experience, and even still, I feel like my knowledge isn't good enough to step into a full time job. I mean, I just took a few classes and even then I felt like the knowledge that I learned could be learned by an average joe if they took like a few weeks to just study online.

What step should I take here?"

vnpjfn,3,2022-06-29,Advice for a university student?,raccoonadmirer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vnpjfn/advice_for_a_university_student/,"I am a university student about to start my third year of undergrad. I’ve taken a lot of computer science classes and I’ve learned a lot, but I don’t feel like I have any idea what I want to specifically do once I graduate. Financial stability and interesting work are important to me, but although I know CS careers tend to pay well, I don’t know what the quality of life is for subfields in CS. How did you choose your computer science specialty?

I get concerned because I hear that a lot of what I’m learning in school doesn’t map well into a career. For example, university has taught me to be very good at writing C++, writing search algorithms, and solving leetcode-esque puzzles. I’ve heard that in industry, very few people write C++ or solve leetcode problems on a daily basis - instead there’s a lot of JavaScript, SQL, DevOps, etc - things which my (well regarded) school barely pays attention to. Being that there’s a disconnect between what school teaches and what industry requires, is it better to devote my extra energy into getting very very good at the topics my school teaches, or should I merely do what’s needed to my good grades and spend my extra time learning tech stacks more useful in industry?

Right now, when I spend extra time outside of school to prepare for my career, all I do is LeetCode. Is this fine? Can I count on learning all the knowledge I actually need for my future job once I actually have the job, and safely spend the meantime gaming the interview system without actually learning useful topics, or is this going to bite me in the butt later?

Finally, do you recommend targeting in a specific subfield within CS? My current strategy is to spam apply positions by the thousand, take every interview I get, and eventually take the best offer I get. To me, right now, what makes an internship offer good is a high wage, cool company, cool project, and cool location. However, since my next summer internship will be my last one before graduating, I’m thinking perhaps I want to target something strategic rather than just aiming for the biggest company name I can get. How do you recommend strategizing for a well compensated, fulfilling future career with not just money, but also interesting coding work? Also, if you recommend specializing, are there any CS subfields you recommend specializing in, and why?"

So far I've done two other internships (one local company, one other mid trading firm), and I'm not sure if that's sufficient or if a third internship would add a lot more resume value.

Pros:

* Would be trading oriented (other trading internship was more about developing internal tools)
* Seems reputable - many people on LinkedIn who have interned here in the past have gone to well known trading firms/tech companies

Cons:

* Only 1 day WFH a week - would be hard to balance applying to full time positions along with interviews especially if I'm mostly in the office every day
* Would still be doing a school course - I would change my degree so I have less required credits but this course is required and only offered in the Fall

Any advice is appreciated!

I’ve only ever worked for a private institutions and ultimately, I want to work in environmental health sector in a federal/government setting; but I figured, if a land a state job doing something that’s not in my field of interest, it will at least give me a better advantage in moving up into a governmental/federal job and eventually be in environmental health. I have never worked for either of the two. What are your experiences in nonprofit and state county departments?"

I'm not one of those super genius teenagers who's ML github repo has 30k stars, but I've been wanting to get into the field. My first idea was an internship for summer break, but it seems that all of them require pursuit a bachelor's degree which isn't possible because I'm still in high school. 

So is there a possibility of me landing an entry-level job, I don't expect FAANG and don't really care if it was minimum wage I would just like to gain experience. Additionally, I understand that entry-level jobs in the field are quite stuffy and difficult to get, so would it be possible to work anywhere, or am I restricted to freelancing and trying to build up a Github profile until I leave High School?"
vnrib4,2,2022-06-29,Two year Technical School for IT?,CynderFlamez,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/vnrib4/two_year_technical_school_for_it/,"Hey everyone. So, I’m 23 and just looking around trying to figure out what I’d like to do with my life. I’m in Texas, and I’ve seen that tech jobs are some of the fastest growing jobs in the state, so I decided to look into IT some. I know relatively little about the field. 


While looking around at colleges and trade schools, I noticed Texas State Technical College (TSTC), a fairly well known technical school in Texas, has two computer related associates degrees: CyberSecurity; and Computer Networking and System Administrations. The classes seem to be good just from their descriptions, though like I said I’m fairly ignorant on the subject, and they have internships (though I’m also pretty ignorant on the subject of internships.)


Has anyone here gone to a technical school instead of college? Or, and this is a long shot, have any of you taken one of these (or any other) courses from TSTC? What are some of y’all’s thoughts on going this route? Obviously I would look to get certs as well, but I still thought it best to look into schools. 


I consider TSTC because it’s shorter than a traditional college, seemed to have more relevant courses, and because they advertise on the home page of their website that they “believe that everyone deserves a great-paying job. In fact, it's so important to us that we’re the only college in Texas whose funding depends on our students working after graduation.”


TLDR; I’m looking at career choices and wondering if a technical school offering IT related programs is a good path."

What was your first tech job and how old were you? Did you have any doubts if you’re experienced enough or about being younger/older than your coworkers? Did you like your first tech job?"

It was disaster for me especially last year.
I lost myself, and I had a lot of bad memories… attempted suicide, had been in coma for a few weeks.
But I think I am in a good place now. I enjoy university life, internship, hanging out with my friends and my crush. I don’t have to go to take any depression pills anymore.
But when I spend time with myself, just alone, which I used to really like, sometimes I feel really scared. What if I go back to be in depression?? 
So I try to make my life so busy, but I am exhausted a little bit. 
Try to work so hard, thinking about new business for a whole day, going to gym everyday, doing my various hobbies, studying new things… making my life busier and busier because I don’t want to be in depression anymore.

Do you think fears of depression will gradually disappear at some points?? Or Should I go to a therapist again? 
(In my country, I guess there is not a great therapist… at least I haven’t met them yet, and keep switching my therapist is kind of exhausting as well)


If I can have somebody to talk to, It will be my relief a bit I think. But I attempted suicide, and caused my family, my friends and my crush a lot of troubles already, so I don’t want them to worry about me anymore…"
vnwa66,1,2022-06-29,what would you guys do?,slurpadurpblurp,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vnwa66/what_would_you_guys_do/,"Hello,

I've got some interesting prospects to consider for this upcoming fall semester (sep start dates). To explain, I'm an incoming 3rd year cs student and I don't really know what exactly I want to do in the future for a career. I have no formal/work experience with anything related to CS. With that said, there are some potential jobs that I  may have to consider for this upcoming semester:

1. part time, year round, remote information security intern
2. remote corporate strategy analytics intern
3. full time, in person mainframe swe trainee with direct hire after training

I guess what I was wondering was which of these do you guys feel would be the best/most relevant general experience in tech for someone like me to do. I don't really know what exactly I'd be doing as 1) or 2). And, 1) is a year round internship, meaning I'd likely be locked up next summer full time. I feel like I'd be messing up longterm if I committed to 1) since it isn't the most ideal experience to have if I want to work as a developer or swe. Then again 2) probably isn't the most ideal either, but it's not year round.

For 3) I'd have to figure out whether I'd be able to even pursue it while also being a full time student. I know that once hired (after training), I'd be able to work fully remote or hybrid. This would make it a lot easier to be working and be a student. However, I think the training has to be fully in person for 12 weeks, which might be really hard to do (scheduling wise) with school.

Right now, I want to find a way to do the swe training, but I think it'd only be possible if I were to take a gap semester or do part time schooling. Do you guys think this would be worth it? I like the idea of being hired directly and not having to worry about a job for a little while I figure things out. But skipping a semester obviously has a lot of considerations.

In all 1) and 2) are the most feasible for me to do alongside being a student, which I also want to do. 3) is obviously the most developer-y opportunity, but carries a lot of extra baggage. I guess I'm really eager to try to get experience that'd help me find what I want to do in cs or as a swe in the future.

Thanks for taking the time to read a long ass post and thanks for any advice."

My question is should I do the courses even though i'm in college ?  Is it possible to gain Experience without any of the courses?

Let me say a bit about myself. I just wrapped up my freshman year of college at Michigan State University which I extended by taking two CSE classes over the first half of summer. I have started putting in place plans for internships for next summer. As such I’ve been reading up on things in particular I might need to know in a coding interview. 

***Something that has struck me as I have begun to attempt LC problems and have reviewed this sub is the issue of taking a DSA course. That is something that I will be taking next spring. I have so far taken two introductory CSE classes; one on C++ and one on Python. We have covered just up to dynamic memory management in C++ and a very small part of linked lists and stacks. The other CSE class I took is discrete mathematics.

In terms of experience I have for all intents and purposes zero, although I will be working in our campuses CV lab come fall. GPA is a 4 out of 4 and I’m in the honors college. My long term overarching goal is AI/ML possibly with respect to cybersecurity or computer vision, another interest is Quantum computing.

***Does my lack of a DSA class put me at a disadvantage in an interview? I have a few months to prepare of course but linked lists, dynamic memory management, binary search, and other such data structures and algorithms are things I would probably fail at a coding interview. Any general advice is welcome!

Places I Have my eye on applying to:

I don’t have any prior experience about any languages what so ever. Since I transferred school, I will be a rising sophomore in Fall. Seeing everyone in this sub doing really well and landing great internships makes me question that is really difficult learn data structures and algorithms on my own in fall while I’m taking 14 credits and secure internship for 2023 summer. Has anyone done this and if so, what resources did they find most helpful?"

I mainly use Java, and have made things like a snake game, calculator, and some other simple things like a to-do list with Swift, and an application for getting stock data with Java/spring boot. But, nothing really big like a website made by me or anything. Any advice is greatly appreciated, thanks"
vnzj46,0,2022-06-30,Getting into CS with a Business Administration degree and a software developer volunteer position?,smallchimp,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vnzj46/getting_into_cs_with_a_business_administration/,"In the past month, I began a software developer position with a non-profit organization as my first foray into the CS world. Prior to that, I graduated college with a bachelors degree in business administration at the end of 2020 and have yet to do a ""career"" position relevant to that degree. I have been programming in some capacity since 2018 or so and have taken on small projects to learn Java, JavaScript, Python, and most recently PHP (the language used for this volunteer position). 


What I'm wondering is what I can do to posture myself into a paid CS role to eventually become a software developer. I understand that a month of volunteering isn't the most notable qualification for a mostly unrelated resume, so I'm looking to set up a roadmap now rather than some number of months later.


Are there more accessible ""bridge"" positions where I can work towards software development from a business administration background? Ideally something that is typically remote so I can move. I've considered looking at internships, but most seem set aside for college students (of which I no longer qualify)."
vnzmqe,2,2022-06-30,UPenn vs UChicago vs Columbia ED for math major,momentumf1,IntltoUSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/vnzmqe/upenn_vs_uchicago_vs_columbia_ed_for_math_major/,"So basically I am having a hard time choosing between these options. What I have found out through internet research:

UChicago has a high international student population (they are also generous with aid?) and ED gives a large boost because they fill 75 percent of the class from ED.

Columbia and UChicago have core curriculums, but in UChicago you can choose, so ig it's better. Also I don't really want to do humanites at all in college so that's a disadvantage.

Tbh I don't even know how UPenn is still in the discussion because it's significantly lower than UChicago and Columbia in the ranking for their math UG program, but some Quora and reddit posts indicate that it has some kind of prestige.

All things considered I am tending to UChicago right now because of the chance boost and large population of international students as well as it's high ranking for math and good location for quant internships.

What do you guys think?"

I’m pair programming with her and tell her to make her class variables private. Then when she opens an MR, they’re public. It’s like she forgets what we talk about sometimes (this is just one example). She’s getting the concepts I’m talking about and bringing up valuable points in our pair programming sessions, but sometimes I need to remind her “We talked about this”, or “I mentioned it should be done as such..”. Why is she forgetting and how can I help her stop forgetting?"

vo09m1,14,2022-06-30,Is MS in CS really that helpful career-wise?,fatalchemist69,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/vo09m1/is_ms_in_cs_really_that_helpful_careerwise/,"I'm a 22yo Software Engineer/Game Developer and I have a B.Tech degree in CS from a Tier 1 private university in India. I have about 1 yoe as a SDE-1 right now, apart from a 6-months internship that I did before joining as a FTE.

I've been tinkering with the idea of going to the US to pursue a grad degree after a couple of years. But my main motivation for MS is the OPT period that the students get after they finish their degree because my goal is to work in US for a while and save up as much money as I can. But I'm in two minds about this, because I'll also be giving up two years to do MS that I could be working for instead.

So here are my questions to anyone who's done MS in CS or anyone just willing to give some advice: 
1. Does the MS degree itself help you level up your skills that much, compared to the two extra years of work experience that I could get instead? 

2. I've heard that with only an undergrad degree, you hit a ceiling at some point where it gets harder to get promoted. Is there any truth to this and if so can MS help with that?

3. A few of my friends went to the US for MS right after finishing their undergrad degree. But after graduating they will still have to start as freshers (with SDE-1 roles). I chose to work for a while instead and will probably be an SDE-2 by the time they graduate. Will the work experience that I already have + an MS degree help me progress in my career faster than just work experience and an undergrad degree? (I know promotions are very subjective and depends on how I'm performing at my current level, but you can assume that I'm able to handle my current responsibilities well) 

4. Since my goal is to work in the US and I'm not really interested in the research aspect of MS, would it make more sense to apply for jobs there directly instead of going the MS route?

vo2alx,72,2022-06-30,Is it possible to take a career break without destroying your career? I've never had a break the past 9 years and my health is bad.,jptboy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vo2alx/is_it_possible_to_take_a_career_break_without/,"Background info:

My parents are Asian so as soon as I got into high school the brutally hard work started. It's hard for people without strict Asian parents to know what it's like, but failure (getting &lt;As) was unacceptable and my home life was hell if my grades were bad (getting a B). High school was 4 years long. 

Fast forward to college my parents actually became chill somewhat, but the spirit of hard work they instilled into me actually manifested without fearing them and I became self-sufficient. I think I got an A in every CS class I took except for maybe one. I did two internships including one at a top company. I developed carpal tunnel syndrome and sciatica by overworking myself doing class projects and personal projects sophomore year. 

I never took a break in college, Summers either I was working minimum wage and doing personal projects or I was doing my internships. While I was taking my classes I was also grinding leetcode and doing hella projects.

College was 4 years/ no breaks at all. 

I graduated college and I found a job at a pretty good company it's not tier one but it's definitely tier 2 (you have probably used the product they are famous for). 

Now I've been working for one year. I also developed eye problems but at least they don't give me pain. 

I know there are people who grind their whole life without complaining but I fear that I'm headed into some sort of crisis the way I'm living. 

I wear a brace for my carpal tunnel and my doctor is aware of both my conditions but neither are serious enough to warrant surgery. He just tells me to stretch but the pain is always lingering even though it's not serious. 

So for my 8-hour work day since I sit at a computer all day physical pain starts affecting my work. I have to take breaks every 5-10 minutes but there is literally always pain and it never goes away. If I work more than 10 hours in a day to deal with some production issue or something my back pain is so bad I can't fall asleep sometimes. 

So basically I've been dealing with hip and back pain from sciatica and carpal tunnel for over 3 years now since it started in college. I also work remotely and my desk setup is very non-standard since my desk is super low. If I got a new job and I had to work in the office I'm not sure how I would be able to work on a desk height that's too high.

And to reiterate I've been to the doctor for these and they did the EMG exam and they just said both of them weren't that serious just do some stretches. They're right I'm not going to die of pain but dealing with pain while working at 22 years old for 3 years in a row has been very mentally taxing for me.

I think if I took a break from computer touching and did physical therapy everyday for like 1 year I could solve these issues. I feel like my carpal tunnel and sciatica never improved since I just have to keep sitting at a desk and typing for my career. I've worn my carpal tunnel brace for 3 years at this point.

Financially I would be completely fine if I just stopped working for one year but I'm worried it would just destroy my career from what I've seen online. 

If you've read my rant/life story ish till this point I appreciate it and I'm wondering if anybody has suggestions for me.

My mental health has been the thing that's most affected. Seeing other 22-year-olds live great quality of life even if they aren't getting paid as much as me makes me feel really bad. Just sitting at the computer and working for one hour is continuously painful and I have to keep doing it to make a living.

Tldr: I have been grinding since high school and I developed injuries (carpal tunnel back pain/sciatica) in college and working as a software engineer continuously has prevented recovery from these issues. Is it possible to take a break from working without destroying your career so that I can fix these issues?"

I am a research intern at this institution. A coworker of mine inherited a pc from an old coworker and he has been working/using the old coworker window user and password for a year now (all of his documents/files - data is stored there). I know it is super dumb of him to do that, but anyway. Today, we tried to change the old user name/information. Again, dumb. (I know we should have just created a new user and/or saved the data somewhere). So, we ""changed"" the username (renamed it). That's the only thing we did. Restarted the PC, and now we can't log in at all. The username changed to something different (still related to the older user - who can't remember any of his passwords). There is a password hint (doesn't work) and a restore password. But we have no idea what to do with that. The data in the PC is important.

Do you guys have any recommendations? (I am sorry for the poor explanation - I don't know the exact terms). Is there any way to log in, or save the data?"

I’m a rising freshman from South Asia. I applied to the US universities for undergraduate program, but I got straight rejections. I’ve settled for a local university, and plan to work for Graduate Admissions beforehand. I’ll be majoring in CS with a minor in Math or Econ, and would pursue CS in Masters/PhD too. For now, I’m planning with either Masters or direct PhD in mind, and wish to end up at a top university for CS (CMU or a similar university). I’ll be grateful if people here could somewhat guide me about the process and what to plan for ahead beforehand. I’ve also included a few queries below, if someone could kindly answer them.

- Is it worthful to opt for Minor in undergraduate to demonstrate academic capability/rigour?

- How important is Work Experience (Internships) with regards to Admissions?

- What can I specifically accomplish in CS to increase my chances? I know basic Python and Web Dev by now only, but I plan for becoming a Software Engineer in future.

- What type of extracurriculars should one pursue in college for applications? Do societies and volunteer work help, if yes how much? Also, does being a Teaching Assistant matter for application?

- How can I get involved in research work early? Students usually have multiple published research works, how could I get involved in such stuff ending up having published research? Should I work as Research Assistant to multiple professors to increase my chances

Lastly, any other advice would be highly valued. Thank you!"

- BCA (Bachelor of Computer Applications), 2021 - 8.74/10 from a tier 2 university. (3 year undergrad).
- Pursuing a 1 yr PG Diploma in CS &amp; AI from IIIT Delhi (Online). CGPA till now - 10/10
- Completed summer courses on Machine Learning and Data Analytics and relevant projects from IIT Kanpur.

GRE : 323 (161Q/162V);
TOEFL: 114

Work Experience: 2 yrs (at the time of matriculation) as Associate Engineer at one of the Big Four as an AWS resource. AWS CCP AND AWS Solutions Architect - Associate Certified.

Projects: 2 Machine Learning focussed. 2 on Analysis/Visualisation. At least 3 more in progress based on Machine Learning and Visualisation.

Extracurriculars: Was part of the Core team of a departmental group that organised annual college fests in undergrad. Head technical editor for the only technical magazine of my undergrad university (published articles on trending topics such as Big Data quarterly on the uni's intranet). Other volunteering experiences such as NSS. Part of Rotaract club.

LORs: Hopefully from the professors of my pg diploma or my iit kanpur course professors, and my current manager, if required.

Looking to apply for MS in CS programs and MS IS (Information Systems) and MS IM (Information Management), with AI/ML/DS specialisations, if available. Open to universities in USA, UK and Canada.

Couple of questions that I have-

a) Would my studies as 3yrs+1yrs affect my application negatively even if they fulfill most USA unis 4yr undergrad criteria? Same question for unis of UK and Canada.

b) Whom should I approach first for the LORs? From my pg diploma (iiit delhi) or summer courses (iit kanpur). And would having an LOR from my manager who is from the USA be beneficial or not?

c) Should I give GRE again? I'm aware my marks in quant are lower than general for CS, but GRE is optional for a lot of unis. So how much weightage would they give it given my profile? Would better marks make my chances better given that I have a 3 yr undergrad?

d) Is doing 1 yr masters in the US worth it? Or it it too difficult to find a job afterwards since we don't get an opportunity to do an summer internship?

e) How helpful are certifications like Amazon Web Services (AWS) or terraform in th application?

f) How are the job prospects in the UK and Canada for cloud, ML and DS?

g) Would doing a specific masters like MS AI or MS DS restrict job opportunities a lot?

I have started shortlisting universities since a couple of days and the ones I have so far are (these are not ranked or categorises as reach, moderate and safe right now so bear with me please)-

1. MSc. CS, Oxford (just because)
2. MS IM, UWashington
3. MCS, UIUC
4. MIM &amp; MS IS, UMaryland- CollegePark
5. MS CS, UCSD
6. MS IS, Northwestern
7. MS IS, NYU
8. MS IS, UT Austin
9. MS IS, UPittsburgh
10. MS IS, Northeastern

Will probably apply to around 15-18 programs overall, and wanted to understand where I stand so thati shortlist programs according to that.

Thank you in advance for any advice and comments."

Worked for 2 years in Intern Positions as ML Engineer / Cloud Engineering Intern in US/Germany/Denmark at a large corporate company, working mostly with Azure/Python as Tech Stack.

A company in Copenhagen has now offered me to join as Full-Stack for 75k€ ( 45k€ netto), but their Tech stack is something I have 0 experience with (Front-end development with e.g. Angular / Typescript). They have a great culture (e.g. no overtime), 37.5h/week, 50% growth per year over the last 5 years and company events and their median age is around 30. But also, e.g. only 25 vacation days and no remote. (no remote is no big deal for me on the first job) It would be exciting to join them, but I think staying in the field of ML/Data Science has better prospects. On the other hand, they had convincing opportunities to learn the whole tech stack on the job. Company size 350ppl/150 devs.

In Munich I am in multiple later-stage interviews, where salaries around 65k€ (35-40k netto) are common. It's usually 40h/week and 30 vacation days, benefits are slightly better.One position is around 63k€, in MLOps, 40h/week, hybrid (2 days office per week, also the option to workcation 30days per year in the EU). The company is less organized (processes) but in a more interesting position related to my previous work (python, Cloud, Machine Learning), where I think this experience can get me into other opportunities. Company size 250ppl/125 devs.

Should I take the offer from Copenhagen and change my field with the first fulltime job or go with a slightly smaller team in Munich in my field for a lower cost of living?"

To those who are experiencing stagnation or feeling that life has been tough, how are y'all coping?

I have been below average-average from young, no major achievements whatsoever. I dare not say that I have done my parents proud (in my opinion). Life has been getting tougher as I grew older whilst I dealt with mental health issues (anxiety, social anxiety, depression, ocd), lack of friends (partly due to my inept social skills and anxiety), subpar academics...

In the first half of 2022, I'm disappointed with myself (again and again):

\- Losing money in stocks and crypto; suffered 80% losses (my savings from many years of part-time work). I have never profited because I started investing end 2020 after the market pretty much recovered and boomed. Luna...My crypto also got stuck in Celsius. 

\- Subpar internship grade; barely scraped by to pass, supervisors were not impressed by my hard and soft skills. mental health spiraled.

\- No income; internships were not paid. coupled with my monetary losses mentioned above, It's makes me more depressed and anxious.

\- No social life/friends; struggling to manage my social anxiety and anxiety in general.

\- Tried therapy but it wasn't effective. I felt that the therapist was using too much toxic positivity and avoidance to guide me to dismiss the issues and feelings I'm experiencing.

\- Family's health issues adding on to my worries and fear.

\- Also wasted a lot of time overthinking and trying to get things to work but nothing seems to be working out.

At this point, I'm not sure...it is what it is? Or try...but I some things just doesn't work out..."

I've recently got a middle dev position at a new company. Nothing to brag about, but for someone who came to coding after 25, I'm happy with my results. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before switching to programming, I'd had a few failures with my business attempts and was so desperate after losing my investments, hoping to earn more, that I accepted to go to the free manual QA internship on the recommendation of my friend. Strangely enough, I fell for the job, although I had never dreamed of working in business development. After eight months of manual QA service, I decided to switch to automated options. But before I had the chance to practice my coding skills, I was offered to join a team of developers as a jun, and that's where the hell started. 

&amp;#x200B;

My day was divided into three, work, study, and sleep. In the year it took me to feel confident in my coding, I saw my friends twice, and any phone call mostly started and ended with """"I'm busy, I'll get back to you later."""" 

&amp;#x200B;

But even after I got better at coding and no longer worried I'd lose my job, I still wouldn't see my friends as much. No wonder when I finally reached some stability, the only friends left were those with a similar work schedule. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the guys at my work are in a similar situation. Not that I'm nagging about lack of social life, but sometimes I want to have a beer and talk with someone not only about the news from [https://hypeurls.com/](https://hypeurls.com/) or work-related issues. 

When I told my team lead about this, he said, """"You'll be lucky to have even one friends by the time you become senior, and you might start expecting your cat to answer your questions."""" I laughed, but his phrase made me wonder if this situation is actually that common for programmers.

It seems like many people on this subreddit have internships while at uni, so I was wondering when you all do them. Do you take a semester off? Do you cram all of your courses in the fall/spring so the summer is free? Is there a way to do an internship and school full-time? I have a scholarship that requires 30 credits a year and at least 12 credits in the fall and spring so I wouldn't be able to take either of those semesters off, but I hope that in the future summer semesters I won't have classes to take so I could do an internship then."

vocpyv,1,2022-06-30,Looking for a CPU Upgrade - VFX workflow specific,Pavlovian_Response,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/vocpyv/looking_for_a_cpu_upgrade_vfx_workflow_specific/,"I’m looking to upgrade my CPU, to aid my VFX workflow. More specifically, I’m a VFX compositor + FX Artist, who works almost exclusively in NukeX, Houdini, and Mocha Pro. I currently have a Ryzen 7 3700X, and am looking to upgrade. Most of my rendering is done with my CPU, and I’ve noticed that any heavy script or scene really suffers when it comes to computing and rendering things out.

Here are my current specs:
	AMD Ryzen 7 3700X
	NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER
	ROG Crosshair VIII Hero
	64GB DDR4 3000 MHz RAM
	850W Corsair / EVGA / Thermaltake 80 Plus Gold

My budget ideally is anything under $600. It’s okay if it goes a little over, but ideally somewhere below. CPUs are one of the components I know/understand the least about, so the help would be much appreciated. 

I am a VFX student and intern at the VFX company Framestore. Feel free to ask any more clarifying questions. Thanks in advance for all the help and advice!"

My current aspiration is to become a video game developer/programmer. I've looked around at available jobs and internships in my area. I've been practicing making games and coding in a few languages. To my knowledge getting the job is rather difficult, and have software engineer, data analyst, and highschool math teacher as my back up plans in that order. I was also thinking about dipping my toes in I.T. certifications as well. Should throw my net wide and try to learn as many skills as I can or better focus on game programming with software engineering as my back up to better guarantee the latter?"

Through out my life I was always an failure. in school I never got good grades and my grades were terrible and no one wants to be friends with me I was bullied by my classmates, seniors and even juniors because I was short. Everyday I was beaten up by a junior for nothing and soon seniors would join them to beat me up and make fun of me. Even fifth graders were taller than me(in 9th grade).  But I found my interest in coding and somehow got into C.S Bachelor's but still even now in university I was doing absolutely terrible my professors decided me not to pass in 3 subjects in my sophomore. I made few personal projects and the people were not interested. I tried applying for internships but got rejected from everywhere, I tried freelancing and never had success.  Now I'm thinking I'm good for nothing. Before making the decision of ending my life I was working on creating a new Programming Language using C and Assembly. And now I think atleast I should Finish this project before ending my Life once it for all. I think it's 40% done and pretty much soon I can bootstrap that language. Its pretty much will be a failure just like my other projects but atleast I should finish it. My family got a wonderful daughter everytime she is feel proud she was good in Academics and sports both and everyone liked her and Questioned me that is she really YOUR younger sister? It's hard to believe man. I mean yeah she is smart and charming. Unlike me who is unlikeable and ugly as hell. I think my parents should have aborted me because I've bring nothing but disappointed to them. Even yesterday in University when I asked pen from my batch. Her friend yelled at me. She said ""Hey get away from her, you ugly pig"" (it's a pretty much equivalent translation to make sense in English). I mean yeah my existence hurts everyone and it's pretty clear. I promise to Update you once it's finished to be released before saying my last good byes to you all and make everyone free from a weirdo like me"
voezv2,7,2022-06-30,Do your parents EVER say the word sorry?,OpenScratch5758,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/voezv2/do_your_parents_ever_say_the_word_sorry/,"I can’t remember my mom or dad ever saying sorry to me. 

I remember we once wanted to go to a family dinner. I was vegetarian at that point for healthy reasons and we went to a sushi place with no vegetarian options so I ate literally the salad they served with the food and nothing else. I was mad, they never said sorry but felt horrible because I didn’t eat.

My mother didn’t know where I lived for a year because she was ‘absent minded’. She doesn’t notice much about my life except my 4.0 GPA. She has never said sorry for being absent.

My dad once hit me. He never said he was sorry.

My mom once told me she could never find symmetry in my face because my nose was always crooked and it made me not marriage worthy. 

When I was underweight and a professional swimmer, they told me my thighs were massive and I wore a size 4 and a size small. They felt bad after but made ir up to me by buying me food that I couldn’t eat because I felt fat as fuxk.

They lied to me about when my father went To medical school and put unrealistic expectations on me which were never put on my sibling. I had a breakdown when I couldn’t do 3 internships + 2 jobs at once. Despite never being on financial aid. When I had a mental breakdown, they never once took responsibility and said I couldn’t handle the stress. 

None of these incidents are to highlight that they’re abusive. I would gladly take them. They just have never ever said sorry to me. Not once 

Do any of your Asian parents not say sorry to you EVER?"

I'm a dumb CS major. I'd like to work for an aerospace company, but I'm still confused about how the intern process works. Please bare with me, I'm just trying to educate myself.

If you're a paid intern at a company, are you allowed to deny the job offer if you decide on something else? What happens then?

What are the benefits, if any, of taking on an unpaid internship over a paid internship?

If you intern at a company, let's say, the summer before your junior year (if possible), then what? Do you just wait until you graduate and then, boom, instant job? What if you took on multiple internships? 

&amp;#x200B;

Again, I'm not trying to sound rude, I'm just a little slow in the head and don't know how this stuff works."

voi4eq,3,2022-06-30,Anybody feeling charitable today?,stibgock,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/voi4eq/anybody_feeling_charitable_today/,"I'm struggling today. I'm 39, and was a bartender for 10 years until 2020. 

I've always had a programmer mentality. I Went through the ZTM junior web dev course back in 2018 as I was already trying to plan my exit from bartending, to save my achy knees. I went through plenty of the YouTube tutorials (JavaScript30, web dev simplified...) and I have enjoyed every minute of it!

In June 2020 I enrolled at my city's community college in their Web Developer Certificate program. Aced it, loved it. Landed an internship through one of the sister college's design program where we work on  a wide range of products for real clients. I built a few helpful utilities for the staff/students within the internship which garnered me some accolades. I also designed a PWA system for one of the clients and after the success of that, four more clients wanted these apps.

My project organiser encouraged me to get a sole proprietor business license so I could be a vendor for the school and get paid (it was a paid internship) for my work separately. I did, and since then he has ordered ten of these web apps and the city of Davis is interested in one as well. All while doing this, I continue/d to grind out tutorials, do tons of experimenting and learning and researching and reading and literally coding till the early morning (which I'm working on cutting back because my fiance doesn't like when I'm a code zombie) and I've been applying to jobs for a long while now. A couple hundred on LinkedIn alone.

I've had ***zero*** interviews. I've joined discord groups that do some resume reviews and participated in portfolio reviews on different subs here. Both my resume and portfolio have gone through many transformations and I feel like they aren't the worst things out there, but why, for the love of Zod, can I not get a resume past the gates of hr?!

I'm receiving no feedback from anybody and I'm really hitting a wall right now. It's hard to tell, at this point, what things I'm doing are wasting time, and which are helpful. My little bro started a Bootcamp a couple months ago and I feel like he'll land a job before me because of the built in job guidance and reference.

I will give millions of Internet points if anyone has any time to just look at my resume and portfolio and just tell me what is wrong with me. What am I doing wrong? What can I do to change it? Is there something on my resume that gets it thrown directly in the trash? Are there no places that will give me a chance without years of precessional experience?

Revature sent me an invite for their September group. I'm feeling the desperation of ""last call"" kicking in and they are the prettiest available girl in the bar right now.

Im blessed to be having any options at all as a new grad with no internships, etc but I need help understanding and getting a sanity check on if/how much to negotiate.

Job 1:

Firm offer in hand, just under 90k, questionable glassdoor reviews, would have to move to a place I dont really want to live in, where the minimum rent is $2k a month for an apartment.

But the work is genuinely cool, using good tech (think systems-y work ), and I think its somewhere I can get experience that would grow my career. They want me to sign the offer asap, and I can feel them getting antsy (got the offer maybe 2 or 3 days ago)

Job 2:

No actual offer yet, but definitely trending that way. Will likely know by tomorrow.

Salary based off glassdoor is likely very close to Job 1, but this job is fully remote, which would save me around \~20k a year since I could just live at home.

However, its a job doing web dev with very proprietary technology and I feel like it would really pigeonhole me if my only work experience is with a super proprietary stack.

I know that Job 1 was approved to pay up to \~95k for a new hire, so I feel like I could maybe get to that? But I worry that they might pull the offer, because up until today both myself and the company where sure I was 100% taking their offer (job 2 sprung up out of nowhere essentially).

What would you do in this scenario?

&amp;#x200B;

E: got the 2nd offer, its for roughly 8k less, but is fully remote which would still be a net financial gain. "
