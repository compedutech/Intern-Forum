npgxpu,442,2021-05-31,My results for the sem,getitoffyrchest,nus,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/npgxpu/my_results_for_the_sem/,"I know this isn't the kind of results you're expecting someone to so proudly share, but here goes:

 B+, B+, B+, B-, CS

Cumulative CAP: 3.33

This is actually one of the best results in my entire uni life. Almost always, I'd have additionl Ds or Cs on top of my miserable few Bs.

I always feel ashamed sharing my grades. As you can see, there's really nothing proud to share... But it definitely feels good letting it out. I don't even know why I'm so afraid of sharing something I worked so damn hard for - perhaps it's not up to societal standards (didn't even secure an internship, and I'm going to Y3)

If you ask me, I'm both happy and disappointed in myself. Happy that I made it through another semester, doing my very best, but also disappointed that I've never ever gotten an A in my entire uni life, despite my best efforts. But hey, in exchange for that, I had B- for a subject I thought I was going to get a D for... That's a fair trade I guess?

If you're one of those slower learners like me, lurking around, I just wanted to let you know that you're not alone, and not everyone gets As. Yes, it's disappointing that your grades don't compare with your peers, but try to remember that what matters most is that you did your best and the learning process. One day, it's going to click and you'll definitely understand everything better, so be patient!

If you're fortunately one of the smarter kids (that I absolutely adore and am grateful for), please continue to help those in need. But don't give them answers blindly. Challenge them to think differently and guide them in the right path. Also, please don't casually ask for other people's grades. I don't know how many times I had to feel like shit lying that my D was a C just to feel less dumb.

As one of the slower learners out there (I'm that CS kid who's always clueless and having to ask my friends lots of questions), here's something I always tell myself to keep me going - maybe it'll help:

You don't have to be the best, but you must always do your best!

Please don't ever give up and you can hmu for a chat anytime!

Enjoy your summer break and see you in school next sem!"
nphxa4,1,2021-05-31,"I left my internship at a toxic architectural firm kind of unprofessionally after I was tricked into working there longer than my 6 months internship period as stated in my contract, and two months later my ex boss won't stop bothering me about it.",ToddlePot,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/nphxa4/i_left_my_internship_at_a_toxic_architectural/,"I know how internships are nothing but a cheap workforce for every professional department, I know why it's a necessity, but what I didn't know was how much stressful it was going to be for me for such little pay. P.s. I'm gonna try and make this as short as I can so pardon my grammar.

Now where I worked was no corporate office, rather a private but a well known architectural firm. I joined back in September last year and the first two months were the hardest, It took some time getting used to all the work related sacrifices such as missing parties and not being able to hang out with friends etc. But after those two months I had to make my work my life, there was no fixed quitting time, there was no proper management in the office, I'd get random work from home calls on weekends. I barely got time for myself and whatever time I had would be spent at the laundry or shopping for supplies. I felt like I'm living this pointless life where I had to do was work and nothing else.

At this point I wanted to quit the job and take a break but I couldn't since I signed a 6 months contract so I continued suffering until my contract was supposed to be over. But I still wanted to make sure whether or not I have to submit my 2 weeks notice so I went to my boss 2 weeks before I was supposed to leave and asked him if I have to turn in a notice or whatnot, he got all nice and said don't worry about it and asked me if I'd like to join in as a full time employee, at first I dismissed it as a joke that I feel like I'm already a full time employee to which he scoffed and said that I'll have more responsibilities and I'd get a pretty decent paycheck which made me reconsider my decision to quit since I was only getting paid next to nothing and was living off on my parents' money, so I agreed and asked him for the details about my position and paycheck to which he said we'll discuss it later. 

He dismissed me for the next 5 weeks whenever I asked him about the offer saying he'll talk about it when he thinks I'm ready for it, and I was already past 3 weeks of my contract and he still didn't talk to me about my offer, so one day I made up my mind that if he doesn't tell me I'll do something stupid like break something in his office and quit on the spot, so I went in and asked him until he finally gave in and basically said that I'll get paid less than minimum wage until I get my degree to which I obviously got mad and then he tried manipulate me into thinking that this is good for me, that I'm a good worker and working here would open up a lot of career opportunities for me. I obviously saw through all of that and decided I'm gonna leave him hanging whenever he needs me the most. 

And then so after a week I gave in my two weeks notice, amidst a big project, which he dismissed by saying I'm making a huge mistake and that he needs me here to which I said it's very stressful for me to work here I can not work here anymore plus it's way past my contract now and he again dismissed me claiming I don't know what I'm saying. He didn't accept my notice so I tried again a week later and this time I lied that I'm being offered a better job elsewhere which he tried to talk me out of but I dodged all of his BS until he finally accepted my notice. I was happy that this is all over now but that guy made sure that I'd suffer the coming two weeks as much as he could. I realised that within 3 days so this time I lied that I have covid and sent him my old positive report with the dates changed and got to quit that toxic workplace early. Although, I wasn't paid for my extra month, it was still worth it.

But after a week or so he called me and asked me to do some work for him in my free time to make up for the remaining unpaid time that I left, so I said ""sure why not"" in a sarcastic tone and hung up on him. And ever since that he has been calling me once every two weeks to do some free work for him, I won't pick up but the guy won't stop calling, so now I feel bad. Did I do something wrong?"

I am an IT sophomore (will be junior in a couple of months) from India, we run a small discord server for students (~350) of our university. 

I'll act as the head for technical mentorship for 2021-22 session. We have talented student mentors from my batch, who are good in domains like Appdev(kotlin/flutter), web(MERN), ML, C/C++, Java etc and are willing to guide the batch of 2024 and 2023, and help them learn programming. It's basically a Student Teaching-Student Program for the session August 2021 to May 2022. 

We plan it to be more of a project based learning experience (like MLH Fellowship perhaps) using open-source projects maintained by the mentors. Not all mentees are at the same level though, some are are new to the domain while some have already made small projects by themselves.

What would you recommend to be the ideal way to execute this program, I want all of us to learn as much as we can and introduce the fellow students to open source and to have some good projects at the end of the ~1 year program. Provided that I and the mentors will be juniors during this program and we'll also be focussing on our internships, projects, and academics.

Is there a way to get a sponsor for facilitating stuff like Google Cloud Platform credits for ML, Docker for webdevs etc? Regarding monetary help, we have asked the administration of the university, they are willing to support us if we need any.

Thanks for the help, have a nice day!"

Currently, I am an application security intern who finds himself with some spare time, as well as an empty wallet. I am not narrow-minded regarding what I could do, but something technical would be much more enjoyable, and look better as experience on a college app/resume.

My question is: would this be possible? I am quite well-spoken and professional, and while I may not be a full-stack developer or a data scientist, I am fully capable of doing relatively basic IT work at the level of an accredited employee. I have decent programming skills, have networking knowledge, can script very well, and know Linux like the back of my hand.

I would greatly appreciate any advice, as I would like some insight before I spend a few hours cold-emailing hiring managers.

Thanks!"

Yea, the last post I dumped out here was depressed me worrying about my father's cancer and not being able to pay for graduate school, and trying to figure out a job that would take any doofus with a humanities degree. Yea, good times.

That's right folks, I've literally mentally broken down and not only have I failed a class that I started the year with an A- in, my father is literally refusing to pay for any more school because ""I'm not paying for you to fail classes"" (and he's right, he shouldn't). Not that I really should go to school at this point. Honestly I was probably a coin flip away from taking a gap year anyway, since I don't think I'm mentally ready to keep going at this point.

So. My scenario's changed; a few big things are still important, a few are now a lot worse than before. Warning folks, essay ahead.

I'm now probably about to be either taking a temporary absence from college or a college dropout, trying to figure out what sort of work I'm qualified to do. My only requirements and desires for work are:

\- Boston area (I still want to be close to my parents, even if at this point they've made it clear they view me as a failure). Above everything else, this is a dealbreaker. Yes, they hate me now for messing up college, and they have every right to do so. Hell, I hate myself for falling apart this badly. They probably wish I'd just feck off and die in a far off corner out of sight. But I still do care about them, and I'm holding out some vain hope I guess that someday they'll forgive me. And if my father's cancer suddenly gets worse I want to be at least close.

\- Preferably above minimum wage (doing the math and budgeting I can survive on minimum wage, so combining such budgeting with a job above that would allow me to save up to maybe take some classes when I'm mentally ready again). Alternatively, I'd also be ok with something at minimum wage that has more than 40 hours a week, since that'll earn me extra cash anyway. At this point it's more about pulling enough a week to pay the bills and save a little.

\- Sundays off. Considering being religious at this point because I'm lacking any real meaning in life, so having a Sunday off would let me visit a random church or something. Or if that doesn't work, it at least gives me one day to drink my misery away. Otherwise, screw Saturdays or having a second day off, more days worked means more bills paid baby.

\- Preferably no overnights. I mean, I'll do overnights if there's no other option, but I'd rather at least be able to sleep like a normal person.

\- Actual upward mobility in terms of wages or promotion potential is nice to have, but it's not a dealbreaker. Objective here is to survive, not to become a millionaire. I'm already prepared to accept the lower class life and abandon all hope of the lower middle class, dating, having a family, social respectability, etc.

\- Preferably a place with less on-call duties. Still willing to take it, and fine with it once in a while, but it would be nice to have a guaranteed time in the day off so I can pretend I have a social life. By which I mean walk around alone or sit in my broom closet and cry I guess.

\- Preferably something that doesn't require me to own my own transportation. This is actually kind of important, since not owning a vehicle might save me 200 dollars a month. Boston has a decent public transit system (when it isn't on fire or in a blackout) and very compact (most important areas in the city are generally within 30 minutes walking distance of each other) so not having a car is very doable. So if I can get away with not having a car, I can cut down a huge part of expenses with relatively limited impact to my quality of life. Hell, my estimated minimum wage budget requires me to not have a car, or else I'll be about 100 bucks a month in the red.

\- Absolute dealbreaker: this job needs to be 100% legally clean. Yes, I have a friend from high school who deals drugs now. He already brought a house and his own sports car. But I have a moral code of sorts. Yes, having a moral code is a liability in the economy. Sorry.

\- Absolute dealbreaker: nothing 100% commission. Tried 100% commission sales once ""for fun"". Made less than minimum wage after months of trying. Never even broke above minimum wage for a single day the whole time. I guess I'm just not a good salesman.

\- Would prefer W2 instead of 1099 but screw it I can't be too picky

\- A stable schedule would be nice but I'm literally unqualified unskilled labor at this point so that's probably a pipe dream

Other random things:

\- I have a few years of part-time work in fast food to help pay for college. Not much but it did get me a little bit of money I guess. Most of the money went to paying for college but I put aside a small amount for emergencies so I do have roughly 2k available. I also have a bit left over from a few summers spent teaching English abroad which I dumped in stocks; at least that went alright and it's currently sitting at just under 9k. I'd prefer to keep that untouched and let it grow a bit as a last resort reserve but if necessary it'll let me live for 3-4 months, or take a good chunk out of a bill or two.

\- Thanks to working part time, teaching abroad in the summer, family savings and my father, I've only had to take subsidized federal student loans, so my student loan debt isn't absolutely crushing compared to others'. I'd estimate it's at around 18k right now. Sadly I won't earn enough to keep it from ballooning, so . . . could be worse but it still hurts a lot.

\- I've had a few years part time in fast food, as I mentioned. I'm generally seen as a reasonably reliable worker. I'll admit I'm not perfect, I've been late to work a few times here and there, but generally I make every effort to communicate and show up on time, I do my work, I try to learn fast, and I don't muck around. I lead the closing shift at my current store (by which I mean I'm the only person in the store for about the last 3 hours, which is the manager's way of hiring as few people as possible, not having to give me a promotion to shift lead, and making my life as miserable as possible). So I guess that means I'm reliable and dependable enough. Probably not enough to qualify me for any better paying job though. Plus, my manager's so desperate for a person who can close reliably (person before me apparently just stole all the cash and disappeared after a week; two newest hires are horrible, first person spends 2-hour breaks and chats on her phone even when there are customers waiting, second guy stopped showing up after just three days) that there's a chance he'll give out bad references just to keep me there. Recently I've been told by my manager that if I need extra hours, I'm free to clock in whenever I want and work as long as I want, so I guess he's cool with paying me overtime . . . but not with giving me a raise or a promotion. Jesus Christ. Staying there is the failsafe option, but if he's never going to hire any help or fire our two disasters of recent hires (who are still on the payroll and schedule btw) I have questions about whether I actually want to stay there. Plus I'm kinda sick of fast food low wages and the constant on-call.

\- I've spent three summers working as an English and History teacher at a private school in Taiwan. I worked Monday-Friday in a severely understaffed school so in addition to teaching and tutoring, I did limited janitorial work and a lot of clerical stuff. Most days were between 10-14 hours. Hated the hours but the pay was legendary so I can't complain. Near the end of the second summer the school slightly expanded the English language program due to success and popularity of my teaching, so I became in charge of two teachers I was supposed to train. In the third year (last year before Covid-19) the school won a few awards for the English program and the English drama class won a competition between a bunch of schools in the Taipei area, so I guess that went reasonably well. But that was foreign work experience in the summers only, and it's not like I have the degree or qualifications to teach anything here in the US, so . . . best I can do is say I know how to work with kids? Lead? Kind of useless work experience without a degree. Would be legendary resume bragging rights if I didn't fuck up college and got through graduate school. Sucks to suck I guess.

\- I spent half a year in high school volunteering at my local library sorting and shelving books. I'm really reaching with this one.

\- I had an internship at a local elementary school as part of one of my two majors (education). Wish I could say more about it but it was more of just sitting, watching classes, and taking notes. Good for school, and program requirement. Not too useful for work.

\- I have one month of another internship at a middle school. This time I actually helped teach a class. Program requirement again, but this time it also proved I could work with kids (plus this was a special needs class so I guess I could prove patience). Went well, but the year was 2020. So I lost it because I was not part of the school's core personnel. Plus it was a program requirement, so I can't actually graduate with an education degree anymore. My life is a joke.

\- I spent several years in middle school, high school, and college as a freelance classical musician. Mostly occasional monthly weekend stuff. Not really enough to live on but just some pocket change, which is good enough for a high schooler. Even managed to score a gig with the Boston Economic Council and the German Federal Foreign Office, which was epic. Got into NEC. Then I injured myself during a gig, and the damage has prevented me from returning to a professional level. My life is a joke. I guess I can act and look professional? Meet deadlines? Handle pressure? Not sure how else to spin this. ""Handle pressure"" is a bit of a joke now, lol.

\- I've done a little bit of tutoring work here and there during college for extra cash. Tutoring a few kids music theory, used to have a student from Taiwan I taught English, used to have a few kids I taught history. Work's dried up for the most part though since apparently I don't have degrees, so they jump ship for the guy with the fancy master's degree even though he costs twice as much as me. Oh well, wasn't earning enough to live on that anyway.

\- At this point I don't really care about benefits. No pension, pretty much useless health insurance, one week off a year, who gives a damn. Worker protection laws in MA are pretty decent anyway. Plus I don't really care. Can't pay hospital bills anyway so if I get seriously injured or sick it might be better to just die anyway.

\-I don't expect to need to support anyone else besides myself. At this point I also don't really care about starting a family or being ""successful"". I don't really deserve that. Maybe above 40k here I might have a little hope, but trying to do that below 40k would just be financially irresponsible. Plus, nobody's gunna date a depressed fast food worker. Never got anywhere in that field in college so I figure I'm sufficiently hardened to that reality anyway. Fortunately my brother's doing well with his compsci major and his girlfriend's in medical school, so between the two of them chances are good they'll earn enough to settle down, take care of my parents, and keep the family going, so I guess that's one responsibility off my back. Thank god I'm the only dumbass in the family.

\- I don't have much else in my skillset sadly. I guess I can type fast? Use some generic computer programs? Talk about irrelevant history stuff? Learn fast (what employer even cares about that anymore)? Interact with people? I have a driver's license, clean criminal history and don't do drugs at all, which is at least something. Yea I'm really reaching here. Some of the few folks I'm friends with and my coworkers at work tell me I'm pretty funny and friendly, but what employer gives a shit about that. Tried to learn how to code but just never really figured out anything beyond the basics, which is a bit sad considering how apparently learning to code is the golden ticket these days. Yea, I guess I'm just unskilled.

I know in the past I've specifically requested more professional-type work in an office or whatever, but I've scrapped that requirement. Screw it, beggars can't be choosers. Physical strength, interests, desires be damned. Construction labor? I'm down. Picking up garbage? I'm down. Landscaping? Screw skin cancer, I'm down. Most of the blue collar folks I've met working fast food are more humble and patient than the white collar professionals anyway. The plumbers, construction laborers, and auto technicians I serve don't mind if I mess up their order, as long as I just redo it they laugh it off and wish me a nice day. The doctors start screaming if I take more than thirty seconds. Physical labor might be nice anyway after spending my entire life an academic. Might not never get into a relationship with a girl with a low-paying blue collar job over the business executive, but I guess I can always hang out with the other guys at the bar and win trivia night with my knowledge. I do have a bad back from an injury long ago but I figure I can maybe put down 10 years or so before it gets real serious. No matter what, even if it's roasting in the sun or being knee deep in sewage for 12 hours a day, if it pays, it pays. Literally anything that will take any old loser is ok; with no drugs and a half decent work ethic I might actually be qualified for those jobs. Yes, I'm not physically particularly strong right now; hopefully with a few years of work I'll grow the strength. Don't know if anyone will take me without strength though.

Rant over, folks. Fire away with those job options. Or roast me for my useless degree and for falling apart. I don't care; be blunt and realistic, I need to know what I can do, and if I'm screwed I need to know that too. Extra points for Boston area ideas or advice for urban areas, since there's obviously not a lot of farms or mines here."

npn1ok,1,2021-06-01,Dorm or commute? Which seems like the better option?,spoodydoo,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/npn1ok/dorm_or_commute_which_seems_like_the_better_option/,"So a major source of my anxiety has been school costs. Thanks to grants, plus the money my school offers, I will likely be paying little-to-nothing in tuition, thus *not* likely needing loans or out-of-pocket payments for those particular costs.

Where my dilemma lies is in housing options. My original plan was to try out housing for the year and see if I would like it. The only thing is that it will end up costing me around 15k in loans for just one year for room and board, plus meal plan (just estimating here; could be anywhere from 12-16k per year depending on what’s available).

I have just been given another option. A relative of mine lives around 25 miles (20-30 mins depending on traffic) from campus and said that I do not have to pay them anything to stay with them if I decide to commute. I will be doing my chores (obviously), keeping things tidy and staying in a small guest bedroom. My only costs in that scenario will be gas, food, basic amenities, and any books/supplies I need to purchase/rent for school. If I get a full tank of gas once per week (car gets ~26 mpg) I can expect to pay around...maybe 1.5k?? per year on that, and less than 1k on food (hopefully 100 per month...guilty of purchasing junk food but I will try to cut those costs as much as possible). The sum of *those* costs seems way more manageable. I’m even considering getting a summer job, saving that money, and putting it towards those costs (which at the end of the summer should be more than enough accumulated). If not then my parents will likely help with those costs, but I don’t want to burden them.

In enrolling I want to eventually take part in an internship and involve myself in a club or two. Ideally I would want to plan classes to be only 3-4 days per week, and maximize the amount of hours I’m on campus to take advantage of any activities/services that are available. Part-time job opportunities, career fairs, yadda yadda yadda. 

I’m just wondering if dorming would be worth the potential 30k in loans accrued over two years or if I should at least try out commuting for a bit and see how it goes. The commute will involve the parkway and some unpredictable motorists, which kinda scares me, but student debt scares me more in the long term, I think. 

Any thoughts? Anyone else have this dilemma?"

I want to get into IT (after a soulless job in finance) and have yet to choose an area of IT to focus on. I like cyber security as an area of study and find the challenges of cyber security a meaningful way to build a rewarding career. As a result, I returned to university to get a degree and recently my university is offering an ISM degree with an emphasis in cyber security. This means that a student takes an additional 2 ISM classes in cyber security that allows this “emphasis in cyber security” to be added. I should mention these classes aren’t technical rather conceptual as in not learning anything outside of what a basic SEC+ certification would offer. 


My question here is that does a degree that comes with an “emphasis in cyber security” added to the bottom meaningful in terms of job prospects? Should i not worry about such titles and just focus on graduating/getting internships?

The goal is to write these articles in Markdown, store them in a database and parse them with Parsedown before displaying.

One idea I had was to add a Preview button that POSTs the form to its own page to display the parsed text before it's published (since the user isn't someone who uses Markdown regularly so she can check for mistakes before sending). In addition, I don't want the content of the fields to disappear when the button is clicked, so I want to insert the POST values back into them. This isn't working out, though.

    &lt;div class=""presentation""&gt;
        &lt;form id=""actuform"" action="""" style=""text-align: center;""&gt;

                if(choice==0){ 
                    form.action=""actu_post.php""; // publish
                } else {
                    form.action=""""; // preview

When I run this, the URL shows the POST values, but the fields are blank and the preview does not appear. I'm unsure of how I should go about debugging this. Is there something obvious I'm missing?

A little background of myself, I'm a rising junior at uni majoring in CS. I was able to have the opportunity to do a research internship for my uni (specifically a REU) this summer. The research will consist of machine learning and statistics. And I will be using Python to do any necessary coding. I don't really have experience in those areas, that's why I decided to do this internship to learn something new.

Today was the first day of my internship and had a meeting with my mentor. Right off the bat, while she was explaining the project I will be working on, she was saying how she wanted me to do this and that (like manipulating files using Python) and asked if I could do that. And to be honest I said, ""well, not really, sorry I'm just really new to all of this."" She responded by saying that it's fine and gave me some tasks to do like familiarize myself with Python and its usage.

I know it's only my first day but I can't help feeling stupid (imposter syndrome). Like just wondering if my mentor expected me to actually know what they want and that I could do it. I guess I fear that my mentor has high expectations for me and I don't want to let her down. Like if I don't meet those expectations, I just be wasting their money (this is a paid research internship). Feeling like I won't be able to make any contributions to the project. Obviously, I'm going to work hard and try my very best, but I feel like my best isn't enough. I've read many posts about this (having imposter syndrome) and they say things like ""it gets better"" or ""ask lots of questions"" etc. but I literally have no idea what's going on and my ability/knowledge isn't the best.

Just wondering if anyone could relate to this. Just wanted to get this off my chest.

I was a little surprised that there wasn't much discussing the event here so I'll share my thoughts. If nothing else, it'll give everyone a break from the same old profile reviews, school debates, and nuanced school selection help. 

# Overview

The event is positioned as a way for incoming MBA students already admitted into ""top"" MBA programs to meet companies and begin their MBA networking. The event was virtual this year and took place from May 6th - 7th. Between the two days, there were probably 8 events I attended followed by virtual happy hours. It had somewhere between 500-1,000 attendees.  Typically, they hold the even in NY at the NYU campus and they made it sound like Goldman Sachs treats all the attendees to some pretty lavish meals and happy hours (no idea how true that is). The event had representatives from a lot of the major firms in Tech, Consulting, Finance, and CPG. The tech firms were Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Adobe. There were big names for consulting and finance but I have zero interest in those so I paid less attention. In order to attend, you must submit a resume. From you resume, the representatives from the firms will select certain students to have a 1 on 1 with. The event cost $50. 

# The Good

1. **The Companies**: I plan to pursue tech so having 3 of the 5 FAAMG companies was pretty sweet. On top of that, their presentations were incredibly helpful. They each went into detail about what they look for in intern applications, what their interviewing is like, what roles they offer to MBA grads, and what working there is like. Hearing how they recruit and for what roles alone made this event worth it in my mind. This felt like the a very natural next step in obtaining the next level of information necessary to start to pursue roles at these firms. 
2. **The Structure**: This was an event that I actually think is better virtually. Having to take time off work, book a flight and hotel, then travel to NY is a pretty steep cost. Yes it would make networking better but I don't think that is a huge asset of this event (more to come). Being able to attend the sessions in between meetings for work while taking notes at your desk in casual attire instead of in an auditorium while having to be in business formal was well worth the trade off. I actually took the two days off work but in hindsight I didn't need to. I was expecting to be on video speaking with representatives the whole time but that was not the case. Most the presentations didn't allow for attendees to speak or show video. Questions were just through the chat. 

# The Bad 

1. **School Presentations**: This was so bad I actually think it slipped off P&amp;Qs radar. One of the first events was having 5 schools talk about how great their program is for entrepreneurship. I almost think the schools paid to be able to speak and pitch their programs but it makes no sense why. Everyone at this event had already committed to a school so there was absolutely no value in hearing about other programs offerings. 
2. **Company One on Ones and Connections**: I am a pretty mediocre applicant (690 GMAT, T20 Program (realistically it's a T25 school but this is my review not yours so were going T20)) so I was only invited to one One on One with a Consulting firm. They only last 15 minutes and the firm really just tells you about other events they have coming up they want you to attend. This was the most misleading part of the event. I thought I would at least be able to stop by a Tech company's virtual both and introduce myself and get a card from them but unless you get selected, there is absolutely zero time to network with the companies of your choosing. Some student once upon a time got a internship offer at this event and P&amp;Q shouts that from the rooftops despite it being a one in a million chance of ever happening. 
3. **Networking:** Virtual networking is tough as is but it felt really off to network with a bunch of students all going to different programs. It wasn't hostile or uncomfortable  but it just felt very naïve to think any of those connections would bring any value down the road. We're all about to start at different schools where there will be hundreds of students, alum, faculty, and recruiters that we meet on day one and start to build relationships with. Unless you *really* hit it off, I don't see myself reaching out to someone saying ""hey we met virtually for 5 minutes at that P&amp;Q event, want to reconnect?"". Then there was zero opportunity to network with the companies unless invited. 

# Review

Overall, the event was worth it. $50 and a couple of days off work (which I didn't need to take) in exchange for getting insight into how all my dream jobs recruit and what they look for was well worth it. If it's virtual again next year, I'd encourage anyone to go. If it's in person, I would be much more hesitant unless you aren't working and have the money to spare. Or if you are someone who can really make solid connections at networking events like that."

npxn5j,4,2021-06-01,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (5/31/2021),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/npxn5j/weekly_job_qa_thread_5312021/,"Hi all,

Here is the sixty-sixth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

I'm worried I'll run out of fuel before my first paycheck,   


I'm still doing instacart as I'm treating fuel like currency, looking for the most Fuel I can get for the least amount spent. And while this Works in large part for my current needs, the math doesn't add up after I start working at Walmart.  


It's a 20-mile loop, from school, to work, to my safe parking space, and back. assuming no delays, I get 30 miles to the gallon. I have a 13-gallon tank and paranoia of running out of fuel. Some nights here in Denver too cold, and I don't own a blanket yet. so I have to run the engine and the heat for maybe 15-45 minutes a night, I figure that costs me 2 gallons in gas.  


It's $3.00 a gallon here in Denver, and I never take an instacart job that's less than $30 in payment. a lot of these jobs will cost me 2-5 gallons of gas. Normally I can cash out half of the amount paid to me. so if the job pays $30, I can cash out $15.   


I have class Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and I am lucky to get a delivery in before classes, however, this cuts into the number of hours I can get for internships, of which 160 are required for graduation.  


I have work Friday Saturday,  Sunday, and Monday.  


Sorry, i know this was a bit of a long rant, but shit happens. Living out of my car is no joke."

I just finished my second year of college and I looking for internships, but I do not know the best way of going about it and I am not sure if I have the skills needed. I have done really well in my classes so far and know the basics in C++ (data structures such as balanced trees, graphs, heaps, any type of linked lists and algorithms such as quicksort, Dijkstra's shortest path, mergesort, Huffman encoding) but do not have much experience except for the projects I have made for my classes. With this knowledge, am I ready for a basic internship and if so, what types of internships should I look for? What are the best ways to do research about these internships and find them in the first place? If I am not ready yet, what are some specific skills I can learn over the summer that will make me ready? I am not sure what field I would want to go into but machine learning, A.I., and data science have seemed interesting. I would gladly take an internship in any field just to get the experience though. I also have experience in haskell, oz, and prolog but they are not as proficient as my C++ skills and seem like they are not really used in real applications as often.

I'm 27 and went to community college for IT. The degree is titled ""Associate's in Science Computer Information Technology."" I graduated in 2015. I had to get an internship for one of my required courses, so I went to local government and got an internship in their IT Department. After graduating, I got a full-time job in local government, but with a different one. It was contract work and they didn't hire me full-time after the contract period. Total, I would say I have a little less than a year's worth of experience between the internship &amp; full-time job in my field.

After that position, I took a what I wanted to be *short* break from working, but then I ended up just not looking and it has continued until now. I help around the house and make sure I'm not a complete lazy bum for my parents, but other than that I just play video games and watch shows.

I never worked in high school or college outside of the required internship. I lived at home and still continue to do so with my parents. They are amazing people and are non-judgemental. Of course they want me to get a job, but they are also understanding because I have mental health issues. I've never gone to therapy or seen anyone for it. It's anxiety and depression, although the depression has only really developed in the past year or two. I've always had generalized anxiety about a lot of things in life and getting a new job after my old one felt really daunting.

To make matters worse, I allowed my certifications in my field to lapse because of all of this and now I don't have the certs which would help me be more qualified for jobs. Mostly CompTia related IT (A+, Network+, etc).

I've read around and people talk about staffing agencies or temp agencies, but I'm not really sure how to best proceed with my large gap in employment with minimal work experience at my age. I've thought about applying for retail or food service just to have some experience on my resume, it's not what I went to school for but I feel like I might not have much choice."

Hello everyone. I got this throwaway account to post this because i'm an active redditor and i wouldn't like this post to be on my history.

I want to keep this as short as possible but be descriptive at the same time. I and my wife have been married for 15 years. We are deeply in love each other and have a great and happy life together. We are wealthy and run our own business. We met this Indian student one and a half years ago when he applied to an available internship position in our company. We refused his application but we had a long conversation with him. He came to Europe two years ago for college but he hasn't been in contact with his family very much since then. He is studying at a good school and both my wife and I were very keen on helping him because we knew he deserved it. We have been seeing him since the day he came to our office, giving him money and making sure he can go to school, buy whatever he needs and get by.

He is a very bright,respectful, well-mannered young man. We trust him so much and treat him very kind. For the last 5-6 months he has been staying at our house every now and then and getting his education. Yesterday, all of a sudden he said he wants to cut all contact with us because his friends think he has an affair with my wife. When we asked why he said he respects us very much and doesn't want to cause any harm to our careers&amp;marriage.

Today, my wife and i called him 3 times but he didn't return any of our calls. We don't want to stop seeing him because we don't want a young man like him to lose his potential and get lost. Without us,i don't think he will be able to maintain his education and well-being. What should we do?

I always imagined myself becoming primarily a software developer over the course of my career. Will starting out in an automated testing engineer kind of position affect my ability to transition to software development later on? The work doesn't sound too bad as far as testing goes -- they're a pretty new team building up a new pipeline with python to handle automated tests and regression tests for a couple enormous systems -- so while it's not exactly my first choice, I think I would definitely be okay there, at least for a while. But.... It is still automated testing at the end of the day. Also, the pay is definitely livable, but relatively on the low side. Without getting into too much detail about this particular place/program, there's a guaranteed salary jump each year, but at least the first year, I'd be making well below industry average for my area.

Not much of what I do involves ""CS"" related work.

I was curious if you guys/girls know of any jobs out there where my experience in both of these areas would be useful? The only ideas I have are to just look into software dev jobs at automation/controls companies and robotics related jobs. I haven't found much useful info from googling, so I thought I'd ask reddit.

Thanks in advance!"

I feel like the computer science program at this college is terrible. All of it is general education + Calc 1 and 2. They don’t really have any real CS courses. Except easy classes that focus on simple programming concepts for specific languages but don’t really go deep into anything. I’ll be a junior when I transfer to a University, and I think I will be so unprepared for the classes and internships :(  Does anyone have suggestions on how I can get better prepared for university CS?"

I'm a recent college graduate feeling pretty down about my job prospects lately. Up until a year ago, I had really solid momentum on my career, and it felt like everything was falling into place.

I went to a great college, had some very competitive internships in my field, and was prepared to graduate in December. Then, last summer, I was fired from an internship, and I've struggled to bounce back. To make a long story short, I worked for a very small startup (just three employees and myself, the intern.) To the best of my knowledge, the company did not have a policy on the use of personal devices for company work. I can say for a fact that I was never explicitly trained on them, to the extent that these rules may have existed at all.

Regardless, I made a careless error not checking to see if I was allowed to use my personal laptop for company work, and was promptly fired when it was discovered that that is what I had been doing.

I've been in a rut ever since. I went back in the fall of 2020, finished my degree, and have been trying to figure out how to handle this for the past six months. I see friends and colleagues graduating with job offers in hand, and I'm terrified of so much as submitting an application. I worry that this incident may have de-railed my career in a significant, perhaps even permanent way.

Can anyone speak to their experiences bouncing back from being fired? Or trying to frame a big mistake in the hiring process?

I'd love to hear your thoughts.

TLDR;

I made a careless error at a summer internship that resulted in my termination. I'm now struggling with how to move forward, and bigger questions of whether or not I'm still hirable in my industry."

nq95kj,9112,2021-06-01,TIFU by breaking a $2000 laptop on my first day of the job,spiderslayerx10,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nq95kj/tifu_by_breaking_a_2000_laptop_on_my_first_day_of/,"I’ve been reading these for a while and let me tell you, I did not want to be writing one on the first day of my awesome new job that I have been looking forward to starting. This just happened 1 hour ago right before leaving the office.

I’m a college student, I study computer science and was lucky enough to land an internship doing software development with a really good (unnamed) company near me. For the job, they provided me a brand new, out of the box $2000 MacBook Pro to use for work. 

The whole day went great, I learned about the position and even got lunch with a few coworkers that just graduated from the same college I go to and it was a great time... up until 10 minutes before we left for the day. I had a minor software issue on my laptop, so my coworker Bob and I started walking over to the IT department together to get it fixed. It was only about 20 feet away, so I just carried the laptop in one hand while it was still open so we could quickly show the IT guys the software issue. That was where I fucked up. 

Now, to get through the doors of this building, you have to scan a security badge for it to unlock. Before starting the job, I was told specifically by a higher up there, let’s call him Charles, that I have to scan the badge when going through a door even if someone holds the door for you. Well when Bob and I got to the door to the IT area, Charles just happened to be coming out. So after walking through the door he held it open for us. Bob walked through first, pausing to scan his badge. I go to do the same thing, pausing to scan my badge, and Charles LETS GO OF THE DOOR. And let me tell you, these are heavy ass doors that close automatically for security. Well my laptop was in my left hand, and when that door closed itself, it used the screen of my Mac as a god damned door jam. 

The base of the computer is intact and just fine, but the entire screen portion of the laptop is bent and broken. I feel like it’s partially the other dude’s fuck up for letting go of the door when I was standing there scanning my badge, but I also shouldn’t have been holding my laptop open with one hand while walking so idk. I hope I have a job tomorrow morning though

TLDR: Held my brand new work laptop in one hand while scanning my security badge at an open door, the door closed, and my new Apple computer turned into Applesauce.

Update: I went to work this morning and all is good. Charles was nice about it and shared in the blame for it, and my boss’ response was essentially the [meme](https://imgur.com/gallery/pSfeUk4)  of “Oh no! Anyway...” I was set up with a new laptop but I’m sure they will never let me live it down here haha. Also this post got a lot more traction overnight I wasn’t expecting that lol, thanks for the support some of the comments made me feel less worried about it before I came today"

I am a rising senior in Economics and Mathematics in a Top 25 US College, and my dream would be to pursue an Economics Phd.

**My Background**

\- 3.4 GPA (with mostly A to B+ in math and economics classes) / Expected before graduation: 3.6-3.7

\- 4 month internship in Finance-Private Equity / Expected: 1 in data science + 1 in econ research institutions

\- 1.5 years as an RA with 2 co-authorship, worked on 5 papers / Expected another year of research -Total 3 years RA/3 co-authorship

\- Currently writing paper under faculty supervision / Expected &gt;= 1 other paper, so total of 2 papers

\- Data Science bootcamp- Python and SQL: Learned advanced regression techniques, data analysis, Machine Learning and Neural Networks

\- Editor at my school's undergraduate economics journal for a year (will continue until graduation)

\- Part-time Editorial assistant at academic journal (low tier)

**My options before applications to Phd**

**-** Masters in economics/Data Science/econometrics/math right after college (either in France, UK, or US)

\- Work experience for 1-2 years in data science or economics research institution

2 Questions:

\-Based on my background , what would be the option that would maximize my chances to get accepted into a top 15 phd program in the US or UK ?

\- Is there anything you would recommend to boost my application (besides getting higher grades, as I know my GPA is not competitive)

Thanks in advance !"
nq9fyx,1,2021-06-01,Going into Masters in Computer Science from EEE. How to prepare?,Tapesaviour,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/nq9fyx/going_into_masters_in_computer_science_from_eee/,"Hi I'm planning to apply for a masters program in computer science. I come from an electrical and electronics engineering bachelors background. I never really had a passion for it. I ended up doing a dissertation involving fully coding cloud solutions for iot in Java. I do know a bit of python and C. 

Unfortunately my school never offered any classes on data structures, algorithms etc. I've decided to take a year out after i graduate this semester and go back to my home country, work on preparing myself for a masters program and find myself an internship. 

So my question is: Whats the best to way to prepare, for someone like me? I really intend to my passion into this, and want to learn a lot. unlike in my ee course where it just wasn't for me. I had 0 passion for anything except some math classes, programming classes and working on my final project."

The position I am interning for is  supply chain process engineer. As a computer science student, I have noticed that there isn’t many parallels between supply chain and computer science. Does anyone know if having this internship experience as a process engineer will help my future in terms of finding a job in the tech industry or will this field have no help due to it being different. Any insight would be great."

I have nearly 2 years experience at Microsoft in India (as SDE) before starting graduate education.

I am getting very few call backs for my applications at job portals (3/70 converted 2 for internship). I usually pair my application with a recommendation, mostly from an engineer around my age (sometimes working in India , office sometimes in US).

My univ is in top 20, my grad GPA is 3.9. I have a couple of papers in ML (mid -tire). I am applying to both SDE and MLE profiles with separate CVs.

I have very little experience in applying for jobs because in India career fairs in universities are pretty comprehensive and very little recruiting takes place outside that at fresh grad level. Thus I believe I might be missing something obvious in my process which is leading to this low strike rate.

These are the reasons I feel that I am getting rejected:

1. Something wrong in my resume that does not pass the automatic filters.
2. I am using referrals of SDE1/2 not of managers
3. I did not connect with university recruiters on linkedin ( if this is the reason can you elaborate on the correct way to do it)
4. Maybe 3/75 is normal in US and unlike an Indian Career Fair I wont get a sit in with 12 companies in 2 weeks.

I would love to get your insights on this situation. Please feel free to ask for any more info you need to be able to answer my question."

Robotics - Tech Capt or electronics lead by senior

Community of 4k managed by a company that is a subsidiary of a bigger company that has 15mil yearly revenue.  group of around 10 students that helps the main/logistics team manage the community and the products.  offered a paid (admin) position but still dont know if gonna get.

Badminton - Varsity 3 years, I dont know if Im gonna get capt by senior. Probably a 50/50 chance.

\*ECs below I just saw as free board spots

Japanese Culture Club - VP, basically just make presentations about Japanese culture and do things like make food and what not.

Japanese Honor Society - Treasurer for now, maybe pres by senior. Its the equivalent of National honor society but for ppl who take Japanese.

Im making this post because I've recently heard stories of (people at my school) getting 4.0 UW GPA's, 1570+ SAT ppl not get into anything but UC merced. Just wanted to check what I am doing correctly and incorrectly. Any advice/feedback/chance is appreciated.

The point is that recently we finished the whole calculations and we have to present them to a bunch of bigwigs, and unexpectedly, I'm responsible for it. I think that is flattering, and I feel they are happy with the job I'm doing, but it overwhelms me a bit, mostly because of my speaking English level.

Are there any non-native English speakers who could give me some advice?

Having said that, I still felt very insecure about the presentation hours before, so I decided just to read my guide notes and pray not to make a fool of myself. Surprisingly when I started to read the guide notes of the first slide I felt more confident to improvise a bit, and at the end, I saw myself doing it during the rest of the presentation.

I'm pursuing a master in intelligent systems from a bachelor in computer science. I intend to move to the bay area from Europe at some point in my life (before having children though). I tried to gather information from this sub and other resources about the experience and portfolio size requirements but it seems that there is no consensus on this. 

I understand that getting a first job as a software engineer in the bay area is nearly impossible, especially for a foreigner. I'm assuming that I will have a visa proving that I have the right to work and live there. My concern is about getting a job without much experience: what is the *minimal experience* required to get a decent job in the bay area ?

Here is what I will have achieved at the end of my cursus:

* Internship (\~ 300 hours)
* Software project engineering and management (\~ 280 hours x 5 people): issued by a client or a company to the university
* Personal student project (\~ 150 hours)
* Master thesis (\~ 750 hours)

Basically, I would like to know whether this is a good start or not. Is this insufficient compared to entry-level jobs' requirements  ?

I think that I will try to get some work experience in Europe first (i.e., Netherlands). It might be safer and I could later ask for a transfer. Therefore, is it easier to get a job in Amsterdam for instance than in the Bay Area ?"

For my analysis I am trying to do variant calling on my transcriptome. I am following the [Trinity github pipeline for variant calling](https://github.com/trinityrnaseq/trinityrnaseq/wiki/Variant-Calling), in which they provided a python [script](https://github.com/trinityrnaseq/trinityrnaseq/blob/master/Analysis/SuperTranscripts/AllelicVariants/run_variant_calling.py) for GATK for the variant calling. I use SLURM to run this job for me: 

    /cm/shared/easybuild/software/Trinity/2.8.4-foss-2018b/trinityrnaseq-Trinity-v2.8.4/Analysis/SuperTranscripts/AllelicVariants/run_variant_calling.py \

    -p /home/SpeciesA_R1.fq,/home/SpeciesB_R1.fq /home/SpeciesA_R2.fq,/home/SpeciesB_R2fq \
    -o variant_calls_outdir

The issue I am running into is that this python script provided by Trinity is compatible with GATK v3.8, while I have have v4.1.5.0 on my local HPC. I understand from searching the interwebs that the difference is is that GATK now runs with a wrapper script and that you have to invoke this. I do not fully understand what this means. I am by no means a bioinformatician, just merely a biology Masters' student trying to my internship. I was thinking more people should've run into this issue, since I could not even find a download link for v3.8 anymore. 

I was hoping one of you magical computer wizards could help me out using this script with GATK v4.1.5.0. I'm running behind on my schedule for my analysis and it would really help me out! Any tips, tricks, quick fixes or just more information about how this stuff works is welcome!

I hate it for many reasons, but it can be summed up here: I am not respected by my coworkers or management, I don’t have any challenging work (same thing every day), pay is low, and the commute is terrible. There is no opportunity for professional or personal development. It’s the office job I thought I wanted and tried so hard to get, but it turns out I hate the 9-5 mundaneness and gossip of the office environment. 

I am almost 9 months into the job, and I think about quitting every day. I think I can tough it out to 10 months. However, would it be much better on a resume to wait until I have been here for a whole year without leaving?

I do have another job lined up, which would entail working with a small business owner. I have been working part-time with her for a few months, but I am ready to commit to full-time. I love the work, and I am respected and valued by my boss. She is willing to match my salary from my current job.

So, considering I only have about 4 years of work experience (did retail for 3 years and had several internships) and am a recent graduate, would it make a difference to a future hiring manager if they saw I left my first “real” job after only 10 months vs 12? Would it depend on how long I stay with the small business (I am planning for the long term). I know at least 24 months is best, but I definitely cannot wait that long to leave.

During classes I was able to do everything that was required, I know my computer science concepts really well and I can do a lot of stuff with code(I did a script to automate powerpoint presentations the other day).  But now that I'm applying to internships and the like I keep getting questions like  ""What have you developed during your free time? Which technologies did you use ? What type of diagrams did you make for the server architecture ? "" 

 I'm honestly feeling really stupid right now because it seems like these 4 years have been wasted learning math and physics when I could've focused on just building stuff instead of trying to get a degree.


EDIT: So I posted this in my throwaway cuz I wasn't sure what the reaction was gonna be (I even thought I might get banned haha) but this community is really welcoming and helpful. Thanks for all the replies and the tips on getting better, I've been working on some tutorials and I guess the years I spent in Uni do help because I haven't really felt stuck anyway is just I dont have the zeal that some other people have when it comes to programming in general.  Nevertheless I hope I can join you guys in the programming workforce and keep honing my skills. 

I'm planning to move on to a masters degree at my current uni so I'll probably have 2 more years of student life before I actually need to start working so I'll try my best so build some cool stuff.

Thank you all!"

Developed an interest in many fields of ECE(FPGA, Signal Processing, Embedded Systems) and then the pandemic hit and I got busy with family problems due to which I couldn't focus much on making resume-worthy projects and deciding on what I want to do in the future.

Long story short, I'm at the end of 3rd year, with around 7.0 CGPA and don't have any resume-worthy projects/experience in my resume. I know C, Python and some C++.

I feel like my situation is really grim and on top of that, I don't really know what I should do. Some more specific points/questions: 

1. People pursue masters in ECE from abroad to get jobs/research, but how do I know if MS is what I should do? Also, given my situation, what are my chances?
2. Further complicating the matter is I'm from a lower-middle-class family, I don't know how I can afford MS from abroad. 
3. I like programming and I have made some small projects, so I'm perfectly fine with having a job as a programmer. I won't pretend, one of the motivating factors is also the money, as I'm from a lower-class family if I secure a decent job at the end of the 4th year, it will save us from many troubles. If I can get paid to program, awesome.
4. Also, almost everyone in my college is doing Web development/App development and I see most jobs for that only on online portals. Being in ECE, I feel like I'm betraying someone when I try to learn these lol. I feel guilty about not doing something core-related.
5. Is it really important for me to learn things like WebDev/ Android Dev etc. to get an SDE job? Can I just focus on ECE (C/C++, Python) and some CS fundamental courses and if still, I'm unable to succeed in ECE, Can I apply for SDE jobs?  Projects vs DS/Algo?
6. Right, now I'm frantically trying to get an internship by learning WebDev by June End, I know I'm late and the situation is grim but something is better than nothing I guess. 

**TLDR**:  I have a really low chance of succeeding in ECE, and it makes the most sense to get skilled to get a developer job asap, but my soul lies in hardcore traditionalist engineering stuff, and I find myself being paralysed again and again by overthinking and unable to have a peace of mind due to this dilemma. If my above thinking is not correct, please let me know."

There is and be always someone willing to help, push and give you a hand towards your goals that we all know the challenges show daily. 

Having said that, I want to prepare for an inter in a year from now but since school projects aren't allowed to be shown as part of a resume I don't know how or what to do to achieve that. I wonder how I can prepare for an internship where all my time has  and still been dedicated towards education, school assignments, work and life obstacles. Since many of the Redditors here have been in a position like mine, what were the changes you made to achieve your first internship? I am not even asking for a first job position but a summer intern sounds very interesting to me. 

PS: The languages I have learned are the ones are thought in school such as Java, C++, Assembly and Data Structures. On my ""free time"" I am learning Kotlin, a steady progress. But despite that  I  still concern about how to apply to internships when my resume is empty.

I am looking for general guidance, and in particular any quick thoughts you may have about how this decision could affect my prospects for an eventual PhD in computer science.

On paper, my first two years of college don’t look awful at all — I have a 3.5 gpa, and I have professional software engineering experience through internships. 

But I’ve kind of meandered through my undergraduate degree to this point. If you can believe it, I’ve only taken 3 computer science classes and the math class prerequisites. I started college thinking I wanted to pursue philosophy, before switching to computer science in my second year. 

I go to a pretty good school, with lots of research opportunities that I haven’t taken advantage of yet.

I could likely float toward the end of my degree, and end up finding a job and being alright, but I’m not sure I’d look back at my college years and be too happy with that.

I have to decide by my next semester whether this fifth year is something I want to pursue. I am leaning toward doing it, in order to make it easier to finish my degree, have enough time to see if research is for me, and to have more time to show that I take my education seriously.

I’m very grateful if you’ve read this far. If you have any thoughts, I’d really appreciate any help with this decision, especially from the perspective of grad school admissions down the road."

I'm a 22 yr old, recent cs graduate with no work experience or technical internships. I've been actively seeking jobs/internships related to my field for the past 9 months since I've graduated. The country I'm currently situated in has a bad job market for my field.

By bad job market I mean:

1. Lack of technical internships.
2. Entry level roles have a ton of requirements and at least a couple of years of exp.
3. Most companies confuse cs jobs with tech support jobs and data entry roles.
4. If certain jobs exist then they're unpaid while expecting you to work full time.
5. There are a ton of scams where they post legit job descriptions but then expect you to pay them to teach you with a guaranteed placement.
6. Also a lot of the jobs are outsourced to experienced foreigners and some care more about skills than the degree (which makes it worse).

My problem is that I've spent quite a lot of time and money on my degree, and I'm qualified for junior roles with reasonable requirements as I've seen around the world, but now I'm not getting anywhere with it. 

I've tried looking up ways to go abroad, but I haven't found a way pertaining to cs.

For a masters, the advice I've gotten is to work first and see what you like and only then do masters with some specialization. Since I can't find jobs in the first place, that won't work.

The other option I've thought of is to share accommodation abroad somehow while I apply there, but I'm by myself and have no relatives or friends abroad, so that can't work. Also most companies prefer hiring candidates from their country anyways so my chances are less.

For going abroad, my country of preference has been Canada. I'm open to other countries as well that are good for my field, but the above problem sustains.

I'm pretty much stuck right now and time's running out for me. Soon it'll be a year since graduation and I'm quite worried. All I want is a job to break into the industry and make some money, but right now I've got nothing but courses and personal projects. The job must be related to my degree so that type of experience I get on the job is my priority.

I'm seeking some advice about what I can do in this situation to get a job or go abroad or anything else you might suggest.

My parents got divorced when I was in first grade, and I remember my mother telling me that she couldn't live with me and my dad anymore and she packed up her things and left to stay with my grandmothers for a while. Without my mother being there for me I was stuck with my dad, who is more strict (We are a traditional Chinese family, so my grandparents on his side live there along with me). I started doing progressively worse on my tests and quizzes after my mom left, and my dad was the only one there to help me with hw. I remember my dad yelling at me one time because I got a D on a Science quiz (I tried to tell him to ignore the grade but he instead just punished me by taking away my computer, he didn't even ask if I made any effort (which I did)). My dad would also NEVER give me any presents for my birthday, this was because I couldn't meet his requirement of getting at least 70s in all of my courses (I kept progressively getting 50s in Math). He told me that ""only children who do good academically get presents, and you keep getting low grades"". So while I went to other people's birthday parties and they got presents, I grew to hate my dad so much. ""How could other kids get presents for their birthdays and I couldn't even get a single one"" is what I kept thinking every time. This kept continuing from elementary to middle school and eventually in high school (I went through the Canadian education system).

Outside of school, my dad would always try to get me to be more active and hang out with friends. (He was a hypocrite to me because he would always try to get me outside, but would always ban me from hanging out with certain people, cause Chinese prejudices, and would not allow me to stay over at their place because ""Why would you want to stay at a strangers place when our house is right down the street""). Every time I did poorly my dad would punish me by taking away my computer and tv privileges, leaving me with only books to read (This is why I became extremely good at History, English, and Geography courses later on, and is important later for this story). After he was done yelling, I would often huddle in my bed crying my eyes out, praying for something bad to happen to him, and hoping I could see my mom (Divorce arrangement at the time was that I would visit my mom every weekend). My dad would always shame me to not cry saying ""Boys don't cry, only girls do, and you aren't a girl"". My grandparents would always take his side and would always repeat what he says, and never ever took my side, which only caused me to continue crying. Sometimes I would just lie in my bed praying to god, crying to ""please kill me and end my suffering"". My dad would always criticize me and have nothing good to say, even when I get good marks in History he would be like ""Why is your math marks so low"" and never acknowledged any other course mark other than Math, even at dinners and lunch the only thing he asks me is ""How was school today"" and ""Did you finish your homework"". (I think now know why I'm not a very talkative person, because if someone asks me something I would always respond by saying ""Okay"", ""Sorry"", ""No"", ""I don't want to"", ""Because I said so"" and a bunch of other lines).

My dad would often tell my mom what would be going on, even though I asked my dad not to tell him to. My mom likewise, would often do the same so I grew to dislike my whole family for it because I can't keep any secrets from them since they were always quick to rat me out. Even my cousins (26F and 23M) told my dad one time when I was trying to evade his punishment and I was then chewed out by him.

The final straw for me came around December 2014. I had done very poorly on an English assignment and he came and yelled at me. The yelling wasn't the problem, but what came after was. He told me after he had finished yelling that ""No one in our family has ever done more poorly than you"". After he left I just started bawling my eyes out, even though I was 14. I started getting very scared of my dad ever since my mom left, and every time I hear him come up the stairs my heartbeat quickens and I get super nervous. The next event came after when I went to a fancy restaurant with my mom and her boyfriend at the time, who would become my stepdad along with my future stepsister. My mom sat me down the next morning and berated me for not showing manners (A waiter pulled a chair for my mom as a courtesy and I had sat down in that chair). I told her that I didn't know that was a mannerism and it was at that point, I asked her why I never stayed with her after the divorce, and her answer shocked me. She said that my dad only gave her $600 CDN after the divorce, with no child compensation. I'm not a talkative person but when I heard this I hit the roof and swore I would never forgive him, both for how he raised me and for how he only left my mom $600. (Before the divorce my mom had a good internship, but after the divorce, she would lose that job and had to go working minimum wage jobs just to sustain herself until she found a good job working for Mercedes-Benz, where she eventually worked her way up to becoming Head of Sales). I stayed with her over the weekends when she would take me to places as far north as Aurora (we lived in Toronto) to work in a convenience store.

My mom is a saint, but she also had her own faults too. My mom had a shopping addiction when I was younger (and to some extent still to this day, but not as much) and would often leave me in a Chapters (A bookstore for those of you who arent Canadian) while she went shopping. Everyone in the comments is going to say this is child neglect, but I actually enjoyed it because 1) I could read books that were interesting to me, and 2) there were other kids too that I could play with (they had a children's area with toys and their own books). I would often get looks from people sometimes but my mom would always pick me up to go buy ice cream or toys for me afterward, so I never saw this as wrong. I remember the longest time she did this was when we were at Eaton Centre (the largest mall in Toronto Downtown), and I remember being there for 4 HOURS before she came. I didn't complain though, since I loved reading.

When it came time for me to enroll in University, I chose to enroll in UofT (this would come back to bite me since I let my friend decide which university I should go and he told me it was the best university for political science when I should have enrolled at UOttawa or Carleton for more political internship opportunities but I chose UofT because it was only located downtown). My dad got mad when he heard this, he expected me to enroll in a business course or tech course, but I told him that because of my bad math skills I would never be allowed entry (I was routinely getting 50s and 60s in Math by this point). Plus, I wanted to become a Lawyer. Even though it pays well, my dad still chastised me because he saw that Lawyers were going to become an outdated progression as technology advances. I told him this was a load of bs. Despite my wanting to cut off ties with my dad's side of the family entirely, I still had to rely on him to pay for my tuition costs as my mom could not afford it. However, I was allowed to now live with my mom for University since I went to the downtown campus and her place was not too far from it.

Those were the good days, before COVID of course. I was able to go out as long as I want, eat whatever I want and hang out with my friends. All I had to do was notify my mom of whenever I was staying late with friends and I would always respond and include the time I was going to come home. I had the time of my life from which my dad had denied me since I was 6. It was literally a dream come true.

I did have to do things for my mom in exchange, such as cleaning the house. All of this was new to me and my mom, because I never had to do these things before and no one ever taught them to me. When I lived with my dads, the most I had to do was move the dishes to the sink, shovel the driveway during the winter and mow the lawn during the summers. Now I had to clean dishes, vacuum the whole apartment and cook for myself (I came to really enjoy cooking). My mom also had to teach me manners and skills that my dad never taught me, things to people like you that seem common sense like (this one was really disgusting) closing the bathroom door whenever you went to the washroom. As I started learning how to behave, I kept asking myself why my dad never taught me these things that he should have when I was younger. ""Why did my dad's side of the family never tell me that closing the bathroom door when you relieve yourself is what you're supposed to do"", ""Why did my dad's side of the family never tell me to put down a toilet seat when there are women in the house"", and etc.

Now I'm 21, and I'm about to graduate and find a place for myself. I have a gf and as I'm spending more time with her I started reminiscing more about when I was younger. She was the one who encouraged me to tell my story here and so here I am. To this day, I try to limit my conversations with my dad's side of the family. My dad like my mom also remarried and I now have two half-siblings, a younger sister aged 5 and a younger brother aged 2. Sometimes I want to help them so they don't end up miserable like I was and sometimes I just leave them to my dad and stepmom (Ofc my stepmom is like my grandparents and acts as a mirror image of my dad). The only reason I will ever accept them into my life is if they apologize for the way they treated me when I was younger (I still get dreams where my dad tries to break through the front door of my mom's place and try to kill me).

P.S A lot of you might ask why I never spoke up to my dad or mom about this, and this is because, in Chinese families, you aren't supposed to speak up to elders because it can be considered rude. Plus, I began to develop what I now think is Anxiety after every time my dad would punish me and I would always have a hard time speaking to a group of people (I know its kind of ironic that I chose to study in a profession that requires me to speak out a lot). I'm very shy and easily intimidated so I developed this mentality very early on after seeing kids on tv shows and movies disobey their parents and get punished for it. It is why I never criticize my co-workers at work or ever question any decisions from my boss because I believe that as long as you keep your mouth shut and opinions to yourself, you'll fit in. It's also why I get anxious when I hear people raising their voice or even something as simple as me missing one class.

I am seriously considering abandoning his side of the family, I don't see it being conducive to my long-term health and I get super anxious every time I talk to anyone on his side of the family. Unfortunately, due to me being financially dependent on him, I have a hard time trying to distance myself from the, so what should I do? So yeah, I just wanted to vent this all out since I am tired of listening to their crap.

TL;DR: My dad's side of the family is abusive and I want to stop talking with them."

Also, in general, does cool off period only apply if one fails an onsite or does it apply for OA's and phone screens as well?

Lastly, if one fails the Google SWE interview, then can they still apply for a Data Scientist or any other role at Google, or is there a cool-off period for applying for different positions as well?

(humor me),alpacasmatter,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/nqti3n/omscs_foot_in_the_door_humor_me/,"I have a BS in Math and MA in Applied Math from a UC school, but my career has been exclusively in math/stats education (teaching community college). I want to get into SWE (data science side), but have no experience outside teaching a few CS classes on algorithms. The only data science internships that I can find are for students, and obviously I'm not landing a job without any work experience.

Doing a bootcamp is one option, but I still suspect that I'd have a hard time getting an internship without being a student. Am I wrong here?

So here are my thoughts: Do OMSCS to (1) obviously learn a *ton*, but also (2) get a foot in the internship/entry-level job door. With my current job (part-time college instructor) I think I can manage the time-commitment of the masters.

Currently, a junior in high school wanting to get an internship in CS. I am taking all college classes--I'll graduate with an associate's in science including my high school diploma. I have all A's in all my classes. Overall academically I'm doing very well, I think. 

On the programming side, my main language is Python, where I've done:  
 \- data analyses, visualization, prediction.  
 \- some machine learning  
 \- drone programming  
 \- use of many API's including, Youtube, Reddit, Twitter, and more  
 \- And others

Other than that, no other extracurriculars to speak of. 

I looked at many places and am struggling to find even one internship for people in high school. I wouldn't mind if it's unpaid, because it's just the experience and connections (plus putting it on the college app) I am wanting. Does anyone have any ideas where I could go about finding one?"

OP is verified. _____________ Did OP send over an industrial size bag of fries for verification?|I sent my work ID
After being around fries all day, do you usually order onion rings instead when you go out for a burger?|Everyone loves fries, I never get sick of them.
Do the drivers get to ride in the cab when they lift the entire truck to dump the potatoes in?|No.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|​​​​&amp;#x200B;
Could a driver hide in the truck and thus enjoy the experience that way? I know, important questions.|If he was intentionally taking himself for a ride he could probably do it, but I'm sure they'd be terminated on the spot ala lockout tag out violation.
Do curly and/or waffle fries take longer to produce?|They don't make curly fries where I am at, I wouldn't think they take any longer to produce. If curly fries did take longer to cut, then more cutters would be added.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|​​​​&amp;#x200B;
I guess to elaborate one what they were probably getting at: is there any reason for curly and/or waffle fries to be more expensive?|I'd imagine waffles have more potato waste than regular fries, I wouldn't know any reason curly would be more expensive.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|​​​​&amp;#x200B;
Waffle/curly fry won't yield as much product as potato cut into fries. Typical McD fry is a line fry. The entire potato is used. Various sizes in your to-go cup. Typical bag of line fries has more small pieces than larger. Pay more for a case of fries where they're longer and uniform, or taken more potatoes to produce.|Depending on customer specifications we grade out the smaller fries. The fries go down a shaker conveyor that has holes in the bottom, the sizes of the holes dictate what falls in.
^(the below is another reply to the second answer)|​​​​&amp;#x200B;
Thanks. As someone else pointed out, the reason they're more expensive might be related to you not producing them at the giant factory where you work. Do you know if there's a reason you don't make that kind of fries? Do you know of other large factories that do make that type of fry, or are those mostly produced in smaller facilities?|The equipment size is definitely a factor of what kind of product is ran. It's not economical to run small production runs on larger equipment. I know factories that were smaller managed to avoid more layoffs due to being able to handle smaller runs better.
Serious inquiry since I've made hand cut fries for my business for years. How often do you see injuries stemming from stupid mistake? Ive seen somebody mince their handle while not paying attention on a dicer.|I've heard of 1 really stupid mistake that ended with an amputation. Never stick your hand into equipment at all, especially when you can't see where you're touching.
What do you do with all the residues - peelings, rejected spuds and cooking oil?|Peelings go-to farms, I think the bad potatoes get spread on a farmers field. Cooking oil is sent out via contract, I do not know what happens with it.
What's the weirdest piece of machinery used?|I don't know of anything specifically weird, we do have a ""fart flare"" that flames off our excessive methane from water treatment
^(the below is a reply to the above)|​​​​&amp;#x200B;
I'll take it. Thank you|I just remembered, we have a piece of equipment that zaps them with electricity prior to cutting. This softens them so they don't shatter in the cutters.
Why are people so afraid of the skin? I've never peeled the skin on my potatoes and it's literally never been a problem. But it seems like every fast food chain wants skinless potatoes and now everyone thinks that's how they're supposed to be prepared. It makes no sense to me, like isn't the whole point of fast food that it's as cheap as possible? Why spend extra time/money on peeling potatoes for no reason? Is the whole world crazy? Am I crazy? please hold me|I don't think you're crazy, imo unpeeled potatoes are cheaper to make and have more flavor.
Do you ever get a chip on your shoulder?|Sometimes there is a flying potato or tater tot, usually they get thrown by a co-worker.
When you go home smelling like French fries does you SO bury their nose in your shirt? Going to try to find a French fry factory video.|Sometimes my SO can smell it, it usually clings to my hair
What is the process to make French fries. Do you add preservatives?|We add salt, SAPP, and dextrose for the he most part
Are your french fries frozen? If so, are you on the anhydrous ammonia incident response team? Have you had a release at the factory since you've been working there?|Leaks happen, we have sniffers and a team of people that respond. We've never had a major leak, we do have procedures in place and evacuation training. I'm not really involved with it directly.
25 years ago I was an intern in the lab that did testing of the moisture, fat, sodium, etc content for a french fry maker in their facility a few miles from the Snake river. I still remember grinding the frozen fries into little noodles to homogenize the sample, using scales to weigh items before desiccating in an oven for moisture content, and using concentrated HCl to digest the fries in flasks as part of measuring fat content. Have the processes for doing those measurements changed much in the last 25 years?|They still do some of these, I don't think it's changed much. They turn the fries to a mushy paste to test the salt content in an analyzer.
I swear, back in the day (mid 90’s maybe) you could get a french fry in your happy meal that was as long as your forearm. Like, me and my sister would take it in turns comparing our longest fries. I know my arm is longer now, but every time I get a long one, I grab a small child and hold that hot fry against that arm. I look in that child’s eye and I tell them ‘the man did us, kid’. And I cry. Because now they alllll stubby. Allll withered. Potato shrapnel with thousand yard stares. What happened to the potatoes? Are they not free range anymore?|If potatoes get too large I've heard we will reject them because they clog equipment, specifically this issue is for sweet potatoes. Larger potatoes go-to our more premium clients that want longer fries. The short ones get chopped up and go into tater tots. I don't know why potatoes are smaller now, I don't work in the agriculture side of things.
[removed]|There's multiple ways they are cut. The coolest way is the potatoes basically go down a waterslide (flume) which keeps getting smaller and smaller. When it reaches near the end the pressure shoots them through a tube faster than you can see which has blades in whatever pattern of fry they're making.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|​​​​&amp;#x200B;
Need a video of this!|https://youtu.be/6xXfpYb6yOk there's a video that kind of shows the process.
^(the below is another reply to the original answer)|​​​​&amp;#x200B;
There are different patterns of fries? Or you mean different thicknesses? Also thanks for a really interesting IamA!|There are different patterns like crinkle. The blades that cut them into fries can be changed out for different styles/thicknesses.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|​​​​&amp;#x200B;
How often do you sharpen the blades?|I'm not sure, but there are thousands of blades.
^(the below is another reply to the original answer)|​​​​&amp;#x200B;
how often do such blades need sharpening? or are they quite dull. Also wonder how much debris builds up from the cutting in the system|I'm not sure how often, they are definitely very sharp. I don't think much debris gets built up that isn't blasted off when the potato hits the cutter.
How was the factory affected by the pandemic, did you see more demand? If yes, how the factory cope with the stay at home order in your home town?|Retail shot way up in demand, originally we had a shortage of packaging because retail uses alot more packaging material. Alot of factories had layoffs. Our work enforced local covid guidelines, there was penalties like not getting paid while awaiting testing if you broke guidelines.
How many potatoes do you go through in a day?|I don't want to be too specific with numbers, as there are not alot of french fry factories out there. We go through more than 25 semi trailers a day full of potatoes.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|​​​​&amp;#x200B;
How secretive is the potato world?!|It's actually more secretive than you'd think because potato making is a highly capital intensive process, and most of the fries in the world are made by private companies.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|​​​​&amp;#x200B;
Do they make you sign NDAs?|Probably did, but I don't remember
^(the below is another reply to the second answer)|​​​​&amp;#x200B;
*sigh* just like...everything else. ____________ Are you looking to invest in Big Potato? __________ I would if I could. I was kind of surprised at first to hear that it's a high capital process but then again, most lucrative products are.|Anything really cheap and mass produced is going to be highly automated. I hear stories of back in the day there used to be tables of old ladies whose summer job was taking knives and cutting out defects from the potato while chatting away. The chatty old ladies has always been part of the story for some reason. They have all been replaced by a machine.
What revolutions do you think will happen to the french fry in the next few years? What changes would you like to see made? Do you have any saucy recommendations?|I don't think any crazy revolution will happen. French fries are timeless unless you're eating healthy
What's the weirdest sanitation/food safety/pest-related issue you've personally seen or even just heard about?|Potatoes going bad in storage and having so much liquid we had to call a waste company to pump out the ""vodka""
Can you tell us about about accidents on the slicer? Best oil?|I wouldn't want to talk about specific accidents besides that we are a factory with lots of moving pieces, and accidents have happened. I don't think we run many different kinds of oil, I know in the past we had tallow and that had issues with clogging.
How do I make my french fries as good as a restaurant's? Also I have no idea how this post got to my front page after 10 minutes|Blanching them is the biggest process that isn't usually done at home.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|​​​​&amp;#x200B;
To build on this and OP can't correct me if I'm wrong. Cut potatoes, soak in cold water, dry off, blanch (par boil) allow to cool on a drying rack and bake or fry. Frying will obviously be crispier. Or just double fry your fries.|Yes, that is basically the process done at an industrial scale. Except ingredients are added during blanching because otherwise blanching takes out the natural sugars in the fry. In order to get a golden french fry you have to add back sugar.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|​​​​&amp;#x200B;
I'd imagine double frying instead of blanching would solve this problem?|If you don't blanch, you don't get that nice mushy interior of the fry that's almost like mashed potato.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|​​​​&amp;#x200B;
Wait, people *want* their fries soggy??|They want a crispy exterior with a soft and squishy interior.
^(the below is another reply to the second answer)|​​​​&amp;#x200B;
Any other ingredients you'd recommend adding for a DIYer at home?|The red color on wedges often seen at gas stations is from the annatto nut, it makes them look tastier without any flavor changes.
Real question: with flash freezing and all that, how many times would you say the fry is frozen overall?|They're cold enough out of the freezer that they will shatter if you're not gentle. Quality is very responsive to issues with not freezing, also we have alarms that are actually paid attention to let people know when temps fall below.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|​​​​&amp;#x200B;
I wish I was paid in attention.|Nuisance alarms that noone pays attention to is a real problem
How much more expensive is it to remove the potato peel before turning in to fries?|Peeling is one of the most costly processes in making a fry.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|​​​​&amp;#x200B;
don't you just tumble them and wash them?|Basically they go into a tumbler with alot of steam, and the steam peels the potato. The remaining skin is scrubbed off.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|​​​​&amp;#x200B;
I'm guessing the energy use of making the steam makes the process expensive?|Yes, steam is very expensive.
what machine in the factory will blow a consumer's mind that's used in the factory? Like consumers know of the machines that cut fry shapes, the ones which slam a potato into a grate to make french fries, but what other machines are used in the process?|The optical sorters sort out the french fries with bad spots, another machine cuts out the bad spots. That process is all automated.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|​​​​&amp;#x200B;
sorry, clueless person here. What's a bad spot on a french fry? Is it the eyes of the potatoes? Is it the part which turns black easily due to higher sugar? Thanks!|Yes, or sometimes a green spot.
so.... do you make the boxes the fries get shipped in? or does a machine? (I'm talking about the brown cardboard ones they go in)|​​​​&amp;#x200B;There are case erectors that erect the cardboard boxes.
Has there ever been an idea for a fry that sounded like a really good idea, but was a disaster after trying it out?|Sweet potato tots
What is your ideal french fry? example: thin cut, shoestring, crinkle, DJ, waffle, etc|I like wedges, partly because they don't need to be peeled.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|​​​​&amp;#x200B;
Ah, management...always thinking about the bottom line.|More so cause then you don't have a headache from issues with the peeler.
Is it true that different fast food restaurants have you add weird stuff to the fries so they hold the fry oil or whatever to stay more appetizing for a longer period of time? And how sketchy are those additives?|I am at the factory end of things, there really isn't any sketchy materials being added. The only ingredient that isn't obvious what it is SAPP.
what is the current innovation direction in the big fry?|We've had optical sorters for many years, those are some of the coolest equipment even though not innovative anymore
What does it smell like in the factory?|Depends on which way the wind blows, it can smell like farm doodpp all day or make your mouth water.
What is the recommended method to cook frozen fries in the oven and have them actually come out crispy? The vast majority of fries we have tried just come out like a soggy mess when cooked according to package instructions.|Whatever way works best for you, I'm not any more qualified to answer this than anyone else.
What do you do with potato skins?|They get send off for animal feed.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|​​​​&amp;#x200B;
send off or sold?|We are paid for our peelings, it's a win win because then we don't have to pay for disposal.
Is a tater tot a french fry?|I don't consider them a french fry, more like a formed potato product.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|​​​​&amp;#x200B;
Followup: Why is it that I can buy tater tots and hash brown patties in the freezer and *bake* them to a nice crisp whereas any frozen french fry is really not as good baked?|They really aren't made all that differently, it might be the time in the fryer. I'm not really sure.
^(the below is another reply to the second question)|​​​​&amp;#x200B;
Added oil.|We don't add any oil into the product before being formed then fried. Maybe other places do.
Who has the best fast food fries? The worst?|I'm partial to a certain restaurant brand we make, but the worst is generic store brands.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|​​​​&amp;#x200B;
[removed]|Ingredients, potato quality, batter, blanching times, frying times
^(the below is a reply to the above)|​​​​&amp;#x200B;
I guess curly fries need batter? I have a spiralizer but haven't attempted curly fries (except in the oven and it didn't work.)|​​​​&amp;#x200B;I think most restaurant curly fries are battered.
How do you make waffle fries?|I'm not familiar with the process as we don't make them.
I've got one more for you: how many gallons of water are used by your processes per pound of potato processed? I remember many plants have to have their own water treatment plants because they use so much water. Are there any big pushes to reduce the amount of water used in the processes?|Water usage has alot of people watching it. I believe it takes about 1 gallon of water per pound of french fries. They are regularly looking to reduce water usage, and spikes of water usage has management trying to track it down.
How are you?|Bored at work
Given there are so few fry manufactures (at least I think that's how I read one of your earlier comments), am I correct to assume your facility manufactured several ""brands"" of fries on behalf of those brands? And if so, what are some of the differences between them? Is it worth paying the extra $2 for the named brand vs. store/generic brand?|There are only 4 major french fry producers. The differences would probably be types/quality of potatoes, length of fries, ingredients, blanching times, batter, frying times. Those things can really make a difference in flavor. We make name brand products on the same machinery as cheapo store brands.
Is there a general sense of how many fries can be fried in the same oil before it must be changed in a factory setting compared to in a restaurant setting? Are there substantial savings from being able to do it at scale?|I believe they check for material in the oil, FFA, for how much new oil they add, if material is too high new oil is blended in. The oil is constantly being filtered. I'm sure doing it at scale has cost benefits, steam is used to heat the fryer rather than electricity like a restaurant.
How old would you say a potato is by the time it gets processed? How long can potatoes be held for before you have to process them?|Potatoes are and can be kept in storage for about a year. French fries are made 365 so we must store local crop until ready to use.
Are injuries in the factory common? What is the worst incident you've had to deal with|Serious ones aren't very common, there was an amputation while I've been here.
Do you feel that factory made French fries are far inferior to hand cut fries (like at In N Out and Five Guys)?|No, there definitely is a texture difference. Neither is superior.
Advances in gene editing aside, what's the most exciting innovation in French Fry technology that most people wouldn't think of?|We zap the potatoes with electricity to soften them, I don't believe that's been around a long time. It requires a pretty specialized piece of equipment.
A spud stun gun? Do you have a cool nickname for it?|Pulsified electric field or PEF
What type(s) of potato do you use?|Several kinds, some of the same ones you can find in the store. I do know they mix them depending on their quality.
Ketchup or mayonnaise?|Both, or by themselves, mustard
When I brokered freight I had a customer that shipped potatoes into Idaho. Why?|Maybe because most of the french fry production is done in Idaho, Idaho has the highest yielding potato farms in the US.
I hear that fries can be fried, cooked, chilled or frozen multiple times before leaving the factory. If so, what is the process like and what is each stage for?|We fry ours, and freeze ours only 1 time. Technically we have different stages of frying and freezing, but they are done consecutively
What are the best potatoes to make french fries with?|Big ones, I don't know much about the qualities of the different kind of potatoes.
It seems like the market for potato starch has increased in the past decade or so. Do you collect the starch for sale from the water used for blanching the fries or is there a separate process for getting saleable starch?|We separate as much starch as we can, and a third party picks it up straight from our plant. It makes us money, and saves on waste water treatment as starch needs to get digested more by bacteria.
Do you sort out green potatoes? I've heard it can indicate toxin build up (glycoalkaloids).|We have a machine that scans the potato and kicks it out if it is too green. Once made into a fry another machine will kick it out if it has too large of a green spot. This green spot will then get cut out by another machine. All waste is minimized as much as possible. There are also redundant human sorters.
How’s business? Is competition heavy? Are margins up during COVID?|French fry business will always be around, covid hurt more than the great recession according to my peers, and we only skipped a beat for a little bit for covid.
Has anyone ever pooped where they shouldn't have?|I sure hope not
Do you get frustrated when people wax poetic about In and Out Burger's fried that are obviously not factory made? I personally think they taste really bad compared to just about every other place's french fries but I am no connoisseur|Never really hear talk about hand cut fries.
How much QA does your factory do?|There is regular checks throughout the process. Certain checks are on a different schedule. Some of them are every hour.
are there any other uses for french fry machinery (e.g. making non-foodstuffs, alternative fries: sweet potato, batter-based fries)? are there any production processes that produce a noticeably better fry, but companies are not willing to pay for the extra time/expense?|Battered fries are generally your premium fry. Alot of our equipment can be used in other kinds of food manufacturing, not all of it is specific for potatoes.
Do you prepare the potato on site or do they come already cleaned and prepared to be turned into fries?|They come straight from the farmer
Which process is the most of a PITA to tune / goes wrong the most?|We transport potatoes around with flumes (waterslides as I like to think of them). Sometimes the pump loops can be hard to tune. We try to tune it once and forget, but life happens.
What's your tool and die department look like? I work in retail supply and I'm always shocked at how different tool and die is for me than most other industries.|We don't machine much nowadays, usually hired out to contractors.
Wait so does the factory you work at make the fries, then ship it off to fast food places for them to fry and sell? Or is it a part of a company, and they sell them at superstore in a bag or something. Because then I’d like to know which restaurants or stores you sell them to.|Fries for fast food are made the same way as those made for supermarkets.
When you listen to Yellow Ledbetter from pearl jam do you tear up at the [""Make me fries""](https://youtu.be/H0OcVTrE1Oc?t=91) solo?|I like pearl jam, never heard the song
Do you get to eat any of the fries?|You're not supposed to, but sometimes you can sneak a couple from the quality lab.
Whats your favorite potato?|Sweet potato
^(the below is a reply to the above)|​​​​&amp;#x200B;
But you're a pass on sweet potato tots? I'm so confused|Something about the texture
What’s the best selling fry cut? I would assume the classic cut?|Battered fries are the best selling
^(the below is a reply to the above)|​​​​&amp;#x200B;
What are “battered fries”?|They go through batter before being fried. This gives them a crunchier flakey crust, google battered french fries.
How do the potatoes get skinned fast enough to make fries?|We put them in a ""tumbler"" which tumbles them around with steam. The ""tumbler"" puts out a few batches of hundreds of pounds a minute.
What cooking do you do with the potatoes to save restaurants time? I've heard that the best fries are usually cooked once before deep frying, do you do that in your factory?|Everything is fried, even tater tots, before being frozen then packaged.
Does anyone call you the Fry Guy?|No, but I do enjoy talking about the different processes.
What do you think of air fryers for French fries?|My coworkers that have them sprinkle oil on them before air frying for better taste.
McCains or Simplot?|I could be at Cavendish or Lamb Weston
Fry factory specific OSHA regulations?|I don't know of anything specific, but we have alot of rules surrounding the fryers due to the danger.
Malcom Gladwell spoke of McDonalds stopped using talo. If fries were supposed to be healthy, I'd have a stick of celery. Will the industry even go back to using beef fat? http://revisionisthistory.com/episodes/19-mcdonalds-broke-my-heart|It's due to vegetarians, and I'm sure vegetarians like their french fries. Alot of restaurants still use tallow so you can still get it.
Does your factory have any third party certifications like SQF?|I'm pretty sure we do, we have regular audits so we can meet certain requirements. Some of our customers have more stringent requirements.
Do you get business from local restaurants, larger chains, or both? If you do serve multiple businesses, do you have separate machines or areas to handle different specifications?|I believe all but our biggest contractors go through distributors like sysco. They'd then sell to different companies. We do have different formers for tots or hashbrown patties that can be changed over depending on what's running.
Why do French fry factories use sodium pyro phosphate when citric acid is safer and probably cheaper?|I'm not sure, we've never used citric acid as far as I know.
Does the stink of rotten potatoes get to you?|Only the fermented potatoes when it gets on my face
Are all fries and tree tots in your factory fried? Is there a way to tell by looking at packaging to see if an item has been fried before frozen?|Tots and fries are always fried where I am at, I've never heard of any that aren't fried.
Do you still eat potatoes? And Fries?|Yes
When I was in college and in a residence one of the guys on my floor found a 3-4 inch nail (metal carpentry nail not a finger nail) in their fries while we were eating dinner in the dining hall. What is your best guess on where this came from?|Everything is metal detected, metal detectors are verified every hour. It's taken very seriously, it would have to be a complete failure of multiple things for a foreign metal object to make it to a customer.
^(the below is a reply to the above)|​​​​&amp;#x200B;
I would accuse the guy of making it up, but we were all together and saw him find it and it appeared to have been fried. I still to this day have no idea how it got there. If it helps, I recall the fries were wedge cut with skins on. This was like 2003/4 ish.|I have no idea how it could have happened. Sometimes there is some weird stuff that comes off the farmers field like trash from being by a road. Golf balls can be problematic.
'know most of the processes' - french fries? Get some potatoes, cut potatoes, fry potatoes, pack potatoes and finally sell potatoes as french fries. Forgot something?|Yeah, you missed some.
Please tell me there's at least SOME nutritional value to fries?|It's a potato fried in oil, has alot of carbs and fat. Carbs and fat is nutrition.
What type of food grade lubricant do you use in the facility?|I don't know the brand, except that it's food grade."

Help?,snowconeoverdose,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/nr0f5h/changed_majors_late_and_now_scared_about_grad/,"I'm an undergrad from a lower income, historically underrepresented background and I'm thinking of applying to T20 and Ivies for grad school (I also have targets and safeties no worries) so I can get an MBA. 

my current stats: 

* GPA: 3.7/4 .0 (I changed my major from comp sci to business during my sophomore year, so i have some Cs and some Bs when I was depressed and trying to do comp sci but practically all As for my business classes)
* extracurriculars: 1) Business Specific Club (I'm currently trying to see if I can work on their committee, but I spent a year with them as a general member), 2) 2 Temp jobs ( I promote school activities and programs and get paid for doing it and I'm on the eboard for both of them with more business specific responsibilities like handling money)  3) Tech Specific Club (eboard, mentor) 4) 2 mentorship programs (I was a mentor for both. one lasted a semester and the other lasted a year) 
* Jobs: 1) One Campus Job I had for nearly a year 2) a lifeguarding job I had since high school but quit back in August 3) business internship with a big company for this summer (never had an internship before that though)
* aiming to volunteer around 200 or so hours this summer (I volunteered sparsely during my first two years of undergrad tho and i volunteered about 100+ hours during high school)
* I know a couple of programming languages specific to what I want to do, but I don't have a portfolio. 
* I'm doing these virtual experience programs with major business companies during the summer but idk how good they are for apps?? They're very small
* I'm taking both summer classes and winter classes to make sure I graduate within four years
* I plan on getting a double major (both business) and a minor (humanities)
* I haven't taken the GMAT yet but im doing prep after this summer and plan to take it soon after. I'm a rising junior. (idk if this helps but I got above a 1500 on the SAT and a perfect writing score)

I'm stressed because I'm not sure if my stats are good enough for highly competitive schools. I know that your first three years of undergrad are super important since that's what universities see on your grad app, but I hadn't been able to be super involved in my first two years. There's so many exclusive company outreach programs, pre-internship programs, and clubs that only accept freshmen and sophomores, which a bunch of my business classmates did. I didn't get a chance to get involved with them, because by the time I figured out I had wanted to do business, the deadline to apply had already passed.  


I feel like I'm so behind because I didn't get a chance to do this kind of stuff since I had no clue I was going to do business in the first place. Because of this, I feel like my application to grad schools isn't going to be as strong as I want it to be despite my current efforts.   


Is there anything I can do to make my grad school application better?"

I know a couple languages (Python, Java, and C to name a few) and have thought about going through my Github to fix or redo old projects so I don't get rusty.

So far, I've been using a mix of websites (Indeed, company sites, etc), postings from my college, and word of mouth from those myself or my family knows to apply for jobs. I've applied for a few jobs but I feel like I'm limiting myself in what I am applying for. In some job postings, I have been scared away if one or two requirement fields I am either shakey at or not qualified for. Personally, I do like to Google the company to see if it is a good place to work for or not. I know that no job can be perfect but some if my searches have made me second guess jobs. I do feel my search location is too narrow. I currently live in MA and have limited my search to the Boston area. I don't have anything against moving away, but it would be my first time living away from home.

My main question is what should I change about my approach to improve my job search? My parents have told me to email companies my resume and asking if they have any entry-level positions available. I've seen people in this subreddit apply for dozens of job postings so I know I need to change something. Any advice is helpful, I know I'm probably not alone as many others have likely found themselves in a similar situation."

Most of my doubt stems from applying and failing to get the job again. Another one of my doubts is about whether I get this job and it messes with my current job/situation as I can't manage both. And even before all of that I need to have passed my licensing exam  to even be able to start working which I'm waiting on the results for right now. 

My mind just keeps spiralling and thinking about the worst case scenario and I just don't want to make the wrong decision and miss an opportunity but the other part of me is unsure of whether I should just take the summer to chill and refocus/work on myself.

That includes working on the software of the product, improving circuits, testing the product, etc. I’m guessing they can’t afford to pay EE salary. Sounds like a good deal for me experience wise but then I’d work there probably until I graduate (thus missing out on potential internships).

**My background**: BS.CS. Have some past SDE/research internships at FANG. Want to work in the industry rather than academics.

**Teams**:

\- **Nvidia**: AI/CUDA/parallel programming; C++(primary) &amp; C &amp; Python.

\- **Tesla**: Full stack internal system development; Golang &amp; TypeScript.

From my interview experience, what the team at Nvidia is working on seems really cool. My interviewer told me they are mainly doing some customization of GPUS/lower-level computing stuff for their clients. There are some AI works(mainly in PyTorch) but pretty limited compared to other teams. The team at Tesla on the other hand works on pretty standard dev projects, not really related to their main product, so not sure if this seems like a solid place for SDE internships (correct me if I'm wrong, this is only from my friends/professors' impressions)

My main goal of doing this internship is to learn as much as I can and boost my dev skills. But right now I'm not sure if I want to continue working in AI.

Re-posting here in full as I think you guys will find them useful as well*

Tip 3 . . . Getting the most out of your engineering internship

Gain a job search framework by noting what you DO and DON'T like

Aside from skill development, this is a great time to see how certain work variables play to your interests. These variables can then be used as a general framework when you graduate and start job searching.

Here are a few variables to consider, but this is certainly not an exhaustive list:

- Small vs large company
- Size of department
- Onsite vs in-office work
- Direct engineering work vs client facing interactions
- Interaction ability with senior/management employees
- Engineering firm or non-engineering firm w/smaller engineering group
- Physical location. Urban vs rural

The actual engineering and work skills you gain will help you get some job offers.

However, the variables I noted above will help you figure out the jobs and roles to which you should apply.

Even if you HATED the internship overall, these are some of the bits of info that can still be learned and benefit you moving forward

nrewui,26,2021-06-03,Not getting enough work,wingobong,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/nrewui/not_getting_enough_work/,Anyone else have this issue? I currently have a paid internship at this tech company with decent pay($20 per hr) and I am not getting enough work assigned to me. I spend most of my time sitting idle on my laptop making sure it says I am available on Microsoft teams. I have messaged my team lead and other people and asked for work but they either give a shallow response or say that they can call me later but never do. I plan on doing another internship next year and want to use the people at my company as reference on my resume. What should I do in a situation like this? I am not really what to do but if anyone has any advice it would be helpful.

What are my options to get out of this?,owlbedamn,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nrgo0a/recent_cs_graduate_stuck_in_a_country_with_a_bad/,"Hi everyone

I'm a 22 yr old, recent cs graduate with no work experience or technical internships. I've been actively seeking jobs/internships related to my field for the past 9 months since I've graduated. The country I'm currently situated in has a bad job market for my field.

I've spent quite a lot of time and money on my degree, and I'm qualified for junior roles with reasonable requirements as I've seen around the world, but now I'm not getting anywhere with it. 

I've tried looking up ways to go abroad, but I haven't found a way pertaining to cs.

For a masters, the advice I've gotten is to work first and see what you like and only then do masters with some specialization. Since I can't find jobs in the first place, that won't work.

The other option I've thought of is to share accommodation abroad somehow while I apply there, but I'm by myself and have no relatives or friends abroad, so that can't work. Also most companies prefer hiring candidates from their country anyways so my chances are less.

For going abroad, my country of preference has been Canada. I'm open to other countries as well that are good for my field, but the above problem sustains.

I'm pretty much stuck right now and time's running out for me. Soon it'll be a year since graduation and I'm quite worried. All I want is a job to break into the industry and make some money, but I've been getting nowhere.

I'm seeking some advice about what I can do in this situation to get a job or go abroad or any other options I might have no considered yet.

Thank you in advance for taking the time to read and reply :)"
nrhehe,2,2021-06-03,Got turned down in my first interview. How many before I get a job!,tomkaa255,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/nrhehe/got_turned_down_in_my_first_interview_how_many/,"Last week I did an interview for IT support intern in a company. It was my first ever interview. Been waiting anxiously for a week for the answer. Today they sent me an email that someone else got the job. Feel like crying. This job would put me out of misery, gain experience, apply my knowledge, and learn new things, would give me the opportunity to bond with people and participate in activities, since I'm alone, have no real friends, done nothing valuable in my life, and have a miserable life. Obviously, I'm at fault for not getting the job, since I was insecure during the interview, something even the interviewers mentioned to me, and seems there were more knowledgeable candidates than me that were more fit for the company. I'm devastated, this was a golden opportunity to get a job, change my life, and I blew it.

Doubt I'll get any opportunity soon since it's so hard to get hired in my country (somewhere in Southeastern Europe). There are barely any job openings in IT, especially for entry levels, and most of them require experience.

This is more of a sorry post than tip, question or helpful post, but I hope you forgive me."
nri7md,13,2021-06-03,I might be a snowflake but why do recruiters have to be deliberately mean and degrading?,throwawayrainy12398,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nri7md/i_might_be_a_snowflake_but_why_do_recruiters_have/,"TL;DR: Invited for an offline interview, apparently they haven't even reviewed my CV. I had to sit in front of 3 people reading my CV and transcript for the first time. They said remarks in a foreign language that I can understand but not speak so I had to pretend I didn't understand anything. They kept asking why I didn't take this and that and why I even bother applying.. even though they said I ""passed the document screening test"" in the interview invitation email.

Long rant, I need to get this off my chest. Going with throwaway account since I don't want my friends to know about all the details. I'm a hypersensitive person by nature, so putting up a though exterior is harder than ever. But I guess I've been mostly lucky in my past job-hunting experience, for recruiters I talked to were generally nice. If I lack something that they're looking for the most in an incoming intern, they'd tell me honestly and I'd always be like, ""cool, let me work on that, and I'll contact you again once I'm ready"".

I'm kind of desperate to find summer internships these days, so I just applied to all companies I could find. Before you say it, yes I know I should've applied to companies that I know I'd be a top candidate in, but several times I've gotten offers from companies I thought wouldn't accept me, because they saw my potential from the many cool (tho unrelated) stuff I did on my CV -- according to them.

A bit of background: my main focus is AI and data science, although I have a little experience with front-end. I'm getting interested in backend lately, since I'm taking several backend-related courses, so I'm trying my luck with backend job openings in startups in case they don't mind accepting newbies (I know it's near impossible, but why shouldn't I give it a shot anyway?).

Now I'd assume that if they invite me for an interview, they'd have at least seen my CV, known the kind of stuff I have and haven't done, and saw the slightest potential in me. I received a notice that I ""passed the document screening process"" and they would like to have me in an offline interview, with dress code: formal clothes. I asked what kind of stuff I need to prepare for the interview and they didn't reply. Cool, maybe they wanted to keep it a secret

So I came, but the first greeting I heard was that they somehow lost my CV and I needed to send them a copy again. Obviously I got confused but I did anyway, and I had to sit down in a small table facing 3 guys who are reviewing my CV while pointing out things on my CV and transcript and making remarks in a foreign language (I'm an international student). It's a very awkward situation since I'm not fluent enough to talk in their language, but I know just enough to understand what they're talking about. So they'd say things like ""that girl did this.."", ""she didn't do this at all.. wut?"" etc etc, and I just had to pretend I didn't hear anything while still keeping my cool to answer their obviously impromptu questions. And one guy would translate my English interview answers to their language, since the other guys aren't that fluent in English, so I painfully need to hear my paraphrased answers throughout the interview.

Near the end, some leader-looking guy came, he saw my CV for a few seconds, and asked why I haven't taken this course and that, and how I haven't taken so many required courses (but I'm in year 3 and I only need 2 more courses). He then asked questions that I didn't know the answer to, and when I tried to answer he would make obvious ""ehh what?"" faces and told me why I even applied if I hadn't took this and that. It was getting harder to maintain a straight face, so I went blabbering about how I'm used to study materials on my own, that there are countless free resources, and that I believe I could study on the way given enough time etc etc.

I mean I get that those stuff are important, but if it's such a problem that I haven't taken those classes, why not reject me from the first place? I've stumbled upon this kind of situation before and the recruiter would just straight up tell me to study this and that first before re-applying, instead of painfully dragging the ""why did you even apply?"" question for hours.

The offline situation made it even awkward. After making all those mean remarks the ""leader"" casually asked me how was the interview, and I just said it was kind of not what I was expecting. I didn't have time to eat before the interview, it was raining, and their office was sooo far from the main entrance. Call me a snowflake or whatever, but I'm still shook and cry when I remembered what happened. Now on top of a bruised ego, I'm losing the interview confidence I had tried so hard to build over the years.

I know I have to own it etc etc and I'm totally fine with them not accepting me for my lack of experience, but can't they do it in a nicer way?"

(""Legislative Budget Board""\^9 OR ""underfunded mandate\*""\^9 OR ""unfunded mandate\*""\^9 OR ""planning and budgeting""\^9 OR ""plan and budget""\^9) and (higher-education or ""higher education"" OR college)

The rules for conversion are as follows

Use + to include terms: +cars +chevy +1957 will find cars AND chevy AND 1957

Use - to exclude terms: +cars +chevy -1957 will find cars AND chevy AND NOT 1957

Use "" "" to find words that occur together: ""Chevy trucks""

Add \~ at the end for optional distance between words: ""Chevy trucks""\~10 will find the words Chevy and trucks within ten words of each other

Use ( ) to group terms: +(chevy vehicles) -(gas mileage)

There are no solid requirements at this point, my company uses Microsoft eco system. I'm mostly figuring out what FSx can do and more importantly what it can't do or its limitations.

Its a great position, what I would have wanted.

However, in march-april I was getting rejection after rejection and was worried I was not going to get an internship and its summer after junior year etc. so I finally got an offer to intern at a cs lab at a more prestigious university (~40/week) (most prestigious in my state) . Also later a part time (~10hr/week) at another even more prestigious university both remote.

So i accepted those offers even though what I really wanted was an internship offer in industry like the one I just got. I honestly wish I could drop the 40/week internship but I just started this week. Its not well paid and the topic is not extremely interesting but ok, I thought it would be different but its alright. Now I regret accepting it but I got the part time one after accepting and since the SV internship reached out so late it messed everything up.  I am managing myself p much and am gonna be working on my own project. Also the PI is super nice and the lab is supportive.

Thoughts/advice if anyones been in similar position? Just feeling a little lost. I am grateful however to be given these opportunities just I wish I had followed up with this company to get an update before.

Should I ask the sv company to do 20hr/week instead of 40?"

I used to be quite a bright student all throughout elementary, middle and highschool, always the top of my class, the teacher's favourite and recognized as 'smart' by everyone in school, friends and family. I graduated highschool with flying colors and had a wide choice of colleges to go to. It might sound like im bragging but it wasn't because i was a hardwroker or anything, most of it just came naturally to me from paying attention in class and doing a minimum of preparation before exams. 

My first 2 years of college did nothing to dissuade me out of my lazy/ passive studying methods as i was still able to achieve great results by doing the bare minimum.
In these last two years, as a finance major, and as the materials are getting more complicated, im having a hard time letting go of those habits and still find myself only doing the bare minimum and only studying to pass my exams ( only trying to not fail my classes and nothing more ) which has lead me to realize lately that i actually don't have any deep knowledge about my major and that i probably wouldn't be able to hold a conversation about what i'm studying/ what i learnt in college. As I compare myself with my classmates im starting to feel stupid. And as i'm getting close to graduating and looking for internships and starting to plan for my future career I can't help but feel like im going to fail, that i wasted these 4 years of my life and that im gonna be a major disappointment.

If you have any advice or if you have been through something similar please feel free to share."

The goal of this internship for me is to improve myself in Financial analysis and valuation. 
I am really starting to stress because I am supposed to find an internship for July / September but I have nothing while I have been looking since January! I only had 2 interviews (that I failed) while I sent countless applications.

At first I thought there was a problem with my CV, but the career center at my school confirms that everything was correct.

nrl7qt,2,2021-06-03,Advice for Mom,Proof_Loquat5585,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/nrl7qt/advice_for_mom/,"This is a long one but please read. I’d like some advice or experiences. My mom moved to a new state (Florida) May 2020 after losing her husband January 2020. She was okay the first two months, but her neighbor across the road started bullying her over her boxer dog. She was told she needed to train the dog better or get rid of him. My mom told the neighbor after a while to leave her alone and stay away from her, which the neighbor replied with “you don’t know who you’re messing with.” My mom is 61 for reference.

This is when the issues started. In September my moms Apple ID got hacked and we reset it. But then she said she thought people were coming into her home. She called the cops to check her smoke detectors for hidden cameras and none were found. She slowly began showing changes. She seemed more stressed and felt like she was being watched. In November she said she couldn’t sleep through the night anymore and she would wake up and felt her bed vibrating. She eventually woke up with a severe burning sensation in her legs and she felt like they were on fire. This led to her claiming that her neighbors had banded together to drug her via her air vents.

This arose from the fact that one neighbor is a retired serviceman, one was a therapist, and one was a pharmacist (she lives in a retirement area in Florida). Fast forward to March 2021 and she called me one night jerking and spasming like she was having a seizure. She was taken to the hospital. After multiple EEGs no stroke or seizure damage was detected and she was cleared. Two days after she returned home her boxer dog began to cough up blood and had to be put to sleep due to a tumor in his chest. She later told me she thought her neighbors messed with the dog while she was in the hospital and made him sick. Fast forward again to May 2021. I came to see her and she was okay for two weeks, but I noticed alarming changes. She would be moving her lips and muttering while driving and I noticed she would be sitting around staring into space with her arms folded.

At the end of May I went to leave and noticed on her nest doorbell she stood outside for 4 hours on her porch with arms folded and finally ran inside. She later confronted the same neighbor who bugged her over her dog almost a year ago and apparently threw a head of lettuce at her. She was Baker Acted and battery charges were supposed to be brought on her. The behavioral hospital said nothing was wrong and when I went to get her she was wandering in the parking lot. Two days later she was Baker Acted a second time after going around at 3AM knocking on neighbors doors looking for me and her new dog. She was taken back to the hospital and was diagnosed with a brief psychotic disorder. I had her taken to a memory care facility because I don’t live in the state and the police advised me to do this. They’ve also stated that the next time this happens she’ll have to be taken to jail. 

She’s been trying to leave the facility now and has become aggressive with some staff. She’s only been there 48 hours but they also said they would call 911 if she got too aggressive, but they were going to give her medicine to see if she would calm down. Can anyone out there please help me in what to do next? I just started an internship and have to do it for school so I cannot be in Florida and can’t take care of her. Does anyone have any ideas on what to do? She obviously has more than a brief psychotic disorder, I don’t know how to get her to a doctor and a better diagnosis. Her facility has on staff doctors but I don’t know how they’ll work to diagnose her since they put her in respite (temporary) care to see how she progresses. Will they really make someone with an issue like that sit in jail too? I have her durable PoA, but where I can’t be in state right now, everything is so hard."

My original plan was to go trough the normal process to get a postdoc and work in academia, however because of mental health problems, I had to give up on that plan. I also want to stay in the same town (In Canada- Southern Ontario) that my girlfriend who is also a student currently is, so applying to hundreds of Universities all around the world just doesn't appeal to me.

The problem is I have virtually no work experience outside of teaching mathematics at university level and some small office jobs that I did as a teen.  I do know some basic programming and of course a lot of different topics in pure mathematics which rarely ever can be used in real life.  

I wanted to ask for recommendations for job searching.  Should I try to go with something related to coding/software engineering? As far as I know that's the most typical career path that mathematicians who leave academia take. I just don't know if I'd be able to compete with people who have a diploma and an internship in computer science for entry level jobs."

Everyone around my including my friends and peers have internships and I'm just stuck here with nothing because I can't code for to save my life. I keep applying to places but I'm getting absolutely nowhere. I'd want to apply to American ones but I can't because I would need a visa that no company is willing to sponsor. I'd have hope for post-graduation but every post I see asks for experience even at an entry level (because they know ppl have done internships). Every decent attempt I make at networking I just get ghosted. I'm nothing compared to everyone else and I don't think I have the will to keep going.

I got a handful of coding assessments and one final round interview but ended being rejected from everything. I know I just need to grind more leetcode and make better personal projects but how much is this going to set me back for next years recruiting cycle? I'll be a junior next semester so I feel even more anxious about finding an internship since it'll be the last summer I can. I'm also an international student so I feel like I really only have a good shot with bigger tech companies which are way more competitive. Aside from grinding leetcode and making projects is there anything else I can do? I tried looking for research and on campus internships this summer as well to get experience but most of them don't sponsor either. I'm just not really sure how to get experience (other than projects) since it feels like a never ending cycle of needing experience to get experience. If anyone was in the same boat or has any tips I'd be really appreciative.
nrnvic,3,2021-06-03,Resume wording help,TeaArtistic481,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/nrnvic/resume_wording_help/,"Hey guys, I’m currently a CS student and my goal is to apply for Software engineer internships in the future. I have one internship experience under the belt , here’s what I did and here’s how I summarized it. Would love feedback! 

```Task #1: Drone Flight Graphs:```
Raw Data produced by drone flights converted into various graphs to optimize features such as battery voltage, and battery age resulting in maximizing drone flight success with Python.
After conducting many drone flight tests, the data of what battery was used, battery, temperature, the voltage drop, how long the drone was flying, and weather the drone succeeded or failed was recorded in the Excel sheet titles ""Battery Aging.""
Technologies used: Python 3.8.2, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, plotly 

```Task #2: Ulog → Bag File ```
Original Code: Ulog → csv file → bag file 
Then you would have to manually type the CSV file name into the bag file program to get the output result. 

What I did: 
Ulog → bag file 
Automated and modularized code, so you type the ulog file and the output will be the bag file. 

```Task #3: Automating Propeller Data```
Engineers test propeller data on a machine, and a bunch of data gets generated of x,y,z, axis and time for the left propeller and right propeller. All this data is saved in a CSV file and then manually entered into an excel document to keep track of, then through excel the standard deviation is found to see if the propeller passes a threshold testing level 

What I did:
Using python I automated this system. First, I made a program that converts the raw CSV files into 2 different excel sheets, one for a left prop, and one for a right prop. Each time data gets added, these excel sheets will automatically update. Then, I made a program that calculates the standard deviation of each propeller by typing in the CSV file name to see if the propeller passes the threshold test or not. If it passes “Pass” is printed else “Fail” is printed. 
Technologies/ libraries used: pandas, json, os, csv/excel imports
 
My summary: 

- Generated visualization for drone flight performance using raw flight data with Python to maximize number of successful flights


- Improved and modularized code in existing python scripts 


- Automated process of if a propeller can be used for drone flights


- Converted data propeller produced into excel sheets, split the master excel sheet into two sub excel sheets (one for left, one for right) and calculated the standard deviation of each propeller


- Used: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matpolotlib, OS, JSON

ANOTHER VERSION OF SUMMARIZED POINTS

- Utilized Matplotlib to visualize drone fight performance with the manipulated raw data from pandas to maximize the number of successful flights.


- Improved and modularized code in existing Python scripts to increase efficiency


- Developed an automation system in Python for calculating standard deviation to tell if they can be used for flight testing leading to a reduction of failed test flights


- Improved project organization by consolidating propeller data files in a central Excel spreadsheet into 2 excel sheets using pandas: one for the left propeller, one for right propeller"

**Letters of Recommendation**

I got my LORs from my English and chemistry professors. I haven't read them, but I imagine that they have probably written me really good recs (probably 9/10 for both).

**Interviews**

No interviews

**Essays**

The essays that I wrote for my transfer app improved a lot from when I applied as a first-year applicant, and I think it's mainly due to the fact that I took more time on my essays (2-3 months) and took a gap year and gained more experience. I wrote about my experience during my year off from school, how I decided to take a break because I wanted to find meaning in going to college, and how I discovered my passion for teaching through working as a TA and developed a goal to become a college professor. I think this was probably the strongest essay.

I also wrote about helping others, specifically through using my field of studies to help underprivileged people. I think I was able to sound more genuine because the essays overall intertwined really well with my extracurricular activities (like at Cooper Summer STEM) and my personal life as an immigrant. 

I felt that my supps were pretty good too, but they may have been a bit generic. I tried to include the specific characteristics of each school I applied to.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* Columbia SEAS

*Rejections:*

* Cornell
* Harvard
* MIT

**Additional Information:**

Applied to colleges during my senior year, got rejected to most of my schools (except for some state schools)

Applied again during my gap year and got accepted to a private college

Applied yet again as a transfer, finally accepted to my dream school

The reason for my gap year had to do with how I felt really burnt out after high school and wanted to take a break. I think college rejections also made me question my direction in my life, and I wanted to search for that answer by taking some time off from school. I think the experience I gained during this time really changed me for the better, and that thankfully seemed to have been reflected in my essays. Another reason for taking a year off was that I had some health issues.

Even though I am pretty content with my grades and test scores and all that, I personally don't think my ECs were all that stellar and was even afraid that the mediocrity of ECs would hinder my chances of getting in, but I think I was able to show my passion for math and connect that to how I want to become a professor. In the end, I think what colleges really want to see is that you are really passionate about something and that you're willing to do something meaningful with that passion.

&amp;#x200B;

LMK if you have questions, and I hope this helps anyone who is considering transferring as an Applied Math major or any other related major in the future."

I've been looking at a few  websites like codeacademy and codeschool. I want to learn coding but I also want a certificate that carries some weight with employers.

I’m 24, 2 years out of college, and I’ve been living in her house then. I’ve been employed the entire time (2 jobs, mostly retail/hospitality/admin), I don’t pay all the bills, just electricity, and pay for my own car insurance. I’ve saved about 12k. What concerns her is that I don’t have a safe career, with benefits and the like. I am just taking whatever jobs I can take. Benefits or not. She’s noticed that I’ve been falling off my job search after I quit one my terrible, low paying old jobs for a temporary one with higher pay and part-time. And she’s getting scared and paranoid to a point where its affecting her physical health and mental wellbeing.

She’s giving me 6 months to come up with a plan of action and afterwards, I’ll be on my own.

I saw this coming, but it still took me by surprise. I have some questions if any of you are willing to answer them.

Question 1: DO YOU HAVE ANY POSITIVES OF BECOMING A TEACHER?

Where did this come from? Well the belief is that English degree means author, and I have yet to make the next NYT Bestseller. I’ve personally been against being a teacher for a little bit. She is “encouraging”, (or at this point demanding) I use my english degree, get a masters in education, and become a teacher. She claims it’s easy, but I  think its expensive and I’ve run into a lot of teachers where I work that have said  otherwise. I’ve been against that option just because I’m not a fan of the lack of work/life balance and other “excuses” according to her. I would rather work for an office, or a day job where I can come home and focus on art/writing/editing instead of bringing more work with me.

If you have any positive experiences about being a teacher, please share. If not, should I pursue it anyway?

Question 2: HOW DO YOU START THE MOVE OUT PROCESS?

If the teacher thing didn’t work out, hell, even if it does, I would’ve still liked to be out of the house and into an apartment by next year. Now the process is sped up, I don’t have a lot of choice either way. What steps do I have to take to start the process? I’m looking at cheaper spots midwest. Any ideas?

Question 3: IS MY PLAN NOT GOOD ENOUGH?

During COVID, while I was furloughed, I applied to cc complete a associates in Graphic Design and become a UX/UI designer. I had some push back, but was still told I could do it when I explained there was some practical use as well. I have some editing experience (worked on college literary magazine for a semester and got an internship at a major publishing house in 2020. Because of that, had to put of associates until next year, but I at least have  two avenues to take. With that, my plan was going to apply to editorial assistant positions and meanwhile, take graphic design to work towards being UX Designer 

My mother is at her limit, but at this point, I am too. I can’t speak up to her and clam up because everything’s an excuse to her. Maybe they are, but I need one of you to tell me and shake me out of my own naivety if I’m wrong. I’m very close to blowing up at her and damaging the relationship completely. 

Please help me. I’m overwhelmed and angry and so is she and I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to hurt her, but I don’t think my life choices should affect her health like this. 

Am I spoiled? Probably. What’s your advice?"

UofT is pretty academic-focused and I am afraid I won't have enough time to work on side-projects or do any internships outside of school since I would need to also grind for CS POSt. 

Please answer these questions below, thanks!

1. The thing is I want to know what were some of your experiences at UofT like when securing internships at big tech giants such as Google, Amazon, Facebook...etc. What did you do differently? And if going back, would you have picked another Uni just because UofT did not offer you more opportunities as you thought it would have?
2. PEY starts after 2nd year and does the school not support you at all for getting internships before the year? Or you all on your own?
3. Do employers prefer UofT students over other Universities?"

I am just in my first week of my IT internship (that I got through my dad since he works there) and 

1. It is kind of unorganized. There isn’t really anything planned for me to do, I kind of just do whatever. Some days are better than others, like today I got to follow my coworker on how to set up a server, I helped another with inventory, and had a really good talk about networking that helped my understanding of everything. Another day I was instructed to take apart a switch and put it back together for whatever reason. I am not that knowledgeable so I know I can’t help out with any project and that my manager and everyone else is busy with calls all the time, so sometimes I just follow this Udemy class I bought to get a better understanding of Networking at work. 
2. Coworkers are nice, but it’s hard to connect with them. I ask them about their careers and about questions I have about IT, but it feels more like me interviewing them than friends. They’re also older than me so there’s an age gap, but other than that they are super nice to me. This one isn’t really a complaint, I’m just wondering if I am going about this coworker relationship right? They might also think I’m not that interested in IT and am only there because of my dad. I really do want to learn more, I just do not have any IT experience whatsoever so sometimes it’s even hard to come up with questions to ask. They keep bringing up that I should do what I enjoy, so maybe they’re noticing I’m not liking it. I try really hard to smile everyday and have a mentality of I’m here to learn, but maybe the sadness subconsciously comes out.
3. Office life makes me sad. I feel like the one redeeming quality of working in an office is being able to socialize with your coworkers, but again, that’s been a challenge. I’m really surprised at how much of a mental toll sitting at a desk has taken, and sometimes I look around and get scared that I’ll grow old and be depressed. But, this was the only internship offer I got, and I am very thankful for the opportunity and do not want to be ungrateful. 

I kind of already expressed to my dad that work is making me a little sad, but he got angry since I begged for this internship when I wasn’t ready. He was kind of right, I just was looking for support at the time.

I don’t want to quit, I want to finish this out because it’ll be good for the knowledge I receive on IT, and if I don’t end up liking it, then now I know I don’t like it. I’ve also decided that I will devote weekend time to learn more networking so I don’t seem like a noob at my job. I just need advice on how to deal with all of it, because I’ll be away from home, family, and friends all summer in a city where I don’t know anyone and I’ve already have left work with teary eyes everyday. I guess I don’t handle change very well. Some tips of how to socialize with my coworkers would be appreciated, too, since I really have not made a new friend in over 2 years."
nrrfw9,0,2021-06-03,Anyone else did internships and then realized they DONT want to be a software engineer? Impact of remote vs in person internship?,Own-Size-8412,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/nrrfw9/anyone_else_did_internships_and_then_realized/,"Most CS majors really want to be a software engineer and are grinding and struggling to get their first internship. I have 9 months of internship experience so far and another 3 months of internship this summer at a F50 level company. My experience so far is leading me to think I should stop pursuing software engineering as a career path.

I've been struggling a lot to get my work complete (read: missing deadlines) even though I know exactly what I am suppose to do and it is relatively easy (compared to what I've done on my own before).

I can think of a variety of reasons why this may be the case: working from home with entire family, difficulty separating home/work life, working in an online setting where I am 3 timezones away, lack of interest in project, lack of control over project (unlike my personal projects). Feels like I spend more time day dreaming about doing other things than my actual work. Once I remember what I need to be doing, I spend so much time catching up on what I was doing before I started daydreaming and don't make much progress.

Maybe working from home feels like homework that I keep procrastinating on? Work from home deadlines don't feel real? Is this adhd (along with a bunch of other factors in my life)? I don't know. But it's been incredibly frustrating trying to get myself to work. I feel really bad because my manager is kind and patient but I just keep missing the mark and feel like I'm disappointing everyone because my manager keeps reiterating how important the internship project is to impacting the rest of the team. I also feel really bad that I'm getting paid so much and getting almost nothing done week after week.

So yeah idk, **does being a software engineering intern get more enjoyable IRL? Or easier to focus on doing what you're suppose to be doing at least?**

What's interesting is that I really enjoy coding. I've made a lot more progress on personal projects outside of work than my actual work. It's just for whatever reason I can't do what I'm getting PAID to do.

So now I feel like I need to find a new career path after I spent so much time working on a CS degree and have this much job experience."

nrsaj4,0,2021-06-03,I'm quitting my job before my boss discovers I don't have a college degree,Kitchen_Concern_2470,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/nrsaj4/im_quitting_my_job_before_my_boss_discovers_i/,"I've been working as a software engineer in multinational financial services company for 3.5 years (1 year as an half-time intern and 2.5 years full time). The company has around 150 employees, 30 of those are oursource employees (not sure if relevant). I am an outsource employee, which means I receive minimum paid time off, I don't get private health insurance (so I have to pay for it myself becuase public health care sucks) and I get no performance bonuses.

Last year my boss' boss said to me in our one-on-one something like ""you've been doing good work and I've noticed you've developed new skills. You're underpaid so I'm working with HR to give you a well-deserved raise"" and I was thinking ""Please don't bring HR's attention to my person"", but of course I couldn't say this out loud. By the end of the year my boss' boss told me I would be getting a 30% raise and I thanked him; I got the raise on January.

At the beginning of this year, Mexican government (I'm in Mexico) decided it would regulate outsource employment. The new law recently passed and I was informed on Monday that I would be getting hired directly by the company while my colleagues cheered in the Zoom meeting. As technically I have been working for the outsource company all this time, I'm worried that HR will look into my background and discover that I don't have a college degree so I'm thinking in resigning before that happens. Even if the degree is not required, it's highly unsual for someone without a degree to occupy a position like mine and I don't think HR will like that a person without degree like me is making more $ (after the raise) than people with degrees in other departments.

When I've been asked about my degree, I imply that I'm on my way to getting it (""I'm just missing 3 courses but right now I'm not going to school because I'm focusing on my work"" or something like that). And this is something that I do, not only at work, but also in my personal life as I am too ashamed to admit to anyone (friends, family or even my boyfriend) that I failed at school. I abandoned university 3 years ago because I couldn't afford it anymore and because I was doing poorly (so I felt like I was wasting money to end failing classes); I was also dealing with mental health issues and I just couldn't take it \[failing at school\] anymore. I was missing about 1/3 of the courswork needed to graduate before abandoning. I've grown in these 3 years: I have learned about effective learning techniques, I have built my work ethic (at my job), and I continue to study almost every weekend so that the maths and programming that I need to finish my classes won't atrophiate so that thy will remain fresh for when I decide to go back to school. I really think I'm much better equiped now to do university.

&amp;#x200B;

My boss told me HR would be contacting me to see about my hiring. This could happen tomorrow, in two months or by the end of the year (I have no clue). I've sketched the following plan:

1. When they ask about my education I will say I will ask them if they can wait six months while I get my degree.
2. After six months I will say ""I got a job at &lt;&lt;random&gt;&gt; company"" and give my 2-week notice (hoping they won't need my education info. anymore as I'm quitting). Even if I'm lying, I'm not harming the company as this are 6 months of good work. I would save money during this time. I can't tell the truth \[that I'm going back to school\] because I'm too ashamed and I'd rather die.
3. I would try to go back to my university (I've been saving to be able to afford it). If my university won't take me back, I would enroll to public univesity which is free here in Mexico, but they won't allow for credit transfer so I would have to start my engineering degree from scratch.
4. Get my degree and find another job (maybe do summer internships or start working half-time midway through?).

&amp;#x200B;

My concerns are the following:

1. Will my plan work? When I tell them I need those six months to provide them with my degree will they accept or ask for other proof (transcripts, or even call themselves my school)?
2. What will recruiters think when they see that I quit a my job to go to school to get a bachelor's degree starting from scratch?
3. Will I be able to get internships? Will my previous work experience be a plus or a minus?
4. When I relaunch my professional career (say 3 or 4 years into school), will I have to start from scratch or will this 3.5 years of exprience in my curreny company account for anything?

&amp;#x200B;

nrz7f5,0,2021-06-04,A CS soon-to-be senior and I don't think I'm ever going to get a job...,lemonsodagingerpop,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nrz7f5/a_cs_soontobe_senior_and_i_dont_think_im_ever/,"I am (21F) at the end of my 6th semester in my 4-year computer science engineering bachelor's course (with a specialization in Machine Intelligence and Data Science). I chose computer science cause I liked math and logical thinking, but in came data structures and design algorithms in my second year and I started losing my footing. I get the point of these courses, but I was so bad at them and was lost most of the time, so I just associate them with dread. The courses that I do like revolve around Data Science, obtaining insights, experimenting, that kind of stuff. I don't really enjoy Machine Intelligence but that could be because when I took that course, the online mode of classes sucked (and it needs me to understand algorithms **😐**).  I'm currently doing a course on Computer Network Security and Information Security but I don't have any feelings about that. 

These two months were reserved for internships, but I wasn't able to get any. I find the technical coding tests really hard. And I haven't landed a single interview. My CGPA is an 8.5 and I've worked on projects almost every semester, and most of the time I'd be using libraries and stuff that already exist. I'm not writing my own algorithms anytime soon. 

I'm just going to put down a list of stuff that's worrying me: 

\- I really need a job. I don't even know if I'd like it, but at least it would pay, and if I could stick with it for a few years I might have other ideas down the line and do something I actually enjoy. Which leads me to my next point: 

\- I need my resume to look good but that's so not the case. All I have on my resume right now are projects that I've done. And I don't even feel like they're any good. I haven't done any volunteering cause. Let's just say I wasn't having a great time at college, so stuff like organizing events was way out of my train. But I could feel it every single minute I wasn't doing this stuff. I don't know I wasn't in a very good headspace.

\- I feel like a lot of the stuff I know is meager and I'm not very well informed. I'm doubting my skills because of how I've performed in these technical rounds for internships (so many of them deal with data structures and algorithms and I immediately feel a dread) (I'll be honest I only started actually practicing solving coding questions like recently on leetcode but still, if I'm not even into that stuff, why do I even need to be tested for it D;)

\- I feel so burnt out and I have no motivation to even work on my remaining courses. I'm currently doing a project with a teacher and I'm sucking at it. I think I actually need to sit down and understand the nitty gritty details of an algorithm but I'm not able to concentrate at it cause lockdown again isn't helping. Nothing's been fun. And this ever looming feeling of disappointment won't go away. 

Like I understand algorithms and data structures are important. I've felt their need while doing projects. But I for the life of me can't get myself to sit down with them. I've been such a good student, but the past two semesters have sucked and I'm so scared about my exam, and this big project and not being able to score an internship. 

So I want to know if I can ever land a job with my current progress? What additional work do I need to put in? How can I even look for jobs that I love if I'm not even able to get past a technical coding round? How did y'all get anything done? I'm so confused and scared right now and the second lockdown isn't helping cause I'm at my home all day thinking about how my graph feels like it's going to drastically fall. 

I'm so sorry if I sound like a stupid brat but I honestly don't know what to do!"
nrzaf6,1,2021-06-04,NOW WHAT? Legal career or business?,tomasjonas,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/nrzaf6/now_what_legal_career_or_business/,"Hey guys, don't know where to start so I will disclose my full story for a better understanding of the situation. Any advice is highly appreciated!

After college I didn't know what profession I would like to do so I ended up studying law. Quickly after I started my studies I visualized myself as a new Harvey Specter. The studies went great and I also experienced a lot of paid internships, etc. during them. I get to meet the real legal environment during one of the internships (in 2nd/3rd grade) at a prestigious local law firm where I had to work long hours (no one explicitly told me to do so, but I understood the environment quickly and realized that it's the only way to be successful as a starting youngster there). It usually went like this: I've done the work, they praised me and gave me more work (that makes sense from their perspective because they realized that I am reliable). Being good basically resulted in more and more work. Anyways, because I was reading books like a 4-Hour Work Week, The Millionaire Fastlane, etc., at that time, I decided to leave the practice to pursue my business dreams - already visualizing myself chilling on the beach with a huge bank account. **I was sure, that I am going to work on my own terms with no one telling me when to work and what to work on.** Even though I left the practice, to this day, I still have a lot of valuable connections there (e.g. going for an occasional lunch with a partner of the firm, etc.).

This was in my 4th grade and I was thinking about dropping out of the law school (important to note, that I was studying probably the most prestigious law school in our country and that we have a public education system meaning I didn't pay anything for it) but the majority of people around me told me to finish it because it was just one more year (I am still not sure if I should thank them or curse them). So I decided to finish the university. At that time I was working as a remote legal assistant and I was gathering my own business ideas, reading marketing books, etc. I didn't have to visit the university too often and going through the finals wasn't that hard for me. I started few business ideas along the way but none of them catch up (I am not sure to this that whether it was because they were bad or just because my mindset wasn't set right, maybe a combination of both). 

I finished my law degree in SEP 2020, and, for the fear that I would have to go to the office, I immediately approached my friend who was a general manager of a huge Amazon FBA business about whether I could work for them... he offered me to work for them as an independent contractor and I took it - basically, I was optimizing their listings to increase impressions, click-through rates, and conversions.  I worked remotely, with no real stress, etc. Because I am a straight-A personality, from the beginning of this cooperation, I was thinking about getting more similar clients and charge higher prices, and ultimately, create a digital agency. I also knew that the business owner of the company is going to sell it so my workload will lower significantly after some period of time. I viewed it as a perfect opportunity to switch from working for one client to start with the freelance practice.

For the past 2-3 months my workload for the company lowered significantly and I worked quite a lot to get new clients. It didn't go really well. E.g., I get a client who was enthusiastic during our cooperation but didn't reply since I sent him an invoice for my services, etc. (quite a few stories like that..) In the end, I started to feel even more frustrated than I was ever before - yes, I have a lot of free time now, but soon I won't be able to cover my basic expenses like rent... I also feel quite lost in what to work on and what not - **what would I give if I had someone I respect to tell me what to do and I just could do it great and get paid for it.** It made me also feel like I am not good and what I do (and maybe that's actually true) which is something I accept really hard because, in the law field, I always get positive feedback that I was one of the best.

Somewhere deep inside I know what I have to do to get more clients and get out of this, but I am just unable to do so. I feel paralyzed. Generally, I am highly organized and have a lot of positive habits, but in the last month or so I see I am slowly getting lost in everything. Back then, I was productively working on the most important tasks in the morning, don't check the phone and email until noon, etc. And now? The first thing I do every morning is that I look into the outlook (probably hoping, that there is some miraculous email that would solve everything and allow me to live happily ever after...). A third of the time I browse legal job offers, the second third I browse marketing job offers and the last third I grit my teeth and try to push through the resistance and work on getting clients.

The question is, **NOW WHAT?** I was always thinking a lot about my professional future, I've also read a lot of books like So Good They Can't Ignore You from Cal Newport, etc., but I don't feel like more thinking or studying the topic is going to help me. Quite the opposite, if I would be able to commit to one option and don't think about the others, I am quite sure that I would be happy and successful.

As I see it, I have two options:

1. Continue to work as an independent contractor in the Amazon FBA field and try to get more clients and push through.
2. Leave my entrepreneurial aspirations aside for some time and commit myself to legal practice.

But I am just unable to make the decisive move.. 

Right now, I probably feel more like getting back to the legal field, make my name there, and then leverage it to get the working hours I want or maybe establish my own law firm, etc...

Did any of you experience anything similar? Thanks a lot for any comments and suggestions.

P.S. It's crazy how having multiple great options makes me (us?) miserable, sometimes, I feel like it would be better to not think about it in the first place or just have one option significantly better than other options...

P.P.S. When I see a cashier at a local supermarket, stressed to hell, people yelling at her, badly paid, I even feel guilty that I have far better opportunities and I am not thankful for them, but pitchforking the ""best one""."
nrzw0a,1,2021-06-04,Academic path advice for working with NISQ machines?,SalvosMachina,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/nrzw0a/academic_path_advice_for_working_with_nisq/,"I am an undergrad studying comp-sci/physics.  I have one NSF REU internship where I studied machine learning and am currently working to coauthor/author more ML papers during my undergrad.  My dream is to do research at a firm like Google Quantum AI in Santa Barbara ([https://quantumai.google/learn/lab](https://quantumai.google/learn/lab)).

I want to research and work with NISQ machines, however, I feel my major path could leave me underdeveloped in the relevant chemistry for quantum computing (which I would like to be the focus of my Ph.D.).

Are there any recommended paths for filling in this gap to be able to obtain these kinds of research positions with only comp-sci/physics majors at this point in my academic career?  Or will I have better luck switching comp-sci for chem?

How should internships play into this?

If anyone has any knowledge related to these questions, I would really appreciate any advice.  Thank you."

I'm a political philosophy MA just about to finish my degree at a russel-group uni, and I have a dilemma.

I dont have family money to fall back on, so I've been working in schools as supply cover to support myself. Prior to this job, I'd worked as a barista for years, where my very short pink hair was not an issue. When I started going into schools however, I got rid of the pink and am now just a bottle blonde. 

I have some tattoos, but have been careful to keep them in easily hidden places, and have limited the amount of piercings (4 in each ear) I've had, all because I feel like I have to conform to a ""professional"" look, at least until I've built my CV up enough that I don't have to worry. 

As I'm coming to the end of my MA and applying for paid internships/ entry-level jobs in publishing, NGO and policy work, etc, I'm starting to feel really defeated and depressed about my appearance. Having pink hair and funky piercings and visible tattoos makes me feel like myself in a way I'm really sorely missing, and I don't see an end in sight where that's going to suddenly be easier for me to get away with. 

Does anyone in these sectors have advice on how to strike a good balance? Am I worrying too much about looking ""professional"", or do I need to give up on using my degree altogether and get a tattoo apprenticeship (i'm an artist and I have seriously considered this) so I can be more myself? 

I think I have really good ideas, and my professors have always agreed with me on that and encouraged me. I always earn high 2.1s and firsts, and I am published. I love to think and write and be taken seriously, and I hate that how I want to look could get in the way, but I also need to be realistic.

Help me please! Any advice or relevant experiences are welcome!"

My summer holiday is 9 weeks and I need to spend the break preparing and studying for my senior year and also writing my uni applications etc., but I also wanted to gain some experience before uni, hence why I wanted to intern somewhere.

Basically long story short, I told them I was hoping to do 3 weeks, and the manager said that they wouldn't take me because that would be a 'waste of their time'. I emailed again asking for the minimum, they said it was 6 weeks. So I replied saying that I would be able to do 6 weeks but asked if they could consider shortening my working hours from 8 hours to 7.5 hours since I am still a high school student and it is a 3.5-hour drive in total (back and forth is around 1hr and 40 each). I received a really sarcastic reply back from the manager last night basically saying that I was ungrateful, she then proceeded to call me a little princess, and said that I should never email her ever again.

I would really appreciate it if someone could tell me what went wrong. Was it rude of me to ask to shorten the hours?

I also realised that the manager whom I was emailing back and forth has really strong connections with my dream college. This won't hinder my chances of getting into the uni, right?

This situation is really bothering me and it was all I could think about last night, I could barely sleep because I am actually really upset about it. I really wanted to do this internship :("

I am about to enter my final year of BTech in Computer Science and I have really lousy grades with a CGPA of 7.1 as of the sixth semester. I study at a tier-3 private uni in India and I wanted to know how much of a shot I have at getting hired for an SDE role at a product-based company. I have close to zero hopes of getting hired on-campus with the kind of grades I have, and chances are, I won't even be eligible to apply to the handful of companies that come here.

I have skills in React and React Native and have completed some decent projects in the past year. I don't have any prior internships though and I am hoping I could make up for that through projects. I will, however, be applying for a summer internship next year and am eyeing companies like Postman, Hackerrank, Goldman Sachs, Uber, Walmart, and \*\*probably\*\* FANG if I can work my way to that level and I've even begun practicing Leetcode problems and will start interview prep soon. I am also open to startup options.

My original plan was to join a master's program in America after grad but that's not possible now for obvious reasons, so for now, I have made up my mind about working for a year before applying to any schools.

\*\*TLDR\*\*  I have pretty awful grades in college and was wondering if they could hurt my chances of getting hired by a decent product-based company. I have skills in web and app development and have completed some good projects."

Re-posting here in full as I think you guys will find them useful as well*

Tip 4 . . . Getting the most out of your engineering internship

The internship is over, but your connections shouldn't be. 

For many engineering students, aside from their classmates, professors, and family friends who are engineers, an internship is their first opportunity to make ""real"" network connections in the engineering field.

Once you've made these connections, it's important to MAINTAIN those connections. This is a key component to network development as you can't expect those people to support you when you suddenly pop back into their lives a few years later.

Therefore, take the time every few weeks/months to make sure you are keeping in touch. This can mean letting them know about a new course or perhaps how you applied something you learned during the internship.

It need not be much, but that little contact point can go a long way in keeping the connection alive.

In the end, you'll thank me down the road when you graduate and those people actually remember you.

**MBA Info**

* Why I want an MBA: I've struggled with the answer to this question. I've been working for just over 3 years now as a drilling engineer. I've had internships with service companies, and have worked full time for one of the largest PE-backed operator's in the Permian. I think it would be interesting to fully round myself out as an O&amp;G employee by landing a job with a PE that invests in oil ventures. I believe an MBA will help me do this. My main concern with this logic is sustainability of my industry is declining, and MBA schools may prefer someone going into sustainable energy. On that note, a second reason I want an MBA is to add a degree of freedom to my job prospects. With my undergrad, I'm pretty much pigeonholed to O&amp;G. 
* Why I want one now: I've climbed the ranks pretty quickly at my current role. Have gone from EIT to engineer 1, and now engineer 2, in 3 years time. Given the structure of the company I work at, I am essentially maxed out on career progression. My next step would be manager, and there are a few candidates ahead of me (with more experience) that would take that role. I've inquired about switching departments, but that is not an option. Now that I have some engineering experience under my belt, I feel like now is a good time to pursue an MBA and get into PE. I am planning on attending programs in Fall of 2022; I would have 4 years experience by the time I attend an MBA program.
* Target schools: UT Austin...open to other suggestions.
* Stretch schools: Ross, Fuqa, Darden
* Long Reach: Sloan, Haas

 

**Background**

* Work experience: I've touched on this earlier but will elaborate. My current role is drilling engineer 2. My role is a little atypical for a drilling engineer. I work a 10 days on / 4 days off schedule. Of my 10 days on, 3 are spent in the office where I develop programs for drilling future wells, create AFE's, post-mortem drilled wells, meet with vendors, and perform cost/efficiency analyses on various drilling ops. The other 7 days are spent in the field at a drilling rig, where I manage a team of 10 workers, and function as the lead wellsite supervisor. Much of my field work is logistics management, but when problems occur I have to think quickly and make the best decisions (both for safety and economics). My field work is revolving shift work. One week I work 6am-6pm, the other 6pm-6am. I am ready to get out of the field and into something more challenging. 
* Extra curriculars and other experience: Pretty poor here. I am part of a cycling team at work. We raise money for the MS150 and participate in some local races. I train 10-15hrs a week so this eats up most of my time. On my days off I'm either riding my bike or working on a 1985 Toyota Landcruiser project I have. 
* Undergrad school/major: Petroleum Engineering from top 5 petroleum program; top 50 undergrad engineering.
* Other education/coursework: Various classes for safety and drilling. I did take a Udemy course on C#, but wouldn't say I'm a C# wizard. 
* Race/nationality: White
* Sex: M

 

**Stats**

* GMAT Score: 700 (42 Q, 42 V, 7IR, haven't gotten AWA back yet). My studying was pretty lack luster. I decided I wanted to take the GMAT 2 months ago. Bought a study book and studied an hour a day for 5 days, then lost motivation and took a month off. Studied an hour a day for another 5 days, took some more time off. 5 days before my exam I studied probably 5-8hrs daily. Focused on quant only. Somehow I scored 96th percentile on V but 41st on Q. This is disappointing as historically I am much stronger in math. I imagine if I studied more I could boost my score up, but not sure if I really *need* to. 
* Undergrad GPA: Rounds up to a 3.6.

 **CLOSING THOUGHTS:** 

I have no debt. My total compensation right now is \~180K, but I hate where I live, and I hate my job. I've tried looking for other jobs; it's tough in the O&amp;G industry. The idea of taking on debt to get a degree where graduates make as much as I do is a bit concerning, but I imagine opportunity for growth is massive. I like the idea of being able to get out of O&amp;G, work a normal-ish schedule, and hold a job where I get to critically think a little more often. My biggest issue is coming up with an effective/interesting story as to why I want an MBA. I can't just tell schools I want to make good money while working a better schedule. I am genuinely interested in PE, but am concerned my story is weak. 

Any career suggestions for me? Are my schools attainable with my current GMAT score? I really like Duke, but feel like UT may make more sense given my work history, thoughts?. Any advice on coming up with a great/stronger story? Should I even get an MBA?

Thanks!"

So long story short I applied for a materials testing tech internship back in April. They got back to me the third week in May on a friday. They gave me an interview. It went ok but it was nothing special and I wasn’t able to meet with the hiring manager (associate principal) as she’s out in the field on the project busy and couldn’t join virtually. They didn’t get back to me so I called that following Tuesday and she said they had to interview one more applicant and then they would be making decisions that Wednesday. So Wednesday rolled by and Thursday did too so I called again. I spoke to HR and the hiring manager was out in the field and was still very busy and hadn’t made any decisions yet. So then I left it. They were closed Memorial Day so I called this past Tuesday and spoke to the office assistant who helped interview me with the HR lady (HR lady is on vacation. She said they made decisions and that the hiring manager would be calling people later this week to let them know and that before she extended the offer to some people she wanted to speak with them first. I would imagine it would be applicants like me who weren’t able to meet with her during the interview due to her being busy. Well it’s now Thursday two days later and still no call. I’m not optimistic at all right now and it sounds like they didn’t hire me. If they did though I still don’t know and I feel like my time is being wasted as I still don’t have a summer job and need to start looking for one ASAP. Should I just call it quits?"

However it isn’t paid. The other I applied to is a month internship leading a group of middle school kids on programming a rocket ship. My precal teacher recommend me for this and I’m sure that this one is paid. I have 3 weeks to hear back from both of these but in the event I get accepted into both, which do I choose?

ns85hp,26,2021-06-04,[UNI] Rejected by Big 3; served NS and took a gap year. What should I do now? Seeking urgent advice.,Classic-Doughnut8772,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ns85hp/uni_rejected_by_big_3_served_ns_and_took_a_gap/,"I am a mid 3.7x diploma holder in Social sciences with merit.

Prior enlistment, I have secured an UNI Offer. During my course of NS, my mental health deteriorated to the point I almost get PES F. Yeah it's that bad. Due to this, I didn't make use of my time in NS to think through what I really wanted to study at UNI. When I ORD, I realized that the course I secured initially isn't what I wanted. Thus, I rejected the offer, and took a gap year to apply again this year for my desired choice, which is Business. Yup, two years wasted.

However, I spent the majority of my gap year seeking mental health treatment, counselling and doing part time jobs like Grabfood to bolster my confidence. Therefore, I did not seek internships or whatsoever. Instead, I did online business courses in an attempt to boost my portfolio. Unfortunately, I did not apply via ABA because I couldn't find an appraisal. I guess I did the online courses for nothing? Thinking back I should have ABA-ed at the very least. Better than nothing haha....

So, now I got rejected by the Big 3. Not sure if my appeal outcome is still pending. I did not apply for other universities. I did not foresee the increase in competition due to Covid-19 and the strong emphasis on ABA (3.5x/3.7x GPA applicants got into Biz via ABA).

I am very disappointed and depressed now regardless haha. No mood to do anything. It is really crushing, especially when I have wasted two years by not applying in NS and not applying via ABA this year. My counselor (I.e. Still meeting my counselor)  thought I have bounced back but the rejections seems to put me back to square one haha.

I know many of you will probably disagree ,but I am hoping to try one LAST time next year to apply for the Universities, especially NTU Biz because it is only 3 years. The issue is,  to boost my chances, the best thing is to take business internships. But as mentioned, my mental health deteriorated again due to the rejections haha. Am pretty depressed. Looking back I wasted so much time and opportunities. I am questioning myself why did I even work so hard in Poly if this was coming. Identity crisis here haha! So I am not sure whether I can take on internships right now. But then again I don't have much time to waste. I have also lost quite a fair bit of motivation because the competition for places next year may be high too, so even If i take internships I might not get in. Just imagine, if I applied via ABA next year, the professors see an applicant who took 2 gap years with no meaningful work experience, lol. I doubt my chances will be high too right? Sure, I can continue to do online courses, but they can only get me to that far.

I understand many of you may be annoyed and think I will not be able to cope with Biz even If I miraculously get in due to my current condition, but I still want to try. But yet again my mental health issues may prevent me from doing anything meaningful this year again, which may result in another year wasted haha. Sounds frustrating right? Like I am so pampered/useless haha. But anyway next year is probably the last year I will be applying. My counselor also advised me to take internships but I don't think I will be able to find one immediately. Haha not sure what to tell him.

EDIT: I probably will be able to take internships haha. Just need slightly more time to calm down. I know the harsh truth is that I cannot afford to waste this gap year again like last year.

Thus I am seeking advice here. What should I do now? Apply again next year? Any other way to boost portfolio other than internships? Honestly the only work I can do properly now is only Grabfood, at least for now. I still have some savings to feed myself for quite a while though.

Btw guys, can I ask if SAF Personnel can be your appraisal for universities? haha.

Just wanted to see what options redditors will recommend to me here haha. You guys can be blunt or anything haha! I also need to accept reality here!

And yes! I have backup plans including SUSS or just work with a diploma. Just need time to get over my grief!

Thank you so much and good night."

For example Google is pretty close to me, but statistically speaking a 32 y.o. POC like me doesn't have as good of a chance at landing a job there compared to most of my peers, even though I feel sharper now than I've ever been.

  One discouraging thing was to see that all of my peers from my study group got internships this summer but I didn't. I don't think I'm the best out there but I tutor, I'm a T.A., I have just as good grades as them (we're all around 3.7 gpa), and we have the same projects since we worked together among them. Yet I got no internship even though I filled out around 600 applications and none of them filled out more than 100. We all tailored our resumes the same way (from the same person's advice). Maybe this is coincidence, but also maybe not. Maybe they saw my LinkedIn picture and that was all... Either way I'm still really happy for them. I want all my friends to look good and succeed!
 
  I know there's a chance I'll need to work harder and preform  better than my peers for the same praise and I'm ready for that. But are there any late starters/POC here that can share some advice?"

In the end I talked to HR and they said I shouldn't worry too much as they are currently looking for a replacement and the project is actually done, just that there are minor bug fixes that needs to be done.

I have since been relocated to a different team with no specific mentor. They said I would be working like an ad-hoc and that I would help anyone that needs help

The project manager lately has been assigning me tasks with very close deadlines (usually the deadline is no more than 5 days) where I need to make a feature with existing components from different page. As I am very new to the code, I am pretty slow with work and he basically guilt tripped me into working over time, and being the dumb fuck I am I did. He said something along the lines of ""you made the decision to intern at a start up, you should know what you're doing, it's normal to work over time at startups""

If you're wondering where are the other software engineers, they are working on a long term project that completely revamps the website

So ok, I understand having to work over time to meet a deadline, as there's supposedly no other person who could tackle this task. What bothers me is that this particular supervisor keeps on assigning task with short deadlines to me and I can't keep up at this point and it has gotten so bad that for me to keep up, I would have to work ON THE WEEKENDS (even my supervisor acknowledged this fact, and he was the one who suggested it) 

This is clearly overstepping the boundaries but I don't know how to respond. I really want to approach this in a professional manner and maintain a positive relation with the people within the company. 

I appreciate any advice, thanks!"

I’m so upset cause I have put so much into my education, I wanted to be higher on the totem pole, but I’m still entry level. I have friends who got a position mostly because they knew someone or their search was great. 

Now that I have given up on my dreams as an engineer. I want to move into a higher level at my position or at another company.

A little background first.  This is a story from my very first IT job as an intern on the service desk at a hospital.  This was basically just a call center for Tier1 support although we did have permissions in order to fix lots of different stuff (must go fast when working with doctors as it's always LIFE OR DEATH with them, ok not all the time but you get my point).  I had just finished my couple weeks of training and had shadowed someone for several days.  This was within my first week of actually answering phones and I think it was my first couple of days even.  Ok on with the show!

Players:

$me = Yours truly, $N = Nurse 

me: IT this is righteousranger, how can I help you today?

N: I can't get into Citrix

me: Let's see if we can get that fixed for you.

This issue happened all the time and usually it only takes a few minutes to resolve.  I made a little small talk, ran through the KB, kicked the user's connection, everything looked as it should, and go to end call.

me: Ok I think that's got you set, just give it a few minutes and you should be able to log right in!

N: Ok thanks! click.

\-a few minutes later-

N (calling back): Hi I still can't get into my Citrix?!

me: I'm very sorry about that, give me just a second to get my detailed process pulled up so I can get this resolved for you.

N: Dont you just hit a button and it's fixed???? (obviously irritated) 

me: uh no ma'am ~~I'm not a wizard~~ that's unfortunately not how it works.  Give me just a minute and we'll get this sorted.

Cue me frantically asking for help while on mute because I couldn't find the solution in the KB's and had never run into this issue before.  We finally got her up and running but it required a remote session to the computer to end all related processes/connections and a reboot for good measure.  My colleagues got a good laugh because of me and I gained a lot of experience."

nsc90f,9,2021-06-04,Should I transfer out of USC?,DirtyDreb,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/nsc90f/should_i_transfer_out_of_usc/,"For context, I spent 1 year at my community college before transferring to USC. I was accepted as a spring 2021 transfer student with junior standing due to my AP credits. During my time at USC, I found my true passion for data analytics and machine learning. For my new career aspirations in data science, I will most likely have to get a masters degree in order to secure a job. I am now contemplating going back to community college for a year in order to transfer to a UC school.

I am thinking about leaving USC for 3 reasons: high cost, lack of value in new major, and my lack of data analytic skills. Firstly, in tuition and living expenses, I will be paying (at absolute minimum) $25k per year for the next 2 years. In contrast, the plethora of UC schools will likely provide me with free tuition and a few grand to help with my cost of living, so around 9k per year for 2 years. I used to be fine with taking on loans, but I am now scared due to my need for additional graduate schooling after I finish USC. With my $30k in the bank, I can likely get through UC undergrad and graduate school with minimum loans. On the contrary, I will leave USC undergrad with significant loans/debt.Additionally, the major I am switching into, applied mathematics, lacks the valuable resources of USC's business school, thus making the cost of USC even less appealing. Finally, I severely lack relevant skills and experience in data analytics despite the fact that I am entering into my junior year. I am trying to learn as fast as possible, but I feel like I am behind my peers thus making internship really difficult to secure. A year at community college would allow me to secure my footing and catch up with my peers.

I love USC, but I am not obsessed with it. It now lacks the value proposition that it used to have for me. I am known to overthink things especially when it comes to money, so I would love to hear other perspectives on my issue."

Basically I got a software developer job at a company I interned for in the past. When i was an intern i did nothing related to code, I mostly helped gathering requirements for a project. they loved me and told me to come back in the future for a job. I saw that they had an opening for software developer and figured I'd apply even tho I didn't feel qualified. I've never been very good at programming and always needed help with my projects, but i figured I should let the company decide whether or not I'm qualified instead of just not applying at all. The behavioral interviews went great, I'm a great communicator and I love talking to people. I kind exaggerated how I like programming, which isn't a total lie because I do like it but I just haven't practiced enough to be very good and i feel like I haven't proven to myself that I could be a real programmer yet. Anyways they moved me onto the second wave of interviews(the technical interview), and basically only asked me about the firmware projects on my resume, which of course was easy to explain because I already did them. These were school projects which involved a lot of outside help and were often group projects. during the interview I made it clear that I did not know any of the languages that were in the job description but a week later I got a call and they told me I had the job!!

I accepted it and was super excited but now that I've started I'm terrified that I could be fired for not being a good enough programmer. Managers said i could learn on the job but omg what if i can't learn fast enough? AHHHH advice please. kinda sorta panicking."

After graduation in one year I want to relocate back to near Atlanta where I am from, and was really looking to transfer to a facility in the area that is run by my current company.

However, the facility is smaller and has had no open positions for a while...so it would make me very anxious to stake everything on getting transferred only to graduate with no positions open in the plant and then have to scramble to find employment.

In my anxiety thinking about this I decided to start applying to random places and just keep applying throughout senior year in hopes of getting other offers.

Next day I by some odd circumstance got called for an interview for a position as a PLC Technician Engineer making $30/hr (60k/yr) basically doing the exact same thing I am doing now. They said I do not have to do mechanical work or even code the PLCs...just troubleshoot them and keep them running...for 60k/yr...which essentially means I will be doing 75% the work I do as an intern now for double the pay.

The only thing is that this job is close to Atlanta so I would have to move ASAP, and is an hour from the area I really wanted to live in moving back. I only have 4 classes left to graduate but have not even started my senior year and still have a one year lease going on my current apartment. This would not be an issue if the start date was later, but the HR person said that they would likely only be able to wait a month max before I would need to begin working.

There's a lot of factors here so I am just hoping for advice on what I should pursue if they do choose to offer me this position.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to share my experience and see if others are having similar experiences.


## My background:

I have 4 internships: two at Northrop Grumman, a startup on campus and New Technologist program at Microsoft. I'm a CE student from UCSD and graduated in March. This doesn't matter anymore because I have a BS, but I didn't graduate high school and dropped out.


## Salary expectations

I've had 3 offers: 83K + 5K sign on bonus, $75K and $70K. I've rejected all of these because my friends have jobs at $120K, $110K and they had worse grades and went to slightly lower ranked schools. I'd be happy to match my first offer at this point.


## My job search experience so far

I've had 50+ interviews, I no longer get anxious before an interview, however depression is at an all time high and it's hard to focus studying algorithms, db, data structures, design patterns, etc. due to not understanding why I'm getting low offers/ denials. Some days I get 6 rejection emails a day. Large companies have rejected me without an interview even though I'm applying to new graduate positions. I've done well on assessments, I have 250 questions completed on leetcode and can do most easy/mediums relatively quick.

&amp;#x200B;
I kind of regret not taking my highest offer just to be done.


### UPDATE:

After 2 months of looking I am tired. I asked for my old offer back in DevOps (3 weeks after rejecting) and they gave me it! They also bumped it up to 91K. It is 2000 miles away from where I live currently and I'll have to be long distance with my GF so this factored into my hesitancy as well.

I wish everyone great success in finding their next job."

I'm a Computer Science Erasmus student who will be in Cork during the next university year. I was looking for an internship where I can work on my Final Year Project, and to possibly keep working there after I'm done studying.

I was wondering if I could get any help on that from locals. I was excited about joining a big tech company like Apple or Google but these don't seem to have actual engineering jobs (mainly administration), and most of them seem to be at Dublin, rather than Cork (though I could reallocate after finishing). I'm also seeing a ton of ML/AI/... jobs, but I was trying to find something with systems programming (Rust/C/C++) if possible, or just any kind of Software Engineering, really.

Are there any companies in Cork known for being great to recently graduated students? Any platform/resources that could be of use? Or any advice you could give me overall? Thanks!"

Currently I’m on summer break and I’m basically doing two internships where I go to one place for 3 days out of the week to learn about Enterprise Networking and IT infrastructure and another place for 2 days out of the week which is at a computer repair shop to learn about computer hardware and the basics of how computers actually work. This internship is the only one that I’ve been able to obtain before graduation.

I’m enjoying my internship so far, but I was just wondering about the true importance of certifications. My supervisor is really encouraging me and other interns to get our CCNA and dedicate multiple hours at home studying for it (he said 5-6 hours). Even though I’m learning about it now, I’m not guaranteeing that I want to be in Networking as a full career just yet cause I just started the internship last week. Also my supervisor and the people that work with him are always mentioning that certifications are important and that if I can get some, then I’ll have no issues getting a job. 

But my ultimate question is that is there anyone here who has a degree and some experience and just learned on the job and worked their way up without certs and/or extensive self study?

By the time I graduate, I'll have had three internships and will be in a pretty good position to go straight into industry — unless I take a professor up on his offer to complete a Master's degree instead.

Specifically, this would be a 5th year masters, going from Fall 2022 to Spring 2023 (leaving Spring 2022 open for whatever), so I'd only be paying half as much as I would for a normal Master's. Normally I know the 'conventional wisdom' is that a Master's does little to help your career, especially when you already have a CS degree + internships; my hope, however, is that this would allow me to get into fields of work that would otherwise be unavailable to me. In particular, I'm really not the best at anything even remotely 'high-level', including both frontend and backend development: I tend to be more interested in OS/kernel/embedded systems/etc, which is (broadly) what I would be studying.

As much as I'd love to take this opportunity, especially given how lucky I am to have both the offer and the means (both financial and otherwise) to be able to see it through, I can't stop thinking about the 'conventional wisdom': just how much would this set my career back? Would graduating with a Master's just end up with me competing with regular new grads for the same jobs as if I just graduated now, or would it actually give me access to new areas of work / allow me to 'jump the queue' to any extent?

Any advice would be much appreciated!"

nshwvm,2,2021-06-04,Java GUI project?,pablopistachioo,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/nshwvm/java_gui_project/,"So I took a DS and Algo class in Java in Spring semester. But I wanted to make a project using the Java GUI along with a DBMS. 

Basically my question is that is a project which is based on DS and Algo better than making a project based on the Java GUI solely? I mean what would look better on resume? Also I am a rising sophomore in college so just wanted to know because I am aiming for Summer 2022 internships :)

nsioe3,4,2021-06-04,tech interview prep?,legendarysandy,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/nsioe3/tech_interview_prep/,"Hey Everyone,

I'm currently a rising sophomore in my undergrad and preparing for my technical interviews for the upcoming internship recruiting season. However, I'm a bit overwhelmed technical interview prep and classes at university don't really help with that.

Basically, I'm practicing doing implementations of various data structures in Python, and self-learning coding interview patterns like DFS, BFS, etc. However, I don't really have a consistent routine or roadmap.

How did y'all go about preparing for technical interviews and stay disciplined to practice everyday? What study techniques proved the most useful, and why?

I'm also confused on how to learn about Dynamic Programming, so would like some direction on how to get starting learning that.

Thanks!"

I am a junior in college studying Computer Engineering, and I want to take on some sort of project to make myself stand out to recruiters for when I apply for internships. Using a TI LaunchPad, I plan on making a motion sensor using a pir sensor module, jumper wires, LEDs, resistors, and a Buzzer. However, I am a bit worried that this project would be ""too simple"" for me to stand out, or that it wouldn't even be worth mentioningin an interview or something. Any thoughts or suggestions?

nsjfxd,0,2021-06-04,Is it worth taking this as my first internship?,wakemeupoh,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nsjfxd/is_it_worth_taking_this_as_my_first_internship/,"So I am a third year CS major and got my first interview for a small printing company to help the owner maintain their code for an ordering form using Javascript. The interview was very simple; he sat me down and showed me the code. The code is written and hosted using a third party site. From what I saw, it was written in a text box in plain text on the same website. I do not believe there are any backups. 

My worries are 1. The code looks like a headache to try to maintain and I am worried that there are no backups. 2. I would like to try to innovate his website using the MERN stack (I built my own personal project website using this stack) but I don't think he would be open to let me try. 3. He wants someone who can work there until graduation (I would not do that even if I had the job but it adds to the baggage). 4. I am a third year without an internship so time is getting tight 5. He was not prepared for the interview at all (didn't let me explain what was on my resume or talk about myself and he admitted to not looking at my resume).

I don't want my pride to get in the way of me taking the job because I didn't like how he didn't let me express myself during the interview but the job looks so unorthodox in terms of coding practices that I think even if I took the job for 3 months I wouldn't be able to talk about it for long if I put it on my resume. But I also don't want to miss being able to have it on my resume since I know how hard jobs are to get. My alternative is probably to make another MERN type website for my summer project and maybe learn a new framework. The job is 8-16 hours a week at a little above minimum wage but I have to commute. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks guys!"

Today I was setting up a public GitHub repo and accidentally pushed a file with credentials that were exposed. Almost immediately, my manager notified me that my repo caused sensitive information to leak and someone outside was able to access our account within the 10 minutes that I pushed to GitHub. 

I deleted the repo and now he said the security team is working to figure out what all information was compromised. Now I have a 1 on 1 with my manager on Monday to review the incident. 

Has anyone done anything similar or as bad in their first week of an internship? How much trouble could I be in?"
nsk36r,2,2021-06-04,Unemployed for a long time :) Feel stuck and like a failure :) Don’t know what to do :),throwawayadhdsos,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/nsk36r/unemployed_for_a_long_time_feel_stuck_and_like_a/,"I was diagnosed with ADHD as a senior in college over 5 years ago. After graduating, I dropped the ball on refilling my meds, partly because I felt an unshakable sense of shame in having to rely on them at all. 

Aaaaand I’m now in my late 20s and have been unemployed for a long time. I had brief work-study jobs and internships in college. After graduating, I had one job for several months (I was a valued employee but had to be laid off). Then... a huge gap in my resume. Then I briefly did some consulting work (thanks to a contact). And that’s it. As much as I tried, I couldn’t finish job applications without meds. So I’ve never held a steady job and my resume is bleak. 

A few months ago, I finally went to my doctor and got back on meds. I hate myself so much for not doing this sooner. With meds, I’m actually able to get some things done. They don’t give me more energy, hyperfocus, or anything like that. They just let me focus a bit better. Without meds, it's like my impulsive thoughts/reactions/habits and my conscious mind are in a constant tug-of-war battle over the reins of my brain. 

I'm still no paragon of executive functioning, but it is better now. But I wonder if I lack experience and professional references to get a decent job. I want a job with a living wage, that I can either make into a career or use towards a career, and that's compatible with my brain (I'm prone to messing up in repetitive """"low-skill"""" jobs, and I do really well in jobs that involve some creativity or regular learning). 

I think I'm too unimpressive for most jobs that would be ok for me, including entry level jobs. I don't see a way out of this and am honestly scared for my future.

Sorry for the long post. I just don’t know what to do. Has anyone been in a similar situation? If so, how did you get out of it? Do you have any recommendations? Also, it seems like most people in ADHD subs have some sort of career path by their late twenties, even if they don't have meds. Meanwhile, I'm unemployed and living with my mom. Could this be a ""me"" problem and not an adhd problem?"
nskek9,1,2021-06-04,[Profile Review] Apple Engineer -&gt; MBB | 3.25 | 760 | 25M,mba_throwaway_x,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/nskek9/profile_review_apple_engineer_mbb_325_760_25m/,"Hi all,

Thanks for taking the time to submit some feedback on my profile review.

**Work Experience:**

* 4 month co-op / semester internship at Tesla while in undergrad
* 2.5 years as a non-SWE engineer at Apple
   * Focused on Machine learning within operations
   * One promotion
* 2 years as generalist AC/BA at MBB by the time of matriculation
   * Focused on manufacturing, supply chain, product strategy, and private equity due diligence
   * Not expecting any promotions by the time I matriculate

**Background and Stats:**

* 26M / Half Asian + Half White
* Top 10 Engineering School (G-Tech, Michigan, UIUC, etc.)
   * 3.25 GPA in Mechanical Engineering, considering mentioning some of the issues I had during school that drove the poor GPA (1 aunt and 1 uncle died within 3 months of each other causing a really bad semester)
* 760 GMAT (49Q / 44V)

**Extracurriculars:**

* In school: Leader of subsystem team for formula racecar and member of robot fighting team
* Position on associate board for sustainability non-profit as well as a good amount of volunteering time logged
* At work: On committee for planning company events in the office at MBB, thinking of joining some more
* Boxed for 4 years

**Post-MBA Goals:**

* Worst part of my application as I don't have a story or clear goal right now
   * Thinking maybe PE/HF and if I fail recruiting, back to MBB
* Really just want to build a solid network, have fun for about 2 years, etc. - I understand the opportunity cost but I think it's still worth it

**Targets:**

* H/S/W
* Literally no clue about R1 vs R2

**References:**

* Senior Manager / Associate Partner at MBB that went to HBS
* Director at Apple (about 4 below Tim Cook)
* TBD on the third, probably someone else at MBB

**Strengths/Weaknesses (in my opinion - feel free to correct):**

Strengths: GMAT, Work History, UG (maybe?), references

Weaknesses: GPA (albeit in engineering with personal issues), and unclear story for why MBA and post MBA goals- which is know is arguably the most important part of the entire application (open to suggestions!)

Thanks in advance for taking a look and providing feedback. And let me know if you have any question or if I'm missing something :)"
nskole,4,2021-06-04,Should I go for interviews after accepting my first job?,LastGuardz,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/nskole/should_i_go_for_interviews_after_accepting_my/,"I graduated recently and applied to all the possible entry and intern positions, most of the replies were negative but I still got some interview offers and accepted one of the jobs, all is done now, signed the contract and have started working. The problem is that I am still getting new interview offers and some of them are from good companies, should I accept and go for it or just tell them that I already got a job. Also I should mention that I didn't do a real interview, like leetcode and such for the job that I accepted and it is tempting to go for some real coding interviews."
nskpqu,2,2021-06-04,"I can't graduate until I have 2 internships or a job/double block internship, but many jobs won't take me because I'm still in school technically. Advice?",LamFGC,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/nskpqu/i_cant_graduate_until_i_have_2_internships_or_a/,"Hi, title explains my situation pretty well. I'm in my final year of college but we're required to have 2 internships, or a double block internship and jobs can count for that as well. One big issue is that it needs to be related to my degree (Game Design &amp; Development, yes I know I'm in an oversaturated field please don't lecture me on that lmao) so it can be in that specific field or something tangential like computer science, etc. However, a lot of places don't seem to want to hire me because I'm not done with school fully, even though the only thing barring me from being done officially is completing this requirement. I'm also worried that my skillset might not be enough for some of these internships or jobs because I've applied to a decent amount and never heard back from that company. Any tips or tricks to help me with this? I'm scared out of my mind to begin paying back my student loans and I don't even have a stable source of income to work with there."

nslnvl,1,2021-06-04,What should I do next?,Naren_Drip_Modi,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/nslnvl/what_should_i_do_next/,"Hi ! everyone

I'm currently in my final semester of my commerce graduation degree I have done some internships during the course 

Apart from that I have learnt R programming and statistics 

I have also given CS1 from ifoa 

Some courses from sites like Udemy in R , excel 

My college is ending so I need some advice what to do 

I have applied for jobs given interviews as well due to Covid results are awaited 

I want to study further but I'm confused whether I should go with actuarial science I have given exam once but failed with 1 mark and current exam's result is awaited 

Or I should go with finance I'm good at economics and if the first one didn't go well I might do a master's in same 

Basically what I want is  job in finance , economics , actuarial field 
I am learning trading too 

Due to all this I'm confused 

What should I do?"

So I'm interning at this big name bank, let's call it C, this summer. This bank sends me some lenova laptop from 2014 earlier this week and it's mandatory for us to work on this tiny laptop (my current laptop is so much better but I am not allowed to work on it)
I decided to buy a monitor+keyboard+mouse for this laptop bc I'm not used to working on such a small screen and just make sure I'm doing my best at this internship.
I'm added to some of the other interns on social media and one of them just posted stories of getting a whole ass set up? Like laptop+keyboard+mouse the whole deal that I'm spending money on

Idk i feel a bit salty about this....i know it's petty
Should i possibly email them about this?

ALSO SIDE NOTE: I don't come from a well off family, I'm on like substantial aid, that's why spending money for me on things I didn't have to bothers me so much."

For the first year, I learned English and spent another two years in community college, and this year is the first year as a Computer Science major.

Since I learned only basic courses from the previous college(like math and science), I do not really have any experience that related to computer science.

So my resume looks horrible even I'm in Junior year. This spring I took programming 2 course which is about Java, but I am not even sure I can put the course projects I've done on my resume.

Only thing I can show off is my grade, but I know that does mean nothing when I apply for an internship or job. 

I want to ask you guys what should I focus on for getting an internship? Also, since the Summer internship chances are passed, is that okay to having internship as a senior?

Thank you for reading this. Hope you guys have a great day."

The company's backend is extremely wrapped and backend development mainly consist of writing Java to use their internal libraries. Their front end development is basically just drag and drop using internal technologies the company has developed or a proprietary React-like library the company developed. During my internship I talked to managers and employees - some said they wouldn't recommend new grads starting here for those previously mentioned reasons while others said that it would be a good environment to experience the full SDLC and learn design principles. (One entry level engineer even mentioned that her senior level mentor would gather up the younger developers and try to teach them how similar features are actually implemented in most other companies).

I've talked to others in the industry that say every large tech company is like that and has huge amounts of abstraction and wrapping since its necessary to maintain control and standardization. I do feel extremely grateful to have a job, but I'm just worried that the only technical skill I can say I gained experienced with in this position is Java and that my future employment opportunities will be limited -- but I'm not sure if my worries are valid. Would it be better for me to continue looking for other employment opportunities that use more widely used technologies instead?"
nsoh1w,30,2021-06-05,A mini guide to choosing your college if you want to become an actuary,_spoonerism_,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/nsoh1w/a_mini_guide_to_choosing_your_college_if_you_want/,"#A guide to picking your college

You're just done with high school, or you're about to be. You want to head into actuarial science because you find it a cool field where you can apply the math you're really good at, you like the intersection of business with stats/math/CS and dig the vibe, you want something relatively low pressure, and I don't know, maybe there'$ other rea$on$.

So you're trying to pick your colleges. Odds are even after all the pizzazz about this being the hottest damn job in the world, your parents and college counselor still think you're trying to say ""actually"", so you're not entirely sure where to aim for.

I wrote this up because I really wish I read something along these lines way back then.

##Where do you want to work?

This applies especially to any international students stumbling upon this, because anywhere's gonna have the daunting visa crap knocking at your door and bringing you back to reality real quick at the end of your studies.

[Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/after-graduation.html) has a pretty generous policy of upto 3 years I believe, followed by the [UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-announces-2-year-post-study-work-visa-for-international-students) with upto 2 years. For international students in the US, they have a 1-year OPT (+2 years for STEM students I think?) but you're going to need to land a job of some sort in the first 3 months to be eligible for the rest of the period. Right after that you'll need to aim to get an H1B, look at h1bdata.info to get an idea of which companies are most likely to sponsor you.

Some European countries like France, Germany and the Netherlands have periods of 1-1.5 years, and since the Netherlands has a large portion of its population that can speak English, it might be something you want to look into.

[Australia](https://www.idp.com/australia/international-student-services/temporary-graduate-visa-485/#:~:text=The%20temporary%20graduate%20visa%20(subclass,which%20stream%20you%20apply%20for.) and [New Zealand](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/apply-for-a-visa/about-visa/post-study-work-visa) are quite generous too, with an Australian visa allowing up to 4 years while a NZ visa allows up to 3 years of work.

But these are considerations for any sort of job I'm sure. As for the markets themselves, there's interesting threads like [these](https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/jq2tu6/where_are_the_big_life_insurance_companies_located/) that give somewhat of an indication of what you should be looking for. Outside of the US the big English-speaking ones I can think of are Canada, Australia, South Africa, and the UK (esp. London, ofc). English is sort of compatible with The Netherlands at a few spots too I'm sure. I've also heard that working in the Arabian Gulf countries may be something too for the pay at least. Bunch of threads I found: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/mklv7p/which_country_has_more_job_opportunities_at_the/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/mchvya/to_those_who_have_worked_in_multiple_countries/) [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/a44x4l/which_cities_are_actuaries_in_your_country_most/) [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/i7u5ul/what_are_the_best_countries_for_an_american_expat/) [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/j7kha9/moving_across_countries/) [6](https://old.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/mcstcd/how_hard_it_is_to_get_overseas_jobs/)

There may be some good discussion on the actuarial outpost, or whatever's left of it.

##So What Do I Look For In A Degree?

Full disclosure, this post is written with the assumption that you'll be seeking work right after. If you're interested in pursuing a MS/PhD or heading into actuarial academia, you might find only a few things useful. And goals can change, so there's that.

The things I should've focused on when choosing my undergrad program were:

1. Overlap of the curriculum with your actuarial exam path (see 'Exam Exemptions' below): I can't tell how much of a boost this can give your application when you apply for internships and later full-time positions.
2. Career preparation: This not only applies to the whole university's career center, but to its actuarial program specifically. To gauge your chance of landing something at a certain university, scour LinkedIn to see how graduates or even current students of the university have been faring. To any international students who intend to stay back in the country to work - this is super important. Also look into universities that have co-op programs, which are programs that allow you to work for a semester or even a year and come back to finish up your studies. Even after all these years I can't stop wanting to kick myself for turning down an offer from a university that included a co-op program.
3. Strength of relevant departments: Actuarial science is at the intersection of multiple fields, like mathematics, statistics, economics, business and computer science. The faculty and research should help you gauge if the university would be satisfactory from an academic point of view. If there's a department specific to actuarial science, that's always a plus - especially if you have any credentialed actuaries who've got the practical know-how alongside the theory they're teaching (this can go a long way!) Universities with strengths across these departments could also allow you to branch your knowledge out and can make a switch easier too.
4. A thriving student culture: I don't mean the ""party school"" vibe with this, but you should look for a place with a lively atmosphere and ample opportunities for leadership. As you'll find out soon after graduation, communication means the world in this profession, even more so if you land a job in consulting. You'll need to work and build rapports with people, and there's no better place to get your feet wet than through a campus organization.

##Exam Exemptions

Some sources by country to help out with figuring out which uni's help out most with the exam process:

- USA/Canada: The [Society Of Actuaries (SOA) has a list of universities](https://www.soa.org/institutions/) in the world (but especially geared towards the US) based on the level of preparation they offer students to become actuaries. CAEs, or the Centers of Actuarial Excellence, is what you should be aiming for if you want the best of the best in this respect. It also helps hugely that students established CAEs are now eligible to earn credit for their exams through college courses (look up UEC) so you'll make way more progress towards earning the SOA's coveted ASA by the time you graduate. 
- UK: The IFoA, the UK's equivalent to the SOA, has their own list of universities whose courses they accept in place of their own exams. I'm not too familiar with the IFoA exam system except that theirs are all written-answer while the SOA's are mostly multiple choice, but it's still great to be ahead of the game. I also believe the IFoA's a bit more generous with their exam credit policy, so you'd see way more peeps in that system getting AIA'd by graduation. 
- Germany^1 : The DAV is the German SOA. The cool thing about this (and the IFOA too I think?) is a policy about mutual recognition throughout the EU, so if you're a fellow in one of the member countries, you're recognized as a fellow in all. Again, their society has [a list of universities,](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://aktuar.de/Dateien_extern/DAV/Vorlesungen_Zertifzierung_auf_PO_III.pdf) specifically university courses, that they recognize in place of their exams.

^1 not as common but holy fuck the universities here are free

##Some Solid Spots

Here's a few universities around the world I would recommend to look into (all in random order):

***USA***: 

1. UIUC - they're next door to the SOA, and if I remember right they've got more than a few research-related collabs
2. U Michigan - they're quite a powerhouse, and have an option to get a bachelor's plus a master's in a short timeframe if that's something you want to do
3. Purdue - these guys also have a co-op program
4. NYU (Columbia has a master's but I'm not sure if they have a suitable undergraduate degree?)
5. UCSB (I was gonna add UCLA but I heard they laid off the actuaries in their faculty a while back so)
6. U Penn/Wharton - this is a reach as always but it's worth a shot for the brand I guess? Plus if you want to do something more business-y later on
- Honorable mentions to UWisconsin and UNebraska.

***Canada***:

1. U Waterloo - like Purdue, this has a co-op program too. Arguably the best place to study actuarial science in Canada if not North America, all things considered.
2. U Toronto - another CAE, and quite a well known name too. Their stats department is top-notch too.
- Honorable mentions to McGill, York and Concordia.

***UK***:

1. University of Kent - really accelerates your progress on IFoA exams, plus it has an option to work a year in industry
2. London School Of Economics - applying to Penn in the US would be akin to applying to LSE here.
3. Uni Warwick - This uni's math department and business school are quite solid, I've heard.
4. Uni Manchester
5. Cass Business School, City U of London - Like Kent, it really accelerates your progress, but the living expenses, like the LSE, may do a number on you. Still, the opportunities while at the heart of London are unmissable I'm sure.
- Honorable mentions to Unis of Southampton, Heriot-Watt and Leicester.

***Asia/Pacific***:

I'll be honest I'm not very knowledgeable about this area, but here's some from what I've always generally heard-

1. U Hong Kong - a CAE *and* a path to finishing off most of your IFoA requirements should you choose to go that way. A double whammy. Not sure about the situation there though.
2. Nanyang Technological University (Singapore) - I'm not sure if this is as prestigious as the neighboring NUS, but it's still no slouch.
3. Australian National University
4. Uni Melbourne
- Honorable shout-outs to UNSW and Chinese U of Hong Kong.

***Rest of Europe:***

I can vaguely remember a few unis off the top of my head, like the universities of Paris, Leuven, Ulm, Maastricht, Zurich etc but not enough to recommend with as much confidence as the ones above. Still, please consider these as an option as they are way, way cheaper than American, Canadian, British and Australian universities while still generally providing a solid education. I remember reading about a list of programs on Risk.Net, but wasn't sure if those were for actuarial science or quant finance.

I'm not well-versed with universities of any other country or region - sorry about that. 

##Conclusion

So yeah, those are my thoughts on picking a university and a country. You'll need to think of the strengths of the related departments, the ease of immigration and finding work in the region of the university and the country in general, and the progress you can make towards your credential with the help of the university. And the fees too.

Edit 2: please don’t take my advice as law. Any advice I give is just coming from my experiences and asking a lot of questions recruiters and engineers. Your school probably has visiting recruiters or engineers too. Just bite the bullet and talk to them. Or your university alums via LinkedIn. They’re just people. 

Edit: some questions are repetitive! Here’s some repeated answers:

- I didn’t do a metric ton of leetcodes.

Very adjusted towards what I wasn’t familiar with. Yes mostly DSA. Heavily refreshed my big o

- LUCK. With all the talented competition, you’d gotta be in space to think that luck isn’t in the equation.

- please stop asking about TC. 
- no more resumes please.
- I did not hear back after final rounds until I reached back to my recruiter a few weeks later. 
- I had a competing offer so that did speed things up post-final rounds
- i didn’t  graduate from an elite/pipeline school. My gpa was about a 3.3 when I applied. I have w’s on my transcript.

- I did not have a referral

- I took leadership with an academic club in my school

- 1 internship with an f500 company, nowhere near being a tech giant

- no personal projects listed. Just major projects done in uni

- iirc onsite problems were like mediums + dummy hard

-  weeks between stages. Reach out to ask about your application status if you’re feeling nervous or forgotten  

- be talkative with ur tech interviewers. They may or may not know the language you’re using. Make sure they know what you’re doing— or trying to do if your code skill doesn’t catch up. Nothing worse than if your interviewer doesn’t know what you’re doing and you don’t finish. Let them know your thinking process."

nsuwcu,0,2021-06-05,How should I approach my MS project? Any Advice?,SS_Academics,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/nsuwcu/how_should_i_approach_my_ms_project_any_advice/,"I am a final year MS student working in Data Science + Quantum Computing.

My project is titled:

"" Applying Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to Experimental NMR Quantum  Computing Data.  This project will apply ANNs to measured data from NMR quantum computing  experiments and come up with a learning tool for entanglement  characterization and gate optimization in systems of three and four qubits.""

Part 1 of the project :

Quantum Entanglement is nothing but a statistical correlation between the various features of 2 or more particles. Basically, you can model those various features as random variables, and then if there's a certain type of statistical correlation between those random variables, those particles having those features are considered to be entangled.

I have to design a neural network that can learn how to characterize the data and figure out if there's entanglement in the data or not.

Part 2 of the project :

Like how you can make logic gates using classical bits, you can do the same with qubits. I am given a certain number of qubits, and for a particular operation, I have found the logic gate operation optimized for a certain feature. Many features can be optimized, such as Error rate, efficiency, energy consumption, space occupied by the logic gates.

So far, my plan is as follows :

1. Learn and Practice Machine learning algorithms - for that, I am doing Andrew NG's ML course on Coursera.
2. Learn and Practice Neural Networks - For that, I am doing the deep learning specialization offered by Andrew Ng on Coursera.
3. Revise Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Information and Spectroscopy. - So that I can understand the problem better.
4. IBM Quantum Developer certification using Qiskit - Since the gates developed would be used to carry out a certain Quantum Algorithm, I think it's better to know what kind of algorithms willseveralBut run on the logic gates developed.
5. Apart from all this, I am doing courses on Brilliant to improve my understanding of ML, NN, and QC.

For Part 1 :

A.  I have thought of a Machine learning approach - Specifically Supervised learning - Designing a linear classifier for characterizing entanglement. But I don't have the labeled training data set currently.

B. Supposing the data set I am given is not labeled, then I can use Unsupervised learning - Clustering algorithms to figure out the labels and then check them myself.

For Part 2 :

I have not even begun to think about it. but I am open to ideas.

Overall my basic approach is that :

for Part 1 :

I will design an NN that can figure out statistical correlations on its own and sort data based on that, and also make ML algorithms that can also do the same and then modify it to work for the Quantum Computing problem.

For Part  2 :

I will design an NN that can generate logic gate combinations for a specific truth table under various optimizations like size, a number of logic gates, error rate, etc., and then again modify it to fit the quantum computing case.

But apart from this, I still feel a bit lost about the project as it's taking me a lot of time to understand things and get stuff done. I have not been able to talk with my Project supervisor because of time clashes; when I get time, I'll also ask her this. But an outsider perspective can be helpful sometimes.

How I've set the schedule for myself is that I'll be working on the Physics/Maths/Coding part of the project and try to learn as much as possible but on weekends I'll have a presentation which I'll do with my other MS Research friends and have a meeting with my supervisor.  Currently, my summer internship is going on so I'll try to get done with any pre-requisites that are required. 

Any advice about this project or about how to approach ML or NN projects, in general, would be highly appreciated.

Thanks for your time! Have a nice day."

I'm enjoying 3 fields that are radically different: Machine Learning, Security and DevOps. I can't choose and I don't have time to study all of them. 

Some background should be helpful so here it goes 

Machine Learning: personal interest but the heavy math makes me insecure bc I'm not good at it. I'm fully capacble to learn tho. My collegue is heavely relying on their students entering ML. I'm in a research group dedicated to it and I'm currently applying to a full university financed nanodegree in AWS + ML, which is great for someone like me that has experience with AWS. 

Security: I have a AWS Certification specialized in Sec. I present webinars about AWS Security and have some experience with it on job. Easy to prove my experience and I'm interested, although I would miss the development part. I'm a very detail oriented and strict rule follower so it matches some of my personality.

DevOps: been wondering around the area for some time... I enjoy Linux but never studied DevOps before. Company has a strong and motivated DevOps team and I'd be willing to learn more.

Question: how did you choose a path? How were you sure it was your ""calling""? Which path seems like the best for me and how can I start to decide?"

I was waiting for site placement for over 3 months before learning about the site I will be teaching at. With them, I will be teaching 8th grade mathematics. Prior to knowing where I was being placed, I was freaking out about bit. I've been in that place where I didn't know where I was going to be teaching at, partly because I was uncredentialled at that point. I have not signed a contract of employment yet, only the conditional offer.

During this uncertainty, I decided to apply elsewhere in case the offer fell through. This was because I found out that they were waiting on a teacher to finish filling out paperwork for their retirement. In desperation, I applied to the local high school district where I worked for before as an intern. One of these schools I applied for is my alma mater. I just got a phone call today to set up an interview for Monday at that school. This is without sending follow-up emails or phone calls. There is a high probability that I might be offered the position at that school due to the history I have with that school. In addition to attending the school, my mom was also one of the original staff that opened it back in the early 90's. Let's just say I'm in a bit of an awkward situation.

TLDR: Is signing a conditional offer the same as signing a contract? Can I back out of the conditional offer if I am given a better offer elsewhere?"

I was very lucky to get an internship this summer but I am just wondering how I can reconcile that I am making so much less than my peers. My position is paying 20$/hr for a chemE semiconductor internship, whereas it seems all my friends are making 36-40. I have a 3.9 gpa and am involved with lots of technical projects and social orgs. One of my friends who struggled heavily to find an internship due to lack of experience got one a few weeks ago and is getting 40/hr. I understand that maybe aerospace or CS pays better, but will I really be stuck making like 60k/yr with a chemical engineering degree? Is my knowledge really worth that much less money? I guess also being a woman makes me feel like that somehow impacts it but I know that's probably not the real reason. This is the first internship for all of us, currently sophomores."

“...Valran’s nipples must be very, *very* blue.”

Kendrick was now certain that this is how he would die, his smug mouth signing the death warrant for the rest of him. At least his cheeks had the good sense to start blushing like our survival depended on it. Who knows, it actually might.

He couldn't look her in the eyes, not after what had just come out of his mouth. Instead his eyes shifted between everything else. His gaze was first drawn to something he hadn’t seen on any of the other purps in the room. One of her otherwise unremarkable tusks was sporting a gold jacket that reached from the tip to halfway to her lips. Lips he noticed had a small scar parallel to the crowned tusk. When they started to tremble slightly he tore his sight away, noting a heart shaped face framed by strands of black hair. He could see jaw muscles clench, bunching up beneath her skin. His eyes once again searched for anything to look at that didn’t remind him of the time bomb he had just triggered the countdown on.

Nose? Looked normal enough.

Forehead? Yup, that was a forehead...Oh, her eyebrows are scrunching up and forming a V-shape now.

*Oh sweet Jesus. Abort.*

Finally to the top of the head. Loose black hair draped along both sides of her face, while the top was pulled back into one large braid affixed straight back, hugging her scalp and dividing her hair evenly on each side. The braid was white in a sea of black.

Attempting to distract itself from its impending doom, his mind wondered if hair coloring and accents were part of Shil’vati culture, or if some entrepreneurial hairstylists were making a *killing*.

He blinked, and when his eyes came back into focus he saw fists clenching and unclenching, clenching and unclenching...

Afterlife, or oblivion? He had always hoped for an afterlife, but right now escaping this situation into never ending nothingness had an appeal.

Her chest expanded, taking in a deep breath.

He closed his eyes.

“CILTARI YOU STUPID BROTHERFUCKER!!” Reverberated through the bay.

\~\~\~

Everything in the bay froze at Pelrinn’s outburst.

Pelrinn was supposed to be the calm, collected one. The consummate professional marine, even when duty called her to the planet of sexy space babes who were supposedly as horny as they were.

The marines at the sides of the car slowly looked up to see her, half turned towards them and positively *fuming*. She knew she was probably the darkest shade of blue she had ever been, but she was so mad she had stopped caring. Chest heaving up and down, her eyes darted around, seeking the source of the current and seemingly every frustration in her life.

Slowly, a mop of black and blue hair and a pair of golden eyes peered above the top of the car.

“What’d I do this time?” Inquired Ciltari in a tone way too carefree for the mood in the room.

Still shouting, Pelrinn replied. “You opened your mouth twice. TWICE! That’s all it took for this male to *tease* me using what you said!”

More of Ciltari’s head crested the top of the car, the usual infuriating smirk forming around her tusks. Pelrinn knew a comment perfectly crafted to annoy her was coming.

“Did he now? Good for him, didn’t think the little guy had the tits!”

Pelrinn’s fury sputtered, not expecting anything so tame. She turned back toward the human, the male looking like he was about to be trampled by a Turox. His eyes were wide, and looked almost apologetic. Cheeks a rosey red and looking like a breeze might knock him off balance.

“I guess that means he's pretty fluent in Shil’vati, huh?” Citari added from behind her.

Anger dissolved away, all her conscious thought devoted now to recalling the details of the last few minutes. Everything Cil had said *was* in Shil’vati, but not many humans she had spoken to could speak more than a few stilted, broken sentences. She had devoted every free waking moment once she knew she was being deployed here to learning English, and only really felt comfortable using it a month ago. That was 2 months into her deployment. She had hoped being able to speak their language would give her a leg up on the competition to find...someone to spend her downtime with.

“At least he’s blushing almost as hard as you, more success than most women get trying to get some action so far.” Grikel’s voice cut through the fog in her mind. The first time she had spoken all morning, and Pelrinn wanted to kiss her for it. It was a lot easier to stop feeling embarrassed when someone else was too, and it allowed her to somewhat collect herself from the fervor Ciltari had needled her into.

At least one of the sisters needed to act right, and anyone who knew them knew Ciltari wasn’t going to.

Born to different wives with the same father, the two of them had polar opposite demeanors. Ciltari was rash, spoke before she thought, and had confidence that spanned light years. They went into the Crucible together, and Ciltari’s mouth probably earned her a record for punishment PT. A concerned officer even pulled her aside one day, warning her that the wrong witty remark to the wrong noble could land you in a heaping pile of Turox shit. So naturally she now saved them all for Pelrinn.

It was just her luck that Ciltari’s pod and her own were deployed side by side...

Golden irises once again focused on the male in front of her, she addressed him much more calmly than she had thought possible a minute ago.

“So. . . I guess you can understand what we’ve been saying all along?” She asked in Shil.

He opened his mouth to reply, but she heard no response. His lips hung open a second longer before closing again. She saw the lump in the front of his throat bob up, then down. She had almost given up on answer when his lips parted once more.

“Yeah…” He spoke in the strongest tone she had heard from him so far.

“...and I’m really sorry about what I said earlier.. You’ve been nothing but professional to me and I threw it in your face. I didn’t consider how much it might embarrass you. Please forgive me.” He pleaded.

Her eyes closed a moment, a small sigh escaping.

“You are forgiven…” She began. “Believe it not, I think I might know someone with a similar... *affliction*.” She jabbed a thumb in Ciltari’s general direction.

“Hey!” An indignant Cil practically squealed from her almost prone position behind the car. She was likely trying to finish scanning as quickly as possible around the bottom now that there was some male attention to be had.

The human cracked another smile at her sister’s protests. Pelrinn felt she had the high ground, and she wasn’t going to let the chance pass. Even if it did just turn out to be practice talking to male without paralyzing anxiety.

“I know you’ve had some years to learn it, but you do seem to be able to speak our language better than most humans I've met. How did you study to become fluent?”

She was genuinely curious, and she thanked the Empress she had questions to ask that didn’t involve anything untoward.

“Well.” He began. “Right after the occupation started... “ Her smile faltered a moment when he used that word. She put it back on, hopefully escaping his notice.

She was spared finding out if she had failed when the human’s phone chimed once more.

Both of them looked over at the interruption. She had no idea what the chimes signified, but from his reaction she could tell it wasn’t anything pleasant. The man took a deep breath. He had been speaking Shil’vati, but for a moment it changed back to English, catching her so off guard she almost couldn’t make out what he said.

“In for a penny…” He sighed.

Equally as abrupt was the switch back to her language.

“Where wa- okay yeah. Your people started distributing the programs and info on how to learn your language, right?” he continued on, doggedly ignoring whatever the noises on his phone signified. Of course she knew the material he was speaking of, it was hard to consider a people part of the Imperium if they never learned to speak the it’s language. Her people blanketed this world with it.

Most humans weren’t truly conversational yet, the ones who were worked closely with their new Shil’vati officials and organizations. Kendrick did not seem like he had *any* real experience with her people up close. Another question for after. Good.

“I got through the first couple lessons, memorizing the alphabet and all that. After that though, the programs were about as engaging as watching grass grow...”

She heard some soft clinks and jostling from the workbenches across the bay, turning slightly to see both Grikel and Valran placing down the scanners, both seemingly finished their respective work and as one they moved in Pelrinn and Kendrick’s direction with *purpose*. Any faster of a walk and they would have risked a “tusk to tit” incident without their suits.

One of Pelrinn’s hands had started moving behind her, before an upright hand from Grikel signaled no danger. When the pair reached her Valran offered a simple “All clean”.

Pelrinn muttered a quick “That’s what I figured…” Earning a raised eyebrow from Valran, asking for an explanation without words.

“I’ll tell you afterwards.” She added. That seemed to satisfy the woman.

The 3 marines now all had their full attention on the smaller human, whose explanation and capability for speech both started to wilt under the increased pressure.

“So I...uh…” His words slowed to a drip when Grikel’s voice interrupted.

“What did you do when the program could no longer keep your attention?” It was worded like a question coming from an Interior agent, but delivered in the tone a mother might use to ask a young son how his day went.

*Of course they were listening in...*

Pelrinn still found herself thanking the Empress at least one member of her sister’s pod had some sense.

Grikel’s gentle prodding seemed to have the desired effect, as it seemed to restart Kendrick’s train of thought.

“Right..” He started. So some guys on the intern-... I guess it’s the Data-net now? Well they created some programs and patches for computers to translate all the English text into Shil’vati on your computer and online games. Then I just started doing everything from memory, since I knew some of the games and programs nearly by heart. Like….”

He struggled to find the next word.

After a few more seconds and trying, he seemed to give up and offered up the word in English.

“*Immersion*” Then back to Shil’vati “The closest I can think of is ‘underwater’, but that’s not quite right.”

Pelrinn didn’t know that word either so she could offer no assistance. Thankfully he pressed on.

“It means only allowing yourself to experience the thing you are trying to learn or figure out. It gives you no other choice but to learn. Anyway, I learned a lot of words that way, and any words I don't recognize I can usually figure it out from the words around it.”

The 3 nodded their understanding in unison.

With nothing else seeming forthcoming, Pelrinn mentally checked her list and cast another line.

“What does the thing you said earlier mean? I do not know what ‘Pen knee” is. Does it have something to do with your leg?”

Kendrick’s face screwed up in puzzlement. A few seconds later the machinery in his mind seemed to catch up and his face eased back into an almost bemused expression.

“Ahh, I think I know what you heard. There is a human saying that goes like this. ‘In for a penny, in for a pound.’ The pound was a currency used by the British, and the penny was the smallest form of it. The penny was worth only a tiny fraction of a pound. The general meaning being that if you start something, even if it's small you should try to finish it.”

Pelrinn could hear a clang, and hurried footfalls after. She dreaded this nice time was about to be sullied in some way by the reappearance of her sister.

“Oh! Oh! Me next! Why do human males alway-” Ciltari started as she came to a stop beside Pelrinn.

“Back of the line, Cil.” Valran finished.

“Okay, so-” Ciltari tried to push on anyway.

This time the interruption came from the table.

\**BUZZZZZZZZZZ, BUZZZZZZZZZ, BZZZZZZZZZZ*\*

Sounded the phone as it started dancing across the smooth surface in time with the noise.

This was the last time the infernal device was going to interrupt her little Q and A session.

“Why is it doing that?” Pelrinn asked, cringing internally when it came out more forceful than she had intended.

Kendrick seemed unphased, and deadpanned his answer.

“Probably my boss, furious and wanting to know why I’m not at work yet.”

The phone kept vibrating, it had traveled almost the width of the table with its unceasing demands for attention.

Speaking with Kendrick was turning out to be one of the most enjoyable experiences since she had made planetfall, and it was going to cut short over a few minutes of labor left undone?

Not if Pelrinn had anything to say about.

“Can you answer it and activate the speakers?” She asked.

He froze up, clearly caught unaware.

The phone on the other hand was still attempting to make its escape. It was threatening to self terminate off the edge of the table when Grikel scooped it up from its perch. The size of her hand made the device seem tiny.

She held it out to the human and simply asked. “Can you?”

He thawed out, and took the offered phone. “...yeah, I can put him on speaker..”

“Please do so. Place it back on the table when you do.” Pelrinn said firmly.

Kendrick just looked down and his phone, slid a finger across a symbol on the touchscreen and gingerly placed it face up on the table before retreating back.

As she stepped forward and leaned over the little communicator an angry, raspy male voice boomed forth in English.

“OH, so NOW you pick up the damn phone! Where the fuck are you Marchand!? Just because you haven't been late before doesn’t mean you get to star-”

She interjected.

“This is Private First Class Pelrinn of the Shil’vati Marines at the security checkpoint. To who am I speaking?”

“...What?! It’s his boss! Where the hell is Kendrick?”

“Mr. Kendrick is currently being questioned at my checkpoint, and he will remain here until we are satisfied with his questioning and inspection.” She replied forcefully.

“Questioning?! The kid’s a goddamn goody-two-shoes! Just let the dumbass go so he can start actually *earning* his paycheck.” The man on the other end demanded.

“He will only leave when I say he may leave.” Her voice grew colder with each syllable, now hunched over the phone and gripping the edge of the table. “Have. I. Made. Myself. *Clear*?”

It was a statement, not a question.

Silence followed.

A muffled sound, then after a few more moments of silence an annoying, repeating tone.

“I’m pretty sure he just hung up on you.” Kendrick stated the obvious.

“Good.” she replied. She felt her fingers ache slightly when she let go of the table and straightened upright.

“He’s lucky we aren’t Interior, using that tone then disconnecting on you…” Valran alleged. “It certainly would not have ended well for him.”

There was agreement from everyone present.

“..so you said you had more questions for me? You said as much on the phone.” The human asked.

“Yes, who is Marchand? The one the angry male demanded to speak with first?” Grikel managed to spit out a full question before Pelrinn had even finished opening her mouth.

“That’s my house-, no that’s the wrong word...family? Yeah that’s my family name.” He answered. “My full name is Kendrick Marchand.”

“But using family names is normal here...it’s not like everyone's a noble or something, right?” Probed Ciltari.

“Definitely not, there’s only a few actual noble families left around the world, but none of them really have any power over anyone anymore, even before you guys showed up.” He said back to her.

Pelrinn jumped back in. “You were on your way to your employment, what is your job?”

“I program ‘see enn se-’ no. that won’t translate at all. uhh...I guess the simplest way to put it is I program big machines to cut parts and tools out of metal.”

“Are you single?!” Of course Cil would ask that…

“I uhhhh...yeah?”

“Why though? When it’s even genders there’s enough everyone right?” Ciltari pressed.

“That’s...kind of a big question and an even bigger answer..”

“Oh don’t worry, we don’t mind!”

“I don’t think that’s the pro-”

Her omni-pad interrupted the conversation with another ping.

Pelrinn looked down and focused on the screen, reading Leva’s second message to her since this started.

&gt;He’s been in the bay for a while now, did you girls actually find something? -Leva

She hadn’t even revealed the first one to the others yet. She brought it up again to reread it.

&gt;Make him squirm a bit for the sass he was giving me. -Leva

Pelrinn could sense Ciltari getting ready to pounce once more, so she cut in.

“So, like I told your ‘boss’ on the phone. This ‘questioning’ can last as long as I want it too. Leva, the marine out there manning the checkpoint kiosk, sent you back here with us just to mess with you.”

There were “oohs” from the other marines, Kendrick looked both upset and slightly relieved.

“Now, if you want I can let you leave right now so you get back to working for that...*pleasant* little man from the phone.” She baited.

After a few moments of waiting, he asked.

“...Or?”

“*Or*...you can stay here with us and answer some more questions. We get to relieve some boredom, you get to skip a little work *and*…” She paused. “you can mess with Leva out there. She just asked me what’s going on in here. Leaving her wondering is going to drive her *insane*. So, what will it be?”

She knew any male willing to risk teasing her the way he had earlier couldn’t resist that kind of mischief.

His eyes wandered as he deliberated. Then a lopsided, sly smile started forming from the corner of his mouth.

“I think it’d be best to be as thorough in your questioning as you feel necessary.”

Pelrinn started smiling again too.

nt7pxc,3,2021-06-05,Research vs Internship for course-based masters,Limp-Following-4053,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/nt7pxc/research_vs_internship_for_coursebased_masters/,"TLDR: Summer internship or summer research assistant for course-based masters?

I'm an upcoming computer engineering freshman working on my 5-year plan, and I'm thinking of what to do during my summers. I hope to pursue a masters in CS or finance, both of which are course-based masters (Where I want to go at least). I was wondering if I should spend my summers doing research assistant positions, doing internships, or maybe half+half. If the masters program isn't thesis-based, is it still more beneficial to get research experience or get job experience and start chipping away at student debt? Does it even matter which one I do as long as I do it well + enjoy it?"

nta55e,9,2021-06-05,My Experience With Loneliness and Anxiety,HooplaInABagel,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/nta55e/my_experience_with_loneliness_and_anxiety/,"I look at the clock. ""Okay it's 2pm"" I say to myself. ""This means that I have to make it through roughly 7 hours until the sun sets, then a lot of my anxieties can go away for the night"". I end up struggling to keep as busy as possible. I practice my piano and guitar. I eat lunch and dinner when that comes around (sometimes I skip lunch because I just don't feel hungry). I sometimes continue my drawing piece if I'm feeling it. I watch some shows/go online. I exercise on a consistent schedule and am quite fit. But between all of that, there is a lot of down time ... down time where I find myself hurting ... a lot. I find myself lying down on the ground or my bed hugging this really comforting pillow I have. It's become some sort of a security/comfort object for me over these months, treating it like it's a very special person ... a person who cares so deeply for me and I for it. Yes. This has developed into a coping mechanism for myself. 

All of this happens on the daily. Day after day. Week after week. I don't have a job as of right now because I start an internship that I was really blessed to achieve in mid-August. So for now I'm stuck in this soul-sucking routine while struggling with my loneliness. The factor of time that I explained within my mind at the start of this is a crucial aspect of it all. The hours of the day spanning between when I get out of bed (which is already late - like around 12pm on average) and when the sun goes down are the worst for me. It's summer now so I can hear people doing things outside and talking, kids playing, cars driving to and fro. In other words, LIFE happening and flourishing. All while I choose to be cooped up inside my house struggling with my loneliness. 

I would go out for walks IF ONLY I wasn't so self-conscious about people looking at me. I live in a quiet suburban neighbourhood, so yes, realistically, there wouldn't be a lot of people to notice me when walking in the first place. But even so, my brain gets so messed up in my self-consciousness. I have this really awful-looking bushy straight long hair (I'm a guy) which I have 0 clue how to go about styling. And even if I were to style it, it would just be for going out on a simple walk. As you might tell from this, I hate my hair so much, at least when it's super long like this. And I can't even get it cut because hair salons are still closed due to lockdown (we're re-opening super slowly). I end up envying those with nice faces who can pull off having slightly worse than average haircuts ... those who aren't like me. 

Relationships-wise, I struggle too. Family, friends, dating - all of it is a struggle. I live with my mother, father, and older sister. Yet the only one I can seem to tolerate is my mother. And saying ""tolerate"" even only applies on the worse days because most of the time she's awesome. It's my sister and father that I can't seem to stand. Whether it's my sister's know-it-all type of personality or my father's aura of laziness that he exudes along with doses of very loud and annoying coughs and yawns (he's a couch potato), I just try to separate myself from them as much as possible. Sadly, that's also the case for my mother as much as I may like her, but I just can't seem to get close to her. 

Friendships right now are pretty mentally exhausting too. I've had this person whom I considered to be a best friend for a few years now. He lives in the UK while I live in Canada but distance never mattered, I had never met someone who I had gotten along with so well before in addition to feeling perfectly matched in personality and humour. But as of recent, he's gotten a girlfriend and now we barely talk as much as we used to. Even after making lighthearted jokes about me ""leaving him"" once I got a girlfriend - yet here I am finding myself in that situation he had once proposed as a joke. My close distance friendships are good and I'm thankful for them so much, but they're just not on the same caliber as I would want. One of the reasons is because they enjoy making a lot dark humour, which I don't get offended by per se, but it's just ... it's not my style of humour and I end up being silent a lot when it happens. And along with them being infatuated with board and video games (I like them but not nearly as much as them), I think I really just want a close friend who I vibe with completely and can just ""hang out"" with because we enjoy each other's company. 

And here's the point where I talk about the dating world and my experiences (or lack thereof) within it. What's supposed to be a fun aspect of this point in my life (I'm a young adult in terms of age) has turned into something so mentally exhausting, crushing, and just all around taxxing. I'm fortunate enough to not have had absolutely 0 relevant even tiny experiences in regards to dating. Although I won't delve into detail about them here. But in the end, I've still been single all my life so far, never having a girlfriend. And my anxieties get the best of me when I know that nothing is guaranteed in life, and that includes how much time you have. I'm not getting any younger and I crave experiences as much as possible. The first date. The first kiss. The first hug. The first hand hold. The first cuddle. All of these experiences I constantly feel like I'm losing precious light on ... and unfortunately it's not something that is so easily achieved by putting in ""hard work"" as you do with other goals to achieve them, because you can't force people to like you. 

Because of all of this weighing heavily on my mind on the daily, it has affected my mental health on such a grand scale it feels like. I get mad and annoyed more easily than usual and end up internalizing it. The loneliness drives me to that comfort pillow of mine to cope even for a few moments. The anxiety exhausts me on both the physical and mental levels. So all in all it creates this huge mess that I feel inside me. Sometimes thoughts in my mind get so nasty because I think of these selfish ideas to employ once I have everything I could ever want - so people in my life who caused this pain in one way or another can feel that pain back. But then I feel incredibly guilty for even thinking that way because it's obviously extremely wrong. Guilt is another big factor into the downfall of my mental health. I end up thinking, ""what right do I have, feeling all of these things when I have everything I could possibly need just to simply ... live."" While others in the world are struggling just to SURVIVE, I'm over here feeling incredibly down over these things. 

Looking back at the clock, it is now 9pm. The sun is finally almost down. It's like I can feel the people in my area winding down from being outside and settling into a nice night in. It's annoying how only like this I can end up finally feeling more calm because I know people are indoors now like me. It's like ... the world was on some higher level than I was for the whole day ... and now they've dropped back down to mine. So I can end up feeling very relaxed about it. 

Thank you so much if you bothered to read through my whole post. You're a trooper. I just needed an outlet to spend the last hour of daylight writing this. Getting it out there, I hope, if there's any of you experiencing anything that I've mentioned, that brighter days will come to you. I know how much hurt and emotional pain can come from these things and I wish you all the best."
nta7m6,1,2021-06-05,"After not being able to get $15/hr entry level jobs in desired field, I blew an interview for dream job opportunity significantly exceeded my salary expectations and don't know how whether I should feel like a doged a bullet or not. Advanced apologies for novel length of a post .....",Cat_Eyed_Goddess94,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/nta7m6/after_not_being_able_to_get_15hr_entry_level_jobs/,"OK so a few things to clarify:

1. **The opportunity was my dream job, but with my nightmare employer.**
   1. I'm 26 and I recently graduated university. **I intend on applying to law school** but prior to doing so, I have been looking for an entry level job in the legal field near me to be able to first move out of an abusive household, etc.
   2. **The job exceeded my expecatations and it felt like a dream come true when I got called for an interview.**  zero work or intern experience in the legal field (But extensive knowledge about the law and have done legal writing/research) , I couldn't even find an entry level legal assistant job.
      1. I see an an ad for a top rated trial attorney who owns a successful firm. He was hiring candidates with experience, or recent college grads who maintained a certain GPA which I exceeded.
      2. The job was not only offered me a 40 plus starting salary with 0 work experience when every other place wouldn't even give me 15/hr for less experienced roles, but it was the only place that allowed me that position without requiring that I have a 2 yr certificate. **And it was being offered in my favorite part of town that I always wanted to work at.**
      3. **Therefore, it was a dream job But it was for a nightmare employer.** On glassdoor, 2 out of 5 reviews stated that the firm had issues with sexual harassment, it was a ""boys' club, that ""inappropariate comments were made all the time"", and ""good luck if you're a female attorney\*\*.If you want to doubt the veracity of these reviews, please just stop; I understand if you may be skeptical of these reviews . but if you're going to totally doubt the veracity of them, then please just stop. There's a fine line between a sexual harassment complaint, and having a REPUTATION for it. I 've seen many disgruntled reviews for various companies, but there's a difference between being disgruntled and multiple claims of serious sexual harassment.\*\*
      4. Other reviews cited long hours and bad pay, with one stating how they messed up on her paycheck a few times and another citing how they put off annual performance employee evaluations. **I didn't mind long hours &amp; working overtime though, because it's what I needed.** One review also cited 20 out of 50 employyes got fired or quit in a year, and that the place was known for being a revolving door. almost all of them cited bad management, with one customer even commenting on a google review that they had lost her paperwork. (was still a very successful firm; the lawyers do \*VERY\* well for themsleves and have been nationally ranked as top trial attorneys)
      5. **And to those who doubt the reviews are true, I could smell the truth of these reviews from miles away and even tried giving them a chance. But as soon as I** heard about how disgustingly routine it was to be sexually harassed, **the ""dream job"" instantly turned into a dream nightmare that I didn't even want to work. The thought of working there (long hours with little training and frequent harassment) depressed me.** I couldn't sleep for more than 3 hrs a night, my head constantly span as I decided whether to work there or not, and I had the worst acne I've had all year. **I've also been right about a bad situation anytime I've felt it, and ignoring that pit feeling only led to bad experiences throughout life.**
      6. I'm 26, living with my parents and just want a stable career that just so that I can pay for a roof over my head to study and get into law school to prosecute guys like him, or start my own firm doing something similar. Since graduating in Aug 2020 I've worked extremely hard to overcome my mental health disorders and I've cut off anyone toxic /abusive in my life that was preventing me from being in the position I am today to move forward and become independent. **I have zero time to lose, and I have zero games to play after having worked hard to free myself of people who tried to play games with me for years. Because there was a solid chance that I would be sexually harassed again, taking this job meant possibly putting myself in a position that I might have to escape from within a short amount of time only to be back in the same position** without a job with additional challenges to overcome such as explaining to employers why I had a job that ended quickly. . **Even if the reviews ""weren't true"", I'm looking for stability, not additional games or opportunties that might lead to being back on my feet with greater gaps in my resume.**
      7. **Reviews also stated no training, a lack of structure , and inconsistent expectations. This scared me since I had zero experience in the field, so it felt like a sink or swim job. I wanted to succeed but didn't know it the office cultivated an environment for that to be able to occur.**
      8. **I wanted to cancel the interview sooooooo bad, but it was the only opportunity I had at a law firm so I thought I'd check it out.** But I felt like I was going to be working a dead end position that could stifle future oppoturnities as there was a chance that I might have to terminte myself from the job if being sexual harassed on a continued basis. Again, it could be that the sexual harassment would stop after telling him to, but seeing how arrogant he seems in TV interviews, the fact that he owns his own firm, and my experience with older business men like him(on the street after being sexually harassed) didn't guarantee that would happen. I'm not stereotyping older men, but he obviously thinks he can do whatever he wants in his own office simply because he is the owner of it and I'm just saying that the worst kind of harassment comes not from young men off the street, but people in positions who feel that they can abuse their power. And his behavior did not settle this feeling in any way whatsover because **THERE WERE RED FLAGS ALL THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS, STARTING FROM THE MOMENT HE EMAILED ME FOR AN INTERVIEW ALL THE WAY LEADING UP TO WHEN I WALKED INTO HIS OFFICE:**

\---------------------------------------------------------

1. **The managing attorney aggressively recruited me.** I got notifications that he viewed my resume many times over the weekend, he gave my resume a like, and at 9AM the next business day, he asked me If I was available for an interview within the next 48 hrs. On the actual day of the interview, I also saw him waiting outside his office door for me a few minutes before the actual interview time. I applied on a Friday. He e-mailed me at 9AM the next business day asking if I could interview. But, I knew something was up based on how he asked me to interview which he did over e-mail like this :*(details of the actual interview in seperate section further below*):

* ""XYZ(my name), Can you interview with me on X date (48 hrs away)? Please advise.
   * first reaction: **i was digusted at his arrogance and immediately felt like an object; he was speaking to me like a pawn when I wasn't even an employee.** Such disregard for boundaries is a characteristic commonly held by (although not exclusively held by) employers who sexually harass or abuse their employees\*\*. I felt underappreciated and immediately had my guard up b/c it was as if he was expecting me to be there.\*\*where can i start lol?

1. he didn't even start the e-mail with a HI, or say anything about my application . I was expecting something along the lines of Hi, Thank you for interest in XYZ firm/ something about my resume. Would you be available for an interview sometime this week (with a time **range as opposed to a single date and time 48 hours prior)**? normally employers discuss availability for interviews in the context of with at least more than one date or time......................................, especially after I suggested alternative, but very flexible time/dates that better suited my avaiability on the application which he clearly disregarded smh.
2. Secondly, the subject line of the e-mail was ""interview with Jones law firm"" when name of the firm was Jones, Brown, and Yellow (not revealing actual name for confidentiality) . He was the owner of the firm, but failed to include the names of the others who shared partnership in the name of firm smh.

* AFter replying with my availability, **he didn't even try to hide how he spoke to his other employee.** Didn't even ask her to *please* send me directions to get there after I confirmed. Instead, he literally replied back saying ""**We'll see you then**\*(not even great, or I look forward to seeing you, etc);\* **Janet, circulate invites"".**

1. *Lol..we'll see you then as if it's my duty to be there?* And, If I were him, I'd be embarassed that a prospective employee who I'm trying to hire actually saw me ORDERING a current employee like that. **I didn't have a good feeling about firm b/c owner seemed like he embarassingly had no manners.**

* didn't thnk that the reviews talking about bad management among other things were true? **LOL. ""Janet""** never set me anything. She did send me something the morning before the interview, and it didn't even include the fact that there'd be a parking garage, etc which most receptionists include in info to interviewees. *Again, not surprising given that a former client stated on google reviews that they had lost her paperwork a few times.*

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Final stage: The interview.**

* **Day of the interview.** I Wanted to be happy about being offered a chance to work a job that had everything I was looking for in a way, but I couldn't no matter how hard I tried and felt like I was trapping myself into a position and settling me for something that would backfire. **I Wanted to be happy, but I couldn't knowing that even if offered the job, I wouldn't be guaranteed the stability that I desire.** **I knew I that was gambling a zero sum game that if I rolled the dice on, would lead me back to where I was now. I** Was ready to go to sue him for sexual harassment in court if need be , but knew that I didn't want to waste any more time after gotten out of a court battle a few months ago where I had to fight off a narcissist slandering my name in front of judge. **The thought of working there literally caused my stomach to churn and my head to spin I recall constantly thinking about how I didn't want to work there.** I also felt like I was settling b/c they had contacted me so fast &amp; I wanted to hear back from other employers that made me happier to work for. **I felt a huge sense of relief at the thought of not being offered the job, and wished that he didn't pursue interviewing me as proactively as he did.**
* **I'm finally about to walk into the office**. **I felt like I was walking into another one of life's dead ends,not an exicitng job opportunity. I remember approaching him and feeling like I was meeting my next harasser, not my next employer. I did not feel scared at this, because** I am not scared of men who harass me by the way. I confidently confront it head on. Thinking as if I was approaching my next harasser just made me angry and feel on edge throughout the interview b/c no one wants to be in a position to ""confront them head on"" anyway. And i've been sexually harassed on the street almost every weekend for the past 6 yrs as a result of walking alone in form fitting clothing with 0 other people around me .
* I walk into his office. **the lack of of bad management was not a lie lol; front desk seemed to be clueless about my interview at 5.** just as I was explaining it to them, he walked in and said ""I think she's here to see me"" . Angry at his earlier sense of entitlement towards me given to me in his e-mail and seeing it occur again in his office, I ignored him lol. *Likee, if you think i'm here to see you then say something to me not your employees..don't expect me to fall at your feet just because I was there to see you.* I continued to speak to the receptionists, which idk if that annoyed him or something because when I finally approached him, I don't even recall him saying hi or how are you? Maybe he did say hi, **but the first thing he said to me was not ""right this way"" or anything similar, but rather ""Follow me, Nancy"" in a slightly annoyed and joking tone.** Like what the actual fuck..follow you and in that tone when your receptionists were the ones who told me to sign in &amp; you said nothing about it ??
* I probably should have walked out right when he spoke like that but this was my first job interview so I wanted to see what would happen. So since this was my first job interview and compunded with what I had heard thus far, I was extremely on edge and just not my confident usual self.
* So, he only asks me 3 questions in the interview while implying that he throught I was qualified. **One question he asked was how long I wanted to work there.** I've never been asked that questiion before so I was caught off guard. Because of that and the fact that I couldn't stop thinking about how I didn't want to work there, I immediately and stupidly blurted out ""for one year"" **only to remember that the job description stated in capital letters that this was a CAREER OPPORTUNITY (if it really was you wouldn't have to persuade people into thinking that it is because your management is so bad and b/c no one actually wants to work there lol)** /I normally might have thought of something else to say on the spot but instead stated the first thing that came to my mind because I thought he'd be ok with it given the super high turnover rate at his firm. *This was right before I mentioned to him my plans of relocating to a different city after a year SMH.*
* In the interview, he also stated that he believed smart hardworking people had what it took to complete the job. He remarked "" If I recall, you (something to the effect of did really well in school), right?."" After answering yes and asking what seperated the employees who he thought succeeded vs those who didn't, he stated 3 qualities and told me that because of my performance in school thus far, I have those 3 qualities even if may not know it yet. He basically thought I was qualified, **liked my resume, but didn't like me lol** which is why I want to explain a few other things which occurred:
   * So first off, I'll say that the impression I got of him so far and the horrible things I read about his firm made it extremely hard for me to keep a straight face for just like just a few minutes into the interview . He wasn't able to see this b/c of my mask but it was telling of my headspace.
   * the first thing he told me was "" So, I want to interview you and not your resume"" **which I knew were code words for "" I want to test your loyalty and not your skills. ""**
   * **He tried to steer the interview into inquiring about personal details.**
      * I'm 26, **I don't speak like a shy ditsy girl at all** but the only thing he knew about me was that I recently graduated college. So when I mentioned interning at a particular place he was like "" so that must have been when you were a sophomore or freshman in college, right?"" I was like I'm not going to tell you my age...... He casually responded by saying ""right, but I must at least be in the ballpark that you're 21 or 22 right now b/c you just graduated, correct?
      * I'm someone who thrives on standing up for herself, loves doing it, but only learned this ability after years of experience .This was my very first job interview and I've never been asked that question in a subtle way before. **At the same time, I was eager to reassure anyone (even someone off the street) that I was certainly 21-22 b/c I've been bullied for months by those close to me about graduating at 26.** So I told him ""of course i am 21-22""
      * When revealing to him the name of the (republican ) senator I formerly interned for,his creep ass asked if he was "" a MAGA type"" in a joking tone (I assumed he was a republican merely pretending for me he didn't like MAGA types to find out my political leanings before realizing after the interview that he once showed up at a clinton fundraiser). Looking back I really regret not saying that ""sorry, I don't pay attention to the politics of those who I work with b/c I don't think the job has anything to do with it"" but instead I just kept telling him I didn't know b/c senator was never in the office.
      * This was all right before he asked what was one of the biggest red flags of all especially in regards to harassment claims online by asking "" what was your most unforgettable experience there"" while smiling at me with a huge grin and shiny eyes after mentioning attending school in Austin ( a city known for being a rowdy college town). Instead of getting annoyed, I (perhaps blindly) **saw this as an opportunity to make a connection a**nd solidify my desire to pursue legal work; **I also wanted to send a message that I was strong enough to not volunteer details about my personal life even if he was curious about it .** So my face lit up when I told him that my most unforgettable experience there were conversations I had on campus about constitutional law and history **(which was true)**
      * Towards the end, he kept asking me (with a huge cheesy grin on his face) whether I was ready to talk some of the other paralegals already working at the firm. **I couldn't tell whether he actually wanted me to do so if he was just trying to pursue a less awkard of closing the interview**.
      * Either way, before that happened, an intense exchange occured when he told me in a very douchey tone that **If I was only going to be there for a year, then I couldn't pursue litigation (being in court)** right before condescendingly remarking that ""this wasn't some internship."" Initially, I told him my focus wasn't on salary or advancement at the jump but rather on present work in a present role.
      * He was fine with that, but as someone passionate about law and going to law school, **likeee unless you're a judge sweetheart, you aren't going to tell me I can't be in court.** Granted his reasoning was very understandable, but those are the kinds of comments you keep to yourself lol **like you don't have to be INTENTIONALLY be both a dick and dumbass about it and tell me ""What I can't do"" when all you have to do is not hire me anyway?? So I sternly reminded him** that my plans after 1 year could very well change so I shouldn't I be able to pursue litigation then?

1. I made sure to sound as if I was looking for serious answers (because I certainly was). He nicely said of course before beating around the bush; I questioned him further, and he said ""this position is all we are going to talk about for today though ok?"" with a smile and a wink . I simply paused in silence, &amp; with a dead expression on my face, told him I could meet another co-worker as discussed earlier.

* He left and brought in another co-worker. I have to reinstate that none of the co-workers looked happy. The moment i walked in, none of the receptionists smiled or anything it seemed dead before the attorney greeted me. The co-worker I spoke to seemed just as on edge and stressed I was during the interview?You know how you're trying to aggressively make your interviewer think some type of way about you with filler words at a job interview? **that's exactly how she was acting.** She continued to stressfully emphasize how "" there are no stupid questions here, you can ask the attorneys anything(lol as if they have time to answer), how you'll get all the training you need with no experience(I beleived this), and that if there's a place to gain experience, it's here"". But, **She was like trying to sell the job to me and seemed tense &amp; pressured.**
* By the way, before introducing to me her, the employer asked if I had any questions or ""if I wanted to meet people."" He barely gave me a chance to answer, but when I told him ""I do have questions for you"" he looked at me with a straight face lmao. I was thinking to myself, *""Oh you think you wouldn't be asked any questions?""*

1. When asking him ""what do you think seperates employees who succeeed vs those who don't and what kind of culture does your firm promote for that"" he emphasized :
   1. success of employees as long as they don't ""Clock watch"" , are dedicated &amp; conscientious (which he said I was even if I myself didn't know that yet) . *Lol i wasn't surprised to hear that he looks for ""non clockwatchers"" especially when 1 of the reviews said he messed up on pay for long once.*
2. then he also said **"" we have a culture in this firm where if something is in your lap even if someone before you messed it up, it is your responsibility to fix since it is in your lap""**. I guess when I looked at him dead in the face quiet in response, he spoke up with a smile and said ""it's what I do all the time, I'm always cleaning up someone else's mess"" (personal injury accident firm)
3. Anyway, after I was done speaking to the other paralegal,the attorney did not return; the paralegal looked around not knowing what to do **as if he hadn't told her he'd be back.** she suggested that she was going to speak to the receptionist and come back, but annoyed at the attorney's negligence in the interview ending smoothly, I followed her out with my backpack &amp; knew it was time to leave. The attorney was speaking to one of the other attorneys in a seperate room, and when he saw us outside his door he immediately stepped out and and asked if we got a chance to speak. *umm of course we did.* But I just said it was a thorough chat before he just nodded and smiled without saying much. I didn't like that, so I subtly adjusted my backpack and turned the other way wanting to leave. He immediately said goodbye and have a good night in a nice tone but like in a fluttery ""okay sweetie if it's like that goodbye then"" tone. But I honestly can't remember which one of us motioned for the goodbyes first

**Concluding thoughts &amp; my question to audience (if anyone's reading) -----------------------------------------**

**He called me in so quickly to do an interview that I didn't even have the chance to explore all my options &amp; apply for college to grad hire programs with similar pay being offered to grads of my college. So I immediately felt like if I were to have automatically agreed to work for the lawyer, I would have settled without knowing whether it was the best option.** But after seeing that much of those college to grad opportunities have expired, I feel as if that firm was a great opportunity. I didn't realize this till after getting rejected/ spending more time to search for other opportunities (that aren't available ) online. **But, I am not sure how long that opportunity would have listed given the poor management and rife sexual harassment that I read occurs there.**

I've realized that the extent to which I cried is a testament to how passionate I am about becoming one of the best lawyers in the country. **As a result, i don't want to just sit around and fulfill someone else's legal dream, I want to fulfill my own which is why I'm willing to take anything that pays decently just so that I can afford my own place and work towards not just getting into law school, but fucking dominating the process of it.** I want nothing else in life right now. I'm also proud of the fact I had such little time to make a life changing decision (whether to actually want to work there or not), and I chose my mental peace. Not just in a ""feel good "" way, but because not having mental peace was signifcantly impeding me from succeeding in past career related goals for many years.

ntamk0,0,2021-06-05,"After not being able to get $15/hr entry level jobs in desired field, I blew an interview for a dream job opportunity that was offering full benefits &amp; significantly exceeded my salary expectations. But don't know how whether I should feel like a doged a bullet or not.",Cat_Eyed_Goddess94,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/ntamk0/after_not_being_able_to_get_15hr_entry_level_jobs/,"Advanced apologies for novel length of a post ..... a few things to clarify:

1. **The opportunity was my dream job, but with my nightmare employer.**
   1. I'm 26 and I recently graduated university. **I intend on applying to law school** but prior to doing so, I have been looking for an entry level job in the legal field near me to be able to first move out of an abusive household, etc.
   2. **The job exceeded my expecatations and it felt like a dream come true when I got called for an interview.**  zero work or intern experience in the legal field (But extensive knowledge about the law and have done legal writing/research) , I couldn't even find an entry level legal assistant job.
      1. I see an an ad for a top rated trial attorney who owns a successful firm. He was hiring candidates with experience, or recent college grads who maintained a certain GPA which I exceeded.
      2. The job was not only offered me a 40 plus starting salary with 0 work experience when every other place wouldn't even give me 15/hr for less experienced roles, but it was the only place that allowed me that position without requiring that I have a 2 yr certificate. **And it was being offered in my favorite part of town that I always wanted to work at.**
      3. **Therefore, it was a dream job But it was for a nightmare employer.** On glassdoor, 2 out of 5 reviews stated that the firm had issues with sexual harassment, it was a ""boys' club, that ""inappropariate comments were made all the time"", and ""good luck if you're a female attorney\*\*.If you want to doubt the veracity of these reviews, please just stop; I understand if you may be skeptical of these reviews . but if you're going to totally doubt the veracity of them, then please just stop. There's a fine line between a sexual harassment complaint, and having a REPUTATION for it. I 've seen many disgruntled reviews for various companies, but there's a difference between being disgruntled and multiple claims of serious sexual harassment.\*\*
      4. Other reviews cited long hours and bad pay, with one stating how they messed up on her paycheck a few times and another citing how they put off annual performance employee evaluations. **I didn't mind long hours &amp; working overtime though, because it's what I needed.** One review also cited 20 out of 50 employyes got fired or quit in a year, and that the place was known for being a revolving door. almost all of them cited bad management, with one customer even commenting on a google review that they had lost her paperwork. (was still a very successful firm; the lawyers do \*VERY\* well for themsleves and have been nationally ranked as top trial attorneys)
      5. **And to those who doubt the reviews are true, I could smell the truth of these reviews from miles away and even tried giving them a chance. But as soon as I** heard about how disgustingly routine it was to be sexually harassed, **the ""dream job"" instantly turned into a dream nightmare that I didn't even want to work. The thought of working there (long hours with little training and frequent harassment) depressed me.** I couldn't sleep for more than 3 hrs a night, my head constantly span as I decided whether to work there or not, and I had the worst acne I've had all year. **I've also been right about a bad situation anytime I've felt it, and ignoring that pit feeling only led to bad experiences throughout life.**
      6. I'm 26, living with my parents and just want a stable career that just so that I can pay for a roof over my head to study and get into law school to prosecute guys like him, or start my own firm doing something similar. Since graduating in Aug 2020 I've worked extremely hard to overcome my mental health disorders and I've cut off anyone toxic /abusive in my life that was preventing me from being in the position I am today to move forward and become independent. **I have zero time to lose, and I have zero games to play after having worked hard to free myself of people who tried to play games with me for years. Because there was a solid chance that I would be sexually harassed again, taking this job meant possibly putting myself in a position that I might have to escape from within a short amount of time only to be back in the same position** without a job with additional challenges to overcome such as explaining to employers why I had a job that ended quickly. . **Even if the reviews ""weren't true"", I'm looking for stability, not additional games or opportunties that might lead to being back on my feet with greater gaps in my resume.**
      7. **Reviews also stated no training, a lack of structure , and inconsistent expectations. This scared me since I had zero experience in the field, so it felt like a sink or swim job. I wanted to succeed but didn't know it the office cultivated an environment for that to be able to occur.**
      8. **I wanted to cancel the interview sooooooo bad, but it was the only opportunity I had at a law firm so I thought I'd check it out.** But I felt like I was going to be working a dead end position that could stifle future oppoturnities as there was a chance that I might have to terminte myself from the job if being sexual harassed on a continued basis. Again, it could be that the sexual harassment would stop after telling him to, but seeing how arrogant he seems in TV interviews, the fact that he owns his own firm, and my experience with older business men like him(on the street after being sexually harassed) didn't guarantee that would happen. I'm not stereotyping older men, but he obviously thinks he can do whatever he wants in his own office simply because he is the owner of it and I'm just saying that the worst kind of harassment comes not from young men off the street, but people in positions who feel that they can abuse their power. And his behavior did not settle this feeling in any way whatsover because **THERE WERE RED FLAGS ALL THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS, STARTING FROM THE MOMENT HE EMAILED ME FOR AN INTERVIEW ALL THE WAY LEADING UP TO WHEN I WALKED INTO HIS OFFICE:**

\---------------------------------------------------------

1. **The managing attorney aggressively recruited me.** I got notifications that he viewed my resume many times over the weekend, he gave my resume a like, and at 9AM the next business day, he asked me If I was available for an interview within the next 48 hrs. On the actual day of the interview, I also saw him waiting outside his office door for me a few minutes before the actual interview time. I applied on a Friday. He e-mailed me at 9AM the next business day asking if I could interview. But, I knew something was up based on how he asked me to interview which he did over e-mail like this :*(details of the actual interview in seperate section further below*):

* ""XYZ(my name), Can you interview with me on X date (48 hrs away)? Please advise.
   * first reaction: **i was digusted at his arrogance and immediately felt like an object; he was speaking to me like a pawn when I wasn't even an employee.** Such disregard for boundaries is a characteristic commonly held by (although not exclusively held by) employers who sexually harass or abuse their employees\*\*. I felt underappreciated and immediately had my guard up b/c it was as if he was expecting me to be there.\*\*where can i start lol?

1. he didn't even start the e-mail with a HI, or say anything about my application . I was expecting something along the lines of Hi, Thank you for interest in XYZ firm/ something about my resume. Would you be available for an interview sometime this week (with a time **range as opposed to a single date and time 48 hours prior)**? normally employers discuss availability for interviews in the context of with at least more than one date or time......................................, especially after I suggested alternative, but very flexible time/dates that better suited my avaiability on the application which he clearly disregarded smh.
2. Secondly, the subject line of the e-mail was ""interview with Jones law firm"" when name of the firm was Jones, Brown, and Yellow (not revealing actual name for confidentiality) . He was the owner of the firm, but failed to include the names of the others who shared partnership in the name of firm smh.

* AFter replying with my availability, **he didn't even try to hide how he spoke to his other employee.** Didn't even ask her to *please* send me directions to get there after I confirmed. Instead, he literally replied back saying ""**We'll see you then**\*(not even great, or I look forward to seeing you, etc);\* **Janet, circulate invites"".**

1. *Lol..we'll see you then as if it's my duty to be there?* And, If I were him, I'd be embarassed that a prospective employee who I'm trying to hire actually saw me ORDERING a current employee like that. **I didn't have a good feeling about firm b/c owner seemed like he embarassingly had no manners.**

* didn't thnk that the reviews talking about bad management among other things were true? **LOL. ""Janet""** never set me anything. She did send me something the morning before the interview, and it didn't even include the fact that there'd be a parking garage, etc which most receptionists include in info to interviewees. *Again, not surprising given that a former client stated on google reviews that they had lost her paperwork a few times.*

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Final stage: The interview.**

* **Day of the interview.** I Wanted to be happy about being offered a chance to work a job that had everything I was looking for in a way, but I couldn't no matter how hard I tried and felt like I was trapping myself into a position and settling me for something that would backfire. **I Wanted to be happy, but I couldn't knowing that even if offered the job, I wouldn't be guaranteed the stability that I desire.** **I knew I that was gambling a zero sum game that if I rolled the dice on, would lead me back to where I was now. I** Was ready to go to sue him for sexual harassment in court if need be , but knew that I didn't want to waste any more time after gotten out of a court battle a few months ago where I had to fight off a narcissist slandering my name in front of judge. **The thought of working there literally caused my stomach to churn and my head to spin I recall constantly thinking about how I didn't want to work there.** I also felt like I was settling b/c they had contacted me so fast &amp; I wanted to hear back from other employers that made me happier to work for. **I felt a huge sense of relief at the thought of not being offered the job, and wished that he didn't pursue interviewing me as proactively as he did.**
* **I'm finally about to walk into the office**. **I felt like I was walking into another one of life's dead ends,not an exicitng job opportunity. I remember approaching him and feeling like I was meeting my next harasser, not my next employer. I did not feel scared at this, because** I am not scared of men who harass me by the way. I confidently confront it head on. Thinking as if I was approaching my next harasser just made me angry and feel on edge throughout the interview b/c no one wants to be in a position to ""confront them head on"" anyway. And i've been sexually harassed on the street almost every weekend for the past 6 yrs as a result of walking alone in form fitting clothing with 0 other people around me .
* I walk into his office. **the lack of of bad management was not a lie lol; front desk seemed to be clueless about my interview at 5.** just as I was explaining it to them, he walked in and said ""I think she's here to see me"" . Angry at his earlier sense of entitlement towards me given to me in his e-mail and seeing it occur again in his office, I ignored him lol. *Likee, if you think i'm here to see you then say something to me not your employees..don't expect me to fall at your feet just because I was there to see you.* I continued to speak to the receptionists, which idk if that annoyed him or something because when I finally approached him, I don't even recall him saying hi or how are you? Maybe he did say hi, **but the first thing he said to me was not ""right this way"" or anything similar, but rather ""Follow me, Nancy"" in a slightly annoyed and joking tone.** Like what the actual fuck..follow you and in that tone when your receptionists were the ones who told me to sign in &amp; you said nothing about it ??
* I probably should have walked out right when he spoke like that but this was my first job interview so I wanted to see what would happen. So since this was my first job interview and compunded with what I had heard thus far, I was extremely on edge and just not my confident usual self.
* So, he only asks me 3 questions in the interview while implying that he throught I was qualified. **One question he asked was how long I wanted to work there.** I've never been asked that questiion before so I was caught off guard. Because of that and the fact that I couldn't stop thinking about how I didn't want to work there, I immediately and stupidly blurted out ""for one year"" **only to remember that the job description stated in capital letters that this was a CAREER OPPORTUNITY (if it really was you wouldn't have to persuade people into thinking that it is because your management is so bad and b/c no one actually wants to work there lol)** /I normally might have thought of something else to say on the spot but instead stated the first thing that came to my mind because I thought he'd be ok with it given the super high turnover rate at his firm. *This was right before I mentioned to him my plans of relocating to a different city after a year SMH.*
* In the interview, he also stated that he believed smart hardworking people had what it took to complete the job. He remarked "" If I recall, you (something to the effect of did really well in school), right?."" After answering yes and asking what seperated the employees who he thought succeeded vs those who didn't, he stated 3 qualities and told me that because of my performance in school thus far, I have those 3 qualities even if may not know it yet. He basically thought I was qualified, **liked my resume, but didn't like me lol** which is why I want to explain a few other things which occurred:
   * So first off, I'll say that the impression I got of him so far and the horrible things I read about his firm made it extremely hard for me to keep a straight face for just like just a few minutes into the interview . He wasn't able to see this b/c of my mask but it was telling of my headspace.
   * the first thing he told me was "" So, I want to interview you and not your resume"" **which I knew were code words for "" I want to test your loyalty and not your skills. ""**
   * **He tried to steer the interview into inquiring about personal details.**
      * I'm 26, **I don't speak like a shy ditsy girl at all** but the only thing he knew about me was that I recently graduated college. So when I mentioned interning at a particular place he was like "" so that must have been when you were a sophomore or freshman in college, right?"" I was like I'm not going to tell you my age...... He casually responded by saying ""right, but I must at least be in the ballpark that you're 21 or 22 right now b/c you just graduated, correct?
      * I'm someone who thrives on standing up for herself, loves doing it, but only learned this ability after years of experience .This was my very first job interview and I've never been asked that question in a subtle way before. **At the same time, I was eager to reassure anyone (even someone off the street) that I was certainly 21-22 b/c I've been bullied for months by those close to me about graduating at 26.** So I told him ""of course i am 21-22""
      * When revealing to him the name of the (republican ) senator I formerly interned for,his creep ass asked if he was "" a MAGA type"" in a joking tone (I assumed he was a republican merely pretending for me he didn't like MAGA types to find out my political leanings before realizing after the interview that he once showed up at a clinton fundraiser). Looking back I really regret not saying that ""sorry, I don't pay attention to the politics of those who I work with b/c I don't think the job has anything to do with it"" but instead I just kept telling him I didn't know b/c senator was never in the office.
      * This was all right before he asked what was one of the biggest red flags of all especially in regards to harassment claims online by asking "" what was your most unforgettable experience there"" while smiling at me with a huge grin and shiny eyes after mentioning attending school in Austin ( a city known for being a rowdy college town). Instead of getting annoyed, I (perhaps blindly) **saw this as an opportunity to make a connection a**nd solidify my desire to pursue legal work; **I also wanted to send a message that I was strong enough to not volunteer details about my personal life even if he was curious about it .** So my face lit up when I told him that my most unforgettable experience there were conversations I had on campus about constitutional law and history **(which was true)**
      * Towards the end, he kept asking me (with a huge cheesy grin on his face) whether I was ready to talk some of the other paralegals already working at the firm. **I couldn't tell whether he actually wanted me to do so if he was just trying to pursue a less awkard of closing the interview**.
      * Either way, before that happened, an intense exchange occured when he told me in a very douchey tone that **If I was only going to be there for a year, then I couldn't pursue litigation**  right before condescendingly remarking that ""this wasn't some internship."" Initially, I told him my focus wasn't on salary or advancement at the jump but rather on present work in a present role.
      * He was fine with that, but as someone passionate about law and going to law school, **likeee unless you're a judge sweetheart, you aren't going to tell me I can't be in court.** Granted his reasoning was very understandable, but those are the kinds of comments you keep to yourself lol **like you don't have to be INTENTIONALLY be both a dick and dumbass about it and tell me ""What I can't do"" when all you have to do is not hire me anyway?? So I sternly reminded him** that my plans after 1 year could very well change so I shouldn't I be able to pursue litigation then?

1. I made sure to sound as if I was looking for serious answers (because I certainly was). He nicely said of course before beating around the bush; I questioned him further, and he said ""this position is all we are going to talk about for today though ok?"" with a smile and a wink . I simply paused in silence, &amp; with a dead expression on my face, told him I could meet another co-worker as discussed earlier.

* He left and brought in another co-worker. I have to reinstate that none of the co-workers looked happy. The moment i walked in, none of the receptionists smiled or anything it seemed dead before the attorney greeted me. The co-worker I spoke to seemed just as on edge and stressed I was during the interview?You know how you're trying to aggressively make your interviewer think some type of way about you with filler words at a job interview? **that's exactly how she was acting.** She continued to stressfully emphasize how "" there are no stupid questions here, you can ask the attorneys anything(lol as if they have time to answer), how you'll get all the training you need with no experience(I beleived this), and that if there's a place to gain experience, it's here"". But, **She was like trying to sell the job to me and seemed tense &amp; pressured.**
* By the way, before introducing to me her, the employer asked if I had any questions or ""if I wanted to meet people."" He barely gave me a chance to answer, but when I told him ""I do have questions for you"" he looked at me with a straight face lmao. I was thinking to myself, *""Oh you think you wouldn't be asked any questions?""*

1. When asking him ""what do you think seperates employees who succeeed vs those who don't and what kind of culture does your firm promote for that"" he emphasized :
   1. success of employees as long as they don't ""Clock watch"" , are dedicated &amp; conscientious (which he said I was even if I myself didn't know that yet) . *Lol i wasn't surprised to hear that he looks for ""non clockwatchers"" especially when 1 of the reviews said he messed up on pay for long once.*
2. then he also said **"" we have a culture in this firm where if something is in your lap even if someone before you messed it up, it is your responsibility to fix since it is in your lap""**. I guess when I looked at him dead in the face quiet in response, he spoke up with a smile and said ""it's what I do all the time, I'm always cleaning up someone else's mess"" (personal injury accident firm)
3. Anyway, after I was done speaking to the other paralegal,the attorney did not return; the paralegal looked around not knowing what to do **as if he hadn't told her he'd be back.** she suggested that she was going to speak to the receptionist and come back, but annoyed at the attorney's negligence in the interview ending smoothly, I followed her out with my backpack &amp; knew it was time to leave. The attorney was speaking to one of the other attorneys in a seperate room, and when he saw us outside his door he immediately stepped out and and asked if we got a chance to speak. *umm of course we did.* But I just said it was a thorough chat before he just nodded and smiled without saying much. I didn't like that, so I subtly adjusted my backpack and turned the other way wanting to leave. He immediately said goodbye and have a good night in a nice tone but like in a fluttery ""okay sweetie if it's like that goodbye then"" tone. But I honestly can't remember which one of us motioned for the goodbyes first

**Concluding thoughts &amp; my question to audience (if anyone's reading) -----------------------------------------**

**He called me in so quickly to do an interview that I didn't even have the chance to explore all my options &amp; apply for college to grad hire programs with similar pay being offered to grads of my college.

What I’m currently doing is making a crud app with Node/React. It’s taking forever to finish because a majority of my time is trying to figure out design choices so it doesn’t look amateur without even having a complete idea of what I want it to be capable or look like. 

My other project is a web scraper.

My 2 other projects are from school, a binary classifier and backend in JSP for a crud app (front end is barebones html). 

I’ve applied to probably 600 positions now and have recently been applying to only start ups. I’ve had 1 interview failed with a startup and 2 phone screens to which they never got back to me and later said they won’t be moving forward.

Am I too dumb to get a job in software development?

In particular, I am not sure just how much developing experience (if any) I would be able to gain since this is a testing position. So here is my question: How much coding is involved in “5G baseband testing” and is this internship good for someone who wants to become a developer?

(Yes I know I could have asked this in the interview, but I didn’t think of it at the time)"

I get that companies adjust to virtual but it's been over a year now, and they had last years interns virtual so I don't really think that's an excuse. 


First, I'm the only intern out of our 53 who doesn't get another intern to work with. Everyone else was put on teams with 2-4 interns to learn the job from other employees, plus have an internship project to do. No clue why i'm on a team solo. Anyway first day was a wash because they didn't have log ins for us to use the virtual machine. I mean ok, i guess 3 months notice isn't enough for them apparently, it happens. Second day, get log ins but every intern has IT issues so we lose have the day with set up. by 1,  i'm finally in. message my manager, he sets me up with a mentor and then great. Ask him what to do. He sends me some instructions on what software I need to setup, the proper files, and settings.

So i'm following the documentation. The instructions aren't working, things aren't where they say they are. I message the mentor, and he tells me that document is for version 19 and we're on 26. Ok, it happens I suppose. Things get busy, documents don't get updated. A heads up would have been nice but anyway, I continue from day 2-4 to setup these various software and I still can't get it working and I'm getting little to no help. 


I mean, the team I'm on, I get it are busy. They have project deadlines or whatever and can only spare little time. But and then there's all the meetings. So many meeting. Multiple times a day where I don't understand anything lol. 

is this normal?"

TL;DR: started an internship, love what I do there. Made some mistakes. Called in a meeting. Got a job?!

A bit of background. I'm 26, and since high school I've been in the Mechanical Engineering field without blatant success. I would get average of 55-60%. Then I discovered web/app development. I decided to throw all of my ME behind, and focus on programming/development.

I started learning python for fun. Then I learned HTML, JS, CSS, React. I've been on this path for just about two years now. I finished my first year in Comp. Science and decided to get an internship through coop programs. I got one RIGHT away. I was so happy. I started the internship exactly ONE month ago.

Friday, my boss calls me in a meeting, I'm super nervous thinking ""shoot.. did I make a wrong commit, what did I F*** up this time..."".

I get inti the meeting, casual chat, and then boom.. he started saying how much he thinks I learn quickly, how my code is clean (except the times I messed stuff up). And then he proceeds to offer me a part-time job as a junior web/app dev with them after the internship.

I have a foot in the business right now. It feels amazing.."

I am a Cal c/o 2020 graduate. I am working on a talk as a complement of the BIO/golden bear orientation to provide some tips for adopting transfer life. Before I get started, I am wondering how is everyone's experience and what sort of area you think advice from upperclassman/older people would be helpful, thanks for your input!

&amp;#x200B;

Below are some of the talk points I had in mind, not very structured yet:

 

What defines a good experience?

\- Xyz

&amp;#x200B;

What are some stressors?

&amp;#x200B;

\-lack of upperclassman or student figure that I can reach out to

\-feel strong sense of behind and loneliness

\-big big campus, big big class, feel it’s hard to make friends and gain personal relationship

\-academically challenged, feel ashamed to ask for help

\-stress about declaring and getting internships

&amp;#x200B;

How to address the stressors?

&amp;#x200B;

\- you can’t do everything at the same time

\- prioritizing and planning, use calendar

\- know the timeline, and plan ahead

\- research and have bigger picture overview before you jump in and sign up

\- your identity doesn’t lays on how you preform

\- find a group of friends to do things together, AKA your support group"

I knew these 22-year-old kids I used to train that now have FT jobs while I'm still unemployed. My mental health has been deteriorating because of this and I realized I'm not very smart when it comes to decisions. 

I graduated in 2017 with a chemical engineering degree, I had 1.5 years of internship experience in an Oil and Gas company but there was a huge oil downturn and I couldn't find a job. I started the 2nd degree in CS for the sole purpose of becoming a student again to join an oil company as an intern and use my chemical engineering degree to become an FT employee there. That plan was almost going to work but it failed when the pandemic hit in March 2020 and oil tanked. 

I now had to fully commit to CS, got an 8-month internship while I was doing FT school. I graduated from CS last month and in my 8-month internship, I barely learned anything. My programming skills are non-existent due to my lack of focus on the fundamental courses when I had no intention of doing CS early on. The internship also failed to land me a FT job because they had ""staffing issues"". So, essentially got rejected by them as well. 

Now, I am graduated with 2 degrees and still unemployed. I could barely code and my engineering experience is meaningless now. I lack the focus to grind through and keep sending applications at times. I think I may have ADHD...

My current plan is to learn Java again from scratch while applying to postings to get interview experience. I don't even want to apply to developer jobs because I can't code for shit and the whiteboard coding questions scare me. 

Sorry, this is a complete mess of a post, it's around 3 AM here and my brain is not working."

I want to get into quant, and was considering applying to MFE (and similar) programs at top US schools. However, I’ve been reading a lot of mixed reviews about it. 

For people who have done the program or work in quant roles, what’s your review of the program?

A little bit of background on myself: I would consider Math and coding to be my top skills, but I do not have a very strong formal background in either due to my major. I have done a lot of stats (I’m doing a Finance specialization), but not much of calculus (beyond calc II) or stochastic processes. I’m doing a minor in computing and I have an internship as a data science intern.

Given my background, would an MFE add value since it’ll give me a formal backing in both math &amp; coding, or will I gain more from doing a Master’s in something else/not doing a Master’s altogether?

I know basic **Python, HTML, CSS**. And I like to think that I have average problem solving skills. The most sophisticated program I ever made was stupid web scrappers and stuff. 

I suffered from depression 3 years back and never really recovered. I have been only slacking ever since. I never really made any effort. And now it feels it's do or die for me. I need to learn something and then earn money from it. But I truly don't know how to go about it. It's like I can't bring myself to believe there's enough time for me to do anything about it.

I chose P&amp;G specifically because they seem to be the best thing after FAANG for my purposes and from an internationality point of view.

I applied to FAANG companies before but didn't even get past the first interview if I wasn't flat out rejected. I don't want to work as a software engineer as there are many people much better than me and I see my strengths in a combination of economics and CS (applied for product management roles) which also fits with my educational and internship background.

So I'm interested to learn more about my options regarding US immigration. I already checked the USCIS for what options I have available, but I'd like to double check with you guys. 

**DV Visa:** I'm eligible to apply to since Lebanon is my birth place, but it seems DV2022 is already underway and I couldn't find any information about when's the next round is going to be. Also, it appears to be heavily luck based. 

**TN Visa:** I'm eligible to apply to as a Canadian (assuming I have an employment offer from a US based company), but the problem is it's for work only and not for immigration. 

**H1B Visa:** Same as TN, but stricter and can be dual intent.

**L1 Visa:** Similar to H1B, but I'd be working for a US based company in a foreign national, and they'd sponser me to transfer to a US branch.

Please correct me if I'm wrong or missed anything else. It seems that **H1B** and **L1** visas would be my best options in the near future, but realistically speaking, how viable are they as a Lebanese graduate with just a couple of internships? I'm aware there's already an exceeding number of applicants and I expect they have extraordinary experiences to begin with. So what's the best way to plan for this? Should I seek to work in a US based company in Canada and hope I can later apply for L1 visa, or work in any Canadian company for experience then apply for H1B?

Hello! 😊

Like the tittle says, my best friend has social anxiety and I'd appreciate your insight on this!

Before the pandemic started she was a lot better, she even started going to a professional school (biggest achievement of all!), but since COVID came, it went south and she almost got kicked out of it for not going to classes or the internship.

I'm really worried she's going to isolate herself and her parents don't seem to care that much. I keep myself in contact, but I'm dependent on whether or not she answers my messages.

Anyways, I'm planning to volunteer at a local animal shelter in July (it's a small shelter).

I want her to come with me. She loves animals as much as I do and I think it'll do her good, because animals are a lot easier to deal with and they don't have humans sucky atitudes. They don't judge you, they don't yell, they don't criticize, they don't make fun of you. And I know she worries about all this and I completely understand.

Do you think suggesting volunteering is a good idea?

I'll never force her to go though. If she doesn't want to go that's fine, I'm just afraid that suggesting this will upset her and I don't want that."

PBQs:
The PBQs looked very challenging at first glance when you start the exam, but always follow Jason's advice: ""skip them and return to em later after the multiple-choice"" this method works best for the PBQs because it gives you a lot of time to understand them and realize they're not as difficult as they appear to be, I had a lot of PBQs in Core 1 and a few in Core 2 but they seemed understandable once you read the instructions multiple times.

They told me I can work on technical tasks as well if I want to get experience in that but it It was a year internship for low pay. So i was searching for other options as well. 

I found a good program to join for management position. The pay is well and the program has great exposure since for two years i worked in four different departments. And for the past year and a half i worked in a fixed position.  During those years i gained experience in Supply Chain Management . But at every position i worked in i was always gravitated towards tasks that involved some technical or software stuff like dealing with ERP and system stuff and i worked on power BI as well. I also enjoyed seeing how the dynamic is like inside business and how it is really an art getting to run this thing efficiently. how finances are recorded and followed and audits and this carefully crafted business logic. 

While the job has good pay i am not totally satisfied by it. I still had feeling that i didn't get to make use of my university studies. I remember i liked so many classes like calculus, algorithms,  microcontrollers and digital design.  It is weird for me what is my situation is like now. Dealing with people mostly and having to push them to do stuff and showing off by soft skills only.  

I am currently learning about web development.

I am planning to learn and find freelance jobs and if it went well maybe i can switch completely and leave my current job . But in this case also i will be throwing three years of work into no where and have no use of it although I learned a lot about ERP systems and their purpose, business logic and processes,  power BI . 

I feel like I am all over the place and can't decide something good for me to do. I still have thoughts about pursuing a master and getting into embedded systems design!! 

I also feel like all of the above is a waste cause i didn't do professional certification in any of it,  not even the PMP the general one. And my university degree: well it has been five years and no experience so i think it is useless now.  

 I feel like I am doing so many things wrong and getting myself distracted . is it too late to go back to learning technical stuff? and is my past years a waste ?"
nttv91,3,2021-06-06,I have completely wasted half of my time at college due to poor mental health and ADHD and I don't know what to do.,cliccbaiit,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/nttv91/i_have_completely_wasted_half_of_my_time_at/,"&amp;#x200B;

I am in engineering college, with a major in electrical engineering, and it is a four year degree. Half of my degree is over and I have learned nothing, I have passed courses with average or below average grades without studying or understanding majority of the stuff being taught,  actually I failed one course in previous semester, my grades are going down instead of going up. I did no internships, no big projects, completed no research work and participated in close to zero extracurriculars due to the lockdown and being stuck at home. 

Heck, I didn't even make any friends except the two friends I made on the first day or did any 'networking'. I don't know what we are learning, I don't know what subfield I want to go to which is why I can't choose my elective subjects or my final year project because I just learnt NOTHING at all. The only thing I am a bit confident I can do is some coding, but it isn't a polished skill I have. Oh yeah, that too, I have no developed skills to land even a small internship in the future. 

The worst thing is, I love my major, I love tech and electronics and math and physics, I WANTED TO DO THIS! But I just don't understand what happened, I had a massive mental health crash and everything spiralled out of control.

I still want to save my career. I want to go get a masters or a PhD or a well paying job, and all of that asks for a good GPA or multiple internships. But I am just so far behind everyone. I can't catch up with all the stuff I missed, all the subjects I didn't really understand because I didn't take classes. I can't make a decision for the life of me about my focus area in this degree and I will need to do it right now.  I don't know how to make up for that. What should I do?

ntu57z,0,2021-06-06,I will have saved enough money to pay off my federal student loan in full once I graduate. But is this really the smartest financial decision I could make?,TinkerCube,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/ntu57z/i_will_have_saved_enough_money_to_pay_off_my/,"I have been studying engineering for 4 years now, and I have 2 years left until I graduate with my degree (6 years in total). It's typically a 4 year academic program, but one extra year was for paid internships, and the other was for a second degree that I added on.

I took out a student loan when I graduated high school just in case I ever ran out of money, but after aquiring a couple large scholarships, grant money, and a few very well-paid internships, I never had to even touch my loan. I've done the math, and I will probably have a few thousand more in my bank account than what would be required to pay off my loan in full. 

Just so that you understand where I am at, I anticipate that when I graduate, I'll have about ~$40000 in federal student loans, and somewhere between $40000-50000 in my savings account. I have no credit card debt (and never will). 

My question is, should I pay off my student loan as soon as possible to avoid accumulating interest (it starts 6 months after I graduate), or should I invest my money in some other way? The thing is, I've heard that you typically get the interest from your student loans back through taxes, but I don't know exactly how that works (especially with such a large loan). My starting salary will probably be about $60,000 a year grosse, so would I get all of the interest back? Will carrying a student loan benefit me in any way? 

Unfortunately I'm very risk-adverse, so I've been avoiding putting money in the stock market (although sort of regrettably, after seeing some of the gains made in the previous year). I also have great credit, so would it make sense to put a downpayment on a house, or purchase something else that appreciates? I also don't have a ton of furniture yet, so I'll have to spend some money on things like that.

I just want to make the best financial decision that I can, because it's a lot of money so what I do with it is going to make a big difference. I don't want to do something stupid and then realize I should have done it differently later on. Can anyone give me any advice?"

ntvaot,0,2021-06-06,I wouldn't let my future kids ever go to a UC school,[deleted],UCDavis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/ntvaot/i_wouldnt_let_my_future_kids_ever_go_to_a_uc/,"I've spent 9 years at UC Davis and I've come to the conclusion that I'd never encourage my kids to go to a UC school.

Back when I was in high school, everyone aimed for a UC school. There was a sense of stigma around not going to a UC school. However as soon as my Freshman year at Davis, I started to resent the whole school and realized that it's not just Davis, but the whole UC system. It doesn't matter which UC you go to (Berkeley to Davis to UCLA), the system seems to be the same. The amount of money you pay per quarter and the amount of support you get as a student is ridiculous.

I remember my first struggles were just figuring out how to study with the quarter system. As soon as you settle into a routine then you have midterms and screw those midterms up, then you've alrighty ruined your GPA for the quarter and perhaps for the rest of the four years. Trying to go to office hours and waiting outside the professor's door because it's so cramped. By the time you get in, the professor is leaving because the hour is up. Trying to schedule conflicting courses that you need to graduate on time, trying to find useless classes to sign up for just so you can keep your financial aid if you are waitlisted for a class that you do need. Trying to bike/walk/run in between classes that are near the Vet school and near the MU in under ten minutes. Trying to schedule a part time job in between your waitlisted classes. Trying to avoid bad professors by reading Rate My Professor. Driving an hour to school for office hours only to find out the TA/Professor didn't even show up and failed to let the class know. Having 4 midterms on the same day. Constantly sitting in old crusty mildew and asbestos infected buildings, but by all means the International Student building needs to be reconstructed every few years. No one fixes Olsen hall, Rock hall, Robbins hall, or Hickey Gym, but we need a new athletic building immediately.

This isn't even to mention trying to talk to an advisor about majors and courses. Or trying to get an internship with a professor, when there are like 500 kids in one class. Or even knowing them enough to get letters of recommendation. Trying to go through the administrative bullshit of getting the papers you need signed (waiting to book appointments with those people or having to go to 6 different buildings to just find the right department).

Students who had prior support from sororities or fraternities seemed to have all the past exams and all the answers for midterms. If you're on your own, you might never really make it through as successfully as those who have social support both academically and emotionally.

I had a friend who asked a professor for a letter of recommendation and the professor didn't even turn the letter in on time.

One time after I graduated I got a Junior Specialist job at a lab, only to be laid off after 8 days because the stupid professor ran out of funding. She didn't even have the heart to face me in person and asked her lab people to tell me and the other two PhD scientists in her lab. Then she had the nerve to ask me to volunteer while I had student loans to pay that finance her fancy travels every year.

One time I was eating lunch with a professor during an internship and another professor came up to us and asked who I was. The next day, that professor's kid was in the lab and given an internship just because of the connections the professor parent pulled. This kid didn't even go to a UC school but instead a private school somewhere else but apparently they could take internships away from regular students at Davis who are struggling to find opportunities.

In grad school at a UC, it's the same shit but multiplied. At that point you don't even know who to talk to in order to get a sense of the requirements you need to pass to graduate. As a regular student don't even think of having the chance to succeed because only international students who had more than 10 weeks to learn the concepts of their courses and who have government funding from their countries will get projects/labs.

If I'm lucky enough to have kids, I hope to send them to private schools (should I be able to afford it). Or community college or a state school. If you feel sad about losing your chance of in person classes during the pandemic, don't be. At least you can avoid half of this.

I've recently met a lot of other UC alums and they all seem to harbor the same sentiments, but once they went to a private school for professional schools they seemed much happier. "
ntyl3l,1,2021-06-06,Starting in IT with an Electrical Engineering degree,ErisPadsHerChest,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ntyl3l/starting_in_it_with_an_electrical_engineering/,"Hi, I just graduated this May with a B.S in Electrical Engineering. I came into college not really knowing what I wanted to do other than knowing I did like electronics/computers and enjoyed problem solving. Fast forward five years and I finally graduate with a 2.7 gpa and a couple internships under my belt, I realize that I don’t really want to do engineering and that I barely remember anything I learned in school. I instead want to make a career out of IT and started studying the basics of computer networking etc. I applied to quite a few IT jobs and engineering jobs (in case my lack of experience ended up not getting me any offers in any IT roles). 

I received an offer to be a hardware engineer designing PCB boards for around $85k starting. The thing is, I’m fairly sure even if I tried my best, I just wouldn’t be cut out for the job since I feel it was a miracle I even graduated with a degree in EE. The only other offer I got in regards to IT was a role as Cloud Support Associate at Amazon with $70k starting plus bonuses but I would have to relocate to Seattle (currently in California). I understand that I have to start from somewhere since I barely have any experience in IT but I’m unsure if it would be a good starting point as my first job. I just wanted to know other’s experiences and if it was a good entry job or should I take the engineering job and look for a different IT job in the meantime?"
nu05wm,3,2021-06-06,Is it still worth it to pursue a career in Law or any field at all for that matters? I feel the errors I made between the ages of 20-21 are getting in the way.,LegallyADHD,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/nu05wm/is_it_still_worth_it_to_pursue_a_career_in_law_or/,"I am right now a 23M living in Toronto, ON. I have a Bachelors of Applied Arts in Paralegal Studies and I personally am questioning if I am cut out for the legal field as I have done so many things wrong and it feels like I need to turn my back. I need to know if I should quit at this point.

The first hint was in the third year of my degree. You are all going to get a pretty negative impression of me and I deserve it. I was proofreading my friend's paper for an assignment (he extremely pressured me to despite me being behind and needing to get it done.) I gave him his paper back and for whatever reason I banged out my paper in a hail mary and hoped for the best. I didn't realize this but I have used my friend's paper on my other screen while writing mine so I could get words in my head and onto the paper faster. This obviously is idiotic and I ended up committing an act of plagiarism on that last paragraph as a result (this was the only plagiarized area).  

I did not realize what I had done until the assignments were handed back and I confessed immediately in order to prevent my peer taking any partial blame and I plead my prof to only give me a zero and not him, and luckily my prof agreed to this so my peer was able to walk off with a deserved 70 and I ate the 0 for the plagiarized paragraph. I felt awful. My friends insisted I was overreacting as this assignment is no where to be seen on my official college transcripts but 3 years later I still think about this act. 

For the remainder of my degree I insisted to only proofread for my peers in the presence of others, and I did all my assignments isolated. I acknowledged to my professor and peers that what I did was absolutely low and classless and even with my friends insisting it was not a big deal, it only felt like it was not the case because the head prof of the program spared me because I was otherwise an above-average student in the other classes and I had two classmates willing to advocate for me, as well as the fact that he himself chuckled when I went to his office to speak one on one about it saying that as it was a first-time thing he was okay with just giving a stern warning. I have never done anything close to cheating since, nor had I ever done anything of such a low nature before this during my college career. I profusely apologized to the prof, I have even confessed in the church if that means anything. As nothing ever arose from this situation beyond a stern warning from the head prof, it is no where to be seen on my official transcript or any official writing from the college that I ever committed academic misconduct. The guilt still re-emerges once a week though I am scared that this could affect my ability to ever see law school.

&amp;#x200B;

That following summer I did my internship at a sole proprietorship law office. The lady was nice at first but by my second week things went miserable. Her lead assistant had bad-mouthed me in a misrepresenting way to the lawyer and as a result I was scolded. Her lead assistant did not equally train me as my classmate got hired with me and thus I was constantly behind. Eventually my internship pay was taken and I was screwed to a volunteership. I sucked it up and did the remainder of that internship for free but by the end of it, the lawyer and her assistant and my classmate who was hired with me all hated me despite me genuinely trying to constantly be nice and professional. I cut off ties with that classmate as a result but this bad experience left me unable to have a reference to help me find a job despite me trying to stay in contact with the lawyer.

&amp;#x200B;

I found a volunteer placement afterwards at a personal injury firm. It sucked that while all my peers were off working full-time I was behind and basically doing a second unpaid internship but I sucked it up for four months before the firm told me they had to end the internship due to there being no room at the firm and a lack of resources. I am not sure how true this is but I just hope this means I was not terminated.

&amp;#x200B;

The worst part is I flunked the paralegal licensing exam twice. This crushed my soul to the point where I even made a suicide video that night. After 8 straight months of no job in my field other than that volunteership and on top of that the humiliation of being stuck at my retail job serving samples at costco just revived every ounce of depression I had ever thought I was able to bury. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I mentioned earlier I had confessed my sin of plagiarism at church, in addition to confessing and profusely apologizing to my profs and peers. I mention this as I feel God wanted to smile on me that next day after I learned I failed the licensing exam a second time because I got a call from a personal injury firm that had interviewed me for a law clerk position 4 weeks prior... they had invited me for a second interview. 3 weeks later they had hired me. 

That was in December 2019. Fast forward 18 months later I am still at the firm full-time but now there are issues. I am the only clerk who works for my lawyer and he has about 150-175 active files with 210+ files total. The other clerk there at the time quit and I have been the only clerk for all the files for 15 months. The lawyer is getting frustrated but refuses to admit the volume of work is the reason and that this is a result of a lack of prioritization... which is something I have been trying to work on for 6 months and is not easy to do when there are multiple deadlines everyday. He genuinely has implied he expects me to work multiple extra hours a day for free and will berate me on the phone a lot for my inability to keep up. Every single clerk in my office has looked at my workload and has agreed with the notion that it is a workload for two people (a few insist it is a three person workload but I feel maybe that is stretching it.) I feel like due to how much this situation has made my boss frustrated at me this could inhibit my ability to somehow ever hold up a legal career and I am starting to think I might actually be incompetent or maybe just not able to handle the stress. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am considering going back to school to do a 1-year port-grad in business management so I can just get away from working full-time and figure out what I want career-wise as I know my goal is not to be a law clerk forever. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am so sorry for this long-written post. I am just lost. Is it still worth it to pursue a legal career after everything I have done and all the mistakes made? Please any advice would be appreciated as I just desperately need some guidance here."

nu07qq,64,2021-06-06,A Few Questions Before Considering Oxford or Cambridge,Aneducationabroad,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/nu07qq/a_few_questions_before_considering_oxford_or/,"About this time last year, I wrote two posts, one advocating for students to consider applying to Oxford/Cambridge (from here on referred to as Oxbridge), and one playing Devil’s Advocate.  This was intentional, because Oxbridge (just like anywhere else) are not perfect options for everyone.  

After all, nowhere is perfect for everyone.

Instead, this year I’m going to focus on a few questions, and depending on how you answer, that should determine if Oxbridge is a good option for you.

**Are you passionate about your field of study?**

No place in the United States is going to let you pursue your field of study in as much depth as a typical British university, and few British universities are going to go as in-depth as Oxbridge.  

Before you come at me in the comments, it’s just math:  In the US, you might spend anywhere from 30-60 credit hours in your field of study, so about 1-2 years of study.  In the UK, you spend the vast majority of your time, upwards of 90% of your courses.  

Meanwhile, at Oxbridge, the reading-intensive curriculum, combined with the tutorial system, means that you’re going even more in-depth.

Verdict:  If you really like what you want to study, consider Oxbridge.  Otherwise, it’s probably not the best option.

**Are Your Extracurriculars the Strongest Part of Your Application?**

In the UK, as well as much of the rest of the world, no one cares about your extracurricular activities.  The only exception is if it is directly related to what you want to study; if you worked in a lab and want to study chemistry, that’s relevant.  No one cares about your tennis record.

The fact that sports don’t matter really seems to shock some people; I’ve had enough angry conversations with parents who think that their child’s soccer skills should earn them a Cambridge scholarship.  Given how the Ivy League is an *athletic conference*, this isn’t really a surprise though.

Instead, Oxbridge only cares about interest in a subject as demonstrated through your spare time.  But how do you demonstrate that interest, you may ask.  Extracurriculars are a great way to do so, but also being able to intelligently discuss (in writing) relevant scholarship in a field.  

Interested in applying for an international relations angle on PPE at Oxford?  Then you might want to be prepared to discuss Huntington’s Clash of Civilizations (and be prepared to be disagreed with, no matter what you think).

Verdict:  If you think your ECs aren’t good enough for top universities in the US, look to Oxbridge.  They literally couldn’t care less, unless it’s related to your degree.  Even then, reading in your field will be just as impressive.

**What Do You Want to Do Outside of Class?**

Social life at Oxbridge is quite different than top universities in the US.  Foremost, Greek life isn’t a thing, and college football and basketball don’t exist.  However, Oxbridge has a ton of traditions and social opportunities, revolving around your College, any societies you join, and the annual sports events held between Oxford and Cambridge.  Also, while opinions are mixed, plenty of people I’ve worked with love Formal Hall dinners, which many compare to something out of Harry Potter (but with really great food).

University-level sports is starting to take off in the UK, but about the same level as a club team at a LAC right now; that said, if that’s your thing, it’s worth considering.

Instead, due to term times being relatively short at Oxbridge, you’ll be expected to work hard and play hard.  These are academically demanding places, and the grade inflation you see at practically every American university is less obvious (it’s still there - most everyone gets either a 1st or a 2:1, which is roughly the equivalent of a 3.3 or higher).  The tradeoff is that you’ll have plenty of time for travel, research, or internships away from either Oxford or Cambridge.

Verdict:  Tailgating is best done on this side of the Atlantic, but if the thought of a great three course meal for eight bucks sounds great, then consider Oxbridge.

**How Much Are You Willing to Spend?**

This one is pretty straightforward.  Top universities in the US are pretty generous with their financial aid.  Oxford and Cambridge offer next to nothing to Americans.  Yes, there are some ways around this (if you are a gifted organist, you’re in luck!).  However, if you’re trying to spend or borrow less than $180,000 over the course of the degree, then you’re probably going to want to stay stateside.  (For what it’s worth, we reckon about $135,000 for tuition at most other universities in the UK for the full three year degree).  
If, on the other hand, your family isn’t eligible for financial aid and you’re not expecting much in the way of merit aid, then it can make sense to go to Oxbridge.  They are the two most expensive universities in the UK (outside of some medical schools), but the return on investment of going to either of them is higher than just about any place else on the planet.  Also, there are ways to use federal student loans to pay for 90% of the costs, but I’d only recommend them in a handful of cases.

Verdict:  If you’re already looking at spending more than $180,000 for the cost of your college education, there’s no reason to rule out Oxbridge.  If you’re looking at a lot of financial aid, you might want to reconsider Oxbridge when you are looking for a graduate degree (which allows you to leverage federal loans better).

There's obviously a lot of other differences (I didn't touch on the College system, or how Tripos work at Cambridge), but for those of you in the class of 2022 who are just now arriving (welcome), keep in mind you've only got until October 15, 2022 to apply to Oxford and Cambridge!"

I’ve thought about this a few ways:

1: I either get an entry-level job in IT first FT then if everything is going well be straight up with them and enrol into uni to do the Batch of IT. I would prefer to do it FT but I think the better option would be to do it PT and be more committed to the job but at the same time still studying for the degree.

2. The other option is I enrol into uni now to study FT while applying for PT jobs. If I’m successful be straight up with them that I’m currently studying.

I am not too sure why but some businesses do hire uni students who are studying. I use to see it on a lot of job ads when I was applying. And this is excluding graduate programs and internships etc.

Anyway. IMO I prefer option 1. Basically because depending on how well things are going I may not need to go to uni anyway, and I’ll just end up doing certs.

Thanks."

I decided to get my PhD because I wanted to learn how to think about science and learn the skills I need to one day lead a research team. 

I'm currently starting to plan for my post-candidacy exam life and that includes figuring out my career goals.

Im 26 btw) and tried going off topic by asking me what my ""most memorable "" experience  in college was was.
   * i've changed my mind about not wanting to work there. **I genuinely believe the sexual harassment will occur** but i'm very comfortable confronting my harassers and I don't want that to stop me from pursuing an opportunity . If a man thinks he can harass me just bc he's CEO and I won't put him in his place , the joke is on him. I don't tolerate  harassment, but i **would rather it happen and me let them know they need to stop  (or  alternatively take them to court if they don't ) than to miss out on an opportunity. I've changed my mind from not wanting it to REALLY wanting it.**
* Here's how it went :
* based on the reviews and how they advertised the position , I felt like I would look like a weirdo if I brought it an extra copy of resume that I got the feeling they really didn't need. t**hey proactively recruited me, and hiring manager opened interview with "" I have a vague recollection of your resume but I want to interview you and not your resume""**
* **one of the questions he asked was how long i wanted to work there.** Because of how much I literally couldn't stop telling myself that I didn't want to work there, I stupidly blurted out the first thing that came to my head which was ""a year""  and even volunteered additional information like "" i plan on relocating to a different city after a year"". t**his was right before I just remembered that the job description stated in capital letters that the position I was applying for was a career opportunity.**
* After asking about the culture of firm, **one thing he stated was ""if it's in your lap, even if someone before you messed it up, you have to take care of it""**. When I looked at him unenthused (at the time I wanted him to know I wasn't the most pleased about that)  he spoke up with a smile and said ""it's what I have to do all the time-clean other peoples' mess""
* **he was like what's in that city?** (smile on his face) and remained composed as well as nice but said in a very douchey tone that \*\*""if you're only going to be here for a year then you can't do XYZ position (more advanced position)...this isn't some internship (\*\*I had mentioned doing internships before)
* (I could understand his reasoning but there was no reason to be a dick; he could've just not hired at me at all w/o saying that) . At first I reassured him that that was fine as I wasn't looking to advance or for higher pay as I was focused on work that was in front of me, but him saying that pushed my buttons **so I later followed up with sternly asking him ""well that plan could always change..so if they do, couldn't i still do XYZ position then""**
* he said ""of course..but the position you were offered is all we are going to talk about for 2day okay""
* I didn't say okay lol. Instead I just agreed to take him up on his prior offer( already given to me before he told me I couldn't advance up to position 2)  of speaking to people already in my position  already working there. Earlier, he was eager to ask whether I was interested in meeting the other people in my role? ( *IDK if that was was a good sign or just his way  of wanting to end the interview nicely lol)*
* I met up with her. she tried very hard to sell me the position. Since he had already left the room and never said he would be back, the girl looked around lost and said she would go speak to the front desk and be back . (clearly he never told her he'd be back either)
* he sees us both trying to exit the room, pops out of the other room where he was speaking to attorney #2 about something. he comes out with a smile and asked if we talked. I said yes but his lack of what seemed to be his negligence in planning to say goodbye immediately told me everything I needed to know about his value in me, leaving me upset.
* SO with a smile , I said yes she provided me with a lot of details. I adjust my backpack strap over my shoulders and turn my body slightly the other way and idk if it was b/c he got the impression i wanted to leave, but he immediately says "" okay have a goodnight"" and ""goodbye"" with a reassuring wave as if he really meant it while saying it in a nice tone but slightly ""ok then"" kind of tone.
* \------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* I know you may advise against me working there based on the shit employer. But I don't want to let their bullshit stop me and I regret it making me shy away of the opportunity which is why I want to send a letter..just for my own closure I guess. Do y'all think I should? Interviw was WEd, I'd be sending the letter Mon after not hearing back. He (CEO) is definitely not the indecisive type/
   * . **I've changed my mind and really want the job**
   * I will also say that the firm actively recruited me. gave my resume a like online, e-mailed me at 9am the very next business day after i sent in my app,asked me to please respond to that in the same e-mail, and the owner of the firm (hiring manger) was even very proactive about the receptionist sending me certain details about the interview by e-mailing her twice to send them. He waited at the front door for me to arrive as well . (I was not late). Job offer stated that it was a chance for college grads to prove themselves, he hired based on a GPA requirement that I exceeded, a**nd stated in the interview because I worked hard in school, he knew I met the 3 qualities he thought were sufficient to be successful. (I asked him what seperates the successful vs unsuccessful employees, he stated ""3 simple things"" and said I had them even if I didn't know it yet)**"

Currently, a summer break is going on at my uni where I am totally free for some months. I want to utilize this time doing internships and learning more but since this computer science field is very fast, I am so confused.

I have an year left till my bachelors degree is over. And, the thing about me is I am jack of all trades but can't pick  a single domain. I am not particularly interested in one specific field. I have done small projects in C, Java, Python, Node.JS, Express, React, Flutter, Wordpress (with both relational and non relational databases) and what not. My college is focused on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence so I have plenty knowledge in the field as well.

I worked as an intern in a Networking company in the second semester for 3 months which made me realize why I was not at all interested in the Networking sector as it was static and there was not much to learn. My parents want me to work in the Government Banking sector but I have no idea about the work that I need to do there. I would be very grateful if somebody could answer on how my knowledge could help me get a job and grow in the Nepalese banking sector.

I already worked as an intern in a sector where I don't want to be involved at and this time I want to pick one specific domain, learn 18 hrs/day, do an internship, do the final year project with the same domain, get a very high paying job and enjoy my life. That is my goal.

My biggest fear is completing my course (Its a 3 year course Bsc. Computer Science) and after all that start a job from the very beginning. I want to be fully prepared till the time I get my degree. I am very enthusiastic in learning.

Please do not say ""pick one career which interests you the most"" because I find everything interesting and that's why the confusion exists all along. Please don't judge if I said anything wrong and show me the path for my future."

I do have a academic experiences in programming (game development, C++, C#) but when it comes to anything cloud related, Google Cloud or AWS, my mind just blanks out within minutes and I can barely absorb any information. Extremely frustrating honestly and I can't muster enough patience or it.


Been thinking of quitting, but it is part of a government initiated skills programme and there might be consequences related to job profile... but this is extremely demoralizing. Anyone else experienced or experiencing similar issues? Advice would be appreciated.

I was depressed for about 5 years of my life before I found a way to turn it all around and make myself a happier and more motivated person. Even through an especially isolated last year where I haven't got to see my friends even once, I managed to find ways to stay positive and keep on going, performing really quite well in my law degree. 

However, recently I was hit with some very harsh personal health issues in my family, that left me with some terrible losses and got me completely off-track. I ended up performing my worst ever in an exam and it has brought my entire average (that I worked so hard to maintain) at a terrible low. I still have 5 final exams to take but I am absolutely mortified and unable to get myself to work. For some reason I am bombing all the interviews I manage to get for internships at all the best law firms and I just feel like a massive failure that is at the brink of losing everything good in life. 

My best friends are in another country and we are permanently separated thanks to this pandemic. I have absolutely no social life or any outlet at all. I feel trapped by both the current global situation as well as my growing incompetence at achieving anything. I feel physically sick throughout the days and just know that I am on a slope down depression hill again, but I don't know how to stop or get better. How can I overcome this?

tl'dr: usually a great student and positive about life, suddenly going through an extremely rough patch w my performance all round, feeling depressive."

Everything was fine, doing the regular 40 hour work week and all; then this past week my mentor started coming in late because she just “didn’t feel like waking up” or leaving early because “the weather’s too nice”.
I’m only here because it’s seriously cutting into my hours and could be a long term issue and make me look like I’m the ‘lazy intern’. Her boss recommends coming in early/leaving late mentality which I’m fine with assuming there’s work to be done.

Does anyone have any tips/advice for me? I’m very excited but also quite nervous. As I am not doing the graduate scheme, should I expect to receive any training?

I am also in dean's honour list and have 86.5% major (last 4 semester) gpa, and was told by my academic advisor that I will be in top 5% in the entire Electrical and Computer Engineering faculty. However, my luck is not clicking with big name tech companies and my resume is getting rejected at initial stages.

I got my resume reviewed a lot of times and posted it in this sub and other subs and all said I have a very impressive resume. I also applied via referrals but that didn't help me in any sensible ways. I have given up getting anything from those faang companies as intern/new grad.

**(Main Part):** I heard that it is pretty easy to secure an interview after 1-2 yoe (years of experience) from those companies, however going through several posts on cscareerquestions, it seems like a mixed bag when it comes to passing the interviews. So I just want to gain some insight from people who couldn't secure a new grad/intern role at any faang companies or any other major tech companies (IBM, SAP, Splunk, Lyft, Uber etc) but later secured a role after few yoe. My questions to you are:

1. Is it a faang company or any other major company that you secured your offers from ?
2. How easy/difficult was it for you to get/secure an interview?
3. Did you apply online or a recruiter reached out to you on Linkedin/email/phone?
4. How difficult was your interview? Were you able to provide the optimal solutions to your problems on the first try when interviewing?
5. How long was your interview and how many rounds?
6. Was there any scaling/role changes (for example you interviewed for SDE ii but they gave you an offer for SDE 1)
7. How long did you prepare? What was your preparation schedule (like 2 hours/day doing leetcode, 1 hr/day doing system design etc)?
8. How many leetcode have you done (I would really appreciate if you list something like x amounts of easy, y amounts of med, and z amounts of hard etc)

Thank you so much for your time."
nuaw1l,73,2021-06-07,Social Exhaustion,Red_Radish0202,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/nuaw1l/social_exhaustion/,"Hello,

I don’t know if anyone here felt the same but I just needed a place to rant. I didn’t know who to talk to or where to post this.

I’m an extreme introvert and only feel comfortable talking to my friends. I get so tired talking to professors, TAs, and new people. I’m about to finish my first year of college and looking back I feel as though I could’ve done better if I had reach out to talk to those more well verse in the subjects. It doesn’t help that I’m a STEM major taking multiple 300 level classes.

When I did manage to gather up the courage to talk to the professor or the TA sometimes it feels like I can’t communicate well with them or ask the right question to get myself to understand the material and it just makes talking to them feel that much longer. Once we’re done talking and I leave being more confuse than ever, I would just collapse on my bed after the long social interaction. And I have to do this constantly for 3 different classes everyday. I’ve had a couple of situation where my anxieties sky rockets to the point of anxiety attacks.

I’m afraid of how my mental state will be for when we have in person classes. My college goes by the quarter system, so we have 3 quarters total in a year. After Autumn quarter we have about a month break (which is a joy) before Winter quarter. And after Winter quarter we have only a week break before Spring quarter, and this is where my mental exhaustion hits me like a truck.

I don’t particularly have a choice since I’m not a genius student. I constantly have low self esteem, imposter syndrome, anxiety, and need help understanding the material. Which forces me to ask others for help but the more I interact with people, friend or not, I just collapse on my bed in exhaustion after just a short 30 minutes talk. 

I never had this issue in high school since the material in high school wasn’t as difficult and rarely had to talk to people since I already knew what to do. I wasn’t a mute in high school just didn’t talked as much as I did in college. 

I considered getting some mental help but the thought of more social situation spikes my anxiety. I don’t want people to worry about me either and constantly making sure I’m alright since that also spikes my anxiety and external self awareness.

That about sums up my rant. I’m so tired and I don’t want to go through this for 3 more years. I’m also concern about the amount of social interaction I’ll have to do to finding a internship or a job after college. Growing up to be apart of society standards is driving me insane and I wish I could just isolate myself from the world forever.

Thank you for reading &lt;3. I’m a total mess lol.


TL;DR: Exhausted introvert college freshman with lots of anxiety is tired of talking to people and just wants to sleep her days away.

Edit: Am I going through a social burnout and academic burnout?"

I am also in dean's honour list and have 86.5% major (last 4 semester) gpa, and was told by my academic advisor that I will be in top 5% in the entire Electrical and Computer Engineering faculty. However, my luck is not clicking with big name tech companies and my resume is getting rejected at initial stages.

I got my resume reviewed a lot of times and posted it in this sub and other subs and all said I have a very impressive resume. I also applied via referrals but that didn't help me in any sensible ways. I have given up getting anything from those faang companies as intern/new grad.

**(Main Part):** I heard that it is pretty easy to secure an interview after 1-2 yoe (years of experience) from those companies, however going through several posts on cscareerquestions, it seems like a mixed bag when it comes to passing the interviews. So I just want to gain some insight from people who couldn't secure a new grad/intern role at any faang companies or any other major tech companies (IBM, SAP, Splunk, Lyft, Uber etc) but later secured a role after few yoe. My questions to you are:

1. Is it a faang company or any other major company that you secured your offers from ?
2. How easy/difficult was it for you to get/secure an interview?
3. Did you apply online or a recruiter reached out to you on Linkedin/email/phone?
4. How difficult was your interview? Were you able to provide the optimal solutions to your problems on the first try when interviewing?
5. How long was your interview and how many rounds?
6. Was there any scaling/role changes (for example you interviewed for SDE ii but they gave you an offer for SDE 1)
7. How long did you prepare? What was your preparation schedule (like 2 hours/day doing leetcode, 1 hr/day doing system design etc)?
8. How many leetcode have you done (I would really appreciate if you list something like x amounts of easy, y amounts of med, and z amounts of hard etc)

Thank you so much for your time."

nucso8,2,2021-06-07,ex-clients want to follow me to my new job and I feel a little guilty,throwawayrain_39,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/nucso8/exclients_want_to_follow_me_to_my_new_job_and_i/,"Hi there, I'm stuck in a little moral pickle and would like some advice!

Basically when covid hit we were told that we had to be scaled back from full time to freelancers in my ex-company. I continued freelancing for this ex-company while getting my own clients outside. 2 of the clients I have worked with in the past as a full timer, and now as a freelancer (though I was still working under the company name, so I don't think they actually knew I had 'left'). In the recent months, I haven't really been getting any jobs from this company anymore and it was quite hard to come by enough freelance work, so I applied for a full time job and managed to pass the interviews! I'm currently wrapping up my last few freelance jobs before I transition back to 9-6 working life.

Here's the dilemma: the past week I've gotten texts from the 2 ex-clients asking if I was still working for my ex-company as they have potential projects coming up. When I mentioned I no longer worked with (ex-company) and tried to refer them back to the owners, one of them offered me an internship which I turned down, and both requested for my new company's contacts so that they could get a quotation and the ball rolling with their projects.

While I'm ecstatic that these clients like my work so much they are willing to follow me, I feel super guilty somehow for sorta 'poaching' potential clients from my ex-company. My ex-company was really very good to me, and they helped me grow a lot as a industry professional, and brought myself out of my introverted shell. But since last year they've been struggling so badly to the point they had to downscale the staff. They're just getting by now and the husband (bosses were a couple) had to find a new full time job while still running the company. I myself was surprised that the clients both contacted me as I didn't actually handle the clients till quotations and briefs were settled (aka my interactions with them were completely production based).

How should I go about handling this? I feel very guilty about the clients following me (there were actually another 2 clients who had asked me to let them know when I move on from (ex-company) months ago), as I feel like I'm stealing income from a struggling friend that taught me a lot. Should I inform my ex-company out of courtesy and respect? What would be a good way to handle this?"
nud4m5,66,2021-06-07,"Lazy classmate gets the internship I interviewed for, while I didn't...",gpodjoe,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/nud4m5/lazy_classmate_gets_the_internship_i_interviewed/,"Software engineering student. 4.0 GPA, hard worker, always go out of the way to put in 110% effort. Always the go-to guy for the other students whenever they skip class, miss something in class or don't understand the topic at all. I applied for an internship.

I am feeling very bad because lazy classmate who never cared about studying or learning anything, skips classes almost all the time, kept failing exams and having to repeat exams, applied for the same internship I did and got the job instead of me. I know I am just sounding like a bitter jealous brat, but when you're the one who works your ass off and go out of your way to get a 4.0 GPA but got passed over for some lazy asshole with a low-ass GPA and zero work ethics, the feeling sucks.

Dude won't even stop bragging about how much he's getting paid for the internship and the holiday bonuses to people, it's sickening. When someone else brags about their GPA he gets crazy and pissy. It's stupid.

I honestly have no idea what companies are looking for anymore these days, is it my interview skills/talking skills or my actual hard skills, and soft skills in the form of work ethics? It's hard enough with COVID being a factor for less internship opportunities, and the fact that I have a stammer. Any advice on how to get rid of this bad feeling and what companies are looking for?"
nud7xh,179,2021-06-07,The All-Application Rejects,materialb0y,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/nud7xh/the_allapplication_rejects/,"Sorry, had to force that pun. But long story short, today marks the official end of my 2021 grad school (MSc) applications journey with 4/4 rejections.

Thinking about it, it was around this time last year that I was brimming with confidence. I mean, I was on track to graduate with Latin honors from one of the best unis here in our country, two publications (both 1st author), and an international research internship under my belt. I also eventually got an above average score for IELTS (after begrudgingly letting go of half a month's worth of salary just to take this goddamn exam). I thought that I had somehow increased my chances at getting admitted to grad school. Boy was I wrong.

After painstakingly tailoring my motivation letters and CV to each program, highlighting my competencies on the research areas the programs were known for, I still received rejection after rejection. My most recent one being the MEngg BME program of NUS, which took a little more than 4 months to release a decision. If I wasn't the meatbag of anxiety that I am, I wouldn't have known about the results because they don't email you.

I also applied to three Erasmus masters programs, and I got really close to getting accepted to one program but alas, I was just waitlisted. Further, I was way far down the waitlist to even have an inkling of hope of getting into the main list. I was just merely eligible to apply as a self-funded applicant (which I obviously can't lol). It was kinda hard to swallow the jealousy when I later heard that one of my workmates got accepted to that same program I was waitlisted in.

After having processed my emotions, I realized that all the rejections I received this application cycle was really humbling. I should never be too complacent with what I currently have and strive to achieve more, build my skillset, and accumulate relevant research experience if I really wanted to cinch the program offer. And since I'm not a 4.0-GPA student, I of course I have to exert more effort on filling in my gaps. I have resolved myself to focus on my current research job, hopefully produce one or two publications out of this, learn more characterization techniques, and try again next year.

I've read here, on several occasions, other aspiring grad students that braved through more rejections than I did. For that, I salute you all! May we never lose the vigor that we have to enter grad school in the near future.

Stay safe, everyone!"
nudu1b,0,2021-06-07,Feeling extremely demotivated after a drop in my GPA.,Mkadmii,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/nudu1b/feeling_extremely_demotivated_after_a_drop_in_my/,"Hey everyone.

I’m (F19) a CS and Math double major sophomore (going into junior) next year. Throughout my freshman year I’ve thankfully managed to maintain a GPA of 4.0 and was really happy about it.

My sophomore year however, the courses became a lot more difficult and demanding. Taking math and CS courses without any electives to lighten my load really took a toll on me and it showed on my GPA. I went from being a straight 4.0, to a 3.92, to a now 3.87.

Yes, I am aware that the GPA is still good. However, I put all my time and energy into my courses, which means I haven’t been doing any internships or personal projects. Every time a vacation rolls around, I’m either too burnt out to do anything, or I’m doing a summer semester and can’t really intern because of it.

I feel extremely hollow and demotivated and upset that my efforts haven’t really paid off the way I wanted them to. And now it’s EXTREMELY difficult to raise my GPA (I need to get like a bunch of straight A’s just to raise it by 0.01). I keep comparing myself to others and beating myself up about it to no end. I’m paranoid that I won’t have anything to put on my CV (literally no awards, no internships yet, no personal projects, etc).

Do you guys have any words of advice on what to do?"

I have a 3.49 GPA, there's 1 week left of school and I have all A's in my classes so its going to rise to about a 3.52, or something around there. I had a Major Spike in my grades from Freshman year to Sophomore &amp; Junior Year, But I don't know if a 3.52 GPA is going to cut it for schools I want to get into.  Here's more context of my situation. Freshman year I had about a 3.0 GPA, My mom had Ulcerative colitis, scoliosis, epilepsy and was very weak so I was helping her during that time, I was playing basketball, and I wasn't even thinking about my GPA or any Top-Tier Colleges. Sophomore year rolls around and I kind of ""got my act together"" and came out with a around a 3.6 GPA that year. Junior year (current) is when I realized I want to go to a top tier, I put in the work this year and I'm going to end of with a 3.9 Cumulative for junior year. I took the ACT early this year and got a 33. I'm going to  make a better visual representation underneath this ""monologue""  of what I've done in my high school career along side the schools I want to apply to.

COVID blewwwwwww hard for new grads entering the job market. I’m posting here to tell my story and how the chips fell, hopefully giving encouragement to the community here. 

I was targeting real estate technology companies for product marketing roles. (That was the first thing: apply where you’d like to work, not just wherever a hiring). I had an internship at such a company, got great exposure/experience and mentors, yet there was no budget for an entry-level, full timer like me -.- Such is life. For the next 4 months I applied to companies in NY, DC, and CA, endured multiple 3 round interviews, and still got no where I wanted. One company I had an internal referral and numerous recs: still went to guy with more experience. Such is life. Unfortunately, job postings are saturated with SDR (sales development rep) roles, so I decided to apply to an “SDR apprenticeship.” I knew I’d be a cold call monkey, but it was a 3 month contract worth $7500. The job sucked. So, so bad. But in my time working there, I continued to network with coworkers and companies in the area. (That’s the second thing: networking isn’t a means to an end. It’s a mode of being. Always, always network and talk of your interests. You’d be surprised by the people willing to give out leads and advice). Finally, I reached out to the lady that worked at my college career center. We had been close friends for a few years and we bullshit from time to time. She invited me to an alumni event, which I would never attend out of my own volition, but I went anyways. I met an alumni who was CEO of a long-standing real estate company in Southern CA. I asked if he could review my resume and offer some tips based on the industry I was targeting. Not long after, I’m on the phone with his operations person regarding an investment analyst position. Two interviews later, I received an offer. I’m on the bus on the way to my first day now. (This was the third thing: leverage every resource you have, be authentically interested in the people who can help you, and be sure the value you bring matches your enthusiasm for the work). 

It took nearly 6 months, but I am now gainfully employed. I read a post from a hopeless fella looking for work this year. I know it’s hard guys, but don’t fret. Your next big opportunity might be right under your nose!"

My goal is to pursue a PhD at a top grad school after graduating (MIT, Stanford, CMU, UW...).

As I enter under grad, I want to make choices that maximize my chances. Of course I'll aim for a ~4.0, high GRE scores, but beyond that, what would be best? Would a mix of research experience and industry internships be important, or just research? 

I have enough credits to graduate from UMass in 3 years, and would like to do so to save some money. Would losing the year of research disadvantage me?

Would doing research in Math in addition to CS be helpful? I'm interesting in exploring Math, hence the major, so I'd love to explore it, but also want to make sure it isn't a disadvantage. 

Is there anything I should learn prior to attending to increase the chances faculty will let me research with them? I was thinking of studying a few professors current research, and understanding their papers, so I can discuss it with them and peak their intrest in me. 

Finally, are research internships usually paid? If so, how much? Out of state tuition for UMass is a lot, so I want to recoup as much money as possible :)

Thanks for the help, and if this is not the place for this type of question let me know and I'll gladly remove it!"

I do other stuff to ""make up"" for it, this very summer as I told them I have a software project with a client I'm dealing with personally, and they really liked that. And I fit their candidate/profile perfectly at least according to them.

nuhkaj,2,2021-06-07,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (6/7/2021),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/nuhkaj/weekly_job_qa_thread_672021/,"Hi all,

Here is the sixty-sweventh installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

\--Nick

Some things i am doing to enter this field are :
-learning through various sites(udemy, coursera, internshala) about data science and ml 
-learning python.
-trying to learn basics of statistics.
It's been 6 days since i started doing all these and decided to ask a question on reddit to know more from seniors/experienced people who are already in this field.

I have been searching about this all over the internet for the past 3 days and these are my current expectations or aim below:
-i will continue to learn ds and ml for about a year more on my own during which i will create my own predictive models and try to deploy them
- after 1 year i want to try and get an internship(paid/unpaid doesn't matter) and try to get real experience from the said internship 
This is my current goal and i only wrote this goal so that you may get to know my mindset and then advise me accordingly 

So my question is what to do next/more so that it may benefit me in the future.Also while answering please tell me where you work and your position.

Tldr or summary of my question - I am a first year in college, decided 6 days ago that i want to enter the field of data science and machine learning now asking advise from people who are already in this field in India.

Your tips/response would be appreciated sir/madam."

nuo63a,1,2021-06-07,Transfer student in desperate need of advice!,Emergency_Fall_5386,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/nuo63a/transfer_student_in_desperate_need_of_advice/," Hello everybody, I'm currently a rising sophomore at a completely nontarget state school in the Midwest. I have a strong GPA (3.95), as well as relevant extracurriculars and community involvement. I realized I'd have to transfer if I wanted a shot at a career in IB, and applied to a variety of semi target schools. I've been admitted into Fordham and Indiana University, among others. I am having a really tough time deciding which of the two I should attend, so I've turned to reddit for advice. 

**Indiana University**

Pros: 

1. Kelly Business School is consistently ranked in the top 25 of the nation
2. Investment Banking Workshop at IU has great placement in IB
3. IU is 20k cheaper than Fordham

Cons: 

1. I've only been accepted as a general transfer, not into the Kelly Business School which adds another degree of uncertainty
2. Being a transfer student, it is more difficult for me to be accepted into the IBW since I am a year behind my peers in terms of networking and extracurriculars
3. Not so fond of the whole 'state school party lifestyle' IU is known for

**Fordham Gabelli**

Pros:

1. I've been accepted directly into Gabelli Business School
2. Fordham has strong internship and networking oppurtunities bc of the services offered by the school and it's geographical placement
3. 20k a year scholarship at Fordham 
4. Good BB placement for undergrad alumnus 

Cons: 

1. More expensive than Indiana
2. Gabelli is ranked 58 while Kelly is ranked 23 by US News

&amp;#x200B;

These are the primary factors that I am considering while making my decision. I am leaning towards Fordham, but I'm just not sure if it's the right choice. It seems that IU is generally a better choice for landing IB positions out of college, although I'm nor sure if this is true considering my specific situation, and I don't want to bank on getting into the IBW at IU. Cost is also a factor for me, although I can afford both. I really don't know what to do, please help!  

I've included a poll for people to vote.

nuoae1,0,2021-06-07,Leaving a full-time position I'm not loving for an internship that is a key to my dream job,CiciGrace,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nuoae1/leaving_a_fulltime_position_im_not_loving_for_an/,"It's kind of a long backstory so bear with me. 

Last Spring I got accepted into my dream internship program. My team was amazing, and I loved my job. I even got offered an extension to stay until December. Two weeks later, covid hit, and all interns were let go permanently by mid-April. 

I graduated in May with my bachelor's degree, and by August I started remotely as a full time firmware engineer at a well known company. In December, I moved 2,000 miles to be onsite. I'm not loving the job, but I figured a big name would look really good on a resume, as well as give me some decent experience. 

Just last week, I was offered a chance to come back to my dream internship. The company I was interning with was hit really hard by covid, and there haven't been any full time openings on my old team since I was let go. However, I would be re-joining my old team if I took the internship. This company is pretty big on hiring from within, and my best chance of getting a full time job with them in the future is by going through the internship program. But even then, it's not guaranteed. 

My question is, is it worth it? Is it worth leaving my full time, salaried position to chase this dream job? If I did leave my current job, take this internship, and then NOT convert to a full-time position at my dream job, how would that look on a resume to future employers? Am I just going to hurt my chances further down the line?"

I want to share some of my own experiences with you guys and hopefully you won’t make the same mistakes I made. I was the perfect high school student on paper. I had the highest GPA, I was a leader of numerous clubs, I was awarded MVP in almost every activity I did, and I did multiple internships. 

But to be honest, none of it mattered as much as I hoped it would. Throughout my high school life, I struggled with mental health issues, I was constantly stressed, and I was lonely. College was the only thing on my mind. I missed out on chances to hang out with friends and make lasting memories because I wanted to study for tests, to do another EC, to study for SATs. I had no time to enjoy myself and I slowly lost my friends because of it.

In the end, I was awarded Valedictorian and won a bunch of senior honors. But the days leading up to graduation was the loneliest I’ve ever felt. I gave up so much for a title and for college.

Don’t be like me. Manage your time better, spend quality time with the people you like, and take a break every once in a while. I wish I had more high school memories to look back on instead of arbitrary titles. And take a break from a2c if you’re on here 24/7 like me. Go enjoy yourself and come here to ask questions and share memes. Make the best out of your high school lives because it really goes by in an instant.


TL;DR: Work hard but don’t forget to enjoy yourself, I wish I had more high school memories to look back on instead of just a title."

Can I negotiate an earlier start date for the internship?",treesofthemind,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/nuqy67/negotiation_job_timings_have_an_internship_for/,"Hi, quite a convoluted question here but please bear with me.

TL;DR - Interesting internship would start at the exact same time as a more longer term, secure position - could I somehow negotiate an earlier start date/shorter duration?  


I applied for a venture capital summer internship programme (2 months duration) earlier this year, wasn't placed for the summer cohort as there weren't enough slots, and got placed into the autumn cohort instead (September to October). I went through the interview process with different funds more for practice, because I doubted that I would get placed (due to the high competition).  


I was also interviewing simultaneously for longer term, tech based training roles that start around September/October. I've since found that I have been offered a few of these, and I'm definitely intending to take one as I prioritise working in tech - as a software dev/architect/etc - as opposed to working in VC, for what would only be a short internship.  


However, I'm aware of how competitive this internship programme is and how fortunate I was to have received a placement at all. I really wish that I could somehow negotiate with them to potentially do the internship earlier, or for a shorter period - for the month of August potentially, if July isn't possible.  


I would be willing to work unpaid for this period. It isn't very long at all (have savings) - and also probably remote due to Covid, so no commute cost. I would really love the chance to learn more about VC, and I really enjoyed the interview with the fund I have been placed with for the internship programme. I felt that we had a great synergy, and it would be a massive shame if I couldn't work with them in some way.  
I would have to talk to the organisers of the internship programme, and the representative of the fund, and of course they will mostly likely say no categorically. There is a summer cohort and an autumn cohort, and I unfortunately did not get a summer slot. They probably wouldn't be able to shuffle the timings for one person, even if I asked to work unpaid.   


My policy is to interview for everything and then decide - because you never truly know what a position/company will be like until you actually do the interview. I did not anticipate being placed anywhere, which is why I went through the entire interview process for the tech roles and the VC internship, even though I knew there would be a clash if I was fortunate enough to receive offers in both.   


I would hate to let the chance ""slip"" through my fingers, as VC is a very hierarchical/guarded industry and even a month or less of experience in a fund would be highly valuable. But of course, I do not intend to go for an 8 week internship programme with the slight possibility of a longer position as opposed to a tech training role of 3 /4 years duration, which would help me develop the concrete skills to succeed in what is also a highly competitive industry. At the same time, I would hate to lose the tenuous connection with the VC sphere I have built here.  


Would be really grateful for any advice on how to proceed."

nur0p4,0,2021-06-07,Aspiring to work to work in Finance after grad school. Should I transfer to a “lesser” undergrad school for cheaper tuition?,PwningNoobz,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/nur0p4/aspiring_to_work_to_work_in_finance_after_grad/,"Incoming undergrad freshman here. My goal is to go to grad school for either math or CS and ultimately get a job at a fund, maybe as a quant (dev or trading). Not particularly interested in research or risk, although I’m still unsure what job I want specifically since I’m not 100% certain what the jobs really entail tbh.

Anyways, I recently ended up committing to UMich for CS. Back then, I thought it was a great idea because of how much everyone around me was shilling UMich and their CS program, but the more I reflect, the more I’m convinced I fucked up big. I love the school, it was in my top 4 or so schools to attend when I applied after all, but the thing making me doubt my decision now is that I’m going to have to pay upwards of 60k a year to attend. What upsets me even more was that I got an offer to Vandy (as a math major) for a total cost of around 45k and an offer from my state’s flagship with a scholarship of 12k. I didn’t consider my state school at all because I (naively) thought I deserved to get into much better schools for cheaper, and now I’m really regretting it.

Anyways, rant aside, what do you guys think I should do? Does undergrad really matter that much if my goal is to ultimately attend grad school? If so, should I transfer to my state college (UMD @ College Park) after my first year, for hopefully a way cheaper tuition in order to not unnecessarily incur a shit ton of debt before I’m even completely done with my studies.

Bonus question: what should I do now in the Summer? Try to get internships, study math, or just chill? I’ve already taken Calc 3 and Discrete, so I’m not exactly sure how I should go about this Summer to prepare for college and make my time somewhat productive. Thanks, guys."

nuse1a,1,2021-06-07,Choose between my career and the girl I'm gonna marry someday,RoundCycle833,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/nuse1a/choose_between_my_career_and_the_girl_im_gonna/,"So this is quite a long story but I’m going to try my best to shorten it. 

  
I just completed my postgraduate medical degree and have been accepted as an intern for a year to work in Ireland. The past four years were absolutely horrid for me as I didn’t have anybody in med school to talk to or anyone I could relate to and I was in a very bad place mentally. I feel like I really lost myself and that affected my performance too. Then, around 7 months ago, I met someone. She was unlike anybody else I’d ever met and for the first time in four years, I truly felt like myself again. She’s now my girlfriend and I genuinely see myself marrying her one day in the future. We’ve only been dating for 4 months but I just know she’s the one. She’s just finished the 1st year of her undergrad medical degree (that is 6 years long), and she’s also 11 years younger than I am. This has never really bothered either of us though. 

  
If I take the job in Ireland, I’ll have to be away for a year from her after being together for only around 7 months. One thing I’m afraid of is that might strain our relationship as she doesn’t really have a support system here yet and her classmates are not the best people I’ve met. If I extended my graduation and stayed, I would do electives in the UK and prepare for the step exams as my end goal is to work in the States. I also think that living with my girlfriend with another year would really strengthen our relationship and just be pure bliss. I’d also be able to be with her and help her while she is in her 2nd year and hopefully will make a few good friends with her classes being in person and not online. If I stay for another year, I’ll apply to the UK and US next year and leave but I think we’ll be in a better place both together and individually then. I’d rather leave her in a year than now. I also genuinely do not mind taking a gap year. I also don't feel like I'm ready to leave just yet. I only got the news three days ago and have 6 days before I have to fly, were I to leave. 

On the other hand, if I took the job, I’d gain more experience and have another thing to add to my application to the States. It would also help me write the second Step exam. But I’m absolutely terrified that I’ll be so depressed and like my old self again and just not be able to perform well and lose the motivation to study simultaneously for the Step exams and give them and end up in America. The first 6 months of my job require me to stay in quite a rural area and I’m afraid of what all of these combined will do to my mental health.

My girlfriend wants to go to the US too and we plan on being together there within the next 5-6 years. It might sound incredibly tough and quite implausible but we’re determined to make it work. I genuinely love the girl with all my heart and would do anything for her. I know she feels the same. 

I’m confused about whether I should take the job or stay here with her for another year and study for the Step and do electives. Everybody is telling me different things and I am completely unable to make a decision. My girlfriend told me I should do what makes me the happiest and most satisfied as that will push me to achieve my end goal. But I still do not know what I want.   
I’d really appreciate any advice you guys have. Thank you so much! 

**TLDR**; I don't know if I should choose my career for the next 1 year or stay with my girlfriend. Choosing the latter will still eventually lead me to succeed in my goals though.

Edit: wasn’t sure if it was obvious but if I left now, we would have to do long distance for at least 5 or 6 years as neither of us are located in the US or UK."
nushok,5,2021-06-07,Feeling too tired to do leetcode after internship,Starlordx160,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nushok/feeling_too_tired_to_do_leetcode_after_internship/,"Any other interns or people finding it so tiring to leetcode at the end of the day rt after work ends. I (rising junior) feel like I need to leetcode so that next year I get a better internship than this year. However I don’t feel like that’s the best way to live my life during the summer. It’s probably best to get a nice internship or new grad offers though. To be honest I would rather spend this summer relaxing instead of interning.

Does it get any easier as you get older with the leetcode?"
nuu9db,1,2021-06-07,Career in IT audit vs tech solutions?,Ambitious-Cat195,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nuu9db/career_in_it_audit_vs_tech_solutions/,I am currently doing a Master's in computer info systems and recently received 2 offers for internships - 1 one risk advisory at a Big4 and 1 at a medium sized health tech company for technology planning. My background is actually in health and I have very little insight in the tech industry. Which one is a more viable career in tech and lead to more exit options? I've heard risk advisory is essentially IT auditing and a dead end. The technology planning one I am assuming is similar to a pre-sales solutions role. What should I try to focus on/pursue? Any insights on salary caps/ work life balance/ day to day of either? Any advice from the industry is appreciated!

nuvmkh,1,2021-06-07,"Chance Me: Masters in CS (Stanford, CMU, Berkeley, UIUC...) Fall 2022",DeepM1nD,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/nuvmkh/chance_me_masters_in_cs_stanford_cmu_berkeley/,"Hey peeps!  


I'm looking to enroll in a Masters program for the Fall 2022 cycle. I'm hella worried that my application  is weak for the top schools and I'd highly appreciate it if y'all can Chance Me for these top schools and also other schools like UIUC, GA Tech, etc.

Here's a little context about what my application will look like:

**Undergrad University (I'm a rising senior):** An international student majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. Also, I'm studying in a top 100 University in the United States. 

**GPA:** 4.0/4.0  

**Research Experience:**  My research experience is pretty limited (I think). I Will have about 2 semesters of research (both of them are separate projects) by the application deadline. However, one of these was not as useful because it was the first time the research program was being held.  For clarification,  I have no publications. 

**Work Experience:** Currently working as a Software Engineering Intern at a Startup. It's my only one that counts. I had one freshman year but it was, for lack of a better word, useless.

I've also served as an undergrad TA and it was a great experience for me. Got a lot of positive words from the students and the professor I worked with. Willl get the position this Fall again but probably won't take it up because I'll be busy with research and grad school apps.

**LORs:** I have one professor who will write me a solid recommendation letter because I've known/worked with him for over a year now. I can get another solid recommendation letter from my internship manager, who happens to be the CTO of the startup I'm working at. I have 2 more potential options for professors, one of whom can write me a decent letter (""stellar performance in class....."") and one of them would be my future research advisor and I'm not how that will go so... yea 

**Coursework:** I've taken pretty hard classes like Systems Prograaming, Intro to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Intro to Data Science, a bunch of math and stats courses too.

**Extracurriculars:** Was on the e-board of the school badminton team, am a member of a ton of CS orga but nothing special. Took part in a couple hackathons (pre-COVID) but didn't win anything cuz I was pretty much going for the fun and learning experience.  Dropped out of the Honors College cuz I was being challenged in areas like History that I wasn't passionate about.

I've been a Resident Assistant for 3 years now, worked for the admissions office and also worked as a tour guide. Served as a mentor as a result of one of the CS orgs I was part of.

**Target Schools:** Obviously some of the top schools, Stanford being my dream school. Other schools include Berkeley, UIUC, GA Tech, University of San Francisco (Safety). Still looking for Safety schools, please drop recommendation if you have any, I'll appreciate it

**My Goal for Grad School:** As of now I'm looking for professional Masters's programs in COmputer Science with an emphasis on Data Science- preferably a non-thesis one because I'm not sure I have a competitive profile for it. I haven't had any great research experiences yet either but I love projects - hence the non-thesis preference. 

Thanks in advance guys! I'd really appreciate your feedback and what else I can do to improve my profile. I hope this gives a good background of my application, do let me know if I missed anything that was important.   


Peaceeee"

nuvvit,1,2021-06-08,What do I have to do to get a job...been looking for a year since graduation,Wu-Han,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/nuvvit/what_do_i_have_to_do_to_get_a_jobbeen_looking_for/,"I have a masters in finance from a top school, just took CFA 3, two top internships on the buy side (+2 other less real internships, but still in finance), and have gotten to 4 final round interviews at decent firms but failed. Also have been applying everywhere in terms of location because I can pretty much work anywhere - Canada, UK, or Hong Kong.

I don’t want to do IBD and would prefer to do AM/PE or even WM. Those 4 final rounds were all in AM/PE but all different - 1 at hedge fund, 1 at PE team for pension plan, 1 at endowment, 1 at real estate PE. And those were a pain to prepare for because each motivation and story is different so I can’t imagine having to do merger modelling and all that for IBD...

I’ve done reflections and wrote down all questions I could remember immediately after each interview so I could see what to improve - in most cases each interview was basically the same questions except different interviewer. I think I aced behavioral side of things because I used the same answers in previous rounds and got through successfully. Some technical parts I messed up a bit on but still was a decent answer. Whatever feedback from final round were all positive but some never gave me feedback despite my requests and after over 7 hrs of interviews 🤬😡. Overall feedback I got was good “but you didn’t have experience in RE or you didn’t have work experience in Europe and top candidate had those.” I mean ffs I can’t get experience if you don’t give me a chance. And for some roles I interviewed for earlier I failed because of language ability - I’m mad at myself for only being native in English and I’m improving on this aspect. 

So I know overall I’m not far off but it’s been a whole fricking year and I can’t land anything. Starting to have more negative feelings especially since confidence is pretty low. What am I supposed to do...I have networked and sent CV to headhunters, connections I had over the years, parents’ friends, my classmates and still nothing. There seems to be no postings that I’m eligible for anymore. 

JUST GIVE ME A JOB!!!"
nuw8rg,2,2021-06-08,Career in IT audit/risk advisory vs tech pre-sales solutions?,Ambitious-Cat195,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/nuw8rg/career_in_it_auditrisk_advisory_vs_tech_presales/,I am currently doing a Master's in computer info systems and recently received 2 offers for internships - 1 one risk advisory at a Big4 and 1 at a medium sized health tech company for technology planning. My background is actually in health and I have very little insight in the tech industry. Which one is a more lucrative career currently in tech and lead to more exit options? I've heard risk advisory is essentially IT auditing and a dead end. The technology planning one I am assuming is similar to a pre-sales solutions specialist role and I'm hoping could lead to solutions engineering or business intelligence roles. What should I try to focus on/pursue? Any insights on salary caps/ work life balance/ day to day of either? Any advice from the industry is appreciated!

I graduated with almost entirely A/B range grades, however, I did not do any internships before graduating like the apparent majority of my peers. I have now moved back home, unsure where to even begin with applications. I am finding that a lot of full-time jobs require two to three years of professional experience (minimum). Also, I feel as though at this point, while I could attempt to find an internship to accrue this experience, I should be able to find an entry level position with a Bachelor's Degree. Am I better off directing my efforts towards internship applications? Full-time entry level positions? Some other alternative? P.S. I'm sure this is an FAQ on this sub so I do apologize."

I think my stats are above average but certainly not the greatest stats. This may be a touch wordy but I want to give as many details as possible for the most accurate chances.

**Demographics:** Male, Indian, Upper Middle Class, Northern California. I attend a fairly competitive public high school.

**Hooks:** First generation immigrant(not sure how much this helps); my older brother also goes to Cal Poly SLO and is graduating this year(idk if that makes me a legacy)

**Intended Major:** Aerospace Engineering, haven't decided between astronautical/aeronautical focus

**SAT: 1490(760M,730EBRW, 21 on essay**, second time 1470(760M,710EBRW)

I tried retaking for a 1500+ and ended up doing 20 points worse in EBRW lol. Not going to try the SAT a third time. I planned to take the ACT but was met with cancellation after cancellation.

**GPA: 3.9 UW, 4.19W, 4.38 College Prep GPA** (straight A student other than a C in my first semester of AP Physics(junior year).I got an A second semester and a B in one semester of both Pre-Calc sophomore year(which was pass-fail), and a B in my second semester of AP Calculus AB(junior year).

My school doesn't rank but I do believe I am in the top 10 percent at my school. School doesn't allow freshman to take AP's and every other year I have taken 3/6 weighted classes(half my schedule was weighted). My second semester of sophomore year was cut short due to COVID and my school forcibly switched us to Pass/fail, which negated my 4.3 GPA and gave me a 4.0 that semester.

**AP/Honors Coursework:**

AP Euro (3), AP Spanish(5), AP Calculus AB(score released in July, think I got a 4/5), AP Physics 1(score released in July, I think I got a 3/4). I plan to take AP Statistics and AP Gov/Econ senior year. I also plan to dual enroll and take Calculus II at my local community college during the school year.

Intro to Engineering Design, Honors Chemistry, Honors Principles of Engineering, Honors English 9-10. I plan to take Honors Civil Engineering senior year.

**Extracurriculars:**

* CSF(9-12)
* TARC(10,12): This is a competitive rocketry team from my school that participated in a National competition. I was Vice President of the club and did a lot of the work when it came to planning and designing. We built and successfully launched a 3d printed modular rocket for the first time in our school's history since the founding of the team. Due to COVID, we weren't able to have the club my junior year, but I plan to do it senior year as the president of the club.
* Church Youth Group Leader: I have been the youth leader at my church youth group since my sophomore year. My responsibilities included planning monthly meetings, meeting with church leaders, and fostering dialogue between adults and teens in the church environment. I have helped organize fundraisers that brought in upwards of $1000, hiking trips and movie nights. We have also volunteered at homeless shelters and ran toy drives/fundraisers for underprivileged children.
* Summer Internship(s): I worked at a startup company as a sales and product research intern. I also helped found the company which was primarily focused on private labeling and selling products FBA(fulfilled by Amazon). I worked there last summer and am working there again this year, but I have also secured a job working in real estate consulting. I am going to be working with clients over this summer helping them implement some proprietary software which will help them develop a database for their properties and also optimize their workflow.
* Volleyball: I played for my school team freshman, sophomore, and junior year. I plan to play senior year(JV 2 years, Varsity 1 year).
* Speech Competitions: I have been a finalist for many speech competitions such as the Lions Club Student Speakers Competition in 2019, 2020, and 2021 the Rotary Club Speech Contest in 2019, 2020, and 2021. I also placed third in my district's VFW Voice of Democracy Speech Competition in 2019.
* I placed third in a National Essay Competition two years in a row(2019 and 2020).
* Sanitizing Drone Project: This summer, a friend and I are working on designing a sanitizing drone for use in high contact, high traffic areas such as football bleachers and the quad area at our high school. The drone is going to be hand operated(we are hoping to make it autonomous) and will spray disinfecting solution over a large area. We plan to enter it into our school district's STEM Expo and also our school Engineering Fair. I also want to enter it into some other science/engineering competitions so please let me know if you have any suggestions.
* Personal Project: I designed and built an RC plane from scratch using foam board. The entire plane was an original design and I entered it into my district STEM Expo(I ended up winning in my category).

**Essays:**

* I am an experienced writer(I get a lot of practice writing speeches and essays lol). I believe my essays will be excellent, around a 8-9/10.

**LOR(s):**

* AP Euro Teacher(she knows me very well; we have a great rapport. She can attest to my character and work ethic. She happens to be a UCLA alumni as well.) 8/10
* Speech and Debate Teacher(My family has known her for years. She has been a great advisor for all my speeches and we have a great relationship.) 10/10
* Engineering Teacher( I've been in his class sophomore year and I enjoyed his class. He gave me a great recommendation for NHS and I will be in his honors class senior year. He is also a UCLA alumni.)7-8/10
* Pre-Calculus teacher(She really liked me. I worked my ass off in that class and she knew it. I always went in before school for help and stayed back after. She gave me a recommendation for NHS. I know her letter of rec will be stellar.)8-9/10
* Civil Engineer: I am currently working with a civil engineer on my aforementioned drone project. He works with drones for a living and is a Cal Poly alumni. If all goes well with our project, I believe he would be willing to write me a great letter of rec.

**Schools:**

**In-State:** UCSD, UCLA(huge reach), UCI, Stanford(massive reach I know), Caltech(also a massive reach), Cal Poly SLO,  Cal Poly Pomona, SDSU

**OOS:** Virginia Tech(sounds amazing from what I've heard), UT Austin, Purdue, MIT(huge reach), Georgia Tech, CU Boulder, RPI.

**ED/EA/RD:** Not sure. Please leave some suggestions if you have any.

I know this was a long and probably complicated post that was chock full of information. If you made it this far, thank you so much for your time and input. I appreciate any responses and criticism/feedback. Take Care!"

However the intern I’m paired with, who I also share a bunk house with, grew up helping her dad with contract work in rural areas, so she has way more experience than me. 

The last couple weeks she has slowly revealed herself to have a negative attitude who thinks her way is the highway. Today was our first unsupervised project together which is how I finally saw her true colors. 

I seemed to be the only one concerned with clarifying our plans, and when I started brainstorming out loud or asked a question she would quickly make sure to let me know anything I missed or wasn’t the most efficient way like I was stupid for even bringing it up. 

In the beginning when we were getting to know each other I was transparent about my level of knowledge, and she said she would be more than happy to help me out and not be afraid to ask questions cause that’s why I was here. I naturally slowly pulled back on this throughout the day thinking maybe I was being annoying but her behavior never changed. 

For the record I do my best to try to figure things out on my own first, listen well, and remember most of what I’m told (when I don’t remember I apologize and ask for a reminder)

Because of her lack of communication it made things worse, because I had to ask her more questions, and she acted like her way was the obvious way therefore other people should just know what the plan was or should be. She will even be a little rude like this to our managers. My manager makes comments to me sometimes like “welp hope she’s she’s satisfied with that” when we are working on something and she’s not there. 

I just feel shitty cause she really caught me off guard today by how rude  she was to me when it was just us and felt like she really took advantage of my goodwill; I feel so used, angry, and stupid. 

It honestly makes me not want to take initiative, ask questions, or put myself out there anymore cause just being around her is starting to slowly lower my self confidence since I’m already insecure about my inexperience. 

I’ll be ready next time, it’s just hard to defend yourself when you know someone technically has good points. 

Anybody have a similar experience or tips? Thank you!"

\- Changed my field and joined a pastry school where I got a diploma

\- Completed a 6 month vocational internship in one of the leading hotels of the country

During my internship alone I noticed that between 30 chefs in the hotel, there was one woman.

Woman were not allowed in bakery, just in pastry and there was a lot of other discrimination too.

Any leads would be highly appreciated. I want to work somewhere where there is opportunity for growth and visa wouldn’t be much of a hassle.

Also if anyone knows good and safe consultancies or agents whom I can reach out to in the country for the same that would be really great."

Profile - I did my undergraduate from one of the top universities in India with GPA of 7.3 (ik not so great :( )  in EEE (electrical and electronics) . I managed to take some CS related electives like OOP and OS in my undergraduate studies. Even with the somewhat useless degree, I managed to be working in one of the well known (Fortune 500) US based company (product based not service based). I have about 1 yo experience rn, and I am gaining more in the coming years. I am specifically a backend developer (spend most of my time coding in Java) with decent knowledge in AWS as well ( I have a few AWS certifications  just in case) . Other than that, I had previously done my internship as a data analyst for 6m. I have a couple of personal projects(small though not too complex  - as I did mostly from a  learning and fun pov in my college days).

I have started looking into universities in Norway/Sweden offering masters programmes in CS/Data Science/AI/ML (basically anything IT/CS related in ANY public average universities ) . The only concern I have is I dont have a undergraduate degree in CS as most of the programmes require undergraduate in the relevant field. I wanted advice regarding how can I improve my chances or realistically speaking is there even a slight chance of getting admitted to any of these programmes with my profile considering the fact that I would start applying from next year and aim to take 2023 fall admission.

nv3hjl,25,2021-06-08,How do you figure out what long-term career you want when you don't want to work and would rather die?,Emphasis_Curious,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nv3hjl/how_do_you_figure_out_what_longterm_career_you/,"I have no actual work experience, dropped out of University like 2 months ago with depression from emotional baggage that I had for years, having zero motivation or passion for what I was studying, gave up after the first week and attended nothing, felt suicidal in every lecture and practical room. Medication has helped me so much and i'm getting my life back together.

I only care about having a social life, looking good and trying to make it big doing something unrealistic. I just want to have fun. Work and school makes me think about how pointless life is and makes me want to die.  By fun I mean going out, partying, drugs, drinking, sex, smoking weed, going on holiday with friends and just enjoying my youth while I have it.

I work with my parents in their store 7 days a week. The shop is open from 7am-9pm.  They financially support me and pay me for helping them, but life fucking sucks. I look at them and think to myself 'god I'd rather die than live like them'. They have no lives, it's just full-time work. Then they criticise me and say they're worried about me because i'm NEETing and I have no plan other than vague ideas like becoming an electrician which I don't even want to do, or being a chef when I can't even cook.

I look at the people who come into the shop and all they do is complain about how they hate work and their lives. Middle aged people buying alcohol and cigarettes to cope with the realities of life.

I've even gone as far to set a deadline on my life to the age of 25. I'm 19 now. There's no way I see myself working a 9-5 for the rest of my life, that sounds like death.

Unless i'm famous and rich doing something I love, fuck this shitty system.

Why would I want to go back to uni for 3-years for a useless degree? Then have to do further study for a masters or phd because a bachelor's isn't enough. Have an endless CV of entry level jobs with shitty employers. Internships, part-time jobs, volunteering? What's the point in all this?

Am I crazy for wanting to die? School made me suicidal enough. My mind wanders when I stare at a piece of school work and thinks of death repeatedly. I feel like depression is just a normal response to existing in this world.  Not living, because we're not actually living. We're just surviving. I'll only get married and have kids if i'm wealthy, but i'm not breaking my back for anyone, it's every person for themselves.

Which brings me back to my question.

How the fuck do i figure out what 'career' I want when I don't want to work at all? I'd rather be a bum, at least i'd be happier.

Even the words ""work"" ""education"" ""degree"" ""career"" make me sick and i'd rather avoid the question for the rest of my life. I wish I could be one of those people who live in ignorant bliss. Who think they 'earn' the right to have their weekend off for breaking their back the whole week. Working for 95% of their week for 2 seconds of free-time before they're back to slaving. My mind doesn't let me do that, and the majority of people on this sub will agree with me when they wish they could just shut their brain off, but they know they'd just be gaslighting themselves for seeing the purposelessness for what it is.

How would working or studying benefit me in any way if I have no life outside of work? I'm focusing on my social life right now and dreams.

Unfortunately, if you choose to actually **live and have fun,** you're guilt tripped by bots around you who berate you about working and having a family because they use that to distract themselves from being empty and want to drag everyone else down. Having a PHD, a high-flying career and a family isn't an achievement Susie. It's not even about intelligence, it's about persistence. If I actually gave a shit i would try, but I don't and why should I? I see absolutely no positive in working. I'd rather be homeless or kill myself by 25. I doubt i'll even make it to 25. I commend people who make money at the expense of their morals. Women using their bodies, people in the trap trying to make big money without doing the most.

All i hear from my family is that i'm a lazy POS who doesn't care about his future. Maybe they're right, but why should I live for the future?

Laziness doesn't even exist. When we were shovelling shit and hunting animals in the jungle that was our work. That was for survival. Now we have food at our disposal, all of our necessities are in front of us. Work is something external that we do for money. People who come from impoverished areas are more motivated to make money get an education and a career. If I didn't have to work for anything, why am I guilt tripped and told to be grateful for what i have when I know no different? I'm not rich, but i'm not poor either.

Fuck this shit world. I don't have the mental energy for this school and work bullshit... it's just survival of the most ignorant. Bring on climate change, I want to watch the world burn.

Rant over.

But I really do need help with that question, so I can get my parents off my back. The problem is, I have nothing that interests me. Not a single career or major appeals to me. Other than unrealistic dreams like Singer, Rapper, YouTuber. I have nothing realistic I want to do. The work needs to be meaningful. I want to make a difference."

I’m 20F, starting an internship in an Investment Bank on the 14th. I got the job for their investment group dedicated to renewable energy.

My university exams finished 4 days ago so I haven’t had much time to practice modelling and now I’m sort of freaking out. I spent this afternoon building a basic project finance model, I found it quite difficult, and then I spilled my coffee on my laptop, it’s completely fucked so I can’t spend the rest of the day modelling.

I’m a law student so Excel is not something I’m a master in by any means. I’m curious to know the extent to which you think it’s a problem that I really have very minimal bearings on the type of modelling I’ll be expected to do. 

I feel like I should be pretty good at it before the internship starts, just so I can hit the ground running and be useful, but my predicament makes that difficult and I’m finding it quite hard.

Appreciate any guidance!! Thanks a lot!"

**Additional Information:**

I applied to so many schools! Do this with caution. I wanted multiple options (due to needing financial aid and self-doubt), but I did have to cut 2 schools from my list at the last moment because there was no way I could crank out any more essays. 

I kind of expected some decisions as my school academics were pretty low. It stung for a bit, but I’ve come to terms with it! I was shocked, however, to get into some of my reaches. Being accepted anywhere is an accomplishment itself :)

All I have to say is focus focus focus on your essays. Make sure you craft your unique story and identity in your essays so colleges can learn about YOU."

The reason I’m posting is because I wanted to ask for some advice. Currently, I work for a small retail location of a bigger company. We’re open seven days a week even though I and my coworker are the only two sales reps, plus my manager. I really don’t care for my job. I don’t like interacting with the clientele and I’m annoyed with the hours, plus I genuinely hate fucking people over—which is basically what’s expected of me. I actually recently switched to part time, but the hours are still somewhat frustrating.

My plans are to go to school in the fall, and they know that I plan to leave eventually.

Additionally, I just started an internship with one of my former professors, and it pays very well, but I simply need to put a lot of time into it because I’m still a novice in the field(software development). So what I would like to do is quit my current job, which pays decently, and devote all my time to the internship. I actually feel as if I do not have enough time to focus on it right now.

Another problem is that I’m close with my manager. She’s actually a good friend and lives across the street from me. Additionally, it will leave a gaping hole in the staffing as the store is already woefully understaffed. 

One more problem is that I’m not exactly confident in my abilities to do well in this internship yet(maybe it’s part imposture syndrome; I’m not sure).

What do you guys think?"

Most of the students choose their graduation degree in the pressure of their family. So, this is why internships are important. It allows you to explore your real interests and decide your career accordingly. In India, we can see most of the engineers choose some other path after their graduation. Internships could be one of the biggest reasons for that.

B honest,Loose-Corgi8810,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/nv8kal/will_i_literally_get_in_anywhere_help_b_honest/,"Hey everyone. I just finished my junior year at a public high school in the northern Virginia/DC area. My school is pretty competitive and pretty highly ranked or whatever. Our school is an IB diploma school, but it also offers AP classes as well. Compared to other kids in my school, when it comes to GPA and grades I could be considered above average/average.

This year I chose to take the full IB diploma, which is the most advanced course path you can take at my school. It basically means you have to take all IB classes, and a certain number have to be HL classes (higher level). I took HL bio, HL psychology, and HL history. I want to be a psychology or neuroscience major in college, or nursing. I’m kind of all over the place in that respect.

I am not really sure what my GPA is because our school hasn’t released our official transcript yet because we do this weird thing where you get one grade for the whole year rather than semesters or quarters. But, if I had to guess, I think this year I would have a 4.3 or 4.4 weighted. My other years of high school were ehh when it comes to GPA, partly because our school doesn’t weight honors classes, and I only had the option to take one AP class which I got a B in for the year (AP government :|).

I got a mixture of A’s and B’s (mostly A’s) throughout freshman and sophomore year, and took all honors classes that I could even though they aren’t weighted. I still don’t know my GPA unw or weighted for freshman or sophomore year, but I would say 3.5 unw for both. This year (junior year) I got all A’s (really proud of myself!) in the hardest classes I have taken and one B+ in IB math (which I am currently advocating for a boost to an A because of an unfair grade she gave me so I guess that is TBD).

However, I think where I really stand out is my EC’s:
• created a mental health initiative/club at my school and was President this year; raised thousands for mental health organizations; had over 50 active members in a virtual setting; worked with school administration to change certain policies relating to mental health; created a “calm corner” space in the counseling office for people to take mental breaks in
• won an award: “Top 18 Young Women of Action” in my city for my club and work on my Gold Award
• Girl Scout Gold Award; created an outline/plan to establish my city’s first ever dog park, and executed it successfully through 2 years of work with city officials and community members
• summer 2021 internship with one of the leading behavioral healthy therapy practices in my area; 4 days a week 9-5; assisting in research on OCD and PTSD in teens; assisting in mindfulness classes and leading exercises for family groups; observing psychologists and therapists in a DBT skills class; regular scheduling and clerical work in the building 
• Girl Scouts Nation’s Capitol Executive Girl Board; chosen as 1/20 Girl Scouts to help with the national board of Girl Scouts in planning and policy making for 2021/2022
• Student Representative for my city’s chapter of League of Women Voters
• National AAU basketball player all years
• Cello player in a competitive youth orchestra all years 

Here’s my issue: I suck at standardized testing and have taken the SAT 5 times, and never gotten past a 1250 :/. If I don’t get at least a 1350, I’m going to apply test-optional which sucks but it’s just how the cookie is crumbling for me.

Some schools I wanna go to:
UMiami (FL), Virginia Tech, Tulane, UVA, William and Mary, Clemson, UC Boulder, JMU, UCSB, UMich, Elon, C of Charleston, etc 

Do I have a chance anywhere lol"
nv8q5i,0,2021-06-08,Graphic design as a day job for an aspiring professional musician?,Borderlessbass,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/nv8q5i/graphic_design_as_a_day_job_for_an_aspiring/,"Warning: long post, skip to paragraph 7 for TL;DR

After attending music college in Boston I moved to Berlin, where I've been gigging in the local scene music scene for the past seven years with various independent bands.  At first I thought I'd try right off the bat to earn a living as a session musician (electric bass) whilst working parallel on my passion projects, but soon realised that that's not really a thing here.  Aside from the odd show or recording here and there, the only real gig I've had as a hired gun was one tour with a local singer-songwriter who paid me €50 per show (plus food and accommodation).

Having come to terms with the reality that there doesn't seem to be a very large demand for freelance session bassists in this city, I began to look elsewhere for income whilst continuing to persevere with a band I'd co-founded in the meantime.  This band now remains my sole musical project, and the one with which I intend to pursue my career.  Up until the pandemic started, we've been progressively getting more paid gigs.  While so far we've been saving all the money we make in a ""Bandkasse"", the amount we made the last few summers would actually have been able to cover all our living costs if we had split it evenly (other seasons is a difference story of course, especially winter).  While I do believe we have the musical talent and drive to make it, financial resources for recording, touring and marketing remain a huge obstacle.

Eventually I landed at the Jobcenter after having worked several odd jobs that didn't pan out for one reason or another.  After attending a Deutschkurs (B2) which they funded, I hoped that they would also finance an Ausbildung for musical production so that I could at least get a foot in the music industry, even if it were not as an instrumentalist as I had once hoped.  I was lucky enough to have been assigned a very chill Arbeitsvermittler who is supportive of my musical endeavours, but unfortunately that wasn't enough to convince the Jobcenter.

After several more months of unemployment, I was asked to participate in a job coaching program, where I explored various options as to what I could do for a living with the coach assigned to me.  Since I'd always liked drawing and designing stuff, it seemed like a logical choice to try my hand at graphic design.  So I applied for an Umschulug - ""Mediengestalter Digital &amp; Print,"" for which the Jobcenter gladly foot the bill.

I started the program last year in January, right before the pandemic hit.  I'm now in the final stage before the exam preparations: a mandatory 6-month full-time internship.  Since April, I've been working 40 hours a week designing posters, business cards, Facebook banners, etc. for a small business in Wedding.  It's alright - it certainly suits me better than gastronomy, retail or manual labour, since I'm not the most sociable nor physically active person.

Regardless, it's clearer to me than ever now that 1) I definitely don't want to do graphic design for the rest of my life and 2) working 40-hours a week (especially with an hour-long commute from home), even at a relatively ""cushy"" job does not leave me nearly enough time nor energy to put all the work I need to into my band.  That's not just rehearsals, shows and recording, but also all the hours needed for songwriting, arrangement (which is very meticulous and time consuming with a 7-piece band including a horns section), making music videos, promotional material, hopefully planning a tour once the pandemic is over, etc.

(TL;DR) So the question is - what do I do once I've completed my Umschulung and become a certified Mediengestalter?  Obviously I'll need to look for some kind of work in that field and stop living from Jobcenter money, but it's of utmost important that I'm able to continue putting long hours of work into my music in order to finally start making a living from it.  A €450 Minijob is not an option, as that won't be enough to cover my expenses, but perhaps if I could earn something like €800 per month on a part-time basis that would be perfect.  The option of freelancing is also attractive since I'd be able to work from home and not be tied down to fixed hours, but I've seen the hellish bureaucratic rabbit hole it's sent some people down (and the exorbitant taxes and Rentenversicherung some of them ended up paying), so I don't know if it's worth it.

Apologies for the long post, and THANK YOU SO MUCH if you've made it this far.  I hope some of you out there who have been in similar situations would be willing to share some insights and experiences.  Any information at all, even anecdotal, would be a massive help."

I'm  a bit lost at the moment and could use some advice. Most of the posts I  see on reddit are about transitioning from (web)dev to machine  learning, but for me it's the opposite. I'm ending my masters and going  to start a PhD in ML in September and am having a lot of second  thoughts.

I've been doing an  internship in ML and am accepted for a PhD to continue working on that  same project. I like the project and the team but am starting to get  bored of ML, while I've always loved dev (currently i enjoy modern  webdev, but any kind of dev really). So now I'm really hesitating  cancelling the PhD to start working in some dev job (though long term  I'd love to be freelance and have the same liberty as I have in  research). Although I can never know because maybe I just love doing dev  as side projects and will miss having a more meaningful research  project, but right now I don't and 3 to 5 additional years of PhD feels  like a really long time. Besides, I can't wait a year to get some  industry experience and then come back to that PhD, because of  additional constraint I have.

If there are any people like me, who have done a PhD in ML while not loving it and preferring dev, I'd love some advice!

I  also got a couple practical questions. If I cancel my PhD right now I  will have a significant debt to pay back over 2 years. How much money  can I expect to make at the start, if it's possible to estimate, given  that I don't have prior experience nor studies in dev? I don't really  have a big personal projects, just a look of little projects, tools that  I made for myself or some things for fun, or some contributions to  projects. I consider myself pretty good in dev, I've been doing it since  I'm young and still love it, and I love learning new  languages/technologies so that wouldn't be an issue for any dev job. I  could spend 3 months doing an online formation so have a more official  diploma, or spend that time doing some bigger side projects. Or as  another option, for people who have done a PhD, do you think it's  possible to manage a sort of evening dev job to get experience and earn  some additional money, maybe some freelance stuff? This way even if I  end up not totally enjoying my PhD, I'd still feel like I'm not losing  my time, and either way I'd enjoy having a ""real"" job at least on the  side.

Sorry about the incoherent rambling, but i'd really appreciate it if someone has some advice/knowledge to offer! :)"

However, due to an extensive back surgery, I was unable to focus on school and cancelled this class alongside calculus.

Because of this, given the C class ""locks"" most others, I'll be attending half the number of classes students are supposed to next semester. I want to do something with all the free time I'll have, specifically something that'll further my knowledge in programming.

I'd love to get some personalized tips regarding all I could do. I'm considering applying for a couple of simple virtual internships. What else, such as beginners' - coding - projects, could I tackle? Are there online courses I should consider, or different strategies?"

I have already begun preparing for fall recruiting for future internships (preferably next summer/SWE role). Recently, I have come across a couple of summer workshops/webinars that are delivered from noteworthy companies such as: 

Lyft's Early Talent Access Program: consists of three workshops that go over their three technical interviews in their regular fall recruiting for the summer. If you are selected within the program, you also may receive a mock interview that (assuming it goes well) can fast-track your recruitment timeline in the fall. (This started today and was found through Canvas which used to be called Jumpstart).

AT&amp;T Summer Learning Academy: consists of a two-week program/externship with training modules ranging from AI/ML lessons to 5G/other company overviews. They give you a certificate upon completion of the course. (Again found on canvas but also on their website)

I am happy with my current full-time SWE internship role, but I still have some downtime and want to capitalize on some of these programs offered by bigger companies (*Especially the Lyft one since it includes a possibility of fast-tracking your recruitment and really breaks down their own technical interviews; technical interview practice delivered by a big tech company is exactly what I am looking for*). 

I wanted to post here and ask if anyone else knows where I could find more programs like this, as there is no common name for this type of program nor a common platform on which to find them. For example, the Lyft program cannot be found on their own company website, you have to google the program name specifically. Obviously, I'm not looking for some random third-party coding boot camp that you pay hundreds of dollars, and I have struggled to find any more programs like this through google searches and navigating through a company's website, so I thought I would post here to see if anyone else has insight or knew of similar programs being offered this summer.

The internship was an unpaid internship that would last 6 months- a year with no guarantee of a job, but that was the only way to be hired. The pay at the end of the internship would be little + no full tike hours or benefits. And it was far away so I had to spend gas commuting over an hour there and back. But this was the only opportunity I found in a year of applying to studios and other music jobs. 

I decided to go for my associates in computer programming so I could be a web developer, but I’m worried I would only end up in the same position and that most jobs would only take a bachelors. Does that seem to be the case? Is it worth getting a whole other degree for a year and if so is the associates the best idea since I can’t afford a masters yet?"
nvdmeh,2,2021-06-08,How to question priorities as an intern?,EditorResponsible918,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nvdmeh/how_to_question_priorities_as_an_intern/,"I'm interning at a large Silicon Valley company with a small team that's maintaining a simulator for a chip that another team is designing. My responsibilities are to profile the code, find opportunities for parallelism, and parallelize it with [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/). Except for the few places I've been able to do this, the entire thing is single-threaded.

Now, obviously, they're giving me this project because they want the simulator to run faster. But I recently learned that the code breaks if they use any compiler optimizations. In fact, the sense I get is that the code breaks if even the `-g` debugging flag is omitted (C++ using gcc on linux). That makes my entire project seem to me like a huge premature optimization. In my (admittedly inexperienced) opinion, multithreading by hand shouldn't even be considered until you've exhausted what the compiler can do for you. In addition, I've discovered that some of the advanced features of OpenMP that they want me to use (such as automated SIMD conversions) will have no effect without at least some compiler optimizations enabled.

I really don't want to whine about the codebase or the project I've been given, but it seems that if they want me to speed up the simulator, my effort would be better spent fixing whatever issues are keeping it from working right with compiler optimizations, first. If there are bugs that are only showing up with compiler optimizations, they might have deeper implications. And once the code works with compiler optimizations, OpenMP will be even more effective. On the other hand, I know all too well that telling your superiors that you know better never goes well.

**TLDR:** As an intern, how would you approach telling your manager that they've got the wrong priorities, politely?"

Computer engineering major but should be CS, didn't want to limit myself early on. Got 3.8 GPA freshman year, accepted into honors program, had a research position for 6 months, got a SWE/Computer engineering internship this summer. I am looking for advice on how to further set myself up.

\- Will having a SWE internship as a freshman open doors later on in terms of getting better internships and better jobs post-graduation?

	○ Will it help with graduate school opportunities?

\- I mostly do development here integrating sensors into ROS packages in C++ but I think I am more interested in algorithm work so I am considering computer vision or AI as possible future prospects, what other well paying and stimulating  specializations in SWE/Computer engineering are worth looking into?

\- I am looking to really polish off my resume this upcoming school year (sophomore year) and to get more worthwhile experience, should I get a research position or join clubs such as robotics?

	○ For the former question, I am in the honors program at my university and there is a senior thesis requirement based on research performed as an undergraduate. I feel like I should use sophomore year to really try and find my interests for that as well as just get better in general for internships in the following summer.

\- Should I do a personal project or two this summer to pad my resume? I have been told it is really solid, not even compared to other freshman. I am worried because all of my projects listed are class projects, so I'm not really showing initiative.

\- What can I do this summer outside of my internship and in the upcoming school year to really get myself ahead and create opportunities down the road? (Most important question)

Both interviews were very rough as I was asked a bunch of ML questions (most of which I my reply was ""idk"") and one leetcode-y question (which went very well). Even knowing I only had a very high level/conceptual exposure to ML, the interviewer (who was also the founder) hired me. In preparation, I took Andrew Ng's course in Machine Learning and started his Deep Learning specialization, but didn't get too far there. 

My role as an intern would be to teach ML stuff to high schoolers, and make my own projects - there are 3 tracks: NLP, CV, and Reinforcement Learning. This is literally my 2nd day, and I'm freaking tf out. All the other interns are grad students (there's one 4th year undergrad), and me being a rising sophomore I already feel a tad out of place. I'm on the NLP track (I'll be moved to CV and RL later yikes), and I have no clue what the hell is going on. 

All the code looks so foreign to me, and everyone's discussing improvements on the course material and here I am frantically googling stuff that I don't completely get yet. I was able to contribute some improvements to the pandas/numpy material but I have no clue was 'lemmatization' is, what a GPU is, or what a TF matrix is. I don't know how to interpret any of the visualizations, and how anything works under the hood (ex. like I know how to derive a loss function). Worse yet - I'm going to *teach* this stuff next week - and I know from teaching a bit at my university that you need wayyy more than surface-level knowledge to be a decent teacher. 

I go to a university that's known for being stressful but even coming from there, I've not been so overwhelmed/lost/freaked-out. The prospect of going through this with CV and RL is also scary; I just can't see how I'll be able to learn them well enough to *teach* them while doing my own projects, improving curriculum, etc. over the next few weeks. I communicated all of this to my supervisor and he's like ""that's why this is so fun! this is a learning-summer-camp for you as much as it is for the kids"" O.o. Anyone else been in this situation?

Guy basically said he was impressed by my communication and way of thinking, but that I’d need a better foundation to get the job. (Even though it said on description we will train.) 

He said while he may have to wait to move me into that role, that he thought i was a great candidate for an internship. Found out after a few follow up emails that this would be an unpaid position. Part of me wants to take it to have anything tech related on my resume and to learn, but after talking to others who finished their degrees and had done internships, they urged me to only accept it if there was nothing else to accept. 

They said it was exploitative which I kinda agree with, and that in their internships they were making anywhere from 15-28$/hr. Is it worth taking for a few months unpaid? Would I get disregarded in the future working at this company if I tried to negotiate for at least minimum wage ? 

I do like what the company does and I liked speaking with the owner. I can see myself working well within their team as an actual worker in the future but the exploitive nature of this offer is making me feel like someone else out there would be willing to offer me a paid internship."

nviogp,1,2021-06-08,SAVE ADHD GRAD SCHOOL STUDENT,notyourhomefry,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/nviogp/save_adhd_grad_school_student/,"Hi, 

**TLDR;** Adult ADHD Grad Student failed to complete internship (final part of course) within the time allotted and was unable to communicate during internship with grad school coordinator to come up with some form of a solution.  2 years post grade for course changing from an Incomplete to an F, student would like to request a grade change and be graded on completing the internship coursework.  This will allow for student to get credit without having to repay for expensive tuition for specific course which will lead to extra burden and undue hardship on an already fragile minded person.  Reasons include mental health deterioration and circumstantial life events.  

**Full Story Below** 

I am a 36y, F, ADHD Grad School Student.  I struggled a lot completing undergrad due to personal issues and undiagnosed mental health (anxiety, ADHD) issues. I spent a few years trying to gain help and eventually was able to get my life back on track, enough, that I could try my hand at grad school. 

I eventually started an online masters program at a decent university.  I understand academics was probably not where I should have tried to excel based off of my troubles in undergrad but it was important to me to try again at something that was once a large part of what I prided myself on. 

 While I started off on the right foot, life happened and eventually one poor grade and a whole bunch of chaos (life events and subsequent deterioration of mental health) later, I ended up repeating a series of classes that I easily could have passed but ended up getting 'incompletes' or poor grades which needed to be retaken. I mainly received poor grades due to missing deadlines and not being able to communicate as effectively as I would have liked when I was facing issues.  The coursework itself was seldom challenging but being unable to efficiently manage my time and communicate really was my kryptonite.   I was able to somehow get myself together and take all the mandatory classes for the program and get the grades required to qualify for the degree.  I felt like I had gotten myself into a good mindset and was feeling good about things. 

I was able to reach the last phase of my grad program which was an internship that allotted 6 months( 180 days) post enrolled semester's closing to complete. In the process of completing the internship, I was already in the middle of a gruesome lawsuit, living with abusive family members when my place flooded and all the order and calm I had managed to recreate for myself, went out the window again.  Overwhelmed once again and distraught by having to constantly get myself to a good position to function, I was unable to communicate to the internship instructor or supervisor about what was going on. I basically froze and was essentially bed ridden unable to perform any basic functioning.  

Long story short, I managed to do a few weeks of the internship, flood hit and I went AWOL. I spent days trying to email the supervisor to gain an extension or simply explain my situation but it just wouldn't happen. It was as if my brain refused to regurgitate what was happening.  It has now been 2 years since the grade has turned into an F.  Due to all the other things going on, I basically disassociated starting March of 2019 till sometime August 2020.  I feel like I was in a sort of slumber. Due to the pandemic,  I didn't have to deal with the outer world at all and so that also heightened it.  

I don't have a solid paying job and am mainly supported by family members.  This internship was covered by a scholarship that was to be awarded at the end of the grad program.  If I cannot get them to reopen the grade that changed from an Incomplete to a F at the end of the 180 days extension, I will have to pay out of pocket to take the internship.  I do not have the means to pay for this class out of pocket as I have essentially been unemployed for 3 years plus.  I only have till the end of this year to complete the necessary requirements for this masters. If i am unable to, 7 years of working towards a grad degree will be all for naught. 

I would like to request that I complete the internship and then be allowed to apply for a grade change from that term and have the 'F' that was an 'I' be treated as if the 'I' still was in place and be graded accordingly once internship coursework is complete.  

**Is there any advice on how I can go about tackling this as I had serious deterioration of my mental health and due to being ADHD and having a severe learning challenge, I truly was unable to function.**   

According to the Graduate Bulletin, a grade appeal change must occur within a year.  I have also read elsewhere that an ""I"" grade automatically becomes an F within a certain timeline.  However I know this to be untrue.  For one course, a professor and I had a delayed submission agreement due to which I earned an 'I' until the timeline was completed.  Once I completed the coursework and received all my grades from the professor, the Professor did not update the class grade for a very long time. I had to contact her multiple times to get her grade change submission.  This leads me to believe that there is leniency in how long a class can remain in ""I"" status.  

I know this is all over the place but as I have been contemplating seeking advice and simply getting my thoughts on paper, I'd rather just put it out there and take whatever advice I can get.  Please offer constructive advice and be gentle. 

Please help."

nvjspt,5,2021-06-08,Finding work as a junior data analyst outside the US,booksnotguns,dataanalysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/nvjspt/finding_work_as_a_junior_data_analyst_outside_the/,"Hi fellow data analysts! I got my bachelor's degree in Business Analytics last year and even though I was among the top students in my class, I'm having a hard time finding an entry data analyst vacancy.

I've spent this year trying to improve and acquire new skills as a data analyst and I've recently completed the Google Data Analytics Professional certificate. I'm proficient with several programming languages especially Python and R, have a good command of SQL, spreadsheets, and Tableau. I also know some machine learning algorithms and data science-related techniques but I wouldn't say I master them yet.

I also wanna point out that I tried to pursue a master's degree in Europe but I couldn't get a scholarship since the degrees in my country (Tunisia) don't have international accreditation. Because of this, I only started looking for a job around two months ago.

I have no job experience in the data analysis field and I feel like that's definitely hurting my odds even though the reason I always avoided internships in my country was that my friends always told me they didn't learn anything as interns and all they did was print some documents and sit around doing nothing.

I'm curious to know how you guys landed your first data analyst job or if you got any advice for me, I was really shocked to see data-related vacancies aren't that popular in my country and the job postings on LinkedIn were very limited, and whenever there's a position available it usually requires about 4 years experience."
nvkw5e,0,2021-06-08,Is it okay to still experience imposter syndrome years into my career?,omgdolphin111,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nvkw5e/is_it_okay_to_still_experience_imposter_syndrome/,"I am an iOS engineer with over 3 years of experience, just graduated 3 years ago as well with a BS in CS. My imposter syndrome was horrible when I started, and I thought it'd get better with age... but has not. I complete my work on time, and have been promoted twice since I've been at the same company that I interned with and started a full time career with. However, even though I'm a level 3 engineer, I still get nervous around leads, principals, staff, Ph.D. candidates and sometimes even our interns even though part of my job is to mentor them. 

Do I just need to use my company's EAP? This imposter syndrome, though it does cause me to lose sleep at times, does not affect my overall work. I'm still actually a pretty high performer at work, according to my manager any way. Never had performance or behavioral skills at work."

my parents are both software engineers who majored in computer science in a country in Asia. my father works at a big tech company and makes a very good income, and thinks that technology is one of the only fields where people can get a high salary. they dont know about the american college admissions process at all or about different fields that are related to computer science (except for pre med). 

ever since i was little, my dad would push me into computer science. he really wants me to go to college for comp sci, and thinks that he knows which schools are best for the fields because some of his facebook friends' children have gotten into these colleges. 

unfortunately for me, i love social science. psychology and buisness in particular interest me, and i would love to go in the pre-med or MBA direction. however, my dad thinks that if i ""narrow"" my focus onto psychology (which isnt very narrow), i will have no chance of getting into medical school, and that bioengineering, etc. are much better options. also, he believes that to going into buisness is close to impossible without comp sci experience. he doesnt let me talk about the career paths that i like, and if i do have the opportunity to talk to others about my interests, he cuts in saying that ill go into computer science just like him no matter what im saying now. its affecting my mental health at this point, because i feel lost without my parents support :(

computer science will never be an option for me, and no matter how many times i tell him this, he never takes it into account. im a rising junior, so its hard for me to choose programs or internships related to social science because he doesnt want to pay for them/drive me to them (but will pay for the computer science ones).

do you guys have any advice about what to tell him? or have any of you been in a similar situation and had something work out?

thank you and have a great day !

edit: just wanted to clarify that i really like math/working with data, just dont like the programming part of cs😭 also im thinking of either going into academia or medical school w psych, and investment banking/managing w buisness or finance!"

I am reposting in hopes of receiving more comments since I’ve got new information to add.

Demographics: 
Gender: Female

Race/Ethnicity: South Asian

Residence: SoCal

EFC: Middle Class

Type of School: Public and decently competitive but no where near the most competitive in my area. There are about ~500 kids in my grade

Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): Legacy at WashU

Intended Major(s): Computer Science for the most part. If I get into a school that encourages interdisciplinary study, I’d like to PoliSci minor. Also for reach schools, I am considering applying as Environmental Engineering.

SAT: I took it once and got a 1560 

UW/W GPA and Rank: here’s where is gets underwhelming… 3.9 UW :/ /4.5 W (yes I know this isn’t the worst but it does mark a sore spot in my application) 
I got my actually rank and its a bit higher than I thought it would be but I don’t want to expose myself so I’ll just say I’m exactly in the top 7% of my class.

Coursework: 
Frosh: No APs no Honors, since we weren’t allowed to. Got all A’s. This was the most rigorous course load I could take.

Sophomore: This is the year when things went poorly… AP World, AP Biology, and Honors Elective. I got 2 Bs in AP World(4 on the test) and  2 Bs in AP Bio(5 on the test), but 2 As in my Honors class. I also got a B in math (89.1 😢) This was the most rigorous course load I could take.

Sophomore Summer: Took precalc in the summer and did a couple EDX courses

Junior: AP Comp Sci A(predict a 5 on the test), APUSH(predict a 5 on the test), AP Lang(predict a 3 or 4 on the test :/), AP Calc AB(predict a 4 on the test), Honors Physics, Honors Elective. Got all A’s. This was the most rigorous course load I could take.

Junior Summer: Will be taking a college course on stats

Senior: AP Lit, AP Gov, AP Calc BC or Stats idk yet, AP Chem, AP Psych, APES. This is the most rigorous course load I can take. I expect to get all A’s semester 1 since the teachers that teach these classes are known to be really good. I also have background in a few of them.

Awards:
1. ISEF Finalist (only one in my school’s history, bow that ive looked into it but idk how beneficial of a statement that is, just a fact ig)
2. Robotics Team won top awards in International competition (I don’t want to reveal too much in fear of doxxing myself)

6. Swift Student Challenge Winner
7. Won some society scholarships for research
8. New York Times Summer Reading Semi-Finalist
9. NHS and CSF lmao

(I know only 5 are typically allowed but I'm not sure what to put, most likely would put ISEF, Robotics, Presidential Service, Swift?, then National Merit Semi(unless I get finalist, then that will be higher up))

Extracurriculars: 
1. Research (10-12): I researched stuff basically. I started off in one area but drifted to another and that area was the one that I qualified for ISEF in (I don't want to dox myself as I said earlier but my research had to do with water). I spent typically at least 9 hours a week on my research, more in the summer.
2. Robotics (9-12): I have participated in several competitions, some with leadership roles and some without, since middle school. We got awards at the regional and international level but I really lost interest in it in my later years because of my research. However, one of the competitions we did connects with my ""theme"" so. +I did a ton of community service, internationally and regionally. I would say I spent a minimum of 9 hours a week on this.
3. Youth Advocacy (9-12): Founded a youth advocacy group in my district and by my senior year, we will have instituted some fundamental policies to achieve our goal. We have chapters in several high schools in my district.
4. School Club #1 (9-12): President of this club and during my time in this club, we invited a lot a guest speakers, did presentation to teach people about said topic, established a school store, and installed a hydroponics system.
5. School Club #2 (10-12): VP of this club. It was for a niche quizbowl and we went to Nationals.
6. School Club #3 (10-12): Founded and did similar stuff above aka we invited a lot a guest speakers, did presentations to teach people about said topic. Also did some competitions but with little success lol. Not sure if it's worth including but its here!
7. Mural painting (9-12): Painted murals throughout my city! Also these were paid gigs but only during the summer.
8. Internship (11): I had an internship under my city's mayor for my youth advocacy work.
9. Miniatures (9-12): Took a cool class about it in middle school and continued with it. I have a blog on it (not that popular lmao). One cool thing I did though was I a) sold some of my finished miniatures, b)Sold my patterns on Etsy (all the proceeds went to a water conservation org). Finally for c) I built a model of my high school, but sustainable. I gave it to my school with the list of sustainable features (let me know where I can go from here! I am a bit stuck lol)
10. Volunteering (9-12): 500+ hours throughout high school.


Essays:
Kind of shit at writing so I only have one idea. I wanted to write about my experience mural painting. How I sat on the street and met different people and saw different things and how they shaped my goals. Its really arbitrary and it doesn't really explain me but thats all I have.

LORs:
1. One of my History teachers, not sure which one: I have always been really involved in all my history classes so I think I can get some good LORs from them.
2. One of my elective teachers: Helped me with my miniatures and also went to Stanford so he knows what to say lol since I think my miniatures showed a lot of IV.
3. Some STEM teacher: Only really had a good relationship with one of them. He retired but he told me he would still love to write me a recc letter.
4. Research mentor: obvious choice lol
5. Robotics coach: has known me for a while, seen my progress over time.

Schools: This is what I'm thinking of now, but of course, I have not done all the research I need to do, these are just what I have in mind atm:
1. WashU (duh)
2. UC Berk (EECS or L&amp;S CS idk what yet but the people I know in EECs told me my GPA will be risky to apply with)
3. UCLA
4. UCSD
5. UCI
6. UCSB
7. A Cal State
8. CMU
9. Pomona
10. Stanford (uwu but my GPA says otherwise)
11. UPenn
12. Yale
13. Princeton
14. Brown
15. Cornell
16. Columbia
17. MIT
18. USC
19. CalTech

Comments:
If this post look familiar, it’s because I reposted as the title I put before made me sound quite vain. I really thought my GPA was really poor in comparison to others around me but in the grand scheme of things, it isn’t. I know my SAT score is pretty competitive so I really have no need to be this concerned. I guess I was mainly wondering how much my GPA would impact my chances.

One thing that would be great is if I could get suggestions on what to do with my miniature to further my efforts. Right now, my proposal is just there but I don't know what I can really do to push it since my suggestions were quite expensive. There are a few feasible ones but thats really it.

I also want to know what colleges you would suggest I apply to. I love the East Coast but staying Cali would be the most ideal for me. For one, way more affordable for me since I don't have to worry about travel expenses(my family can afford it but still) and also in-state tuition at my state schools(which are amazing schools themselves). 

In terms of a dream school, I don't really have one. I love Berk and Stanford, cause they are in-state, their location is 🤌🏽, and they are great for my major. I also like Cornell because of their ""any person, any study"" policy. Same with Yale. My family is telling me to also apply to Brown cause they think I would suit it but again, my GPA says otherwise. These schools are all honestly shotguns and you never know what will happen but still, I will definitely shoot my shot. Anyways, idk what else to say here. CHANCE ME PLEASE"

So I'm a computer science student in my third year and I will say i truly do love this field and i am good in it. My dream was to get into my schools coop program so I worked really hard. I have 4-5 side projects, couple programming contests and hackathons (actually won a hackathon), and attended many events. I felt like I was a shoe in to get accepted into coop. Unfortunately I broke a school rule. I sent someone an answer to an exam thinking it was over, but alas it wasnt and he pasted it. Even if I did not intend in helping him cheat, I'm not suppose to send answers when exams are done anyway and it is my fault as a student that I didnt remeber the rules clearly enough and now all this happen. I can still appeal but that wont do anything. 

I now failed the class and got an academic notation on my transcript. Luckily I can remove the fact I had academic dishonesty off my transcript when I graduate if I dont commit anymore crimes. However, even if I retake the class that F will always be on my transcript. I was looking into applying to grad school but I have to be honest with them.

However will grad school even accept me? It's been 2 months since this happen and i spoke too a lot of people and I truly had learn my mistakes. However, how bad is my future fucked up in terms of grad school and jobs. Or even internships. I'm sorry for typing so much I'm just a little stressed"

9 months into my first job and I feel like I'm in a rut. Here's a little background experience.

Graduated from undergraduate with a 3.97/4.00 GPA in Computer Engineer and minor in Mathematics and computer science. Had both hardware and software engineering internships, done freelance software work for 3 different startups, had club leadership experience, plus on my own time, I have been developing a personal automated stock trading program. I feel like I have done everything I was told to do by recruiters, but regardless, I was overlooked by every company I wanted to go to. I applied for probably 25 comp. eng. positions at Intel, NVDA, AMD etc and didn't get a single interview despite being in probably the top 5 or 10 in my class. But not being specifically compute science, it was difficult getting a SWE job because degree was only semi-applicable.

I ended up getting a job as a developer at a Electronic Health Record company. Its a decent salary, but I don't like the location, or work culture, or codebase. But more than not being satisfied with the job itself, I feel like to get a FAANG job, you almost have to have a FAANG job. If you don't have another impressive job on your resume, you won't even be considered for the next impressive job. My failure to get a job at an elite company out of graduation really hindered my ability to set myself apart.

Ideally I would love to pivot into a fin-tech position, (dev or quantitative developer at Citadel is my dream position right now). Does anyone know how I can get there?

Specifically if anyone works at Citadel that would be willing to talk, I would LOVE to connect. I've reached out to about 30 people at Citadel on LinkedIn and no one has answered."

Electrical Engineering major looking for some advice",Judgement_Day7,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nvwb21/didnt_declare_a_cs_minor_should_i_or_should_i/,"Hello everyone. I attend a fairly reputable university with good amount of career fairs and networking. I’m currently an electrical engineering major, and the coding related coursework for an electrical engineer at my university consists of a intro python class (taken), intro to C++ programming(taken), and the use of Verilog and C in labs with a little bit of projects sprinkled in. 

At first I was considering doing the CS minor at my school. However, with a combination of too many hours per semester and personal issues, I decided not to. Also, I was able to secure an EE internship. 

As of a month in, I dislike my EE internship thus far and want to consider pursuing a software related internship for next summer. 
(Rising junior)

The advice I’m seeking is whether I should reconsider doing a CS minor or attempt to self learn the necessary course material needed to land a software role. Declaring a CS minor would add 1-2 semesters to my graduation and would likely hurt my GPA along with my given financial situation.

What would I need to learn this summer that would help me land a software related role for next year ? 

It helps that my EE internship is virtual and I do practically 2 hours of work for my 8 hour day. 

Thanks all"

However, I am trying to find data science internships at other FAANG or Unicorn companies and find that a lot of them want phd students or maybe I'm just not looking properly??

Basically, I am scared to solely focus on DS prep this summer because what if I don't get anywhere I want. Should I also prep for SWE roles just in case? Or are there enough opportunities in DS? I am also doing a DS internship this summer and don't have too much time. At most, I have four hours of interview prep time in a day. What is the wise move? Also, I have never leetcoded before and I took my DS&amp;A class one year ago so if I choose SWE it is a LOT of prep.

So, short introduction: I'm an  international incoming freshman at a #200 ish ranked school. I got a very generous full tuition and a stipend for my room and board that made studying in the US and receiving a world class education a possibility. I'll be joining college this fall and would be majoring in accounting and finance. 

I'm extremely grateful for the university's faith in my abilities and I've done my research and found it to be a place where I can grow. However, it is a non target school so I'm a little worried when it comes to employment prospects. 

The University is close to a big city, which might make seeking internships a little better. I'm interested in pursuing a career in Auditing or anything related to finance (I'm giving myself time during college to figure out my specific interests). However, being an international student makes things much more difficult when it comes to obtaining Visas. Due to this issue, I might need to aim for Big 4 or F500 companies that would be willing to sponsor a work visa. 

This community has taught me so much about the industry and I'd be grateful if y'all could give me some advice on how to go about seeking internships, networking and ensuring a successful career.

It's bad. 0 ECs and I start my senior year (according to the US highschool system) in August and apply to universities this January (I believe that's the deadline for most unis in regular decision). Do you guys think it's possible to build my ECs and essays in the next 6-7 months? I was optimistic at first honestly but after talking to some councillors I understand it's highly unlikely I'll be able to go to a good school. 

My IGCSE grades weren't very impressive because of the whole predicted grade fiasco. Got 1A* 4As and 4Bs
Will give SAT this August and am hoping for a 1450+

Some EC ideas I had which I THINK are possible:
1. Writing a book related to my major
2. Starting a blog
3. I have done an internship and community service already
4. Writing a research paper
5. Coding a website for a business rn
6. Doing a college course like edx
7. In the process of making an app
8. Am also planning to join my school's rugby team

So yeah this is all I NEED to do. What are your guy's opinions? Is it doable (Ik issa a handful but I believe I can do it). I wanna atleast get into top 40 in the US for CS. Will be needing financial aid so that's an obstacle as well.

You think I have a chance or should I just go to a mediocre uni in my country and transfer to the US?
Be as honest and harsh (if need be) as possible. I need a wake up call. Have a nice day"

nvyzs9,16,2021-06-09,I got the job and I can’t believe it.,skylightmeredy,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/nvyzs9/i_got_the_job_and_i_cant_believe_it/,"About a month ago, I sent in an application for a company that’s huge in the field I want work in after college. They didn’t have any internship positions open, so I applied for a full-time job they posted on LinkedIn. 

I thought they wouldn’t even look at my resume, never mind actually consider me. I do have some experience and technically meet their requirements, but those that they have hired for the same position in the past are typically older and have finished undergrad (with some working on their masters degree). Still, I figured I could throw my name in the ring, especially if they’re looking for more interns in the future. 

So imagine my surprise when I received an email about next steps! I had 48 hours to complete two assignments, and after I passed that stage I had a video interview. 

I was told that I would hear back from them by Friday about the position as they were doing more interviews throughout the week, but this morning (Wednesday) I found out I have been officially offered the job!

I’m beyond excited as not only is this my first ever full-time job, but it’s in a company I’ve followed for years and in a field that I’m extremely passionate about! It’s basically to the point where I’d feel lucky to interview for them *after* graduating!

The only problem, however, is this timing. As a college student going into my junior year, the commitment is quite daunting. A 40 hour work week is nothing crazy over the summer, but on top of a full course load plus being on a collegiate sports team (ice skating, so not technically varsity, but still competing at the national level), I’m nervous to see if I’ll be able to manage it without having my grades dropping too much. 

However, this opportunity is one that I feel like I cannot pass up on! I can’t tell anyone yet because of confidentiality purposes, so I decided to come on Reddit and celebrate kind of anonymously here 😂 I’m getting the contract in the next day or two, so advice and luck would be appreciated!🤞🏻"

nvzkrx,8,2021-06-09,a newbie babbling,ConditionMiserable88,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/nvzkrx/a_newbie_babbling/,"Hey everyone,

fist of, I hope this is allowed, if not please delete.

&amp;#x200B;

I am pretty new to the anti-work sentiment. It started about 1.5 years ago when my roommate told me she wasn’t going to work full time after her degree. Partly because full time positions are not very common in her field, partly because she said she just didn’t want to.

Now for me as a business major, this was completely mind-blowing. Up until that point I was, naturally, very career focused. It was what they taught us to be. I had done two internships, was just starting out a part-time job and went to every career fair and “free career workshop” I could find. I had accepted that I would never have a “dream job” but I was still planning on shooting for the quickest and most efficient way up. Planning my route through a prestigious Master’s to a top professional qualification in my field. All this while I knew that my internship, grinding away at one of the world’s most well known accounting firms, had been far from a great experience for me mentally.

&amp;#x200B;

Then Covid happened, and I started working and studying from home, I failed my last exam, which added another year to my undergrad and I watched some people of the people on youtube that have recently popping up, that talk about how capitalism work sucks Now I am here and these are some things I’ve learned:

1. I don’t want a career any more. I’ll be ok with working a four-day week to get by, but only if it accommodates my needs.

2. Number one need being: work from home at least half the time. I don’t know the anti-work community’s stance on wfh in general, but I love it! No time wasted on commute, comfort of your own home and avoiding toxic office culture, sounds great to me. And instead of spending the times I don’t have anything to do or short breaks everyone needs from time to time, pretending like I’m busy, I can fill these precious minutes with small household chores, so I am free after work ends. 

3. And let’s be clear here, I still do my work, but I’ve come to realize that time I save by being extra efficient (which is definitely a bit more stressful), doesn’t automatically belong to my employer. As long as they don’t reward my heightened productivity with extra compensation, I don’t see anything wrong with just taking that extra time for myself. And that is just a lot easier to do when you’re not constantly being watched by your boss.

4. And the work getting is done is really all they care about. They don’t care about you. I mean, I’ve always kind of known this, especially because as a part-time employee and student on the side, I don’t bring much “value” to the company. Nevertheless, I always felt bad, if I had to leave a job, was very apologetic for wanting time off and always made sure to coordinate everything I did with my boss. But it seems like he really doesn’t give a flying freak what I do. He never asks how I’m doing (working at home), he rarely realizes what I’m even working on at the moment and doesn’t even make sure I have enough work. So why should I care. I’ve completely stopped checking in with him regarding my work schedule etc. If he has a problem with that, he can come talk to me. It’s taken some time, but I’ve learned not to stress about it any more.

5. Especially since I know how little they pay me for what I do. Since I work with clients and part of that involves invoicing, I happen to know exactly how much money I’m making them and how much they pay me in return. I’ve been wanting to ask for a raise for a while (I’m too shy), but in the meantime I will put in the effort that suits my compensation.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly haven’t come far in my journey yet. I don’t know how I want to spend my life. I still feel like I can never truly relax because it feels unproductive. I’ll be spending the next two months on a retreat and I really hope it’ll help clear my mind a bit and show me what life without any work is like. **If you’ve got any reading recommendations that you think might help, I’d be glad to hear them.** 

Anyway, I am happy I found this r/ and a happy very early weekend to you all!"
nvzqzo,1,2021-06-09,[IWantOut] 23M Culinary Arts Student Philippines -&gt; New Zealand/Denmark,Marcsman,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/nvzqzo/iwantout_23m_culinary_arts_student_philippines/,"How it do my dudes, I’ll be graduating with a degree pretty soon and my plan is to work in restaurants in either New Zealand or Denmark.

Don’t get me wrong, I love my country and the food but I can’t see myself growing in this industry with very minimal wage. So rn it’s either of the two. I’m impressed with the restaurants in Denmark but I’m worried about the whole integration thing so I figured New Zealand would be my priority.

I’ve got a bit of experience in the kitchen and I had an internship in a Michelin star establishment in France lined up but unfortunately it didn’t push through cuz of covid so I don’t have any legit experience at the moment.

My plan is to apply for work in some restaurants and hope for the best then start on work visa stuff if I ever get accepted.

So now I’m just wondering what my odds are looking like and if how I plan to go about my future is feasible given the circumstances or if at least it makes any sense haha.

Also I’ve gone over some visa info for both countries and they’re a bit intimidating so any tips would be very much appreciated &amp;lt;3"
nw0bjr,6,2021-06-09,Recording lessons and lectures,Careful-Listen2277,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/nw0bjr/recording_lessons_and_lectures/,"Long story short I'm 27F with a severe and rare combination type of ADHD and currently taking Vyvanse. Which I have been on since 2016 and for me, its been a great help my grades pre 2016 vs now will speak for itself.

However, one downside for me in general is that I have trouble remembering things people tell me and it frustrates me more than it does others. 

Last year, during my virtual summer internship I was having trouble remembering a lot of the information that I given and it was extremely irritating. I tried to write as they spoke, but it was hard listening to what they were saying and then remembering what they said at the same time. So I decided to start using the voice recorder on my phone and recording the meetings I would have with my mentors. When I would work on my assignments I was able to go back to those recordings and listen all the information, tips and suggestions that I was given. Because of that, I was able to excel and was named one of the most promising students in growth and expertise during the program.

I decided to start doing it at my home school as well, because despite classes being virtual last semester as well and the lectures being recorded, I had that ONE professor (who doesn't) that chose not record because ""virtual learning has made us lazy and think that we don't need to pay attention during class or just not show up and simply look at the recordings later. When we qre suppose to be paying attention and writing as we are listening."" So I started recording her (no one else thought of it) because not only was she a fast talker but the information she gave wasn't in the PowerPoint slides she ""graciously"" slapped together nor in the textbook, if it was it was vague. And like before those recordings were a life saver as I was able to go back and listen to especially with her ridiculously long assignments (ex. for a multiple choice test instead of just circling the answer we had to explain why we chose that answer). 

I know people will b*tch and say recordings are a crutch and I need to do it on my own, and all that other noise, but I have obviously tried before and it didn't work. So if something is helping me succeed in school and life why would I set myself up for failure just to appease someone who doesn't understand what I'm going through? Easy I don't, because it's my life and I know what's best for me."
nw0ps0,10,2021-06-09,"Landed job at tiny software company as ""lead dev"" (i.e only dev), but I lack fundamental knowledge.",bungjohos560,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nw0ps0/landed_job_at_tiny_software_company_as_lead_dev/,"Hi /r/cscareerquestions, 

This got way longer than I wanted. It's basically a rant/therapy post, but I'd love to hear advice or any similar experiences. 

Some background about me: I did my bachelors &amp; masters in a techy-arts program, during which I got decently impressive work experience in various tech-ish jobs. 3 years ago I switched gears to learn more about the software development side of my field (mostly C++), so I took a few coding classes and landed an unpaid internship at a company doing exactly that. I was totally lost when I started, but I studied pretty hard and learned a decent amount working with Anila (the only developer at the company). I also contributed some pretty useful code which still generates profit. I left a year later to focus on my classes. 

Fast forward to today, recently graduated, and found out Anila was leaving the company. I interviewed and got the job as her replacement. It's pretty clear to me that my unpaid internship was the main factor in my acceptance, because they already have experience with me. 

Anila (super nice person) already started their new job, but is staying on with the company about an hour a day to help with the transition, so I'm trying to learn all the ins &amp; outs. This position is full-stack - from answering support emails, writing new products, bug fixing, communicating with testing team, etc. Pretty intense high stakes stuff. 

So I'm feeling uneasy. I did not go to CS school, I only took some classes. I'm self-taught via youtube tutorials, but I completely lack fundamental C++ knowledge. If I had to do an entry-level coding interview test (never tried) I have no doubt I would fail it. I've designed fairly impressive field-specific C++ software by banging my head against a wall and googling all my problems - but if I were asked to define what a ""class"" is off the top of my head, I would struggle. THAT SAID, they couldn't hire any old software dev - I have some pretty specific experience in this artsy field. So I do have a good grasp on the ""big picture"" of the company if that makes sense. 

But here I am, in charge of everything all of a sudden. It's terrifying to think of when Anila will no longer have time to help out, because despite me being full time, they do 90% of the work. 

I do also suffer from depression and intense self-criticism (read: imposter syndrome). So my own judgement is flawed. But when I try to look at it objectively without self-pity, my knowledge of fundamentals is still concerning. The good news is that they've been understanding so far. I asked for feedback and they only had positive things to say. So I'm not acutely worried about being fired, but I feel like they're going to ""discover me"" once Anila leaves and I'm unable to put out fires. 

I'll wrap this up - if this resonates with you, if you recognize yourself in this post, I'd love to hear from you and get advice, C++ textbook recommendations, or even just commiseration!"

I am about to head into my senior year in the fall.

The internship I'm working now is not an on/off internship like most. I work 30 hrs/wk indefinitely and this is what I have been doing since September (so almost one year with the company now). 

I plan to stay at this company, but not at the specific plant I work for. I currently go to school away from home and want to ideally transfer into a full time position at another plant they run that is closer to where I am from.

In this context when should I speak to my manager about full time job opportunities at this other plant? I've been keeping an eye on job openings in the other plant for engineers through the internal job site but there have been no openings for quite some time...which makes me concerned.

Any guidance on when and how to go about what I'm trying to do would be well appreciated.

Thanks!"

**Letters of Recommendation**

Biology Teacher (9.5):  We got along great during class and she helped raise my ACT from a 33 to 35. She also helped me edit some of my supplemental essays.

Psychology Teacher (8.5):   I would come into her class for lunch and discuss both academic and personal endeavors with her. I was able to read her PhD thesis and got to learn more about developmental psychology before normal class time.

Counselor (8.0): We got along very well, I believe he knows more about me than most of his other students, so I think the LOR was a bit stronger.
​

**Interviews**

I would give most interviews an 8/10. I was able to talk to some (Rice, Northwestern, Penn) for upwards of 2 hours. Columbia went HORRIBLY, I hate the core curriculum and I think it kind of showed in the interview.
​

**Essays**

Personal Statement (3.5):  I thought it was great. However, I wrote about how gender identity has shaped my way of thinking and how I have grown since coming out. Looking back, this topic was a very very bad idea

Additional Information (0.5):   I explained how depression caused my grades to fall significantly in grade 10. BAD IDEA. I maybe saved it a little bit by discussing how I have grown since then and what I have done/will continue doing in the future to prevent it from recurring.

I’ve done two IT internships for a school district mostly imaging and configuring computers, adding them to the domain etc. 

I’ve been a lab proctor for my university but it got shut down due to COVID and computer labs aren’t the most sanitary of places. 

My GPA is 2.89 as I was previously a mechanical engineering major until Calc 2 kicked my butt. My semester GPA is 3.7 and have been since I’ve changed majors but I don’t know how much my gpa affects my options. I’ve been on the dean’s list for the past two semesters as well. Should I use my semester gpa? 

I’ve completed two Coursera IT certificates from Google; IT professional and IT Python automation. My GitHub is a bit weak with not much on it. 

I’m very familiar with programming languages Java, C++ and python and can create fully functional objects. 

I’ve also done web design with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript with databases using MySQL.

The only job I got was a temp janitor for $10/hr which I can only get up to 29hrs a week. The only reason why they hired me was because I worked there before as a summer pool worker and renovated the very warehouse we were interviewing in. The woman who interviewed me did my payroll and mentioned I had excellent attendance and dedication but barely considered me. 

I feel so out of place, like is the industry just garbage right now or am I the garage?"

I started out as an intern in the IT department when I was 16, and then I became a software developer when I turned 18 and graduated high school. I work full-time with a little bit more flexibility during the school year.

I do full-stack web development, so I've been involved in everything from designing and architecting applications to implementing new features to reviewing pull requests and everything in-between. I think I have a decent grasp of everything, and my manager(s) have given me commendations on my work and my ideas. I've been struggling a lot recently since I am severely underpaid for all of the work I do, and despite my good performance, I've been denied a raise because of the company budget. 

I'd like to apply to different places and start somewhere new, but I have no idea how to approach it because my education would place me at an internship level, my work experience would classify me as an entry/mid-level developer, but all of the positions I've seen are temporary internships that only last a semester or entry-level jobs that require 9-5 availability year-round. 

I'm facing this odd case of impostor syndrome because I have this real-world experience that's way beyond an internship level, but I'm only 20 years old with no degree and I often feel like I'm very underqualified for a lot of job listings I've seen.

* Should I apply for internships and see if they'll keep me year-round, or should I apply to entry-level positions and see if they'll grant me extra flexibility?
* How qualified am I really if I have the experience but lack the underlying knowledge that comes with additional schooling?
* What can I do outside of work and school to bridge this gap between my experience vs. my abilities?"

Economics alongside the pre-medical track at a large public state university; I have been shadowing and volunteering alongside all sorts of professionals in the medical industry and recently felt pretty disheartened by the fact that a lot of them seem to have a cynical attitude about their past training and/or that they're *tolerating* their job rather than truly loving it. **I am not completely over medicine yet** since I don't feel comfortable jumping ship (just yet), but I am keeping SWE at the back of my mind as a possible career I could switch focus to should I find a sure reason to leave.

I have minimal coding experience with Java and have touched upon very basic data structures. Let's suppose I take the scenario where I decide to pursue Computer Science.

**Is targeting a Big ""N"" Tech or FinTech Company out of reach for someone like me?**

Realistically, if I execute the scenario where I leave pre-medicine and major in Computer Science, I could produce a BA in approximately 1.5 semesters or less starting this Fall 2021 and graduating by December 2022. The problem is, this only leaves me with ONE summer to obtain an internship during my college career, and CS internships open this fall, where I'd still be learning Data Structures and possibly seriously lack the expertise that other students have. Not only that, but I'd have to somehow leetcode and adopt personal projects with my minimal experience in time somehow for interview season. I have no networks currently with big tech companies since I have been in the pre-health world. Would being internship-less the Summer of 2022 be a real possibility and if so, then what?

I understand that being earlier is better, but since I'm not 100% about leaving medicine, this decision is even more stressful and I have trouble figuring out who I am.

**How difficult is it to move toward a Big N if you spend the first few years working at a mid-low tier firm?**

Given the prospects of me being late, I can't really demand I get myself into a good tier company straight out college. Is it more difficult to get into a Big N as a college student or as an already practicing SWE?

**Is coding expertise more like a muscle that undoubtedly gets better the more you do it... or could there be times where you're genuinely not smart enough to crack a problem?**

Seriously worried about this one. One aspect about medicine is that once you do the work, you're sure to reap an entry toward the industry; it was very linear and direct, but what about software?

**I am aware that GPA's are not necessities for good internships, but to have a realistic shot at good summer jobs, what range is optimal, especially for a state non-target student?**

**How the hell do you network? Do you even need it?**

**Are there any ex pre-meds here who were late into their education and were in this situation like me?**

**I see TC's figures in mid-6 figures straight out of college skewed by elite, pure software companies off levelsfyi, is that level of TC freakishly difficult to achieve (the way IB jobs are impossible) and what tips do you have for someone who is introverted for breaking into big tech?**"

**Letters of Recommendation**

I waived my right to view them, so I'm just guesstimating their quality.

AP Bio teacher- 7? I have mixed feelings about her but I think at least 2 of her students ended up getting merit scholarships at our state schools or into decent places in the past, and I chose her because she may or may not have helped with their lors. I tried to leave with a somewhat good impression-- I'm pretty sure she hated me for something second quarter but changed her mind later.

AP Lang teacher- 6? She doesn't know me super well from class, but she advised a club I led and is fairly good at writing reccs.

Counselor- 8? She tries to be supportive, but she's honestly really busy. Seniors only get a 30 minute time slot to talk with their counselor, and I did what I could to provide her with enough info to write a good recc. I think she has a decently positive impression of me, but with hundreds of students every year, I'm probably not super memorable.

**Interviews**

My first few interviews (Duke, Penn, Oxford \[kinda\]) were trash (3-5/10), but they helped me prepare for my later program interviews and I absolutely nailed those. I liked my Cornell interview and learned a lot, although it was nonevaluative.

**Essays**

I changed my common app topic sometime between EA and RD decisions, and rereading the earlier RD drafts I submitted (Duke, Vanderbilt), it was a bit too sharp and I'm not surprised I got rejected. I started planning around January, worked on my app over the summer, and tried to finish my supplementals a few days before they were due so I had the time to review them. 

I think the essays I spent the most time on I ended up getting the most positive results for. I definitely rushed my Georgia Tech and UMich applications.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

UNC Chapel Hill (EA: $10k/yr stem/merit scholarship, public health assured enrollment, honors carolina)

Cornell (RD, bioengineering: very nice!-- It's been my dream school since freshman year and we made it!)

NC State (EA, engineering: scholars program, $5k + 2.5k scholarships)

ECU (EA/rolling, bio: EC scholars + chancellor's fellow + honors college, scholarships)

UT Dallas (RD, bme: honors, got the full ride for national merit, but changed my mind before march 1)

UNC Charlotte (EA, engineering)

*Waitlists:*

Georgia Tech (RD, bio/chemical and biomolecular engineering)

Wake Forest (RD, neuroscience/biochem)

UMich (applied EA to LSA, got deferred, didn't write loci, waitlisted RD)

*Rejections:*

Duke (RD, Trinity)

Vanderbilt (RD, cellular molecular bio/bme, shot for the NMS but changed my mind after rereading my essays)

UPenn (RD)

Oxford

**Additional Information:**

I think I ended up about where I expected based on past r/collegeresults \+ a2c data, but I'm still happy I aimed for a wider range.

For Wake Forest, I noticed that they noted on my portal that I went to gov school, which may have helped. Some schools considered AP exams in lieu of subject tests being cancelled, and getting 5s definitely helped.

If I could do it all again, I would have applied to Georgia Tech EA, and saved time by skipping UMich (they usually don't give out aid to OOS students and I'm not sure why I applied) and Oxford (lack of flexibility). I also applied to a lot of competitive/national scholarships-- some worked out and some didn't. It took up a lot of time, but I'm glad I did. It shouldn't have taken me more than one interview to figure out what I was doing wrong.

Things I did right: For national merit, I'm glad switched out of Vandy+UTD and ended up not listing a first-choice college. I also ended up not applying for scholarships/honors at UNCC because I was running low on time and wouldn't chose it over UNC/NCSU. I'm also glad I didn't ED anywhere because the costs for private schools were unrealistic.

In April, I turned down the waitlists and ended up deciding between Cornell, UNC, NC State, and ECU. &gt;! Sorry Cornell, you're gorges, but I'm going to Carolina! !&lt;"

I'm running out of technologies I want to learn and apply myself to, and it feels like I could work on any personal project in these fields and have no opportunities arise from them. As much as I love programming, I've never made a cent from it, and while I've never cared about the fact, it's starting to make me doubt my own skills.

Waitlists are just a fleeting sense of false hope within the next few weeks. I’ve already enrolled in a few classes at my school for this summer as I can prospectivey graduate in around 3 years, however, everytime I come to these classes I’m just immediately pounded with an emotional wave of sadness, anger, and frustration.

Everything I had planned to do—maybe get a job this summer or try for some internships excited for the next school year just all fell flat as my level of motivation plummeted to an abysmally low level and I’ve practically already fucked up my start of college by wasting this summer for a few credits.

I guess I’m still in the process of learning how to cope.

Edit: Thanks for all the responses guys. Honestly since applications ended I don’t think there’s been a day past where I haven’t thought about what I could’ve done better. And to my reluctance to admit—I haven’t cried much in the last 8 years until now where I’ve basically bawled my eyes out every other week or so. I haven’t told my friends about my borderline mental breakdowns yet, but they’ve been very supportive as well as the people here.

It’ll definitely take some time for me to accept where I am, and rather than just trying to graduate as fast as possible I’m thinking spending more time to build connections within my school network and continuing to try and demonstrate excellence will (hopefully) lead me to somewhere I can be content."

When I had an interview with FB and Tesla, the recruiter told me that I could do the challenge in any language of my choice so I chose C++. In my FB interview I was told that I have to do the coding challenge in Python, but they allowed me to write in C++ and then attempt to port it. In my Tesla interview, they did not even let me try in C++ and just told me to try my best with Python. I know Python but not to the level of being able to answer Leetcode mediums in short amount of time.

Soon I am going to start preparing for new grad interviews and trying to decide if I should practice in Python or C++? I am quite a lot better in C++ and have 2 years experience in it, did I just get unlucky in my interviews that they demanded me to code in Python without telling me before the interview?"

I’m not too familiar with the internship process (when to start looking, preparing, etc), so I just wanted to ask you guys:

1. Is looking for summer 2022 internships during this summer (aka June 2021) too early? If so, what is the ideal time to start looking?

2. When should I start preparing for technical interviews and what are some good resources that would be useful? I haven’t taken a data structures &amp; algorithms course yet, but I’ll be taking it in the fall. So I wasn’t sure if I should start preparing right now, or wait until I’ve taken the course.

Thank you!"

Is 5 courses per semester doable? for example for this fall Im planning on taking (COMM 205, 210, 217, 226, and. MATH 208) I am aiming to mostly A's so can I get high grades if I put in the work or is it too difficult to manage 5 courses and have a life?

Should I get into Co-op or should I find internships on my own? I heard that co-op is very exhausting and does not give you a break. 

When should I start joining activities and programs at JMSB such as KWPM or JMIS, etc? and how can I enter these programs or apply for them? if you have any activity/program/society recommendations for finance students please share it.

Finally if you have any advice in general related please feel free to share it. Thank you."
nwag9m,14,2021-06-09,Plastic Bones - Chapter 3,biocage,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/nwag9m/plastic_bones_chapter_3/,"Two silver pyramids floated in the twilight, one inverted over the other, joined by a clear cylinder linking the tips and forming the superstructure of the space station N-X-171. Metal plates were joined together by sloppy chemical stitches, giving the exterior of the space station a series of seams. From a distance, the joints seemed like an ornate engraving. The metal shone under the bright exterior illumination, lit for the benefit of personnel observing the station through the exterior view ports. The station had been fabricated to meet a schedule and a budget, but the design was reliable. Mining ferries delivered raw materials for conversion in massive furnaces the size of a space station. Within the fission-fusion reactors, ore was processed into needed metals and polymers, and then formed into structural members and the advanced materials used to construct the electronics and controls. Automated drones rapidly joined components and completed the basic structure in twenty megaseconds, and spent twenty more completing the interior. The station was armed and armored with equipment designed to withstand the assault of uncoordinated free-space pirates, and had done so twice during the two hundred megaseconds that had elapsed since its completion.

The hourglass-shaped structure stretched two kilometers tall, and one kilometer wide at the ends. The center contained the command center and a cable-operated elevator designed for crew and small freight. The station possessed no primary propulsion, and tracked nearby debris with a dilaton mesh to control orientation and protect against damage. The station seemed small from a distance, and up close, cheap and insignificant. The complexity of the station wasn't apparent until personnel boarded and found themselves lost in the crowded, winding interior.

A cool glow, blue, distant, and bright penetrated the open observation ports in the station's command center. A heavy war ship approached the station at high velocity. The ship's aft end faced the station, dumping heat and radiation as the ship's propulsion system strained to cancel the enormous relative velocity. Turbulence from the engines reached the crystal-clear windows, more than four meters of thick plastic and clear ceramic, and flecks of burning propellant left tiny craters. The approaching ship's thrust presented little structural threat, and interstellar debris traveling at high relative velocities could be more damaging. Tribune Rashid waved red-faced at the operations console, and the operator shuttered the windows with alloy blast doors. She was unaccustomed to crewing the command center in such a manner, but N-X-171 was short-staffed. Rashid would have expected her reports to have at least the rank of a Cantor, Second Class.


***



Eric Tisdale sat in the exterior cafeteria with his date. He enjoyed her face, and the way she always smelled of fresh fruit. He had met her on the station, another intern. ""You're leaving in a megasecond"", he said.

""Yep. School doesn't start for another four, but it'll take me that long to get home. Maybe I'll be back here at the end of a few more semesters.""

Melissa agreed. ""I'll finish my dissertation on this station, I guess. I'm done my classes, so I'll be gone by the time you come back.""

She would have liked to have known Eric better; they had spent most of their time together high and in bed, enjoying each other's warmth more than any sort of intelligent conversation. Eric refused to discuss his work, but Melissa wasn't shy. She was sent to the station as part of a university grant to support the development of new long-range scanning technology. The Quorum chose N-X-171 for the project because the station's distance from civilized space allowed the researchers to conduct system testing without interference or detection by the sectors. She seemed certain that the technology would revolutionize sensor systems, providing the accuracy of active EMDIS and WaBIT arrays while maintaining the stealth of the more passive PRES technology.

Eric was sure she was telling the truth. She did believe in what she was working on. He smiled and stared at her brown eyes. Her hair, colored to a false shade of red, reached below her shoulders. ""I can't believe someone back home hasn't snapped you up yet. Do you wanna keep in touch?""

Eric smiled at the comment. There was someone he would return to, someone waiting for him back home. Melissa was a pleasant distraction, and she had seduced him, and he knew no harm could come from the affair, not since his personnel record was sealed during his employment on the station.

Melissa turned her head and noticed a shadow fall across the window. Eric watched the shape of her nose against a distant wall. That face would haunt him after he left.

Outside, shields spiraled out of the station, metal sheltering the command module and critical infrastructure with interlocking steel bands and lead plates. The command center's interior remained lit by the screens of computer consoles and terminals, and dim overhead emergency lights.

Speakers in the dark control room popped. ""Subotai to N-X-171. This is an armed cruiser representing the Fugu Corporation. This is a command inspection. You will transfer control of your docking systems to our console. Compliance is your only choice in this matter. This is our last warning.""

The ship was repeating this message while closing from a thousand kilometers, before coming to a stop five thousand meters from the station. Rashid had ignored the threats. The Fugu corporation sold synthetic seafood - there were retort pouches full of the stuff in the station stockpile - and Fugu did not maintain warships.

The communications engineer peered up from the electronics pod, seeking direction from his superior, who nodded her head. The engineer pressed one of the few mechanical buttons on the console, and the Tribune spoke. ""Warship Subotai, This is Quorum Tribune Mitsumi Rashid. This is a Quorum facility in free space. Your corporation has no jurisdiction. You'll have to leave, now.""

Rashid waited until the 'talk' light on the console turned from green to red, and shouted at the weapons technician, ""What is it?""

The radio channel clicked closed on the warship. The communications engineer scanned through pages of data at her console. ""Scan manifest has... they have a full loadout. Why is an armed military vessel insisting on boarding? This isn't customary. Still no government ID, but this isn't a pirate ship. We're... uh... we're outgunned. Badly.""

The commander considered the engineer's words. Warships following procedure would disarm their weapons when approaching stations; required by law in civilized space, or near any station with substantial defensive weaponry. But the Subotai had approached at a high velocity, under false pretenses. ""Don't know. Did you let the geeks-""

Rashid was stopped mid-sentence by hardened metal penetrators, red-hot from their passage through newly molten armor, ripping into the command center. The rounds buzzed past the startled crew, through the observation windows on the opposite side of the cabin, and the glowing pellets lodged in the far blast shield.

The warship had initiated firing on manual control, disorienting the station's security systems. The ship outside rocked under the recoil of her projectile cannons. The defensive systems on the station returned fire, but the defensive weapons were torn apart by the warship's autocannons. Automated alarms flashed throughout the entire station, but were silent as the command center succumbed to vacuum. Dense liquid contained in capillaries embedded throughout armored walls of the structure expanded into foam, sealing the precise round holes, and air pressure returned, though not until several seconds after every person in direct control of the station died. A layer of white ice condensed on frozen consoles, eagerly waiting for commands to return fire.

The warship remained perched outside the station, a blocky mass defined by thick plates of armor, recessed sensors, and protruding robotic weapons. The Subotai was a predator designed exclusively for anti-station combat. Invisible patterns of energy wove across the hull of the station, painting glowing ribbons in the insufficient armor. Hardened bullets fired from kinetic launchers punched through the heat-softened hull, tracing behind the path of the beams. The station was being dismantled far more efficiently than it had been constructed.

Eric and Melissa flinched as the emergency alert system sounded.

""Guess I won't be finishing my dissertation here"", she quipped, trying to calm her nerves with a moment of wit. Everyone onboard the station knew it could become a coffin.

On a civilized station, civilians and crew should have taken the call as direction to head towards evacuation stations. The station wasn't equipped with the life pods typical of smaller fleet ships. Any attack sufficient to endanger the station itself would kill its inhabitants. There were a few supply shuttles, and if they were lucky, a nearby frigate would be waiting, but the station could never support transportation sufficient to allow the entire personnel complement to escape.

After witnessing the attack on the command center through the windows, like many others, Eric bolted towards his lab. The cafeteria was on an exposed outer deck, and he would travel deep within the station. Most of the labs, including the one he supported, operated under protocols that had to be carried out. He shouted orders to Melissa, that she should go to the transport bay, but he was sure she hadn't heard him.

Eric reminded himself of his priorities, that the Quorum entrusted him with responsibility. A moment of heroism, he decided, could benefit him later in life. The thought of being injured or killed seemed implausible. He was Eric Tisdale, Secret Agent Scientist, sleeping with strange women on distant space stations, and he was invincible. And if the intruders were not disabled quickly, the high-security lab deep within the station could be sealed, the life-support and power systems were redundant and distributed, and Eric decided that he would lock himself inside.

Bulkheads began to drop when the alarm activated to prevent atmospheric decompression in a damaged structural unit from affecting larger sections of the station. The quarter-meter-thick iron plates proved necessary while the cannons of the warship continued to carve through the station. The attack continued for a half kilosecond, venting the atmosphere of most of the outer levels on one side of the station. Satisfied with the carnage, the ship's lateral thrusters ignited, strafing around towards the opposite side. Small pods floated from the ship and tiny thrusters flared; boarding pods made contact with the hull, and elite combat engineers worked to cut through damaged armor with hand-held plasma torches.

The bulkheads had divided the ten-meter-wide main corridor into channels, ten meters in length with traverse possible through manual bypass hatches. The doors would open at a button press, but only when the air pressure on both sides of the door was the same. Eric knew the design had saved his life when the first bulkhead he encountered refused to open, but he would have to take a slower route that would keep him closer to the exterior of the station. He bolted through the large chambers, navigating through crowds of people attempting to flow through the small doors. He thought of some analogy of sea-creatures swimming against running water. Air was thinning; the threat started to become real, and his face broke into a sweat while his heart raced.

The first attack resulted in the death of one third of the station's population. More died from atmospheric decompression when soldiers cut through the hull. The remaining engineers, isolated on interior decks, swarmed towards their laboratories. Many of the engineers intended to uphold their obligation to protect their restricted-access work from confiscation by the invaders.

In most sectors, the local governments were more powerful than the Quorum government proper. The imbalance of power created a tense political situation. The facility performed research intended to maintain that situation, ensuring the Quorum government's enduring technical advantage. The Quorum used technology to maintain relative control over the sectors, ensuring peace. If a large amount of sensitive technology fell in to the hands of any one sector, an imbalance would be created that could destabilize the Quorum government.

The recyclers in the station screamed and were prioritized by the load-shedding system even over life support. Gravity-assisted tunnels lead towards anti-factories where blades, catalyzers, and mass reactors strained to convert the research of major labs and thousands of scientists into fuel and debris. Eric and Marshall reached their lab at the same time, and Marshall began barking orders.

Eric understood the protocols before Marshall had finished.

""Procedure. Everything goes down the hatches.""

Marshall explained that the station commander would surrender, and that they'd be killed if they didn't destroy the research before the invaders came. Eric understood - their lives only held value if they were the only store of knowledge. If the commander could have scuttled the station, Marshall knew she would have. Eric watched for Devon, though he never arrived. Marshall assumed his colleague had run to the transport bay, abdicating his responsibilities, hoping to escape the station alive. He'd end up dead with that sort of strategy.

The adrenaline began to subside, and Eric's heart no longer threatened to burst in his chest. Deep in the station, the walls muffled the sound of weapons fire. The attack seemed like a bad dream, thirty seconds of carnage fading behind two kiloseconds of work. Eric and Marshall shoved the results of several careers in cognitive integration and biomechanics into a rectangular hole in the wall. Computers, trash, paper notes, and robotic components were torn apart alike. They hustled to completion. Marshall looked at Eric. ""One last thing.""

Marshall looked around. Aside from the contents of the workbench, only hand tools remained. Nearly everything with integrated storage had been destroyed, and the rest was one room over. Marshall knew that smugglers had brought the equipment aboard, and figured it would make his career if he could get the project off the station by the same means, before the invaders came around.

""Alright, you're done. Eres is in the basement. Head to the transport bay, stop by and trash it on the way. I'll finish cleaning up the lab.""

Eric's gaze became dismissive. He could see his own breath. Life support must have been disabled. His heart began to beat faster. Emergency pressure cylinders would be dumping their contents into the station atmosphere. Without life support to circulate and warm the air, the expanding gas would reduce station temperatures below freezing. The event was survivable with appropriate equipment, but Eric was dressed in light clothing. He hoped the station commander would surrender, and realized his odds of seeing home were growing dim.

Marshall's voice was kind. ""Eric, that's an order. Go.""

Eric bowed and jogged out the lab entrance. He decided that the some wretched iron-and-jelly box didn't matter, and rushed towards the transport bay. He never arrived.

Marshall walked to the mechanical room, where the experiment lay, wrapped in plastic and metal, the same protective tape applied during the manufacturing process. His fingers poked at a portable terminal that lay next to the experiment. The device displayed diagnostic data for a few seconds, and went blank. Marshall tossed the tablet into a recycling hatch in the main area, returned to the room, put a small green bottle to his lips, and inhaled.

He eased the diagnostic umbilical out of a socket and folded a layer of reinforced synthetic flesh over the maintenance port. Marshall picked up the body, surprised at his body's unwillingness to tolerate the burden. Marshall spoke, activating a vocal backdoor in the auditory symbolic interpreter, and delivered the first of a series of activation commands. A fugue of statements and synthetic spoken responses played out, and the machine's mind was brought in control of the body.

Gravity fluctuated, weakening and strengthening, and Marshall fought for balance. He left the lab and continued toward the center of the station, hoping the powered transport tubes and their tiny, uncomfortable trains remained functional. He felt the body tense and release in his arms as the prototype's mechanical actuators gathered charge and came on-line. The sight could have been romantic, he thought, if she wasn't wrapped in aluminum, and he wasn't about to die.

Marshall passed through two dozen bulkheads before he completed initializing the machine he carried. He was relieved in finding the robot would follow him, under its own power and initiative, into the tram station that would take them to a shuttle in the transportation bay. The pair reached the lobby before discovering that an inoperative train was parked inside, just beyond the entrance. He entered the car and gestured in front of a terminal, bringing the computer to life. Displaying diagnostic error messages, the terminal explained the problem. The artificial gravity system that should move the car along the station's central axis had become unreliable, and the tram shut down based on a safety interlock. Marshall worked to override the interlock when his ears began to tingle. A low howl sounded through the tunnel, and Marshall looked up, and saw a tram from several dozen levels above hurtling towards him.


***



""Sir, system scans show 90% of the survivors are in the transport bay. Seven shuttles have already left. They have stealth; we've lost PRES lock on the first two."" The ship's sensors were the best the Ura had developed, and commercial technology operable by Quorum citizens still outpaced them.

The commander of the Subotai peered at the display. The shuttles were small, some just larger than life support pods. Two were sizeable enough to smuggle equipment out of the station, but he was certain he hadn't given them sufficient time transport any of the bulky valuables he wanted. And if the equipment was difficult to move, it would be difficult to destroy.

The infantry assault force exhausted their allotted time. He needed to clear the station of survivors to prevent additional damage to equipment. If the civilians knew the attackers were permitting escape, they might be more inclined to leave. ""Let them go. We'll get what we need. The incoming ships can pick them up. Send the message.""

The specialist obeyed, and watched his displays while the ship's cooling systems struggled to return the orange-hot ceramic heatsinks on the gun pods to ambient temperatures. Massive pistons drove molten copper salts through cooling channels and into heat pumps. Plasma vented aft of the ship in a cloud of inert neon light. The Subotai was equipped with nuclear weapons, and would annihilate the station after scouring it, but for the moment, the intent was to pillage.


***



Marshall's thumb found the sharp edge of a broken rib protruding through his skin. The one tram had slammed into the other, but the structural supports held. Inertia slung both trams towards the outside station, where they collided with a bulkhead door and came to an abrupt stop. The tram lost a third of its three-meter height, crushed under the force of the impact, blossoming outwards, rupturing the outer walls of the transfer tube. Marshall groaned, having been maimed by a simple broken handrail.

He scowled at the machine, his face full of pain. She was standing, staring at him. The collision left her unfazed; she stumbled about the chamber for a moment, and regained her balance automatically. The design was good, though not so good to save his life. Chunks of smashed glass glinted from her hair and skin and the exposed protective film.

""Ina, order. Throw yourself in a recycling tube. Shit, if they find you, I'll be executed.""

The woman knelt and crawled towards the side of the wrecked tube. With his injuries, the scientist would die within the kilosecond. The plastic covering her crinkled and cracked while she struggled to convince her limbs to pull her through a broken wall.

Outside of the tube, Ina entered a pressurized deck three levels above the transport bay. The announcement system crackled and relayed instructions for all personnel to evacuate, and listed nearby corridors had become obstructed. She observed the presence of a large bovine specimen possessing liquid gray eyes and a mass of fifteen hundred kilograms. The beast snorted, then turned, ambling towards a sign. The animal stopped for a moment, waiting for Ina to follow. She failed to understand what was happening. Data indicated she was receiving information from external sensors, and her usual connection to the simulator was inactive. The environment was foreign, after waking from simulated dreams. The presence of the animal was irrational, yet indicated.

The signs were simple pictographs augmented with text in the common language, easy to follow towards the transporation bay. She perceived a simple string of symbols communicating actionable facts: if she were to navigate in this direction, she would arrive at some particular location. The route was simple: a series of ramps used for moving large cargo from the bay through to the largest tube on the station. A fragment of her mind became aware of heat and minor damage. A dying security guard watched a woman wrapped in the burnt tatters of a lab coat and green plastic walk through a pile of burning packing crates that had once contained food and basic supplies. Outside, a warship switched to incendiary ammunition so as to further deplete the station's oxygen supplies. The invaders would find the approach effective.

Trapped under twisted plastic supports that had dropped out of the ceiling, Krista watched a figure stumble out of the fire, peeling burning fragments of clothing from itself. What she saw seemed to be formed from a movie or a nightmare. Krista had tried to shift out from under some of the supports, but the largest, which remained tethered to the ceiling by massive power cables, pinned her legs. Krista grunted at the figure, unable to gather the breath to scream or ask for help. The form materialized into a woman her own age, sooty and smoldering, clearing past the smoke. Krista managed to a single squeak when the girl continued down the hallway, past and away from her. She hadn't expected a response, after her own companions had left her behind when the overhead structure collapsed.

Ina's sensors indicated the bull had disappeared. Confused, Ina turned around towards Krista and assessed the situation. The girl was trapped but alive. The debris could be removed, since most of the individual pieces would have a weight of less than fifty kilograms in the reduced gravity. Ina chose to move towards the girl, hefting a metal pole along the way. Ina used the pole to pry the largest support from Krista. Under normal gravity, the largest support column trapping Krista would weigh several hundred kilograms, due to the electrical cabling inside. Ina moved the column and pulled smaller pieces of debris and revised her assessment: the girl's legs had been crushed by the injury. Purple welts had formed; the injury must have been recent, and loss of life due to blood volume failure was the most probable outcome. Ina wondered whether she would have helped Marshall, had he asked.

Ina lifted Krista with an awkward gentleness, placing one arm under her knees, the other under her shoulders. The girl passed out from pain as Ina turned to move down the hallway. Smoke was thick and choking hot, but Ina left it behind during her descent through the cargo ramp. Without air circulation or filtering, the toxins from burning wreckage would incapacitate and eventually kill any human. The poison didn't matter to Ina, her symbolic interpreter registered scent and irritation, and the experience was lost in the flood from her sensors. The synthetic skin on the soles of her feet became damaged, but her mobility was unaffected.

Two men in combat uniforms reached the intersection at the bottom of the ramp and peered around. They wore padded greatcoats with pistols hanging from the sides. They saw the pair and stared at the women for a moment; one, with misshapen legs, held in the arms of another, covered in crinkled, silvery-green fabric, wisps of smoke floating up. Ina tracked small dots of blood with her footsteps. Her face and hands were bright red from the heat. The shorter man gestured towards the pair. He started to rush towards them, when the second man grabbed his elbow and held him in place. The taller man spoke and gestured. ""Wow. This way!""

The men waited until the pair reached the intersection before the group continued towards the transport bay. The taller man asked if he should carry the injured girl. Ina ignored the question, and seemed comfortable with the weight in the lowered gravity, and even her own injuries, and he dropped the issue. The intersection led to another, which split into a series of hallways. The lighted signs in front of the hallways were dead; all of the hallways ended in closed doors.

The taller man removed his overcoat and placed it over Ina's shoulders. ""Ma'am, I'm Specialist Ross Simons. We'll get out of here as soon as we find a transport. Can I do anything to help you?""

Ina ignored the gesture and remained silent and motionless. None of the input she observed assisted her. She didn't know what she wanted. She was haunted by a vague desire to survive, but she wasn't sure what that meant in the context of the last kilosecond.

The other man pointed at a newly-flashing yellow light above one of the loading bays doors and said that it indicating a ship was undergoing pre-launch checks. Ina watched the bull walk down the fifty meter hallway, through the closed airlock at the end, a quarter-meter of hardened steel and lead-glass. A simple desire formed in Ina's mind, to follow.

The four headed towards the launch indicator and barged through the loading bay airlock when it opened. A handful of people moved around a medium-range shuttle, sleek and matte-black, with a shape that might a remind a planet-born person of a seashell. The area seemed cramped, three meters between the shuttle, the personnel airlock, and less by the massive wall that would swing open like an airlock when the shuttle launched. The craft was large enough, designed for a combination of cargo and personnel transport.

A shuttle crew member saw the four approach and swore. ""Colin! Medic! Earn your damn pay, we're on the clock!""

Ina and Krista were approached by a man responding to the call. He was dressed in a simple tee-shirt and plastic pants, not the usual scrubs and protective clothing of a Quorum medic. He carried a large orange duffel bag hanging from a strap around his shoulder, with the bulk under his arm. The medic waved Ina in, then took and lifted the limp body in his arms, careful to avoid injuring the girl further. Colin was certain the shuttle contained a gurney and trauma kit, but couldn't imagine where.

In the launch bay, the crew scrambled to finish the shuttle's emergency launch. The crew was resting in a small suite near the bay when the attack begun, but the shuttle was powered down and de-fueled for maintenance. Two crew-members had spent the entire attack scrambling to detach electrical harnesses and seal panels where maintenance technicians had left work incomplete. Another bypassed the automated controls of a refueling mech and had nearly finished replenishing the shuttle's supply.

The medic led the pair onto the shuttle, first into a large common area, then through a small hallway, and to tiny quarters. The room was blue-hued with walls that seemed to be made of thick carpet. The color and texture of the walls and ceiling matched the floor. The fabric walls were attached to free-standing cylinders each spaced a meter apart, constructed from dull, unfinished steel, and jutting out of mounting points in the floor. The medic introduced himself and laid Krista onto a bed, a thick structure extruded from mottled brown plastic in the center of the space. Hinged, it could open into a storage chest for bedding and clothing. Krista's head lolled to the side as she settled; her breathing remained strong.

Colin turned towards Ina for a moment. ""Are you hurt? What's your name?""

The woman's face was small and triangular. Her dark hair was ragged and singed. Colin noted the whites of her eyes were clear, wrapping blue irises and pupils that glimmered in the bay lighting. Synthetic eyes, and retro-reflective, Colin knew. That close to fire, and reeking of smoke, her lungs should be in revolt, and her eyes should be red and wet. He wondered if she was a full-synthetic conversion or just a mech, and waited for her response. ""I am unharmed. My name is Ina.""

""And hers?""

""I don't know.""

""Ok. Her legs are... smashed. Which means she's bleeding.""

Ina nodded. Colin fished around in the bag that hung at his side, finding a pistol-gripped injection system in a plastic case, and a fist-sized cartridge with a series of multi-colored spheres inside of it. ""What happened to her?""

Ina responded without hesitation. ""The ceiling subframe appeared to have collapsed. Within the preceding two kiloseconds, on the cargo ramp adjacent to the local docking lobby.""

""Ok. I'm going to give her a nasty drug cocktail. This shuttle doesn't have a medical facility, but we can keep her alive until we get somewhere else. Did she get hit anywhere else? Did you find her sitting up or laying down?""

""Her torso was clear of debris.""

Ina stared at Colin while he jabbed Krista with the gun in the chest and in each leg, close to the hip. The large-gauge needle punched through clothing, skin, and bone alike. The device pumped a synthesized a cocktail of coagulants, stimulants, anesthetics, and antibiotics into her bloodstream. He wouldn't know if she had any internal injuries other than her legs until he could stop that bleeding. If she was bleeding internally, the best he could do was to manage the pain. Colin looked up at Ina and took stock of the girl, burnt hair, bare footed, and wrapped in a security guard's greatcoat.

The shuttle thumped when the bay's airlock vented. The announcement system activated. ""Folks, we're gonna make a run for it. That attack ship might be military, eight ships ahead of us have gotten out of passive sensor range, so we're probably ok. They're still firing on the station, and there's no armor in the transport bay, so here we go. Strap in, we're gonna burn hard. Colin, I can't see you, buzz when you're ready.""

Colin looked helplessly at Ina as he pulled on a metal slot in one of the support columns on his side of the room. The metal slot revealed a folding slab, which expanded, fanning open from a single joint, becoming a simple chair. The chair was made of woven netting, and a seven-point acceleration harness made of the same fabric hung from the seat and slot. The medic pulled a second chair out, and pulled Krista from the table and onto the chair. Krista remained motionless and unconscious. He first strapped Krista in, and took his own seat. The shuttle bounced lightly as thrusters nudged the ship out of the bay and from the station's gravity system. When the shuttle's own gravity controls engaged, the occupants felt like they were tipping from side-to-side for several seconds.

Ina had pulled another chair out, lashed the harness over her shoulders, across her waist, and around her knees in the same manner as Colin. He gave Ina a thumbs up and two raised eyebrows, and she indicated her readiness with a nod. The man pressed a button at his side, and let the pilot know they were restrained.

The engines of the shuttle pulsed into full power. The acceleration of the craft was limited by the ability of the dilaton mesh to keep the crew alive: at emergency acceleration, the dilaton mesh could not fully counteract the perceived force, and the exertion of the engines pressed Ina into her chair, and Colin out of his. The straps held them in place for half a kilosecond. The acceleration faded and Ina watched circulation return to Colin's face.

""Sorry for that. These kinds of shuttles need fifteen kiloseconds, actually, to spin up before hard acceleration. Since we got one of the last ones left, it was powered down until the station got attacked.""

Ina acknowledged with a nod. ""What is this ship's destination?""

Colin shook his head, unstrapping himself from his chair. He checked Krista's vitals with his fingertips, then attached a bright copper ribbon from his bag around her neck. Wire traces along the ribbon lit up; the flexible film began to work, sensing, recording, and transmitting data. Walking to the wall, Colin pushed a black button on a panel near the door.

""Rolf, where're we going?""

Several other buttons adorned the panel, gently colored globes and squares, simple controls for lighting and communication. Static clicked and a voice came from a speaker hidden near the top of the door, behind the carpet-wall. ""Don't know. How are the kids?""

Colin pressed the button a second time. ""Not good. The one's bleeding internally. Safe to be up and about?""

""Yeah. This shuttle came loaded. Bronco's bringing you the trauma kit.""

""Thanks.""

Ina remained motionless, sitting, acceleration harness loose but still locked. Colin looked her over, eyeing the burnt hair and soot-covered skin, but unable to see any severe injury or signs of shock. The coat more than covered her, and he could tell she didn't want to deal with him.

""You've got second degree burns.""

Ina thought for a moment and responded, ""No."" She was certain that she was hiding who she was, and without knowing why, she was also certain that medical treatment would be problematic.

Colin squinted and hoped her stubbornness was enough to keep her safe. ""Taken any anesthetics? When were you burnt?""

A knock came from the door. Colin waved, and the door opened. A bulky man with light brown skin and short grey hair handed Colin a large case, eyed the girls, and closed the door behind him after he left.

Colin turned, leaning against the wall, and said, ""Ok. Well, your friend is going to need observation. Her new jewelry will alert us if anything bad might be happening. This shuttle's set up for twenty crew and passengers. I guess there's seven of us, so-""

""She's not my friend.""

""Excuse me?""

Ina looked at Colin. ""Sorry. I first encountered her in the cargo ramp where I found her injured. You said that she was my friend.""

""Er, well, the point is, this is a converted cargo hold. That wall"" - Colin pointed - ""slides back. Give me a moment, and it'll be big enough for you both, and then some. If you go out this door, take a left, go all the way to the end, and take another left, you'll be at the common room. Take a right, and you'll be in the hygiene shop.""

""Thank you.""

Colin said, ""You smell terrible. Why don't you go get cleaned up? I don't mean to be selfish, but we're short-handed and I'd like to ask you to keep an eye on her. I have some other things I'll need to take care of until you get back."" Tapping the button, Colin continued. ""Pathik, open up the wall between quarters nine and ten, please.""

The wall shifted, sliding towards the door, revealing another room. The furnishings were identical to the first, with two small beds with a table between them. A simple plastic chest was attached to the floor at the foot of each bed, for storage of personal belongings. The webbing chairs folded into the support columns, and the fabric dividing wall wrapped itself into a column between the door to the quarters, and the freshly-revealed door to the neighboring room.

Ina stared at Colin for a moment and wondered why he used so many words. Her head rolled slowly to the side, hesitating, then turning up. Her face remained expressionless. She selected a single option from a conversation-response menu presented in front of her, and felt her mouth form the single word, ""Ok.""

Colin leaned the back of his head against the wall for a moment, staring at the ceiling. He backed out of the quarters, and turned towards the common area. Ina closed the door closed behind him.

I have requested for more tasks, or just some feedback for me to improve on the previous task, yet nothing has been assigned to me still.

nwdf2k,1,2021-06-09,Which internship should I quit?,moonmoonoop,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/nwdf2k/which_internship_should_i_quit/,"Hi all,

I got offered three internships for this summer. In a really really stupid haze, I accepted all three offers. I understand I shouldn't have gone about things this way, but now I need to make a sacrifice. Internships 1 and 2  started already. These are both remote, and I can do them at the same time. I also accepted internship 3 which is supposed to start next week. This one is in person, there is no way I can do all three.

Background: I just graduated with a degree in justice studies. I have done mostly political communications internships in the past. I am not too sure about my career goals at the moment, but I definitely want to work in the human rights field. My ideal position would be working as a Policy Analyst/Associate for a nonprofit dedicated to civil/human rights work (like the ACLU). In other words, I want to be in both the public policy and human rights realm. Or I am also not completely writing off going to law school to become a human rights attorney. I think I'd want to work in either DC or NYC.

Here are the facts

Internship 1 is unpaid, it's about 24 hours a week, but I am not really heavily monitored with it being remote. I have been able to get some other stuff done and still complete my tasks for the day in the allotted time. I am making social media content for a non-partisan, well-known think tank in DC. I've already done social media work, and I don't think I'll learn anything new/beneficial from this. However, I accepted and planned to do it because of the potential connections (although I am not sure at this point what connections I can make with it being remote). So, I guess the real potential benefit is that I have this reputable DC organization to put on my resume and maybe have a slightly better chance of being hired by the org in the future (in another area of work) or another DC org since I have the name affiliation and my supervisor as a reference. I think the fact that I made the commitment and started this one already is freaking me out in terms of quitting.

Internship 2 offers a 1000 dollar stipend, it's about 10 hours a week, remote, and I'm working on projects for the political department of a grassroots org dedicated to electing progressive women in Texas. I have done similar internships to this in the past, but never in the political department. So far, I have been assigned projects having to do with data collection, outreach (reaching out to women in Texas to discuss running for office), and social media. I don't really have problems with this internship. I accepted it because it may give me a little bit of a different experience than I've had in the past. I don't believe I'd want to be hired on because I don't have a desire to work in Texas. But, I could still relationships within the political realm. (This one I probably wouldn't quit either way because it really wouldn't make that much a difference since I can do it alongside internship 1 or 3) 

Internship 3 is unpaid, it's about 18 hours a week, in-person (about a 25-30 min commute), and it's for the Attorney General's Office. For privacy reasons, I won't be specifying the state, but it's my home state which happens to be pretty conservative. I would be working with the Community Outreach/Education division which deals with crime prevention. The description states that I'd be answering calls, emails, working on social media, research, job shadowing, assisting with special projects, and taking on a special project of my own. In the interview, I asked about these special projects, but it's still unclear to me what it would be. This definitely seems like a more professional, established internship in a slightly new area of work for me. However, there are a few things on my mind. It is unpaid and it seems that the cost-benefit analysis isn't great (more tasks expected, gas money, etc. and nothing in return monetarily). I also don't necessarily want to stay in the state long-term. I am sure the connections I make may lead to me out-of-state opportunities, but I'd imagine the internship would really only help me out in the local community. Party affiliation and general disagreement with the state government has me questioning if I should even do this. I know that shouldn't be a deterrent, but it definitely is a thought in my head. Lastly, doing this internship would mean I have to quit one of the other ones (more than likely internship 1). I have already accepted the internship 3 offer (basically said I am still interested and will be coming in for orientation) but I imagine it's probably not as bad to quit before starting as it is to do it after.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I have to make a choice between internships 1 and 3. Which do you think I should choose? 

I could try to talk to my internship 1 supervisor and see if I can still stay on the team but maybe work at night drafting posts and whatnot (I am not really sure she'd agree). 

If I quit internship 1, how should I go about it? Will I definitely burn bridges or am I overthinking this? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I accepted three internships, I have to quit one. I am deciding between internship 1 which is a remote social media internship for a think tank in DC (already started this internship) and internship 3 which is an in-person internship at the Attorney General's Office with the Community Outreach division.

Internship 1 

Pros: in DC which means I can potentially make connections in the city I'd like to move to, easy work/remote 

Cons: not really learning much, done social media work in the past, unpaid

Internship 3 

Pros: a new area of work, seems to be more professional and established in the sense that they expect interns to take on more responsibility

Cons: unpaid (and they expect interns to do a lot), not really in the field/state that I want to work in"

The LOR from my Physics and Math teachers were very good. I've known them since freshman year and actively participated in their classes. Also I have been involved in projects outside of the coursework with both of them. 

Counselor: This helped address the things that are different at my school to an average American school. She knows me since I was in grade 1 and talked a lot about my leadership and how I helped the administration manage throughout the years.

Employer: He was very impressed by my performance in the internship and talked about how I added some key points to a app they were developing.

**Interviews**

I only got a interview from Upenn which was okayish 

**Essays**

The essays were my strongest part. An AO wrote to me and said that he loved my writing. For the personal essay I wrote how I survived the worst earthquake of the century and how it paralleled with my great grandfather's survival of the second world war and how this whole experience changed me.

**Additional Information:**

My family immigrated to the States a few years ago however, I stayed back in my home country to complete my high school. 

I shot gunned and I feel it worked for me. I reused my essays a lot so thinking back I don't think applying to a lot of schools had a significant increase in time commitment. 

Also I never thought I would get the results I did, and I am extremely grateful for it. Before the application cycle began, my top (somewhat realistic) choices were Umich, UT Austin and UCLA. That's why UT Austin's rejection hurt the most. Also there was a difference of over two months between Umich's EA acceptance and Stanford's RD acceptance, during those two months I go heavily attached to Umich, even found roommates and basically fell in love with the school. So leaving Umich was also very hard for me.

Also one thing that's been bothering me is that I got into most of the public school I applied to but got rejected from most of the private schools I applied to. Is this a coincidence or is this because private have less intake or something else."

nwh7ik,3,2021-06-10,How do you deal with your partner’s comments and feeling accepted? Best ways for communication?,knuffeldiers,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/nwh7ik/how_do_you_deal_with_your_partners_comments_and/,"Hi guys! Some background about myself. I’m a 26F and I just got diagnosed in November last year. My boyfriend 29M and I have been dating 3 years - 1 year long distance, 2 in-person and we don’t live together, but see each other most of the week. I am currently medicated and it helps, while also undergoing some group therapy to help with behavioral aspects. I have always been high functioning, primarily inattentive, and am doing my Master’s in the foreign country of my partner. My ADD symptoms definitely became exacerbated in the past months due to lack of a support system here/ stressful full-time internship/ corona-related graduation delays. However, they have definitely always been there and played a role in our relationship. 

Anyway, my partner has attended some meetings with my therapist to try to understand what ADD is better. We’ve slowly started trying to communicate things more openly. However, on the flip-side of this, I take what he says as harsh criticism and feel like I can’t be my authentic self with him. I had caffeine a bit late the other day and he was commenting that I had too much energy, it was too much for him. The weather was finally nice and I was just happy, then his comment quickly soured my mood. I have a hard time “talking” about these things, because to some extent this is just who I am as a person so it feels like a character attack. I’m having a hard time separating the ADD symptoms from who I am as a person, especially when I know I did take my medication that day. 

It’s shitty to always feel like you aren’t enough for your partner with who you are as a person. I’m trying to always live up to his standards and feel like I fall short. He tries to be kind mostly and tell me not to feel shame, but it definitely triggers feelings of it. 

He gets upset because he doesn’t feel like he can tell me just how he’s feeling without it bothering me. His culture is to be very direct, which I’ve gotten more used to. I’m trying to be able to talk about it, but what do I say, “This is how I am. I can try to hold back my energy, but I’m happy and excited right now for once?”. 

How have you guys handled these situations or feelings? I definitely appreciate advice. Please don’t jump to, “Break up with him!” because this is going to be an issue in any other serious relationship I may have. I just want to find a good balance between communication and helping my partner understand that some things I just can’t change. 


Thanks a lot!"

He was an amazing writer and excelled in the things he was passionate towards. Excelled as in won national and international awards. He had very top notch LORs. He also published two research papers from a lab at an IVY medical school. Very passionate individual, but got flat out rejected from every T20 especially with a surprising reject from the IVY he did research at along with a lot of Top Public schools (UMich, Cal, UCLA, UCSD...) 

He committed and is currently attending Ohio State University BioE on a full ride with plans of possibly double majoring with Computer Engineering and on the premed track. He already has multiple internships, research and other leadership positions under his belt. During a conversation, he told me that choosing OSU was the best decision he had ever made.

Don’t even regret or feel shameful towards your acceptance. Be proud of your accomplishments and you never know how life will take it’s course. In the end, it doesn’t matter whether you go to Harvard or a state school, it is what you make of the experiences throughout your four years that matters. Fly high and congratulations to the class of 2025."

I am an international student majoring in CS at U.S. university and I recently changed to CS from non-stem degree; last spring semester was my first semester as a CS student and my first coding class/experience ever.

Now, I am self-learning HTML/CSS/JS to make a website and plan to make my own website by end of summer (only front-end tho)  since I will be also taking 8 credits of classes during the summer, which as DS&amp;ALGO and Calculus. Will plan to learn backend and hopefully I can finish them during the fall.

Now, I know it is gonna be super hard for me to get an internship for summer 2022 due to lack of experience but I want to give it a shot and just think it will be also a good experience me to prepare for the 2023 summer.

Now, I am wondering when should I apply for the internship based on my situation? Should I apply for it right after summer which I will have more experience than now? Will the company even consider the personal website without backend work as a personal project?  To be honest, I am not sure what would be the best strategy for me..

Thank you so much for your the time to read my post and looks forward to hearing from you!"
nwhqci,2,2021-06-10,"I messed up my first year of college, what now?",Over_Championship_30,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/nwhqci/i_messed_up_my_first_year_of_college_what_now/,"I just finished my second semester at a university I was really looking forward to getting into to. I initially wanted to go for the film program there, since it's a pretty notable one, and I worked hard to get a scholarship to pay off my tuition in full. I was told the film program didn't actually accept people until their 2nd year, so I applied as a communications major. It wasn't exactly what I imagined myself doing, but I figured it was closer to the ""right idea"" than going in unexplored. 

I had plenty of advisor meetings my first semester, in fact I relied on them heavily because all of this was so new to me. I believed I was on the right track. 

While this is minor, my first inconvenience was the last week of my second semester. I tried to register for all the classes I needed for the communications major, just to find out that my credits never transferred (after trying twice) so my registration date was much later. I ended up calling the office to get my credits transferred, which suddenly made me an academic sophomore. However, all the classes I registered for filled up within a day and I lost them. I was frustrated, because I had completed almost all of my general education classes and didn't know what else to choose. 

I had another advisor meeting to try to fix it, but she was a bit stumped, and suggested I register for classes from other majors for the time-being. So I did. 

 I also took two math classes my second semester to fit in my milestones, since I wasn't able to register for them my first semester because they filled up too quickly. Stat and College Algebra. My grades were fine the entire semester, so I wasn't worried about any classes. I took statistics my last year of highschool, and my college stat class didn't have any new material on it. It was just time-consuming outside of my other courses and my job. 

My stat professor started moving test dates around towards the end of the semester. I missed the last test prior to the final because I was on a weekend trip, and he moved the test date from the week after to that weekend, while I was gone. I didn't see it until it was too late. Brought me down to a C. Okay, I wasn't going to stress, I would just bring it up on the Final.

I moved back home for the summer. Took all my finals at home. My Stat class was my last final left, it was scheduled for a different week than the rest. Didn't worry about it. A few days before the weekend he sends an email saying he's moved the Final to the Friday before the weekend starts. I had my other math final that day, thought it was nice to get it done all at once. The day comes, I take my Algebra final, and completely forget I have the Stat final as well. So I missed it. Honest mistake. I couldn't have remembered even if I went back in time. I decided to try my luck and ask for an extension on the Final to take it the next morning. 

I didn't get a reply the next morning. Went to a wedding that afternoon, we stayed out late of course, and didn't come back until the next day. I check my emails and find out that he decided to give me the extension later that evening until 11:59pm. Great. I missed the Final. Twice. There was no way I was getting another chance, and I was already embarrassed that I had missed something so important multiple times.

So I failed my Stat class. 

I also had already started a marketing internship for the summer, so I could catch up on my major. 

I can't remember why, but somehow I went to my advisor to ask him something about my internship. He tells me that my internship won't count for credit because I'm not formally accepted into my major yet (he was also the same advisor who approved my internship before I started.) But offers me a program to join to get recognition on my transcript for it. So I try to join the program. A few days later they email me back saying they can't give me credit on my transcript because there is a hold on my account. I ask my advisor about the hold. Looks like my GPA has dropped below a 3.0 so I'm off track for my major. They switch me to a ""certificate recognition"" option for my internship. My advisor tells me I need to set up a meeting to change majors. So I do. 

I really only have an interest in communication- related majors, since I've decided against the film major. I was starting to look into Marketing or Public Relations...turns out everything in the School of Communications is competitive. The advisor plans out a course for me to go into IT or Humanities. I have absolutely no interest in either one. She also advised me to retake the Stat course by the end of this summer. I asked if it could raise my GPA, and she said no. 

I also just got an email a few days ago that I lost my financial aid because my GPA dropped below a 3.0... and since I failed a course, I didn't earn enough credit hours to use my ""one time restoration"". So even if I raised my GPA next year, I wouldn't be able to gain back the financial aid. 

My boyfriend suggests that I quit everything. According to him, I should drop the internship (because it's no longer related to my major.) I should pick a more practical major (so I can be stable and make money when I graduate.) I should transfer to a community college, or just stay home and take online courses (because there's no point in racking up student loans for a degree that won't guarantee a stable job, and certainly not for a degree I have no interest in.) He also wants me to quit my current job to go work in some place that's a better ""career-starter"" and makes more money, like a law firm or a hospital. And by quitting everything else, he thinks I could open my schedule up to start working full-time and save up money. 

My boyfriend is great with money. Super invested in stocks. Organizes his spending every month. Goes cheap on the mundane things in life. He didn't have a great work-ethic in highschool, so he couldn't get scholarships for college.. He goes to a community college. Used connections to get into a university last semester, but he only stayed for a week before dropping out and went back to his community college to finish his AA. He doesn't plan on pursuing education past this. Instead, he's saving up to get his own house and wants to start a family by the time he's 25 (not necessarily with me. Just the life path he has planned.) He's also great at getting jobs. Went straight from Walgreens, to an upscale restaurant, to the financial firm he currently works at. He has his career planned to stay in finance. He used his connections to get to where he is now. It works for him. 

We're also breaking up at the end of this summer because I just signed an apartment lease for college, which is in a completely different city about 3 hours away. Recently, he's been asking me to move in with him and leave my current college, so I don't have to worry about all these financial mistakes I've made. Really, I think he just says it because he doesn't want me to leave. I've told him before that it isn't what I want right now, and he acknowledges it and tells me that I know better than to make decisions over some boy. 

I haven't quit anything yet. Maybe I'm just too prideful. But I can tell he's disappointed by the choices I'm making, which is starting to make me feel stupid, and even though I've never taken the offer seriously, my anxiety is making me reconsider if moving in with him would make me better-off. 

I'm incredibly stressed. I'm having a hard time keeping my thoughts separated from other people's opinions. I don't think I can afford a ""potential"" life path anymore, and my current options are not at all what I want. I'm afraid of making a choice I'm going to regret. I already didn't know what I wanted to do with the rest of my life, but now that I've lost my financial aid, it seems really expensive to not know what I'm doing. My boyfriend keeps stressing that I need to pick a career path and stick to it, but now that I have to enter an uncompetitive major, I'm afraid of getting stuck in a career path I don't even remotely desire. I definitely don't want to waste money on a degree I'm not going to pursue. 

I tried to find counseling through the school to help me actualize some goals and figure out what I want, not to mention help with my anxiety. I was denied because they don't take new clients over the summer, so my option is to wait until next fall or pay for my own therapist. Neither of those sound helpful to me right now. 

I really don't know what to do anymore. 

I think I just put together an entire essay, so in summary: 

-My freshman year. Academically now a rising Junior.
-Credits transferred late
-Failed a course
-GPA dropped below 3.0
-Current Internship won't be counting for credit
-Have to change my major to something I'm not interested in. 
-Lost my Financial Aid 
-Relationship anxiety"
nwie4h,8,2021-06-10,I got my first job... and I hate it...,CometBoards,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nwie4h/i_got_my_first_job_and_i_hate_it/,"After 4 years of school, I got my first job at a small automation company. I was super excited, but after working for only 2 weeks, I already hate it.

1 They are behind on ALL their projects, yet the sales department keeps signing new projects. We currently have more active projects than people that work at the company.

2 I am the only person with ANY comp sci or software background. The employees are mechanical engineers and don’t know the difference between a float or an int. (I’m serious, a guy told me he had been debugging his program for hours and he had int x = .5 in the first 5 lines. Told me I was a “genius” for figuring it out so quickly.)

3 For my first project, they expect me to be some sort of wizard and fix some broken c++ computer vision code written by an intern over a year ago who no longer works at the company. The code is over 8,000 lines long and is split into less than 5 functions. (They are over a year late on delivering with this particular project.) Even if I do fix it, the sensors they have suck and will never be more than ~80% reliable, but I know I will still be the one to blame when the customer is unhappy with the result. I told them this during the last meeting and was told “we hired you to fix it”. 😑

How do I leave this job without leaving a permanent black mark on my record? This company has less than 20 people and they spent a bunch of money getting me a desk and new monitors. I fell bad for not giving it at least a few months, but at the same time this company is fundamentally broken and completely mismanaged. The thought of even working here another year makes me wanna cry. It’s not even a startup. The company has been in business since the late 80s.

If nothing else, I just want to vent. I got my comp sci degree to be a problem solver. I know I was a gifted programmer during school. I was always the “go to” guy among my comp sci classmates when they needed help. Now I feel like I am just wasting my talent and my education.

Thanks for any advice! Currently writing this in the middle of the night after waking up from a work-related nightmare."

nwk7ts,2,2021-06-10,[Scholarships] SGIS SIA EC Dilemma,Xyrialight00,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/nwk7ts/scholarships_sgis_sia_ec_dilemma/,"Hi everybody, I’ve just recently been offered an SGIS Scholarship in my field of study (Aeronautical Engineering), for SIA Engineering Company. However I’m also currently a recipient of the NUS Merit Scholarship hence now I’m in the dilemma of which scholarship of the 2 I should take. 

Just some context about myself, I’m passionate about the aviation field and am really interested to work with aircrafts in the future as my career which is why I chose my course of study. However, I’ve also heard about how the aviation industry in Singapore is MRO-focused which I’m still not too convinced if it is what I want to do in the future as I would prefer to be at the forefront of innovation in the aviation industry.

My original plan was to sign up for internship attachments during university at MRO companies such as SIA EC to see if the job scope is of my interest. However now that I have been offered the SGIS scholarship, I will have to make my decision now about my career choice.

Additionally, I understand that scholars would likely go through a rotational style in the company to give them a holistic understanding of the firm and gear them to take up managerial and executive positions. 

This sounds like a scholar would be more involved in the planning and administrative work rather than having more time on the ground and working with aircrafts (which I’m more interested in).

Because of that, I am hesitant if I should take the SGIS scholarship and stick with my current NUS Scholarship as 4 years is a long time to spend in a firm if I end up not liking my role.

Having said that, giving up this opportunity for a secured job and higher scholarship value sounds a little irrational too given that SIA EC would have been a firm I would consider in the future.

Would greatly appreciate if someone who is from SIAEC or someone who has been through a similar experience as me could share some insights😅. Thank you!"
nwkyht,4,2021-06-10,"Advice for a Pakistani applying to T30s - good grades, bad ECs",u_dont_know_who,IntltoUSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/nwkyht/advice_for_a_pakistani_applying_to_t30s_good/,"Hey guys,

I recently saw a post here about someone applying from Pakistan who was in a very similar situation to me, so I decided to post my situation and ask for some advice too. I'm an intended CS major applying in January. I have very good grades (10A*s in O level, 1550 SAT, definitely within the top &lt;5% of my school) but my ECs are below average (mainly because I have really bad social anxiety). Here are my ECs:

- Some (very basic) community service

- Programming: I'm currently writing a Gameboy emulator, which is a fairly advanced programming project and one that I'm quite proud of, although I'm not sure how useful or ""impactful"" it is. Other than that... well I've mostly written things like web scrapers and automation scripts for my own use, so not sure how useful those will be.

- Public speaking: I've done many public speaking related activities, including elocutions, parliamentary debates and MUNs. HOWEVER, I've won very few awards, mainly thanks to my social anxiety. I've won an HM at one national MUN and a few city-level awards in 9th grade, but that's it.

- Science olympiads: I've only won one minor local competition, and that too in biology. However, and I'm a little unsure about this, our school holds a national competition every year, and this year I won the comp sci module nationwide as well as the math module within the school. Does this count the same as any other national competition?

...and yeah, that's pretty much it.

Some things I'm planning to do:

- I will most likely lead the CS club in school in the coming term, and plan to hold coding bootcamps, training etc. (Coding is quite overlooked in our school)

- I'm probably going to do a coding internship in the coming month or two

- Some more olympiads

- Trying out for the Pakistan maths team (though it's a long shot)

And finally, what I wanted to ask:

- What other ECs can I pursue before January, apart from the ones I'm aiming to do? Specifically, which ones will be useful for CS? What kinds of programming projects are the most useful?

- How useful is the competition hosted by our school which I won nationally? Do I lose credibility since I was part of the host school? Worse yet, will it look bad that I wasn't organizing it? (I will next year, but sadly it happens in February :( )

- How impactful is my public speaking considering I haven't won awards? Can I somehow convey to colleges how my anxiety has made public speaking a unique and difficult challenge for me, or will that make me a liability for them?

- Will doing lots of ECs in such a short time frame leave a bad impression on AOs?

- How much does being a Pakistani help me, if at all? On the other post I saw someone comment that colleges' expectations for ECs vary by country, and being from Pakistan helps. My own anecdotal evidence, seeing people who get accepted here, seems to support that too.

- I know this subreddit is US-focused, but do you have any idea whether I'm likely to get accepted at Cambridge, Imperial or other top UK unis?

Thank you for reading this long post!"

I moved away for this internship and it made me realize that I really don't want to be that far away from my family. Unfortunately the state I live in (MT) has like next to no CS jobs that are actual CS jobs. There's some tech/IT stuff but very little CS.

I randomly start sobbing, I cant finish sentences, I have constant headaches, high blood sugar, high blood pressure, sleep problems and what not. I am a shell of what I used to be. I miss that guy, I want to be like him again.

I am not sure if this is the right place to post this, I am truly lost and out of answers, out of questions, maybe also out of hope"

I graduated in 2020 with a journalism degree and got an internship at a news site doing their web development. It's a pretty well established news site. I rebuilt their whole front end and they hired me to be their front end developer. I use vanilla JS, React, and PHP in my work. I have two personal projects as well, one is a web app in React and one is a portfolio + blog with vanilla JS (and EJS).

Anyways. I'm finding it a bit hard to get a new job so far. I've applied to 41 jobs, with one interview request, 7 rejections, and 2 coding tests (one that led to a rejection).

I'm considering going to a bootcamp just to add it to my resume. I am already pretty good at front end development as I have a job doing it. But my lack of CS degree might be throwing employers off.

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks."

Holy moly. I am over the moon. Last week I received an admission to my top choice program (Master of Finance at Frankfurt School of Finance and Management). I have read my admission letter more times than I can count, and it still feels unreal.

I will detail everything you need to know below. This story is for those who think they might have the **wrong degree to be admitted, too little work experience, or too low of a GPA**. I will try to keep this post as short and helpful as possible. (Writing this, I realized the post is REALLY long. Feel free to just navigate using the titles to the sections that are interesting to you.)

Edit 2: Wanted to throw in that a lot of people look down on UBCO as being ""worse"" secondary campus of UBC. Obviously this is fake news (source: me). UBCO is a great school with some fantastic profs. If anyone else is having doubts about their undergraduate school, don't. What matters is the work/effort you put in.

   * HEC Paris
* Target
   * Frankfurt School
   * ESSEC
* Safety
   * Católica Lisbon
   * IE Business School
   * ESADE

# Why did I only apply to Europe?

I did not apply to Canada because I had already studied there, it is very far away from home (Germany), and it is not really known for finance.

I did not apply to the U.S. due to safety concerns (racism, police brutality, etc.). I know that it is a generalization and people may disagree with me, but this was a personal choice. You are free to make your own.

I did not apply to Asia (e.g. Singapore) mainly because I grew up in Asia and had already spent a semester there on exchange, and the distance from home.

In my essays I also made it clear I wanted to study in Europe. I had already formally studied in Asia and North America, and now wanted to formally study in Europe, which would round-out my international experience.

# Things that helped me be a strong applicant:

**International Experience:**

My diversity definitely made me attractive (even though I know there are a lot of Indians doing finance. Why? Because I have lived in five places on four continents. I noticed that international experience and exposure is highly valued, so my background definitely helped me in this aspect.

**GMAT:**

My GMAT score was very good (98th percentile) with a strong quant score. I was really proud of this and did spend months studying full-time to achieve this. I'm glad I was able to score this highly because it helped offset any concerns over my GPA (which was good, but not excellent). If you want more information on this, I have a GMAT debrief post that you can find in my user history.

**Letters of Recommendation:**

Of course I haven't read my letters of recommendation. But they were by likely very strong due to my connection with the profs. The first was from a prof who I had been a TA for and also taken two classes from (scoring very well in those classes). The second was from a prof who taught my favorite class (in which I scored the highest grade of the class).

**Essays:**

I spent an insane amount of time on my essays (at least for HEC Paris and Frankfurt School). I spent a lot of time breaking down their websites and brochures and seeing what they looked for in students. I then took that to my essays in order to convey that I would be a good fit for the school. (For FS that was easy, as it is my dream school, for HEC I had to morph my profile a bit.)

My best advice to writing essays is this. Convey directly why you are motivated to study in the field that you are applying, and convey indirectly why you are a good fit for the program.

Schools care about two things. (1) Will you make it through the degree. (2) Will you find employment after the degree. Make sure you indirectly convey to the school that you fulfill these two categories and you will be accepted.

What I mean by indirectly is - do not say ""I am so good at leadership"" (literally only someone who is bad at leadership would say this; instead tell a story about how you had impact on an extracurricular organization through a leadership role. Your skills should be inferable from your essays.

I know advertising is not allowed. But I want to shoutout the YouTube channel ""Medical School Headquarters"". They have a series called *Application Renovation* and it makes it clear how detrimental direct/indirect selling can be on essays, even if you have a 4.0 GPA and high standardized test scores. (I know its a med school channel, but it really helped me write my essays; I highly recommend checking them out).

Lastly, I also attended Master Evenings and the likes and connected with a couple of students/alumni on Linked-In from Frankfurt School and HEC to get advice on my application and to view their applications. This was helpful to understand what type of person the schools were looking for and helped me make a few tweaks to my essays.

**Awards:**

I'm sure they were viewed positively by adcoms. But honestly, they are not really special.

**Polish:**

I think this is an underrated aspect.

Before some of my interviews, I was put in a room with other students. I was shocked at how many people seemed to have put very minimal effort in. People not wearing appropriate clothing, facing the camera in the direction of the sun, etc. I understand that not everyone has the means to have a good webcam and nice clothes. But at least go sit on the other side of the table so you are lit well, and prop up your laptop on a couple of books so it doesn't look like you are looking down on the interviewer.

Also be courteous to you interviewers, smile, sit straight, etc. (Should go without saying).

# Things I thought were weaknesses, but probably didn't matter:

**Work Experience:**

I thought it would be detrimental to not have relevant work experience. But, it probably didn't matter. Getting internships has been brutal during COVID-19 and universities know and acknowledge this.

**GPA:**

Applying with a decent, but no excellent GPA, to top schools seemed very daunting. However, I realized my GMAT probably helped ease any concerns about my ability to complete the program (plus my letters of recommendation).

# What went wrong:

I think I could have gotten accepted to HEC Paris as well. But I did have a pretty bad interview. I accidentally made the assumption that all HEC schools belong to one big organization. A very simple but stupid mistake that waves a huge red flag that shows I didn't do enough research into the school. That being said, I didn't really want to study at HEC Paris (due to negative interactions with their students on my exchange), and was really only applying for the prestige. Guess it all worked out in the end.

# Final Words:

I am so happy and proud of myself that I made it into my dream school (Frankfurt School) with a scholarship. I am so excited to start the next year. I am already frantically looking for apartments and submitting documents.

This sub has been a huge motivation booster along the way and I am grateful to have been a part of this community.

I hope this post can help others (even if its just one person) in the same way that other peoples' posts helped me.

In summer of 2017 I worked at a small bank as a Software QA intern.

I've always been interested in rockets, space, and the like.

When applying for college, I figured that mechanical/aerospace engineering would be the paths for me.

And so I went for mechanical engineering. I knew that computer science is the boom right now, but I figured that it was something I could learn on my own; I can easily pull up videos and practice developing software/coding myself. Not perfect, but better than the amount of mechanical engineering I could learn.

The second decision I made was to attend ASU over GeorgiaTech. 

My decision was financially driven, honestly. I got decent scholarships at both universities, but being an in state I would be able to attend ASU (and commute) for free. GeorgiaTech, would cost around $30000 for tuition and dorms every year... And that would put me in quite a bit of debt.

My university decision, I'm not too worried about know that I think about it. I feel like my internship and research experience will make up for that and getting a degree without debt is amazing (unless someone can explain to me the incredible benefits of a top tier school)

What about my first decision though?

I go back and forth sometimes: Do what you think you'll enjoy (Mechanical Engineering), but then I think about it, and I feel like Computer science would be fun too. Probably not as fulfilling for me, but definitely nice money wise.

I have had a learning disability all of my life and it has affected my grades quite a bit. I never sought help until the beginning of my Junior year but by that time the damage was done and my GPA is not as good as it should be. Once I began a prescribed medication and utilized resources though my school, my GPA improved by a lot but not enough to change my overall GPA drastically. I’ve noticed that my low GPA has been a reason cited by recruiters for being passed for their internship programs. Although I finally found an internship this has been very frustrating. 

My question is, should I start disclosing to recruiters that I have a learning disability? Will this hurt my chances or will this maybe help my chances?"
nwsucb,0,2021-06-10,"I think my perception about CS is wrong, and I probably need some help.",Skullruss,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nwsucb/i_think_my_perception_about_cs_is_wrong_and_i/,"My perception has pretty much been that:

A. School will teach me everything somehow- I've unlearned this perception, a few months back.

B. Once I get my internship It'll fill in those gaps where school only taught me foundational basics.

For further context, I'm about 66% done with all of my credits at a good university, and I've been working an internship for about a month now. I'm pretty close to (if not) fluent with C++ and (cursed I know, but still) HTML, CSS, and Javascript and at my internship I've just been putting the hours into making a perfect 'calculator' page for my company, which just uses my previous experience.

What I'm doing now just uses my current experience, and there's such an UNBELIEVABLE amount of content that boggles my peabrain, and it feels like I'm literally never going to learn such a wide range of knowledge. I've never done any coding that interacts with **anything whatsoever** over the internet, in any capacity, aside from importing scripts/stylesheets for a webpage. I don't have any clue how any of that works, my experience gives me the ability to make fancy menus with some decent logic/algorithms, but how in God's name does 'fancy menu' turn into 'Dark Souls' or 'Bluetooth Speaker' or 'GPS app'... I just don't get where the leap is. Is that just 100% ""Learn it yourself, monkey.""? It feels super frustrating to not have the proper expectation, mostly because it's simultaneously a letdown and pressure-building as my time to be seen as a 'student/intern' dwindles into an expectation as a 'legitimate' developer.

If there's a resource (or several) that anyone recommends, it would be greatly appreciated. (As a side note is leetcode a good way to gain those experiences to make that 'leap'?)"
nwt0ue,1,2021-06-10,What should I do in this situation? (Big text),Painful_Mind,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/nwt0ue/what_should_i_do_in_this_situation_big_text/,"I'm an intern at an hotel for almost two moths and things started to go ape shit.

Basically the way this internship works is by the school offering something to the hotel, wich in this case is me and my female college from school, to work there and in exchange the hotel teaches us how to work there and prepare us to be a productive member of society, so it's a win-win.

But thing aren't going like that, the hotel uses us, me and my colleague, to do the things that are needed to be done at the hotel, but in exchange they don't teach us equally or even treat us (at least me) as an intern but rather as a worker.

I'm a shy person and not very social, my profile is not of a person to be in the reception, as I tend to be embarressed, so accepting guests and clients isn't where I'm the best at, but I think that everything can be teached or changed with experience, I changed A LOT after all the experiences of being there, I can speak clearly and not be embarressed at all now, all those things about thinking that other people think about me in a bad way or judge me is over my shoulders now, I don't care the slightest  about that anymore, I feel good and useful, but the ones always judge me and put me down are the ones that are supposed to not do it, but rather teach me how to be better and tell me where I failed (so I can learn from my mistakes).

I don't want to come all bitchy and all millennial ""oh my feelings"" not at all, maybe I'm coming like that because I'm not understanding that maybe it's supposed to be this way but I'll explain everything and then I want you to tell me if it's really supposed to be like this and if not, what I should do.

So, altho I'm proud of my development in communicating with others and feeling good in public, at the beggining it wasnt like that, I most of the time wanted to do stuff, I was always asking what I should do in certain situations and always trying to show initiave and effort.

My internship started in the reception, the people that are in the reception are, a Girl, the general manager wich is going to evalueate me, another girl, the head of the reception, and two boys, a recepcionist and the sales manager, who also take part on this evaluation because they transmit everything to the first girl, they all work in the reception even tho they shouldn't, because of short staff, and they all have different schedules, therefore she can't always be with me and needs them to say what I did and did not do.

The first month even tho I showed initiave I lacked confidence, wich in a way was perceived by lack of effort, I couldn't just go and talk to a client when I don't even know what I'm supposed to say right?

They knew that and they told me the first week to do nothing and to observe how it is done, but watching someone do something is very different from actually doing it and that would be fine if the informations where transmited to me too and not transmitted in the way of me hearing what they say to the clients and to remember it.

Informations like, ""Due to the pandemic, we cannot open our indoor swimming pool because we do not have natural ventilation"", so, if a client asks me about the pool, I have no other option besides either, remember what they said to a previous client or ask them about it and then proceed to tell the client.

That situation in particular did not happen, but stuff like this always happened with other type of informations, so when that situation camed I would get anxious and nervous and people could tell I was nervous from my voice and the way I project myself towards the client, not intentionally of course.

This wouldn't happen if the information was disclosed to us previously instead of being on the exact moment we needed it. My colleague also expericend this but not to the same extent because she is more of an extrovert type of a person, so she wouldn't get that much nervous.

The first week passed by and I changed sector, we interns go thru a different sector from week to week, so I started in the reception and the next week I would go to the cleaning sector.

I don't want to brag, but form all the interns I am the best one at the cleaning sector, words that came from the head chef of cleaning (not an American native speaker, I dont know what it's called), he always calls me his right arm and he will also take place in the evaluation, but one thing is for sure, the general manager, the person that is going to atribute my grade (basically everyone says if I'm doing good or not and from there she atributes the grade she wants) she is only in the reception, so even tho she has everyone from the other sectors telling her I'm really good, she will most likely follow her gut feeling from what she sees in the reception.

So after people realizing I was really good in the other sectors they started to change my schedule, I would now go more days to the cleaning sector than any other intern, what this causes is something I call unfair, because in the reception everything is chilled out, due to the pandemic there are fewer clients calling, making reservations, coming thru the doors...and the cleaning sector as well as the breakfast and kitchen are the most complicated ones, because people now want room service wich has to be provided by us and even tho we are/were in a pandemic, food was always being prepared for the clients, not only that but cleaning turned into something totally different form what it was (from what people told me), now everything has to be well cleaned and there must not be any error.

So everyday, at the time I was supposed to get out, I would go home really tired and the one person that is going to atribute my grade does not know (she probably knows) or care about me giving my all and doing the best in that sector and also the fact that the others were not having much work as me puts me down, instead of she wanting what's the best for both sides (student and hotel) she decided that the hotel came first, so she was the one who would make the schedule, basically I learned more from the cleaning sector than from the reception and so my skills morphed into a shy person, a hard working one, but a non talkative person.
 
My confidence started to go down, at least when she was around, any mistake I would do she would come to me and ask me about it agressively and in a way of making me feel stupid, it could even be the slightest thing ever, she would then look at me with a face like ""you are trash"" and then when I proceeded to explain she would turn her back on me, basically stating ""I don't give a fuck about you"".

By the time I was going again to the reception my skills that I had previously learned were now dissipated into this shallow, shy and scared person.
More mistakes would take place, they would look down on me, they would say stuff like ""do you really need another explanation?"", yes I needed another explanation, because now I couldn't think normally, everytime I was in the reception my mind was thinking not about what I had to do, but rather, how I was perceived by others and paying attention to every detail not to be criticized again, my mind was trying so hard that it failed over and over.

They took note of that and didn't like how I was still in the leaning process, while the other girls (a girl form my class and 4 other from different schools) were already advanced, they weren't checking in clients yet, but they were already doing other stuff without needing them to tell them what to do.

Then, the general manager of the hotels of the north of that group of hotels, basically the head chef of the general manager camed into the hotel and started to work in the reception, because of the short staff and needing to have people go into vacation, he is a really nice guy, but what they told me was that I couldn't share the same schedule as him because he would not help me in any way and would leave me alone in the reception while he would be in the back office, they knew I wasn't ready to be alone in the reception so everytime my schedule matched his they would transfer me to other sectors, the cleaning was one of them.

The reality tho, is that he is a really nice guy and helps the interns, other interns were all the time in the same schedule as him and because of that one of them is being hired as an assistant, but I never got a chance to be with him and show my worth, instead they would say that I was not good enough and that I have to change, but never tell me where I was wrong and how could I improve, they just don't give a fuck, they expect me to realize where I'm wrong and I do realize but never tell me how I could improve (or maybe thats how life really is, you never get it till you do, or till you get fucked) and what's worst is that this experience just made me realize how fake this industry, or rather, life? People? It made me realize how fake this world is, how you can just get fucked and never get to fight back, born a piece always a piece of shit.

So, this is where I'm at now, in three weeks my internship is over and in a three month internship I was not even three weeks on the reception, wich was  the reason I chose this area to study and this place to be an intern at.

What also gets me is the fact that the general manager hates me and the grade she will atribute to me is most likely according to what she and the others in the reception see, so I do know that it's going to be a shitty grade, I need a good grade to go to college or to have more chances of getting a job in the place I want, but clearly I wasn't born for this.

Now, am I in the wrong here?

Is there something that could be done?

Talking to them about this is a big no-no because they don't give the slightest fuck.

Anyways, if you read this far take this 👑 and have a great day. (I'm also going to copy paste this into other subs because I wanted a response by anyone, but noone will read this)"

nwu2dk,2,2021-06-10,Should I leave my current job?,Electronic_Plant9697,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nwu2dk/should_i_leave_my_current_job/,"I have to apologize first because I feel like I'm about to go on a rant.

So I just started working for a bank as an Intern Java Developer (working with the mobile app backend team)
Completed my Honours in CS last year. 

Anyways, I'm not the happiest with the job so far. The progress has been EXTREMELY slow. And the onboarding has been rubbish - it's as if they didn't know what to do with me - no tasks assigned - no intro to anything - just awkward vibes. 
6 months in and I'm considering leaving this company. 


Reason 1: They don't care about their developers. Let me explain

I spent Feb and March ""setting up"" the working environment. The process is very tedious and inefficient. 20+ years this company hiring devs but no one thought to take care of this process? Alright. 
On top of that mess, they were all over the place when it came to giving me a laptop.  I'm on my 3rd laptop as we speak (it's 6 years old, battery life last 20 minutes tops, and it's an i5 with 8GB RAM - crashes at least once a week) and the last two had their own problems...
Laptop 1 had some ink on the screen 
Laptop 2 was 10 years old and only worked when the charger was plugged in
-_-

Since I joined in January, I'm only getting my first coding project, now - first week of June 
6 months in and I feel like I haven't learned anything. I feel like the onboarding is rubbish and the company doesn't care. The company doesn't care about their developers. The fact that they don't invest in getting their us proper resources to get the work done really pisses me off. 
And what upsets me the most is how when I did my interview I explicitly asked if there's any learning platforms they have licenses for so their graduates have the freedom to learn whatever course - they said they provide Udemy licenses... 
It's June but I have no Udemy license still because ""the company has no licenses... I should wait a bit"" 

You CANNOT convince me that such a big ass bank does not have Udemy licenses to give their interns? Or money to get their developers new and decent laptops? So they can work efficiently. Nothing? 
Hell I asked them to order me RAM a month ago but still nothing... I don't understand why everything has to be such a drag. 


*** I'm calm now 🧘‍♂️ Apologies ***


Reason 2: I want a clean slate for myself

Since I started the job I feel like I've been doing nothing but being a useless incompetent team member who doesn't help with much and knows nothing. 
I know I'm a new grad and I'm not expected to know as much as the rest of the team but I still feel I can do better. I missed a couple of compliance training, I'm the grad who took 2 months to set up, I feel like they already see me as someone who slacks and they have no respect for me. I don't like that. I feel like I wasn't given the chance (and the resources) to ""shine"" 
It really feels like I'm not gonna recover from that reputation. I don't know. I just wanna switch jobs and start afresh... Also maybe work for a startup - I don't like the big company structure very much



Anyways... I provided reasons why I want to leave BUT I'm an intern, I don't have much to compare this job to. Maybe all companies operate like this and it isn't the case that the employees get everything they want (or need) 
Maybe on boarding is slow and you don't start coding the first month. I really don't know. 
Am I overreacting or this company is just not it? 

Your advice would be really appreciated😊

PS: I have to mention there's too many people (even people who aren't working for this company) preaching that the company is one of the best companies to work for and there's a lot of growth, looks good on your CV and yada yada yada"
nwu3c7,2,2021-06-10,Looking for Outside Opinions for a Recent Cyber Grad,Fl0ppp,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/nwu3c7/looking_for_outside_opinions_for_a_recent_cyber/,"Hi everyone!

I just wanted some opinions from people in the IT field on my current situation. Last month I graduated with a B.S. in Business Information Technology, with a focus in Cybersecurity Analytics and Management. Before I graduated I also had an internship with a huge healthcare organization that lasted about 10ish months that started the summer before my senior year that I worked remotely on days I had extra hours to work.

The majority of my internship was spent in what I would call incident response, I spent a majority of the time (over 6 months) managing the org's end point user protection tool which included about 12,000 devices. Unfortunately the organization didn't have any openings in their security department when I was graduating. I struggled to find a job in the security field, which I think I can attest to not completing any certs yet but I am studying for Sec+ 601. I finally caved and started applying for other jobs, and got a job as a help desk technician for the company I did my internship with.

I have come to find that I really don't like it very much, and I mean this with no disrespect but it feels like the knowledge I have gained is just being wasted. The job I have now feels like working in a call center, which I guess should be expected based on the company size but I just really don't enjoy the work.

My question for anyone who was nice enough to read all this, should I just try and stick it out here for a while even though I hate it and try to work on certs when I can, or would it be possible that if I quit and focused on getting Sec+ and maybe Net+ as fast as possible I could get a job without this helpdesk experience? (I am working remotely from my parents' home at the moment so I don't necessarily have to worry about money right now)

nwuio2,4,2021-06-10,Feeling worthless and anxious without an internship,KeyBlue9,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/nwuio2/feeling_worthless_and_anxious_without_an/,"Hi. I’m a civil engineering undergrad who just finished junior year. Summer is here and despite everything I tried, I don’t have an internship. It’s made me very depressed and worried about applying for jobs next year, so I figured I could walk through my feelings here and ask for advice.

A bit of background: I tried all the recommended tips and tricks all through junior year. I cold-applied, asked through my network, and attended (virtual) career fairs all year long. I got several interviews too; some were meh, but many went quite well. And yet every time I got that stinging letter of rejection, it hurt more and more. I have a 3.9 GPA and plenty of extracurricular leadership experience (including project management), but still nothing worked out. 

This has made me feel like an utter failure, and I’m so anxious for the hunt for my first engineering job next year. After all, hiring managers probably aren’t gonna prioritize my resume (no matter how tailored and refined it is) without that sweet professional experience, right? COVID screwed me over last year and bad luck did this year, and there’s no way to communicate that without an interview. In fact, I’m not sure if I should just apply for an internship to start once I graduate. But it’s too late to change the past, so now I’m looking forward.

Fortunately, I have a good research assistant position that’ll continue through summer, and I have my old retail job to pay rent. I just don’t think these make up for an internship, so what can I do to (a) feel better about myself and (b) make me the best candidate for a job when I graduate? I was thinking of learning more CAD programs (Civil 3D, Revit) and improving my Python during my free time, and seeing if I could learn about more companies from my network. Do career fairs start in summer? I’m hoping to work in geotech consulting after getting a masters, so I’m looking for an entry-level field engineer job in a construction company (unless there’s a stronger option).

But I want to know what you all think and recommend, and if there’s anyone that’s been in a position like this too. Does it get better from here? All in all, thanks for reading and I’m looking forward to the responses."

I am entering my Senior year of college with an internship in my University's IT department.  I am looking for jobs post graduation, as the plan is to move away with my girl friend after we graduate in the Spring for her grad school.  In the process of looking two of the jobs I see for available entry level IT departments are System Tech and System Admin.  I know that Admins are usually in charge of a team of techs and deal with software more than hardware like the techs, but I do not know much else.

How long does somebody with a Bachelor's Degree usually work as a tech before making the jump to an Admin role?  Is it possible for me to land an Admin role after graduation if i continue my internship into the school year where it will transition into a part time job, which is certainly possible.

Hi!

I'm a 19 year old and I would say I am pretty responsible. I have never done anything to my parents that violated their trust in me or whatever. I'm a rising sophomore in college; while I do live with them and they pay for rent/food, I'm financially independent for everything else (due to financial reasons, me and my sibling will have to start helping with paying rent, which is completely fine). I get good grades, very active in school activities, internships and a great work history, and quiet for the most part.

I don't really go out much, but when I do, it's usually with my boyfriend. My parents don't know he's my boyfriend, although my mom can tell (you know how moms be). I never talk to my dad about my social life, so whenever I have plans, I tell my mom. My dad usually never asks what I am doing when I'm out btw. If he does, I don't really care, because he really never disciplines me or my brother (22). Plus, I'm not afraid of him.

My mom, on the other hand, is incredibly anxious whenever I do go out. Whenever I tell her I have plans, she gets so tense! She always demands that I don't go over my boyfriend's house (bc she's afraid of premartial sex and pregnancy, lol). I also cannot stay past 8 PM. She texts me usually at 7 ish where I am and that I have to be home by 8. I know this seems pretty tame, since I'm still going out with a boy alone with her knowledge. It's really not that often as I would like it to be (like once every two weeks) because I am afraid of her asking me about him and I, and acting really anxious and tense like I am doing something wrong. I am honestly so sick of this at this point. I hate being treated like a kid simply because I'm a girl. She used to make me text my brother a lot when he was out, back when he was in high school, but that stopped when he was a junior. He used to go out a lot and stay out late and she wouldn't care. But every time I have plans, she's not as lax at all. I thought this would change, since I've been hanging out with this boy since senior year of high school, but nope. If anything, it's gotten worse. It sucks seeing people my age stay out late and go on vacations with their friends and boyfriend. I have cousins my age, same gender, immigrating from their home countries to France or Canada alone!! And I can't even stay past 8!!

I can't dodge her texts, or else she'll spam my phone. Sometimes I'd wear thick jeans and not feel the notifications FOR A MINUTE and she'll already be demanding that I text back. It's fucking ridiculous. I'm really fed up at this point, and I know nothing will change unless I do something. My brother used to just blow off my texts back in high school, but I just can't do that without being extremely anxious. Plus my mom couldn't really do much to discipline my brother since like middle school, so it's not like he had to stay home or anything. I hate being treated like a kid and being distrusted for no reason. Unfortunately, I'm living at home during college too. I am trying to transfer out and dorm somewhere but I haven't heard back from the schools I've applied to yet, which fucking sucks. But I do not want to wait until September for school to start and try to change things then. How do I stop my mother from controlling me so much? How do I tackle my own anxieties and stand up to my mother, indirectly or directly? Also, the 4th of July is coming up, and my boyfriend wants me to sleep over his house (with a bunch of other friends), and it's giving me so much anxiety just thinking about telling my mom about this plan. I can't even tell her I want to be out later than 8, lol.

Also: I skate, and when I do, I usually come home at like 9:30. No texts from her. It's definitely me being out (and being out with a boy) that makes her so uptight.

Any advice is greatly appreciated!

edit: if it helps to know or sympathize, my bf is a white guy lol. i don't think this is a point of contention, since i have some relatives that married white people. converting is a big deal to her but let's not get into that, marriage is so far away and I'm dumb young"

I am now in my final semester. I want to get a GPA of 3.0. So that I can apply to good universities for a Masters degree in Canada.   


If that fails, I don't know what to do. I feel like everything needs a GPA of 3.0 nowadays and I feel really underqualified to face the real world and move on to the next chapters of my life. I have been getting rejected by universities and internships left and right. I am still not gonna give up, my current semester seems to be going well, I don't know if I will get 3.0 by the end of this semester though.   


Is there anything I can do to make myself look good? Are there any good / respectable universities in Canada that don't really care about your GPA and accept you for a masters degree? I know it is a weird thing to ask. But I really want to go to a good university. I did my best all these years but unfortunately the chances of reaching my goal seem to be very slim.

I'm primarily a front end developer who has been working mostly with react and have some Angular knowledge as well. I also have really decent knowledge of css/html

I will soon be moving to Germany to live with my girlfriend (who lives pretty centrally in the city of Erfurt in Thüringen) and was wondering some things

\- How is the demand for web developers in this area? Ideally I would like to not have to commute too far every day if I could avoid it. Also working partly remotely or even 100% in the future is a goal for me (I know it is harder to achieve this as a junior dev).

\- How hard is it for someone who has only done internships to get a position? I also have a bachelor in software technology and I'm currently studying a masters in computer science and engineering but I am seriosuly considering to drop out as I am feeling completely burned out and I don't feel like I am learning anything relevant with regards to working in web dev.

\- How hard is it to get a job if you are not completely fluent in german?

What type of jobs should I be looking at? I know a fair chunk of my experience is in support, and I’d like to not get a job in that, so I’m wondering if my experience is enough to get a position above it.

nwvrgb,1,2021-06-10,How do I disconnect from work and uni?,ducanukem,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/nwvrgb/how_do_i_disconnect_from_work_and_uni/,"Hello!

First post on this sub, sorry if I break any rules or it's not related enough.

I lately have noticed that I am too stressed/anxious about everything that I have to do profesionally. To sum it all up, here are my main stressors:

1) a 30-hour per week internship in audit: I find this job overwhelming and stressful, the workplace culture is trash with all of the seniors working over time every week, topped by the fact that I get many new tasks with barely any instruction but hugh pressure to do it right from the start, especially as one of the seniors  I mostly have to work with treats me like shit.

2) my university sttudies: I am currently halfway through an exam session, my grades are dipping since I barely attended classes due to the internship, I only have 3 exams left ans I think that in the worst case scenario I will pass all but 2 of the exams. I plan on getting a shorter and easier job the next year to stay on top of uni, but now I am so stressed that I do not know how to maintain untill I finish the exam session and the internship (late July).

3) I also have to help my father with some of his work when I get any ""free"" time (luckily hea leaves me alone lately knowing that I have exams).

I probably bit more than I can chew, I just need some advice on how to not break down these two months. 

The amount of stuff that I have to do and especially the fact that I am stressing all the time about it is consuming me. I have neglected my family, my friends, my faith, my pets, my own mental and physical health, my other projects and my appearance. I got fat (I was slightly overweight before the pandemic, it got worse then and recently it was the worst since I stuff my mouth with junk and sugar trying to get the sugar rush so I can grind a bit more and forgot about exercise. I became addicted to porn once again just to forget about my own life. I find it hard to fall asleep. Whatever energy I have left at the end of the day is used up for mindlessly watching YouTube or consuming other media, and sadly that's the part of the day when I feel most alive.

How can I keep myself from breaking down untill I finish this period?

How should I go about incorporating healthy habits once I am free of the exams and internship?

Thank you!

Edit: I also noticed that I have this voice inside my head which keeps telling me that I am not good enough as a human being unless I am 100% productive 24/7, a straight A student and made out of iron. It's been there for a long time. Has any of you experienced this? How could I free myself of this voice?"

I would consider myself a strong candidate (previous full-stack job experience, started TAing in second year, 3.9 gpa) and I want to get into a FANG company in the future (this is the main goal). I've been trying to track down a 4-month internship in the last few terms. But my motivation to submit applications was really low before, so I didn't put any effort into them and as a result I didn't really get interviews so far. (I would rather spend my time studying, solving Leetcode or developing projects)

I started putting effort in submitting applications recently, and I submitted an application with a bank. They scheduled two interviews with two separate teams for me. I just completed the first one. The interviewer said at the start ""Your resume is very impressive, I'm sure you have many offers, why do you want to work at a bank?"".

Truth is though I don't really have many offers at the moment. But I feel like the bank likes me and I can probably get this position. But do I want it? What do you guys think?

Growing up, I was considered a very bright kid. I was a good at my school coursework, used to get good grades and school and was a fairly decent sportsperson and represented my school and college basketball teams. People around me always used to say that I was destined to do something good and I always wanted to live upto that expectation. Everything started to go downhill once I got into 12th grade. Wasn't able to get good grades in either the exams or the college entrance exams and left my parents disappointed. They were still supportive of me and made sure I didn't lose hope. 

I was able to grind and was able to get into a good engineering school. In my first year, I found it hard to balance my coursework and extra curricular and ended up having 4 backlogs. I made my biggest mistake there of not informing my parents about the backlogs and decided that I'll eventually clear them. I was able to clear 3 of the 4 in eventual semesters, sometimes even giving 2 end sems in a day (trust me, it's hard) and left the last and the most difficult one for the last semester, as the coursework is very low for that particular semester. Everything was going well until the point I had to skip the exam to complete my dissertation and decided to give a makeup exam after a month, what could go wrong right? Well, everything went wrong, so wrong it had a Butterfly effect on my life. I got caught cheating, Yes! I am still ashamed of it after 3 years. My exam was cancelled and that meant I had to repeat the course once again the upcoming semester. I tried to get the penalty reduced by talking to higher authorities but to no avail. Again, I didn't tell my parents about it because I knew they'll be heartbroken and decided for the college to inform them themselves (another mistake) and when the letter reached them, the sheer shocked look on their face upon reading that their son, from whom they had such high expectations from was caught cheating. They were sad and angry. I was angry at myself, I spent nights crying. Along the way I pushed my girlfriend away, who was always supportive of me and always acted as my emotional pillar (another mistake).

My parents forgave me, and I decided to work hard to undo my wrongdoings and get into a good graduate school and one year later, I did. But then this pandemic happened and I had to drop the plan altogether because of the uncertainties sorrounding the situation. I was 23 by the time. 1 year wasted because I had to repeat the course and another 1 year wasted to prepare for graduate school. This made getting a job difficult and in the meanwhile, my family discovered that my grandma has cancer. So it became even more mentally and emotionally draining for everyone. Thankfully, my father being in a government job, covered her full treatment. After almost 10 months, she sadly passed away in February of this year. The last one year especially has been tough. I am turning 25 in 8 days and I am still unemployed with 0 days of work experience. My family is worried, they are pissed at me but they won't show it, I am pissed at myself, sometimes I spend nights wondering what am I actually doing with my life and where is it going. I've been able to get into an average B school recently. My father is going to retire in 2 years and I'll be 27 by the time I graduate, still a fresher, probably an internship under my belt. if the B school doesn't work for me, I'll be done. I am the only architect of my downfall. Over that I rarely talk to any friends, two of my only best friends in college left me because of some disagreements. I don't even know when was the last time I even talked to any of my friends, most of them have probably forgotten I exist anyway. 

Anyway, I'll end here. This post has gotten way too long. Kudos if you made it through :)"

Long post lol,Humble_knight2020,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/nwzrjc/graduating_this_fall_and_some_tips_i_think_will/,"As I’m graduating this fall and only have 2 classes left to take, I wanted to take some time to share some tips with incoming freshman’s or anyone in general. I’m a CS major with math minor and I was able to graduate 1 semester earlier.  From my perspective to succeeded in uni, you must 

1.) STUDY your ASS off. I mean this, although this is a given rule, many freshman’s have no clue what they are walking into, especially if you’re a STEM major. 

2.) MAKE FRIENDS. Yes, social life is very important. I’m not talking about just making friends who you hangout with or drink with, I’m talking about being active in class. Make professional friends, classmates who you can talk to about the class. It always helps to discuss with individuals and I know for some classes you can’t discuss with ppl because honor code violation but I’m talking about as you go to 300 level courses this is very helpful. Even for non CS 100 level class it’s helpful, unfortunately for intro STEM classes 😂 be careful. 

3.) BE ENGAGED IN CLASS, TALK to your professors, build relationships. Don’t be shy to add them on LinkedIn after semester ends, particularly profs who are teaching your core major classes. I got multiple recommendation letters which helped me land an amazing internship in machine learning field. Many professors are directly connected to the industry and know someone or work there, so its best to be in touch. 

4.) DON’T cheat, yes it’s better to get a C and learn the material than to get an A and not learn shit. I see some kids in my internship, great grades , no knowledge. Why because they cheated their way thru and took shortcuts.

5.) DON’T get disheartened if some classes in your major are difficult and think WORK will be like this. Honestly, my internship and courses were super different even from  my programming classes... I learned that we go to to college to learn HOW TO THINK , not HOW TO DO something. 

6.) LASTLY, HAVE FUN. Join clubs, organization, join frats or sorority. It’s not a crime to have fun. Covid definitely ruined somethings last year but it will get better. 

Side note for STEM majors: Join clubs or Orgo related to your field, there are shortage of tech talent and in those places, someone always knows where opening are so sometimes you will just luck out and get job offers or internships without going thru hassle. For other disciplines/ majors  I know UMD has you guys covered too. 

I loved my 3.5 years here made some amazing friends/ learned a lot academically and I couldn’t have ask for a better college experience. I was always a Maryland native but met some ppl out of state and will cherish that. As always go TERPS!!!!!"
nwzymm,11,2021-06-10,Imposter syndrome or incompetence?,TheJollyFancher,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nwzymm/imposter_syndrome_or_incompetence/,"Hello,

So I'm 3 weeks into my first internship as a rising Junior in CS. Most of my experience is in C, C++, python, and more low-level programming; I've primarily built console applications and assemblers/linkers/etc.

I had a hard time securing an internship for this summer, but managed to land a full stack role using React/Django. Most of the hires were experienced with the stack, so I'd assume I just got hired because of my school's name and my decent resume.

Here's where the issue is, I literally have no idea what I'm doing. We jumped right in to developing a web application for internal company use, and so far I've created three buttons and one page layout. Meanwhile, the other interns have created entire database schema, entire page functionality, and are nearly done with the application. 

Here's the weird thing though, we've talked about version control, time complexity, and general software development practices, and I seemed to be the only one who knew what was being talked about. I feel like I have a solid computer science foundation, but no experience with this stack, and the other interns are in the opposite boat.

Firstly, are there any tips for picking up a new stack quickly, or am I just screwed for this internship and have to try my best? Secondly, I haven't enjoyed this type of programming at all, and prefer actually using loops, conditionals, etc, instead of a bunch of libraries. Am I doomed, or what other sectors of CS would I be interested in?"

Tldr summary: I freelanced a bit as a social. Saved the money. Invested it in an app. The app brings me over 500$ monthly.

I am currently 16 years old my app is still up and running. After my revenue from my app started to stabilized a bit i started buying and selling anime figures online. I bought new and second hand figures from Japanese stores using proxy websites and took a commission of anywhere from 30-80$ per transaction. I think i sold a total of like 30 figures before PayPal asked me for id verification which i obviously failed. And my PayPal account got deactivated. 

I was a bit lost for a while. And i kept spending the money I was earning from app and figure sales in stupid ways for personal stuff, video games, manga, etc. This was really stupid of me. I never tried to really reinvest the money for some reason. When my PayPal got taken down and when i couldn't sell figures i realized the money i was earning was earning can dissapear at anytime. I had a sort of realization the and there. 

After that, I started to buy and sell Instagram accounts online for awhile but then I ran inti the problem of id verification. I edited my id and sent it it got approved but then after a month i got a notification saying my account got deactivated. An another failure.

After this i tried my hands in crypto and lost a 1000$ bc i was literally gambling by putting high leverages. I lost that 1000$ in 5 mins. I realized something then an there. I was playing with money. I didn't know how crypto worked. I was investing in something in which i had no knowledge about. I realized i had to invest in myself.

I spent the following months investing in myself. I learnt about digital marketing, and its basics on a course provided by google. I also learned about ad management, social media management, social media advertising, influencer marketing and some photoshop skills. I also learnt about how the global economy actually works and how buissness and start ups are actually work too. After this i went to get part time internships where i worked for free and got a lot of experience in these skills. I was once even lut incharge of a 5000$ ad campaign. 

After doing all this, I wanted to make an app and website. It's an app that let's buissnesses and individuals to schedule posts on instagram. I sourced the app development to one lf my friends in Sri Lanka who has been a programmer for 6 years and paid a fraction of the price for the same quality of work i would here here. Weate just waiting to get access yo fb's API now to launch the app. I don't have a real marketing budget so i am trying to find some investors everywhere.

I recently got an another job as a social media manager and social media marketer to support my next project. I am making an anime virtual assistant which will be powered by gpt neo or gt3. This App requires a lot of work from my part and the other job i got also eats up my time. I am still in college/higcinghschool (europe usa name is different i think ) I have to keep up my grades.

But recently i have been facing more and more problems. My parents oblige me to go to university because of our family condition(immigrants etc) My parents are Asian btw. They said even if my apps worked and i made more than enough money i still need to go to uni. This makes no sense to me. My dad doesn't support me ever since i started working a lot more than usual on my projects. He says i don't spend time woth my family . My grades are steadily dropping. I spend too much tim Infront of the computer etc. My father scolds me for these stuff..And now he gets angry over every little stuff. Especially when I asked about not going to uni if i made enough money, we had a heated argument. My  mom always confronts him and calms him down. But i am bot the only one getting scolded anymore my mom is too  My mom is the one who keeps my whole thing going. 

But today my mom came to me crying and saying i have to reduce my work time, the time j spend on my phone, etc. Saying uni and education is more important than money. And she can't take it anymore being in the middle of the dispute with my father. She literally said i feel like"" i am living in hell at times because of you two. I never had any problems with your dad before, we barely had arguements before. Now it happens on a daily basis""  This just broke me I don't know what to do anymore. I don't want there to be a family problem bc of me. But i don't want to stop working on my projects either . I just don't know anymore. I am emotionally lost."

nx1iii,3,2021-06-10,Masters in software engineering?,longfight123,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/nx1iii/masters_in_software_engineering/,"Hey everyone

I've been searching for entry level positions constantly for awhile with my chemical engineering degree (graduated June 2018 with a 3.63gpa), anything related to engineering, I've been applying to. Like for many others I haven't been able to get my foot in the door and I'm considering switching out completely now due to how saturated the market seems for entry level positions. I'm 27 now and I've been searching across the country as well and had my resume reviewed a few times.

In the past 3 years since I've graduated, the first two I worked where I did my internship but it was basically just a data entry position in the oil and gas industry 80% of the time, ie reading through field reports and extracting data. I was constantly applying while in this position. I eventually found a data analyst position late last year, which has been extremely challenging and stressful (no previous experience, lots of gaps in my knowledge so a lot of googling and asking questions) and developed skills in Sql and moving around data and I've been teaching myself Python during my free time. I'm currently doing some data modelling work as well so I've been learning that on the job. 

I am at a bit of a crossroads right now. I'm 3 years out of graduation with out any engineering experience and although I'm still applying I am worried that my degree is becoming irrelevant and it'll be impossible with no relevant experience. I would still like to atleast try working in anything engineering to know what it is like but no luck. I am considering going back to school for a masters in software engineering, there is a one year program that accepts engineers from other degrees where I am. I am considering this because I've always found programming interesting (swe would've been my second choice but I was young and stupid and chose what seemed to make money at the time) , enjoyed learning Python, and the one year timeline is huge, plus you get a masters degree. 

My question is if I am to still interested in engineering and getting any entry level job related to engineering, should I keep trying? Is it still possible? Or should I just go back to grad school and apply to the software engineering program to 'reset' my career? Maybe a after degree in computer science but I don't want to put myself through another 2-3 years of schooling."

As you can imagine, I learnt a lot during the first 3 or so months. After that I mainly gained experience in talking to clients. I still lacked the sheer knowledge that I would expect an accountant to have - knowledge that my manager had.

I know there is so much more to learn as I can't even understand the conversations my manager has with our clients. I think I have a relatively good grasp of what I am meant to do in my role but I have no idea how to jump from where I am to where he is in terms of knowledge.

nx2ib3,6,2021-06-10,New grad - should I quit to focus?,neverabstract,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nx2ib3/new_grad_should_i_quit_to_focus/,"Hi all. New grad here. I went back to school in my 30s and just finished a BS in CS at 40. Hooray! It's been a tough past few years and it took a little longer than I expected, primarily due to having a full-time career. Lower management but lots of responsibilities/demands, etc. Salaried and work overtime almost constantly. Work made finding time to study difficult but I buckled down, made it happen, and graduated with a 3.8. However, the demands of work made it impossible to even think about an internship. And I was too chicken to take a chance on myself and leave my career for a temporary internship. 

So here I am, just graduated a month ago, no professional CS experience, and I have not applied for a single job. As soon as school ended, work took over my life again. I have hated my current career for a while now. In addition to that draining me emotionally, I have very little time to buckle down and study for interviews. I know I have a small window of time after graduating to secure a job before my chances start to evaporate. Maybe they already have. What should I do??

I have a small nest egg that could carry me for 6-8 months if I quit my job and focused solely on studying for interviews. I know my stuff but need some time to study and refresh everything I learned. Maybe work on some coding passion projects... Is quitting my job to do this a smart move? At 40 years old with no internship under my belt, what are my real chances of landing a SW Eng/Dev job? I'm single and have no support system so quitting a good job is a huge risk. However, I feel it is necessary at this point. 

What I'm looking for is someone experienced to weigh in and lend me your thoughts on this. Should I quit? Or should I force myself to continue in my current job until I have something secure? What are my prospects really like?"

The head slithered and swayed as it made its way out of the bushes. I grabbed Sasha’s shoulder and shook. She turned around.

“What is it, Ben?”

I hissed at her in a whisper and pointed at the snake.

“Oh, shit,” Sasha gasped.

I slowly started to back away, but didn’t look away from the thick body of the snake slowly undulating from the vegetation. I heard the crunching of Sasha’s footsteps behind and to the side of me. We creeped away at a slow but steady pace. The snake matched the pace as it headed towards us. As we reached the edge of our dig site, the bushes began to shake and the snake hesitated. Then, as I watched, it lifted off of the ground. Not the snake lifting its head. The entire body lifted off of the ground. It began to head towards us again, seemingly floating in the air while still slithering and writhing.

I whimpered, and I could hear Sasha gasp.

A sleek tawny paw  stepped out of the bush. And then another. Just when I thought that maybe, just maybe, the lioness would eat the snake and be full enough that we could run away, I realized just how truly screwed we were. Because when the rest of the lioness came out of the bush, I noticed a nasty detail.

The snake’s body was coming out between the lioness’ shoulders. It was like the lioness’ head and neck had been replaced by the front half of a large, hooded viper.

It was real.

The serpopard.

If you haven’t heard of a serpopard before, then you should do a google image search. Seriously. You’ll see some weird animations, a card from *Magic: The Gathering*, and some artifacts. Better yet, go to Wikipedia. You’ll see some excellent depictions of serpopards in ancient Egyptian art. “Serpopard” is an awkward amalgam of the words “serpent” and “leopard.” There don’t seem to be any surviving texts that refer to this creature, so people slapped those words together. “Serpent” is obviously a fancy replacement for snake. “Leopard” is likely totally wrong-headed, as the depictions, with tufted tail and no splotches, seems much more reminiscent of a female lion, rather than a leopard. But I guess “serpopard” sounds better than “snon.” Or “likes.”

I got into Egyptian archaeology for a lot of reasons, which is my way of saying (or not saying) that I got into it to impress a boy. Turns out, I loved Egyptian archaeology more than that boy, so I traded him in for an internship with Dr. Shadid at a recently discovered minor pyramid deep in the desert west of Giza.

Sasha and I hit it off immediately. She came from a school in France that I’d never heard of, because I don’t know any schools in France. It was great getting to know each other, hitting the Egyptian bars on the weekends, and talking archaeology. She had a major thing for ancient depictions of animals. When she found out I had never heard of a serpopard, she pulled up a bunch of photos on her phone.

“This is a seal that’s currently at the Louvre. Do you see the lion body and long, serpentine neck? Serpopard.”

“Weird. Good weird. But where do you think the idea of this creature came from?”

“There’s not a whole lot of information on it. A lot of people think it’s a masculinity or male virility thing. Lions were associated with masculine strength in the ancient Middle East quite a bit, and it’s not like compare genitals to large snakes is a new thing, so…”

“Dang. So it’s a lion with a giant floppy penis for a head?”

“Dude. No. It’s a snake for a head. It’s a metaphor, not your erotic fanfic.”

It seems as though these people Sasha was referring to were wrong. Or, at least, were wrong for calling it just a symbol rather than a real animal that also could function as a symbol.

Because one of them was creeping out of the bushes and getting ready to attack.

It hunkered down, its legs getting ready to spring.

“Run,” yelled Sasha.

So I did. I turned and sprinted, Sasha directly ahead of me. She was heading back to our dig camp, a group of tents in a cluster 30 yards away. But what would a tent do to stop lion claws?

“Sasha, go into the pyramid,” I yelled.

“What?”

“Camp won’t protect us, but stone walls will. Just go!”

She changed direction. I looked over my shoulder and saw the serpopard skidding as it stopped to change direction, as well. It was faster than we were. We just had to get lucky.

Sasha made it to the side of the pyramid and pulled open the metal cover protecting the site. Luckily, we hadn’t locked up for the day, or we’d’ve been serpopard dinner. She jumped through and held the door. I hit the entryway at a dead sprint and didn’t stop as I entered the pyramid. I heard Sasha slam the door, and not a second later a loud thud that I assumed was a serpopard trying to body slam the door open.

“What the fuck?” Sasha gasped as another slam hit the metal door.

“Is that really a serpopard?” I asked.

“Dammit, Ben, what did it look like to you?”

“I know, but--”

I was cut off by the piercing shriek of claws dragging across metal. It was like nails on chalkboard, unnerving and unsettling, and the serpopard kept at it, slashing away over and over. I could feel my anxiety creeping up.

“There’s not a way to latch the door from the inside, is there?” I asked.

“Never been a need. Not usually a need to prevent someone from breaking out of an archeological site.”

“That’s what I figured.”

I looked around, hoping to find an answer. Mostly, I just found sand and stone. I pulled out my cell phone, turned on the flashlight, and looked at Sasha.

“Let’s head in.”

“Why?”

“Look, we can’t hold the door shut, so if that thing figures out how to get its claws into the handle and open it, we’re dead. Might as well try to get some distance between us. We just might find something that we can use to trap the serpopard or something.”

“Fine, I guess. I don’t know what else we could do.”

We started heading deeper into the pyramid, fast walking down the tunnel. I wanted to run, to escape the horrifying creature behind us, but with only a flashlight to pierce the pitch blackness, that seemed like a good way to crash into something or trip and get a facefull of pyramid. And the last thing we needed was an injury slowing us down or making us less effective.

The hallway entering the pyramid went deeper and deeper. The air was stale and noxious from being closed so long, and Sasha and I had to cover our mouths with our shirts to be able to breathe safely. After our shirts kept sliding off, I finally just took mine off and tied it around my face, overly large bandana-style. Sasha glanced at me.

“Now I don’t have to adjust it and my hands are free for the flashlight and whatever else I might need to do,” I said.

Sasha shrugged and did the same with her shirt.

Now unencumbered and breathing as well as one can in a pyramid that’d been sealed for millenia, we headed further in and eventually came to a small open room. While the wall directly across from the path we entered from was solid stone, there were doorways to the left and right. The blank wall had a massive stone relief. I waved Sasha over and we both shone our lights on it. It was so large we still didn’t have the whole thing illuminated.

On it we saw massive serpopards, etched out to be taller than we are. Their serpentine necks intertwined with each other. To the left, there was an image of a pair of serpopards tearing open the stomach of a man. To the right, the relief showed the same man entering into a stone hallway.

“The guy is facing the right, so these read right to left, yeah?” I asked. I focused on buildings, not writing.

“Yeah,” Sasha said. “It looks like this guy entered a stone hallway, encountered a whole mess of serpopards, and then got devoured by them.”

“Please tell me the stone tunnel he entered isn’t the same one we just came out of.”

“I think it’s more likely that it’s one of the hallways branching off of this room. The man is facing to the right, which tells us which direction this reads, but do you think it also tells us which tunnel to use? He could be looking at the tunnel that leads to his demise.”

“Or,” I added,” it could be that you follow the writing and it naturally flows to the left, with the flow leading you into the tunnel told about on the wall.”

“Damn.”

“Yeah.”

“I mean, we could always just chill here. This wouldn’t be set up to be a dangerous room, if there are options of paths.”

The smashing and screaming of stressed metal echoed down the hallway we had just come down.

“That was the door giving way. It’s not going to be safe to wait here for long.”

“Which path do you think we should try?”

I stared down one, then the other. I had no idea. I told Sasha as much.

“Ok, then let’s go to the right. It’s what my gut tells me.”

“Then let’s do it.”

The right tunnel was barren for the first 50 meters or so before opening up on a room filled with shining statues. They appeared to be gold, possibly just gold plated. The room must have had at least two dozen of the statues, some of men with pharaonic beards, others of animal headed gods and goddesses. There were two large chests placed in the middle of all of the statues. Each had a small carving of a serpopard and a knife-wielding man on the sides and top.

“Does that mean there’s a serpopard in there? Or the weapon to kill the serpopard?” I asked.

“Possibly both. That would be the nastiest type of trap, one where the solution is there but you can’t use it in time because the serpopard is ripping your guts out.”

“That’s really dark,” I mumbled.

“No shit.”

We explored the room, looking at the statues, but in the back of my mind there was always a ticking clock. How long until the serpopard chasing us caught up? The only branch in the tunnel was in the room with the stone relief, so it wasn’t like the serpopard was going to have a hard time finding us. We needed to act.

“These statues are getting us nowhere,” I said. “Let’s open the chests.”

Sasha huffed, but nodded. We walked over to them and quickly looked them over one more time. Nothing stood out. I grabbed the lid of the leftmost one and started to lift. It was heavy and I could only raise it a fraction of an inch on my own. It would catch on a lip when I tried to slide it.

“I need a hand, Sasha. There’s a lip and I can’t lift the lid over it.”

She came over next to me.

“On three?” she asked.

I nodded. She counted down, and then we lifted with all of our might. It felt like the lid weighed a ton. We only got it raised about an inch and a half, but it was enough to slide it over the lip. With a powerful shove we pushed it back.

“Not too far,” Sasha said. “If it falls--”

It overbalanced and fell. When it hit the floor, the metal banged and reverberated, filling the chamber.

“If it falls, the serpopard chasing us will know exactly where we are,” Sasha finished.

We looked in the chest. It was empty. Sort of.

There was nothing in the chest, but instead of a bottom, there was a shaft that descended further down. A humid smell came from the shaft and the soft echo of lapping water came up from below.

“Should we risk it?” I asked.

The worst sound I’ve ever heard answered.

I imagine you’ve heard the screaming sound of big cats. It’s like this big hiss/snarl/yowl/scream all rolled into one. Now take that and filter it through a deep hiss.

The serpopard had found us.

“No time,” Sasha yelled. She shoved me hard, sending me over the lip of the chest and tumbling down. It wasn’t as deep as it looked, and maybe ten feet down I hit cold water. It was slightly slimy and dark, with a gentle current pulling me forward.

I looked up at the lit square that was the base of the chest. I saw Sasha leap forward to dive in before abruptly stopping.

She screamed.

“Oh, fuck,” she yelled.

I screamed her name.

“It burns,” she yelled. “Ben, just go, it’s--” She cut off into another scream. It was piercing and full of pain, and ended abruptly when she coughed blood out of her mouth. She looked down at me, tears in her eyes, before being abruptly yanked back into the room.

The current moved faster the further I got from the shaft. I’d dropped my phone in the fall, but there was a gentle light coming from somewhere ahead. As I moved closer, I saw there was a gap in the ceiling and a small set of stairs on the side of the channel carrying the water. I swam as hard as I could in the current, moving to the base of the stairs. Climbing out of the water, I dragged myself up the stairs and into the light.

The gap was small, just enough to pull myself out of. It opened under a thick clump of vegetation, hidden from sight. I looked around and saw I was on the far side of the pyramid. I’d made it all the way through the tomb.

Staggering as fast as I could, I made it around the pyramid and to camp. I found Dr. Shadid and tried to tell him everything, but I kept sobbing. I climbed into a truck and wouldn’t come out. I didn’t want the serpopard to get me.

I got the next flight out of Egypt. I may have escaped a real-life serpopard, but I’m afraid they’ll never stop hunting me in my nightmares.

nx5lwt,30,2021-06-10,[Scholarship] How to pass (scholarship) interviews?,ilovethrowawaymeh,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/nx5lwt/scholarship_how_to_pass_scholarship_interviews/,"The title says it all. After my A Levels, I went for several interviews with organizations such as NUS USP and MOE Teaching Scholarship and was unsuccessful in applying for them. I just got a call yesterday from MFA that they were going to re-consider my application and possibly offer me an interview if available. I'm also going for the Wee Cho Yaw Leaders Scholarship very soon (thank god for that after NUS Merit Scholarship rejected me) I really don't want to screw up this chance if I am given it. I'm aware that after you have been offered an interview your credentials don't really matter so the reason I wasn't successful in my application is because of my interview performance :^)

I've always never been really good at interviews. In JC1, I went for the HSP interview I prepared a lot for, only to slip up and involve my personal religion in my response. After I looked at my interview questions and answers, that was probably the only slip-up (but a fatal one) which cost me 2.4k in cash and a free trip overseas T.T Miraculously, I managed to pass the MOE Teaching Internship interview, likely because I had some insightful responses and there were a few people in my group interview who were actually trolling haha.

 I'm not really good at talking to others in interviews, so I really need interview tips from the seasoned pros so that I (and maybe some unfortunate soul out there) don't have to worry so much about interviews in the future. Thankfully, I have a family friend who is amazing at interviews, but I honestly don't have the way with words that he does and I'm a bit paiseh to ask him ahhaha. So here I am asking reddit.

Background/self diagnosis of my own interview abilities:

- Generally I can offer insightful/original responses, but might not be able to develop them further. I feel like I have Impostor Syndrome and the interviewers would slowly uncover my ignorance in the subject matter because I tend to read moderately without going in depth which displays my lack of nuance regarding issues (Example: USP interview was about current affairs and world history since I indicated my interest in MFA. Turns out my interviewer was an English professor with vast knowledge in foreign/current affairs and I was trying not to BS whatever I knew about world events since I haven't been reading the newspapers a lot haha)

- I'm also afraid that I speak too little in the interview as I tend to be quite concise about my main points (think about 6-10 sentences not including examples I bring in). I don't want to end up ranting but I'm not sure what is a decent length of response.

- I tend to be a very honest and direct person in my interviews, which interviewers may not necessarily like. I stick strongly to my moral values and value honesty a lot, which is why many of my examples are based on what I really feel. In my MOE interview, I stated that if I set a bad example for my students, the only option would be to apologize to them. In that sense, my answers could be interpreted as overly simplistic or naive? I don't really want to be fake too but would it be a necessary evil in the context of an interview?

- Which brings me to my next point I might appear a little over-confident in interviews? IDK

- I'm naturally a little bit on the clumsy side so I'm afraid that already leaves a bad impression on the interviewers but I don't think that problem can be solved by a single reddit post

- I'm also kind of socially awkward IRL lmao but I tend to write good personal statements which I believe gets me the interview in the first place (except PSC. bruh. even a PSC scholar approved of my essay but I didn't even get an interview. instead got ""redirected to ministry scholarships"". guess my portfolio is dog). I tend to stumble on words and sometimes my speech isn't very coherent haha

I'm not afraid of lacking the credentials (they have secured me offers for interviews). I've tried researching interview tips/good responses online before my interview and I always do my DD before any interview starts by listing common FAQs (which usually don't come out LMAO) I believe if I really want to grab the opportunities lying ahead of me I really need to brush up on my interview skills. I don't want to look back at myself and regret not getting a scholarship or something I wanted because of my interview skills (social awkwardness). Interviews are honestly the time to shine but if I don't take the opportunity nothing can help me :^)


Interview veterans of reddit, please send your blessings upon this unfortunate awkward soul."

I finished my master’s degree(PhD did not work out, but I left in good standing).  I have been applying to jobs for about a month, and I have started to see some movement.  One of them was a “more documents” request from a major insurance company, the other one was a call from a recruiter for a mid-sized software company.

(Additional context.  I have pretty good education, MA and BA from top-30 universities, but I have little/no job experience(I included my TA work and an internship during college))

In both cases they ask what salary I was expecting.  For the insurance company, the ad said (mid-60k to mid-70k) so I said 64k(I originally said 60k, but I showed it to my mother and she said to bump it up).  For the software company it is in a much cheaper place to live(Durham NC vs Washington DC). I ended up saying 45k, which was my instinct but obviously too low; it ends up the position is more in the 55k range.  I was not prepared to answer the question since this was my first “interview”.

As I continue with my job search this question will obviously come up again.  What is the correct answer?  Does it depend on the job?  Should I just have a personal minimum (maybe 55k in my case)?

How do you answer the question to maximize chances of getting the job? (Getting the job is more important than the perfect salary at this point)."

I'd been applying for both internships and full time positions starting last October, as I wasn't sure whether I would pursue a masters and thought ""well at least I'll have more options"", not really expecting much out of it. Once I got the internship in mid-April, I stopped applying, but had a final round interview for another big gov company (whose application timeline is very long- I initially applied in November). I thought that interview went quite well, but didn't hear back in the given time or even later, so figured I was ghosted and didn't sweat it too much.

However, cut to two months later, and I got an offer for the position, with a pretty nice salary! 'm pleasantly surprised and excited- but the thing is, I will also be starting my masters in CS in the fall. The recruiter said the start date could be as late as November and is flexible, and that they encourage their employees (especially in their TDP program, as I will be), to pursue  masters degrees, and that as long as I can manage both, I'd be fine. 

Anyone who's done a masters and worked a SWE role simultaneously, what was your experience? Should I turn down the offer, finish masters and then re-apply, or attempt to juggle both, probably with a lighter classload? Is it tough? Is it worth it? And does it leave room for other activities that are important to me and need to keep practicing, or will I be too busy to do anything else? I have two weeks to decide- any advice would be helpful!"

Advice appreciated

&amp;#x200B;

Hello all,

I would consider this more of a (south) asian family story than parents story. I feel a bit guilty posting this because I am close to my parents. However, as I've been getting older, I feel anxious, depressed and frustrated with my inability to solve matters properly. I will say this is not *entirely* my family's fault, but I feel they also don't realize how their own anxiety and behaviors have made me terrified of the world whereas other people can approach situations with a level of calmness and clarity.

Some background: both sides of my family have extremely high levels of anxiety and depression, which as you can imagine is hardly addressed. My dad is the oldest of four other siblings and already at an early age my grandparents treated him as the ""third parent"". I feel like as a result, my dad became a people-pleaser and takes everybody's issues in his own hands. When my dad got older, my grandparents had in mind who they wanted my dad to marry, but my dad liked my mom and even though they eventually accepted it, I feel like there was a ton of tension which resulted in my dad having to ""pick either or"". My grandparents had high expectations my dad continue to resolve his sisters problems while he was married: when his sisters were having marital issues, they asked my dad to drive 3-4 hours in the middle of the night to her house and mediate the fighting because they were living out of country. As a result, I grew up watching my parents having horrible outbursts at home (yelling, screaming, the occasional threats of harming themselves). I was already diagnosed with an autoimmune illness at 3 years old and had horrible anxiety leading to issues with communication in school (not talking out loud, etc.) Eventually, I had to work with counselors to overcome these issues and I did. A few years later, my parents separated, which is an extremely stigmatized concept in South Asian culture, so my grandparents fully expected me (at age 10) to be the mediator. They'd often pressure me to cry and throw tantrums to my mom so she can feel guilty and come back to my dad. Even though I desired a normal, nuclear family, I knew my parents fighting was a terrible living situation and felt annoyed by them putting pressure on me. Everytime I'd visit my dad and have to leave, they'd be like ""oh look how sad he looks! are you really going to leave him like this?""

My mom had moved with her brother and my uncle had just then had to relocate several times for jobs. Every time we'd have to move, my grandparents would grow angry at my mom, call her a bitch and get mad at me for not doing anything. One time, I cried in front of them when I was 12 or 13 and nobody really even felt sorry, my aunt stared at me blankly and told my grandma she was right. They'd pressure me to transfer schools when I was already on my third high school. They wanted me to come to a college close to my dad so that my mom comes ""running back"" home since they thought she wouldn't be able to handle me being all by myself.

As a result, I put tons of self-inflicted pressure on myself to do well in school beyond what my parents expected of me. I thought about becoming a doctor so that I can be so busy I wouldn't have time for all this nonsense. However, I was not really ""naturally"" intelligent and often found myself struggling to keep up as I tried to take as many AP courses as possible. I didn't have time to do anything outside of school (sports, jobs, etc.), struggled with driving because I was so anxious (failed my test a few times unfortunately). I also developed hypothyroidism in my junior/senior years of high school, which is known to cause severe depression/bipolar like symptoms and it made my mood infinitely worse.

I didn't get into any of the colleges I wanted to and ultimately decided to go to college closer to where my dad was-not because I wanted to comply with my grandparents wishes but because I at least had childhood friends in the area and thought it may be nice for me to be around them since I was struggling to feel a sense of belonging in the town my mom was in.

The first thing I wanted to do was finally get my license and after more practice and a calm approach, I got my license at 18 without any mistakes. Though my dad encouraged me to learn, he would not let me drive for quite some time. When I'd go visit my mom, she'd let me drive by myself, but it took me few more months to convince my dad I can at least drive locally and to school (which was 40 minutes away). But as I was getting more confident and comfortable, I asked if I could try the freeways and he said absolutely not. Even though I practiced a few times on city freeways while I was learning to drive and took my family on a 3 hour trip through NYC freeways and mentioned I drove an entire 8 hours on west coast freeways with my mom, he said that was great but wouldn't let me drive alone as he felt I needed freeway driving to be a part of my ""everyday routine"" for him to feel I can handle it. People my ages, including my cousins, were confident enough they were driving literally everywhere, making friends and just kind of ""growing up"". I feel like me driving and being independent was at odds with my dad's sense that he needed to be involved in and take over everything. If I needed to go into the city, either I would take a bus or have to ask him to drive me over.

I was overall becoming pretty miserable and isolated in college. My childhood friends were fine to be around, but of course ever since I moved they learned to move on with life without me and I was having to forcefully squeeze myself in places people didn't always want me to be in. I was hardly making friends and the people who did become friends with me were fellow peers enrolled in the same competitive undergrad/grad combined program that would commence with a professional degree who only needed me for notes because they never attended classes. Majority of us were expected to be working while in school and even though I really tried to find an internship, I wasn't able to secure one. It also didn't help I was one of the few visible brown people in a mostly white area. As a result of that experience, I became insanely depressed and anxious one summer with debilitating intrusive thoughts and full blown driving phobia. I didn't have it in me to leave the house or go anywhere. And to be honest, I really had nowhere to go:  No friends, no internships or anything. Finally, during my last year of college, I did have to force myself to drive again as I had to complete full year of practical experience and became pretty confident again. However, when it came to driving to a new location, my dad wanted me to practice with him a few times. When I started one of my internships, he told me he'd accompany me until I feel comfortable with the route. I know this is partly my fault, but I just ended up giving up and have him drive me the whole month I had to work there because I struggled feeling I was capable of handling it.

Basically, after I graduated both of my parents had two philosophies: my mom thought it was impossible I could live far away from family until I get married and my dad felt he still needed to kind of make all my decisions on my behalf lol. I wasn't able to find a job for a very long time and had decided to do another masters in a program 8 hours from where my dad lives. When I told my dad I got in, instantly he drove out 8 hours to ""get an idea"" of the area and try to see if he could find apartments for me. I didn't ask this of course, but this kind of pattern continued-after I had graduated and found a job in a nearby city, I had told him and he drove out there (an hour or so away) and tried to find apartment buildings in ""safe"" areas for me to stay in. I already knew I could not afford living in a building and used facebook/craigslist to look for room shares, which I ultimately found, which he was skeptical about because he felt like landlords are unreliable with maintaining places, but I obviously had to make the decision that was best for me and I feel like *slowly* my family was allowing me to be capable to make my own decisions.

However, even a year after that, when I was moving to NYC at the age of 28, my dad insisted he moves me instead of me getting a moving service to save money. He had told me I should live with his sister until I find my own place, but told me his sister would have a tough time picking and dropping me off to the train station so he suggested he'll drive the car to my aunt's place and take a train back home so I can have a car to drive to and from the train station. I told him this was so unnecessary and I can just find my own sublet, which I did, a relatively cheap one until I find an apartment. When he drove me up there, his face fell instantly and when I was coming back in the car, he said he didn't feel this was a safe location at all because ""there were scary dogs around the apartment building"" At that moment, I completely lost it and had a meltdown and he was shocked by my reaction. I felt so irritated by the way my life was going, the number of college/academic failures I endured, the toxic jobs I was working in and the extreme overinvolvement in every decision I was making that made me develop extreme anxiety and self-doubt. I told him there's nothing I could do about leaving the apartment because I paid a deposit and can't rely living with other family members or his sisters.

Finally, of course, I think my dad is somewhat coming to terms with the fact I can make my own decisions though there are still times it's not easy. When the pandemic happened, he drove up to the city  to take me home because of how unsafe the situation was. I realized that was understandable as it was a new and uncertain situation and I was living with roommates, but throughout the pandemic too, his overprotective behavior felt very out of hand at times. In the beginning, he didn't allow me to touch any of my things, including sanitary pads until he washed it profusely. I felt embarrassed knowing people my age and in my professional field were mostly working on the frontlines whereas my dad wouldn't even let me touch my own pads. I had already planned at some point in the year I would need to go back to NY and take some professional exams I had been planning to take for a long time that were only being offered in person. I had scheduled around October/November to take my exams and as the dates were coming closer, my dad did a ""google search"" and asked me if I could take my exams online instead which I told him was not possible for the tests I was taking. He asked me if I could consider postponing some of my exams ""in case the rates get bad"". He also felt uncomfortable with me getting a COVID test as he felt the person giving the test ""would be exposed"" and may give me COVID. I was getting clearly cranky and irritable and he kept getting angry at me for being ""foolish"" for prioritizing exams over safety. The thing is: yes I get it, COVID-19 is a novel and unsafe situation. However, I was extremely lucky I was able to work at home (primarily because I failed to find a job in my original professional field where if I did have a job, likely I'd be working in person but was working in a different capacity as a researcher so could work from home) . I only needed to go in one day to a test center where there were all kinds of safety protocols. It took a lot for me to convince him I could try to manage this safely and I am glad we came to an agreement, thankfully.

The one good thing during the pandemic was my dad did encourage me to start driving again and said he feels I would be a safe driver than most people. However, I do feel extraordinarily frustrated by the history excessive babying and not treating me like an adult. I am extremely embarrassed at who I am and have a lot of self-loating/self-hating tendencies. I find myself getting extremely frustrated at my parents all the time and bring up the past to them a lot because I feel like even if they were trying to protect me, which I genuinely appreciate, they've also made so terrified of everything in life. I have zero desire to date or get married, not only do I not like most of the guys I end up matching with, but I also feel like the idea of having somebody ""hover"" over me would be annoying. Additionally, not very long ago, one of my dad's sisters (who probably has bipolar, but of course is not getting treated) had a whole outburst at me for no reason and had called me a piece of shit and said my dad has spoiled me and turned me into a brat. Although my dad defended me, I feel irritated people are able to find an opportunity to say these things about me.

I guess I'm writing this here to just seek advice about overcoming anxiety and becoming more confident as I'm in my thirties now. The first thing I did do recently was get a psychologist to evaluate me and I'm trying to see where to go from there. As I had mentioned-I feel like my parents are coming to terms finally that I am a grown up capable of making my own decisions, which is helpful, but I am also trying to overcome the frustration of being ""behind and stunted"".

Talent - Compassion and teaching others, specifically adult students like my Tia, whom I tutored through her GED courses in Statistics and Algebra during the summers after my sophomore and junior years. I discussed how I wanted to give back to those who gave everything for me, including my parents and tias, who all immigrated from Mexico and Guatemala for my future, meaning they lost theirs
4. Leadership - Discussed the culture of sexual violence and how I was a victim. Being the oldest and a victim then prompted me to protect those in my family and ensure they were always safe and loved. My home was broken into twice when I was about nine and ten, and for weeks, my little twin brothers slept in my bed while I stayed awake at the bedside to protect them. I would give everything in those moments to make sure they felt safe and protected from footsteps in the hallways.

I am most worried about my essays. UCLA Linguistics and Computer Science is my dream school and major, but I am not sure if I reflected much of the qualities they are looking for in my essays or courseload."

I am trying to look into getting mostly software development, specifically in either app or web development in the public sector. I want to know how good should the pay for the COL in what I’m assuming is the Washington DC area, as well as what I should be expecting in term of my skillsets and how progression work. I also want to know whether they’re going to accept someone from a public state school with a B.S. CS, alongside with maybe 1-2 projects and an internship.

It was 45 minutes with a senior software engineer on the team I would be working with. It was a position I was definitely unqualified for (firmware engineering but my experience lies in software). I struggled through the technical problem since it used concepts I completely forgot about or never really used in practice (bit manipulation, two's complement, etc. lol something I haven't touched in years). The interviewer ended up breaking the question down into extremely small subproblems and teaching me along the way, to probe me to the right answer and was super nice. I knew for sure I bricked this interview so hard pretty early on, and kinda swallowed my pride and just engaged my learning mode. I wanted to just straight up apologize for wasting the interviewer's time because I thought it went terribly.

He was nice and stayed almost 30 minutes overtime to teach me concepts and walk me through the problem in detail. He also talked about challenges/follow ups he has seen other candidates face, and said things like ""if we had more time, I would've loved to see you scratch your head and work through these challenges (referring to the coding problem), since they're really interesting problems.""

I'm like 95% sure I'm going to get rejected. I would be 10000% sure based on my performance on the technical, but the only hope I'm clinging onto is how he spent 30 extra minutes teaching me concepts and guiding me through the solution in depth. My theory is that he's just a nice guy, and maybe felt obligated to be nicer to me since I was referred by someone he works with. Thoughts?"

They have offered me a CIFRE PhD as a continuation of my internship subject. However, i am more into software engineering. I love programming and came here to actually gain experience in a big company as a software engineer/developer. This PhD will also give me 3 years of professional  experience but will it be better than working at an IT company for 3 years? I have around 1.5 years of professional experience and have applied to some jobs but to no positive response. Even if they respond, they need french speaking people and i can't speak french fluently.

If someone who has faced similar situation could write what they did, i'd love to read.

I'm a high school student from a non EU country. Sorry if my questions sound too naive. But, I recently got scholarship offers from Russian Universities for my bachelor's. I'm going to pursue a degree in computer science if everything goes right. However, I also had a couple of questions regarding this. 

1. As far as I know, even though the universities in Russia are really good. However, there isn't any system for internships during pursuing a degree. I can't also do any type of jobs like the werkstudent system in Germany. Although, I can still pursue internships in the summer, but I don't have any idea about how that will work. So, in this case, as a non EU student, will it be wise to still enroll in a Russian niversity? 

2. I want to apply to Germany for a job after my bachelor's. I don't have a problem with learning the language on a much higher level, as I already know it upto A2. I can manage. Obviously I'll try my best to make my profile as remarkable as possible. 
However, with a degree from a Russian University, and in the worst case, no proper work or internship experience, will it be hard enough to bag any kind of job in this field in Germany?

3. I want to get some job experience before I apply for my master's. Which I aspire to apply for a master's in another related field of tech, as that is the field I ultimately want to work and specialize in. However, before that, I want to get some proper CS career experience before I decide to jump the ship. Which is why I'm worried about this.

It would mean a lot to me if I get any kind of advice. As I do not want to regret my actions later on. Thank you."

Internship A has a part time flexible commitment, and seems very chill + pretty easy (basic data science), while internship B is 20 hrs/week, and is much more rigorous.

3 job/internships at once is probably too demanding for me so I'm looking to choose 2 of these. I think internship B is the best in terms of CS career experience, and the job is the most lacking in such. However, the job, as the only paid position, has the most possibility of short-term monetary gain. Is it worthwhile to choose the internships over the job to gain career experience as a 'long term investment' (maybe increasing the possibility of getting a higher paying job in the future) or is my logic flawed here? These will be my first job/internships, so I really don't know what to expect. Please let me know what y'all think. Thanks!"

I’m a fresh grad in Chemical Engineering. I’m from a South American country, but I did my whole undergrad in the USA. 

Despite doing well (3.82 GPA), I absolutely hated studying Engineering. It made me miserable and I simply do not have any interest in staying in the field. But the thing is, I have no idea what I actually want to do or even what I like. I’m still relatively young (22 years old) but ’m completely lost. The only thing I know for sure is that I do not want to stay in my country. My target destinations are Europe (since I have a European citizenship, I think it’s probably the safest bet), Canada or USA. 

The fact that I have no clue what to do is driving me insane. It certainly doesn’t help that I wasted 5 years in a major that I hated, but still. I guess my options are:

&amp;#x200B;

* Do a Master’s (somewhere in Europe since it’s basically for free) in order to transition to a different field: The problem is obviously that I don’t know what I would like to study (big risk of making a poor choice again) and from what I’ve seen, if I wanted to do something like Finance or Economics, I wouldn’t be eligible since you are required to have a degree related to the field. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Get a job: I wouldn’t mind it, but I really don’t know where to start. I have zero work experience (no internships) and it’s really hard to get a job abroad applying from my country. Plus, I’m not sure what positions I could apply for, since I have zero interest in my field of study. 

Has anyone been in a similar position? Do you have any advice for me? Any other options I should consider?

Thank you very much!"

nxklgt,15,2021-06-11,Does it seem worth it to take DAIICT or LMNIIT over lower NIT'sand mid IIIT'sfor btech cse or its equivalent?,Rich_Concert168no,Indian_Academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indian_Academia/comments/nxklgt/does_it_seem_worth_it_to_take_daiict_or_lmniit/,"I gave JEE mains this year and got 99 percentile in one of the attempts. The final date of filling forms of private colleges is approaching and I wanted to know if I should fill the forms of DAIICT or LMNIIT colleges. I have not heard about these colleges a lot but my sister was telling me to apply to these colleges. I want to know if I should apply to these as they have a high application fee and I would feel it as a waste of money if I did apply and did not want to go there.

I did read some reviews on youtube and quora but did not seem to get a definitive answer. I get that these are fantastic colleges but what is their position relative to lower nits and mid iiits. I also tried to find people on linkedin from these colleges but it didn't let me message them as I don't have a lot of connections.

Here is what I came to know from googling and reading the reviews: 

1. These colleges have decent placements.
2. DAIICT was recommended more than LMNIIT.
3. DAIICT has ICT branch instead of CSE and it is a mix of CSE and ECE syllabus.
4. They have a good alumni network.

So if someone from these colleges or you know about them and can answer my questions then it would be very helpful. My questions are as follows-

1. How is the culture among the peers? Like coding culture and drugs and other things. I guess this is the most important thing.
2. Can the college provide me with ample opportunities with regards to research, internships, placements and higher studies?
3. Are the professors supportive and helpful?
4. Would these colleges be a better alternative than lower nits?
5. This one is specific to DAIICT as it has ICT branch instead of the usual CSE so I wanted to know if ICT is valued in the industry as CSE is the norm in India? Would this lead to any problems in the future?

I can't think of other questions now but if you know anything else which is important for me to know before applying then please do list it. Also if you can help me get these information from anywhere else then please guide me to it.

nxkpsz,1,2021-06-11,Which Path Should I Choose as a New Grad?,Tosawi,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/nxkpsz/which_path_should_i_choose_as_a_new_grad/,"Hello guys, I am studying business in Turkey and I will graduate this month. I have a dilemma and I need your advice. 
A local E-Commerce company offered me a new graduate job with a salary of twice the minimum wage. I accepted it, they send me a company pc and gifts etc. and next week I will start in this company.
Yet, today a global company which is the best in its industry offered me a long term internship position with a minimum age. After the contract ends, there is no guarantee to be a perminent employee in there. I also know that most of the new graduates want to work for that company.
Another problem is I applied a master's programme in Germany and I am waiting for an admission offer in two months.
Both companies don't know my master's plan.

Now, the dilemma is, if I choose to stay in the local e-commerce company I am going to be able to save some money to spend in master's. If I choose global company, I am probably going to be blacklisted in the local e-commerce company and I will spend a couple months with a minimum wage. Since there is no guarantee to move forward after this internship, I would probably choose to study master's if school offers me. But I might get blacklisted from that global company as well if I choose to do so.

What should I do?"

Just wanted to share I committed to Ucf as a transfer student and I’m excited. It was very tough decision for me I had to choose between a lot of schools but it really came down to Ucf FSU and uf. I didn’t listen to others when it came to “prestige” I just did what I felt what was best for me because In the end it is my life and my decisions should not be influenced by what other peoples opinions are. I’m going to be a finance major while also minoring in sport management. I love the city from Orlando (especially coming from a small town) and I want a campus/city where there’s more to do then just go out to bars and party. I felt like this was the only city I could really do that. I know each school has its cons, but overall the pros really outweighed the cons at Ucf and all the other schools I’ve previously mentioned. I am most blown away by all the internship opportunity that is available here especially in the sports management career I want to pursue. I’m excited to get started and just wanted to share the good news with my fellow Ucf people!

I did graduate with a 3.55 GPA as an Honors Scholar, but I have no professional experience or internships on my resume. I spent all of my summers and free time year round working on passion projects in music and cultivating a small fan base locally in New England. 

I've been resigned to the fact that my dream has nothing to do with my degree for a while now. I'm confident that I can have enough of a career in music to at least support myself. However, I'm not sure what the best way to transition into that is. Right now, I'm living at home (not paying rent), working part time, making some extra money off of music related commissions, applying to jobs, working on developing a disciplined and motivated routine, etc. 

My goal is to move to New York City where a lot of my collaborators and friends are located. I know the city can be expensive (especially compared to where I live, which is relatively rural), so I am considering finding community housing with other music cats. 

The part I need help with is figuring out how to transition from this to that. I know some folks who dove right in and really struggled financially in their first year chasing a creative dream, and they might say to go for it, but I don't want to get evicted and mess up my credit, or have to ask family for money, or anything like that if it went south. I know plenty of people who would say I need to have a full time job in my degree to keep both doors open while I work my side hustle, but that really limits the time I can spend on my craft and network in music, and it might be a bitter existence for a while. I'm hoping right now to maybe find something full time that's tangentially related/beneficial to a budding music career, or at least creative in nature, but I'm not sure what that could be. I applied to a UI/UX internship yesterday but came to realize I don't have any experience with Adobe Suite or any other web design essentials, really. I got referred by a friend for a project management &amp; marketing position, but I feel I'm at a disadvantage since my degree is unrelated. 

Sorry for the word vomit. I guess my question is, what should I do next?"
nxo3vw,16,2021-06-11,I think I'm destined to fail once I start full-time and I don't know what to do.,i_might_have_ADHD,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nxo3vw/i_think_im_destined_to_fail_once_i_start_fulltime/,"I just graduated from a top school with three internships so I'm extremely lucky in that aspect. The problem is, none of those internships went well. In my first two internships, I was given projects that were large in scope and maybe too complicated for a college intern with limited experience. I did my best, but it was hard to stay motivated and focused, especially when my bosses couldn't offer much guidance.

I was somehow able to secure a dream FAANG-level job for my third internship in Summer 2020. That one didn't go well either. Ramping up at my first big tech company was difficult during quarantine. And working alone in my bedroom felt miserable and hopeless at points. I kept getting stuck and once again it was hard to stay focused and motivated. 

The only thing that's giving me a little bit of hope is that I did alright in school and graduated with a good GPA. I went to a notoriously difficult top school where a lot of alum say that working full-time is so much easier than managing the hellish courseload. But I feel like school is so different from work, and I didn't have to work *that* hard in school. You can get a super difficult problem set or coding assignment, but you'll have a bunch of classmates trying to solve the same difficult problem and TAs/professors who know what to do. So I survived by either constantly asking TAs for help or starting assignments late and getting help from friends who started earlier. In a real job I don't have that option.

So I didn't get a return offer from the FAANG-level internship and had to go through several months of hell and rejections before getting an offer from a startup. Now it seems like a great startup with solid comp and great upside, but it has a reputation for poor WLB. Plus, literally everyone I've met there seems so much more qualified than I am. 

I don't want to be one of those people who self-diagnoses disabilities, but a few ADHD symptoms seem really familiar. For my whole life I feel like I've dealt with focus issues and generally not living up to my potential as a result. Please DM me if you went through something similar. It's also possible I just have terrible work ethic that needs restructuring. 

I really don't know how I'm going to keep up. How can I not tank my career as soon as it starts?"

I'm not complaining or judging or anything like that. It is SO hard to get an internship, job, or career oriented opportunity. It is very hard already, but with COVID and everything that has happened this past year, it has been an especially difficult hurdle. There are people that send out a hundred applications and get completely ghosted by all of them, it is VERY difficult right now. 

I just don't understand why some people don't even TRY. It has been drilled into our minds that a college degree just is not enough anymore, and you have to really make steps toward your career, whether that be extra courses, jobs in related fields, project experience, internships, and volunteering. 

I am an Engineering major, and a lot of the people around me spent days applying to internships, interviewing, etc. It is stressful to think about the possibility of not doing something over the summer to set me forward in my career, and many other people feel that way too. Given the circumstances, many people with that mindset do not have an internship, which is okay too, don't get me wrong. 

The other half of the people around me just don't care at all, and I don't understand. Do they not care about their future? Are they not trying because they don't think they'll get anything? I almost WISH I didn't stress about getting or not getting an internship. I don't understand that attitude, and I'm not saying its right or wrong, I'm just wondering why some people just frankly do not care about internships."

I can never catch a goddamned fucking break no matter what the fuck is going on. I genuinely don't know how to function after everything that's happened to me.

Content warning for suicide mention and abuse.

My first memory is my mom being so mad at me that she hit a wooden spoon on a counter and split it in half, and then she beat my ass with it. My parents had me way too fucking young and as soon as they got bored of me they stopped giving a shit about me and then got divorced when I was 5. My mom is so fucking scary and was always so fucking mean to me for no reason. She tried to kill herself and risked injuring me as well when I was 8 years old. I had to drag her half-conscious ass upstairs while she cried until she stopped moving. I didn’t even know what suicide *was* yet. I knew she was dying but she always hurt me so fucking much I considered just going to bed and pretending I couldn’t do anything. But I saved her instead. And because of that she continued to abuse me for the rest of my childhood and teenage years.

My dad and stepmom burned down the fucking house and I lost almost everything I owned. We got scabies and bed bugs at the hotel that our insurance placed us at, and the bed bugs bit my fucking ***eyelids***. I developed endometriosis as soon as I got my first period and the cramps were so bad I would lose my vision and be unable to walk or speak. My parents never believed me that the pain was real. My mom would scream at me while I laid on the floor unable to respond because the pain was too severe. I also had terrible vision and my parents never believed me when I said I needed new glasses so everything was just always fucking blurry. They never believed me about anything I said.

My parents also couldn’t agree on having me move houses every other week like a normal kid with divorced parents, so I moved *every other day of the week* until I was 12. My dad’s house resembled a hoarder’s house and we had trash bags piled to the ceiling. I didn’t have a bedroom (despite it being a 3-bedroom house) and I slept on the couch. Our shower floor was stained solid back and everything smelled so fucking bad all the time. We had clouds of gnats that travelled room to room and I developed a debilitating fear of bugs because I kept accidentally inhaling them. My mom constantly snapped over nothing with no notice and would lash out at me unprovoked. She would call me broken, unattractive, fat, damaged, and gross. I was so fucking scared of her that I almost preferred being at the filthy trash filled house instead. They also never bought real fucking groceries and I didn’t know what most vegetables were until I got older. I ate Doritos and frozen burritos for every meal.

I also realized I was fucking transgender at 12 and I was so overwhelmed by it that I tried just suppressing it for years and just posted about my dysphoria and pain online. My parents secretly monitored everything I did online (but conveniently did nothing to stop me from getting groomed by pedophiles) and they saw me write about how much agony I was in because of how they treated me, but they never changed their behavior. They saw how miserable I was and how often I posted about being suicidal, and they punished me for it. I could never bring myself to attempt suicide because I just desperately wanted to experience One Good Thing in my fucking life for once.

I got CPS called on us on accident because I told a teacher how I felt my freshman year of high school. I spent 3 months straight unable to leave my bedroom as a result of it. I felt so fucking dehumanized. I wasn’t allowed to talk to anyone outside of the house as punishment. I barely ate. I practically stopped sleeping. I spent every day for 3 months straight staring at the wall in silence being ashamed of myself. My parents didn’t seem to give a shit that I could’ve been taken away, but they made sure to drill in how guilty I should feel for risking having my younger siblings (that they never abused) taken away. I felt so guilty and so scared that I contacted the case worker and told him I made everything up for attention so he would leave us alone. I got so stressed that my immune system started attacking itself and I was covered in hives and my skin started getting incredibly damaged.

I finally came out as a trans man at 15 and my parents told me it was disgusting and that they were disappointed in me and that transitioning “wouldn’t fix what’s wrong with me”. I lived in the middle of Republican fucking nowhere so all of my peers thought I was fucking gross for it too. My school didn't let me use the gendered bathrooms because I was out as trans, so I had to use a single bathroom at the far end of the building that was frequently locked and inaccessible. I had no friends except for my boyfriend (who is now my husband, he is my one good fucking thing). I couldn’t go more than a day without having a debilitating panic attack. My teachers were at a loss for how to help me because they all knew the problem was my home life.

I saw multiple therapists for short amounts of time but my parents always fought with each other over it and I would eventually stop being brought to appointments. One of the therapists tried to convince me that my gender dysphoria was God testing me. Oh, I forgot to mention, my parents are fucking insane evangelicals as well, and I was sent to a Jesus Camp where they cried and spoke in tongues two fucking Summers in a row. I finally saw a psychologist at 16 who was finally helping me and I decided to invite my mom in for an appointment to learn more about me being trans. She responded by screaming at me that I was too broken to fix with hormones, and I was never allowed to go to that psychologist again.

My parents wouldn’t help me learn how to drive or get my license, and I wasn’t able to get my own fucking bank account or any ID until I was an adult. This has screwed me over massively. It’s nearly impossible for me to get employment because I can’t fucking drive. I fled for college as soon as I turned 18 and they wouldn’t fucking help me pay for it because they were banking on me getting a full ride scholarship (who the fuck even gets those anymore?) so I had to sell plasma to pay my initial tuition, but I was anemic so every other time I did it I would start to black out and have to beg the employees to let me keep going if they noticed.

I moved back home for 3 weeks after my freshman year and the treatment was so bad that I left overnight with a hamper of my belongings to try getting a place in the city my college was located in. I started working full time for minimum fucking wage at a severely understaffed wholesale grocery store with a piece of shit boss that forced me to break safety regulations so often that I eventually ended up tearing my shoulder and had to be driven to urgent care (where I was left, with no phone, outside of the bus route, where I then had to walk miles in the snow to find transportation back to my apartment).

I have no fucking help in anything I do. I have nobody who can cosign for me on anything, nobody who can walk me through any aspect of being an adult, I have fucking nothing except for myself and my husband (whose parents also suck, so we don’t have them either).

When COVID hit, we both got laid off and had to go on unemployment. I haven’t even been able to properly enjoy finally having income without fucking 60-hour work weeks anymore because I’ve been so stressed and so overwhelmed that I’ve just spent the entire past year rotting internally while completing my degree. I receive almost no financial aid because my parents’ incomes had to be recorded on my FAFSA despite them not helping me in the slightest (that should change now that I’m married, but I only have one fucking year left of my degree now anyway).

And now it looks like I might need a medically necessary hysterectomy (how the fuck am I going to pay for that?) and our roommate that had been living with us moved back home during COVID so our leasing office is having to reassess if we still qualify for the same fucking apartment we’ve been living in for years. It’s unlikely that we’re going to get denied, but I am so fucking tired. I’m so fucking tired of never having a goddamned break.

I have no close fucking friends because I’ve had to dedicate my entire life so far to staying on my feet enough to function. I can never keep up with anybody for more than like a month. My husband is the kindest man in the world and the only reason I’m alive. I just don’t know what to do with myself. My only dream in life is to teach high school. I just want to help kids. I just want to do good in the world. I just want others to not have to suffer. I’m so fucking tired.

I have PTSD from my childhood and as soon as anything reminds me of it I’ll spiral for at least a week straight. I have too much financial anxiety to pay for a new therapist but I need one so bad. I don’t even know how I would get to one, since I don’t have a fucking car and our city rolled back a ton of their bus services because of COVID. Life just keeps getting harder. I’m only 22. I’m so stressed all the time I feel like I’m just perpetually going to pass out at any given moment.

I’m supposed to intern teach this Fall, and everyone in my program has such faith in me, and I’m terrified of letting them down. I’m a perfect student despite everything going on, but it never feels like enough. I don't even know how I'm supposed to fucking teach if I can't drive. I feel like I'm wasting my time pursuing my dream. I just want to do good. Why is it so hard to do good without getting my ass beat by circumstances out of my control. I just want a fucking break. I feel like I’m experiencing a level of grief beyond being suicidal. Existing is so fucking painful. I just want to live a normal life. Fuck. I didn’t even come close to listing everything fucked up that’s happened to me. And I never feel like I can fucking tell anyone, because I forget how Not Normal my life has been and it makes other people visibly stressed to hear about it so I just keep fucking everything to myself now. I’m so fucking sad. Fuck. I want to kill myself so fucking bad, but I could never do that to my husband. I also just want to know what it feels like to be fucking happy and comfortable for once. Is that such a fucking crime. Fuck. I'm tired of being so poor and stressed.

I'm so tired of seeing people I know receive hundreds of dollars from their parents to help out with expenses when I've been left to fend entirely for myself. I'm happy for them but I feel so deeply broken. I don't know how I'm supposed to live like this. I just want to be fucking comfortable. I'm so fucking sad. Fuck. Everything is horrible."

I've been looking everywhere within a 50 mile radius on various sites like LinkedIn, Glass Door, Indeed, etc but nothing speaks up to me. I just can't seem to find any good beginner jobs or internships for what I want to do.

As the title says, I don't have any professional experience in coding or really coding experience in general. What would be the best move for me currently? I know that I haven't been practicing coding since I've graduated, so I need to get in the habit of that again.

I first learned to code making games and throughout college I'm taking game development classes so my career goals are primarily in game development. This summer I scored an internship at an automotive company and because COVID has subsided a lot, I'm able to get my own office and come in or at home whenever. I notice whenever I have a lot to do, I'm much more productive and happier in the office, especially when there's other employees around lately. I also really love events like intern dinners/hangouts and our workshops every week (I'm very extroverted). If I have a lot of work to do in a particular sprint, remote work makes me distracted and frustrated. 

I don't know much about the actual job market for game development but is it a ""ridiculous"" idea that I could find a game development job that offers office work flexibility like my current one? Would no one come in anyway? Is the work atmosphere still as friendly? Should I move to somewhere near California and New York to get the experience I'm looking for or should I try local companies first (Detroit area). Would they only offer remote stuff locally?"

nxq22m,2,2021-06-11,What level of competency is needed to list a certain skill (language / framework / etc.)?,Must_Find,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nxq22m/what_level_of_competency_is_needed_to_list_a/,"I know this is a tricky question that will ultimately splinter into tiers depending on what role a person is looking for.

In my case, close to graduating with a BS in Computer Science &amp; breaking into the field of software development at the internship / entry-level. Like many, I feel overwhelmed in that despite being exposed to the discipline in the broad and general sense, I lack real depth and know there is a lot out there for me to learn.

I want to sell myself as honestly as possible. With no experience and unrelated work history, how do I detail or list skills that are relevant to the positions I apply for? Is this were grinding leetcode or other problems comes in to gauge what sort of problem solving I can address? Can I list a programming language just because it was primarily used in a course I took, despite it not being the one I am strongest in? Or should I only list things that I have projects built around and or with to demonstrate actual knowledge?"

So, I am an incoming transfer student to UF and the nature of my transfer is such that I will have to take Data Structures and Algorithms in my 3rd semester(that will be the summer before my senior year ). I wanted to know if this would pose a big issue for me trying to get an internship over the summer. As I know many companies want their students to have completed their Data Structures and Algorithms class before they apply for an internship. Can anyone give me recommendations on what I can do to land an internship before I take this class?"

I plan on transferring to an alright computer science school for the rest of my undergraduate studies, which is in the Top 50 for Computer Science.

Due to the lack of programming and science courses at my current college and still having another year to go before transferring, I decided to start doing MOOCs and watching lectures from other universities online for the last five months (e.g., Stanford, MIT). At the moment, I have done almost around 25 courses. At this point, if I were to pull up the degree requirements for computer science students at most universities, I would have taken most, if not all, of those courses, as I have a good understanding of the subject.

The issue is, I did not earn credit for these courses as I self-studied the material. I'm confident that I could get a job in the field, but I still want a degree, internships, and attend graduate school. Is there a faster method for me to get there and attend a good school without having to go another three years in undergraduate school with material I already know?"

I'm in the middle of the interview procedure with the start-ups with the position of the full-stack intern but non-paid. This was my first time applying for internships and I wasn't expecting to get any offer. Although, I got one really lately from this late May. 

I was planning to just take some summer classes to fulfill my GE graduation requirements. Although, because of this, I'm not sure whether I should take summer classes or just do this non-paid internship. I looked it over the previous posts related to the non-paid internship, but the overall opinion seems negative. Is the SWE non-paid internship just straight BS? 

I'm currently going to De Anza community college, and I'm transferring this fall to UC Santa Cruz as a CS major."

Is this what work is like?,changjinglung,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/nxx5s2/career_change_golden_handcuffs_is_this_what_work/,"Hi Reddit! New graduate here. I also don't come from the USA. Sorry for my English.

I recently have been feeling stuck. I worked full-time alongside my last semester of college. A company (consumer electronics distributor) accepted me to their graduate training program. They hired me even though I was still in university because of my good grades (1% of top students) internship record and because I speak both English and my native language, since it's a foreign company.

I was supposed to be trained to fulfill a certain managerial position (Zone Sales Manager) almost immediately as it was urgent. But after a month I was hired, 3 expatriates returned and got the positions I and the other 2 new hires were supposed to be trained to fill.  It's been months and there still are no plans for me, because the company is quite small and there is no real ""graduate training program"" it was labeled as that because they wanted me to be in that role.

So for now I have no actual responsibilities. The pay isn't bad. It is around double what the average fresh graduate earns. But I feel very useless here despite my title being ""District Sales Manager."" Most days I do nothing aside from basic administrative work since DSM appears to be a redundant position, and my boss (Regional Sales Manager) is looking for things for me to do, and has me compile Excel reports and sit in the retail stores watching retail staff work to ""improve my skills and help me learn more about the company until I'm ready to be a ZSM"" More problems with this work:

* No office hours, I am contacted constantly even on Sundays and government-mandated holidays, and this is on top of the official work schedule being 9am to 9pm Monday to Saturday. Get reprimanded for insubordination if I ignore these. Even employees and bosses on leave are still actively working.
* Half my salary is based on the percentage of revenue goal the company achieves, which is impossibly high so I never get full amount
* Pressure is on me to increase sales and I am blamed for low revenue even though there is nothing I can do. The only things I can do are to talk to the retailer staff and motivate them (which is difficult when they are earning less than minimum wage and being pressured to sell more with no commissions) and beg our account managers to help settle the issues with our retail partners. I fear in the future I will not get employed anywhere else after wasting years here getting paid to do essentially nothing.
* My performance depends on many factors out of my control, retail partners have inefficient supply chains which I cannot do anything about. Performance is dependent on the territory assigned (high income districts with lots of paying customers + cooperative retailers and low income districts with retailers slowly going bankrupt have the same quota)
* No benefits except mandatory government benefits, which are almost nothing in my country
* I am actually underpaid here as my base salary (before adjustment to sales quota percentage) is less than the other 2 graduate trainees for the same job (And I have contributed more with more with my earlier deliverable submissions, and system improvements because so many staff don't know how to use basic Excel. I taught the other DSMs how to use pivot tables and formulas, such as for when they prepare their sales reports per SKU of the hundreds of SKUs by using sort filters and COUNT)
* Not much potential for advancement here, the company is racist, and even though I can have a higher position fresh out of university, only the expatriates can have higher positions. Zone Sales Manager is the highest I'm likely to go. (with double my current salary) I don't know when I will reach Zone Sales Manager (current ZSMs told me there is no plan and that I'm the backup option in case one of them gets fired, it's used as a threat ""Improve the results or changjinglung will take your place"")

Being fresh out of university, my friends and classmates are applying in other jobs. Some are getting into very selective international brands offering way better compensation (20% higher salary + lots of benefits) with a more reasonable (however similarly heavy) workload. I wonder if I would enjoy myself more and make better use of the academic credentials I worked hard to achieve.

If I don't make it into those jobs, however, I'm considering taking a pay cut for less competitive companies. The pay will probably be lower (\~20% less) but for a proper 9-5 5-day work week and a chance to improve my skills it could be worth the switch. What would you advise?"

My grades are pretty mediocre, I’ve only taken one AP (I can specify if needed) and haven’t done much extracurricular-wise. I did one year of track, one year of swimming, as well as taken a year of photography and drawing. I also have a veterinary internship over the summer. It may seem like I have everything set, when in reality I don’t. I’ve spent countless hours crying and stressing on what to major in. I basically want to major in something that won’t require a Masters degree and I can earn money pretty fast. I’ve thought about architecture, even took the necessary classes for it in high school, but I don’t really have any experience with it. Then I considered veterinary studies, but it requires a lot of schooling and I don’t know if I can and or willing to manage that. Then I considered computer engineering because the average salary is around 92k with a bachelors degree. I’m all over the place with choosing a major and I know you can enter college as undecided but I’d rather not.

ny240w,1,2021-06-12,Is it time to move on?,CelticDubstep,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/ny240w/is_it_time_to_move_on/,"So, I'm been working at the this company for nearly 2 years. It's a small company and I'm the sole IT person so I manage everything IT related as well as some unrelated duties. However, over the past couple of months I've been stuck in a rut and can't really pin point the issue but I've simply lost most of my motivation, even performing day-to-day tasks. 

The only thing I can think of that is causing these feelings is perhaps burn-out with this company. It's a great company to work for and I have good working relationships with everyone, including the owner. The owner pays 100% of our health insurance, so no deductions from our payroll and he also matches our 401K a fairly decent amount. We also get a good amount of PTO and a yearly bonus at the end of the year. 

However, there are a few things that have been bothering me which I think have been building up to this point where I am now.

1. Lack of communication - This is a big one. There is little to no communication at this company and what do I mean by that? We've parted ways with at least 4 employees (all at different times) since I've been with the company. Example: I noticed an employee hasn't been in the office in several weeks, so I ask someone if they knew where he was and I was told by that person that he was an intern and he finished his internship at the company. Meanwhile, all accounts for this user remained active. I addressed my concerns with upper management with no response. Employee 2 sends me an e-mail, from his work e-mail address, that he was let go from the company and wanted to know if he could get a copy of some personal files that were on workstation. Again, I brought this up to management with no response. Employee 3 &amp; 4 I also found out directly from the employees and was never informed by management. The same has also happened when we hired someone... I get a phone call one morning from our 2nd office ""Hey, we had a new employee start today and we're trying to get him logged into X workstation, can you help?"". 

2. No annual review/raises - I've been at the same pay now that I was on day 1 which isn't terrible, but the company as a whole does not conduct reviews or provide regular raises. I was told by someone who has been with the company for 10+ years that they simply give raises ""when they think about it"" and that many people have had to ask for raises. 

3. Equipment - We have 4 servers and some 25+ workstations, with no a single one of them being under any type of warranty or maintenance contract. Other than the servers, all the workstations (we only have a few notebooks) are custom built and are in ""fair"" condition. For example, most of the systems are in 15+ year old Antec Gaming Cases with SSD's not mounted (as the cases only have 3.5"" bays and the last IT person didn't bother using adapters). Our workstations vary in age, but on average, they are 6-8 years old with some over 10 years old, and some a few months old. As the majority of the systems are 6-8 years old and are used for engineering work, the slowness complaints have been steadily increasing over the past 2 years. I understand it is a small company and they have to watch their books, but trying to replace these older systems has proven difficult and I've been having to recommission system simply to meet our employment needs. I'm at the point where I may be recommissioning 12+ year old 1st Gen i5's. 

4. Software - This is pretty much the same as above. We're using one piece of software from 2015 that is pretty critical to our business and the developer of this software refuses any support since they don't support anything newer than Windows 7 and we're running Windows 10. I've been able to get the company to upgrade on an as-needed basis when a user runs into an issue that completely breaks the software, but we still have 12+ seats on this version. 

Anyway, I'm almost wondering it is time to cut ties and move on. I live in a low population/non-metropolitan area so the IT field is extremely slim here, but it seems that right now is a good time for possible remote opportunities that will (hopefully) pay better and I can work with a team of people instead of having everything rest on me. The owner will be retiring in the next year or so at which time his son will be taking over and let's simply say it will be a less than ideal place to work at that point. 

Anyway... thoughts? Thanks in advance as always."

I wanted to ask the MPP grad students of this sub if they think their experience at public policy school was/is worth it. 

I applied to law schools this last year and only a handful of MPP programs, vying for maybe dual degree situations. 

I've always been interested in politics and government and legislating, so I was wondering if this field and curriculum makes a difference in pursuing a political career. 

I'm in at Price at USC with a pretty generous scholarship that would let me get out with no debt. Should I take the chance? I'd still have to sign up and take a stats class this summer which is a huge bummer because I just graduated and feel like a need a break from school. 

I decided last week to maybe defer and take a gap year, but in reconsidering my career goals, part of me wonders why not just start now? I graduated early and I'm still pretty young with not a whole lot of professional experience (thanks to the pandemic.) I feel like I've earned a gap year off, but I'm not sure how useful just working or having an internship would be if I have this opportunity already. 

Let me know your thoughts."

I know I want to go to law school one day, but have also gotten into a great masters program that I feel like I might want to pursue. It's an MPP that would take two years. I've graduated a year early from undergrad, so going straight on through from grad school to law school would take 5 years, and I'd get out at 25 going on 26 years old. 

I'm wondering if it makes sense to get all these degrees, or for those of you who did something like this, was it worth it? 

I wouldn't have to take on debt at the grad school thanks to a scholarship, but law school might be a different story. 

I have the choice to take a gap year this year, but I'm also wondering if just going on straight through would be worth it? Lots of people have been telling me I'll just be burnt out and crushed after 5 more years, if I don't take a little bit of a break now. I'm inclined to agree with them, but I'm not sure if I'm anymore passionate about work and internships right now than I am about grad and law school?

Also, sometimes I'm not sure if I want these degrees just to have them and complete the challenge, or if I actually know I want to have them and am aware of what I'm getting myself into.

My main intention was to get into a big name company (faang, quant farms, salesforce, unicorns etc) but it's either my bad luck or something with my resume that is not getting me interviews at any of the big tech companies.
I will have done 4 internships by fall 2021 at mid sized Canadian companies ( more than 200 employee and more than 10 years in business) in Vancouver.
I have had referrals and got my resume reviewed several times with 0 luck. 
Now one of my backup plans is to graduate and get 1 year of professional work experience, and then go to grad school as I heard a master's degree with professional experience boosts someone's chances significantly. Also hopefully by that time (late 2023 or early 2024) the pandemic will be over and hiring will be in surge again.

(Main Part): Now I am deciding between Waterloo ece masters vs US schools. I will list pros and cons from my perspective from both

Waterloo pros:
Cheap domestic tuition
High flexibility ( since I am domestic I can take a semester off to do internship or do whatever I like
Not bound by certain restrictions an international would have)
Very high reputation in terms of job search
High probability for me to get in (talked with admission committee and they told me I have very high chance with my GPA of 86% vs their required 75% for ece masters)
Cons;
Won't have access to us job markets due to visa issue
Can only get into ece master's, don't have good shot at Cs masters (although I don't care as UWaterloo ece masters have lots of software engineering specializations such as ml, networking, security etc)

Us schools: I am mainly looking at Washington state, Uwashington eece masters and UC San Diego 

Pros: Access to us job market as I will have cpt and opt which means at least for internship I won't require sponsorships

Cons: highly expensive (excess of 100k usd)
Inflexible (I will be international which means I cannot do a lot of things that a domestic can do)
Low ranking: (since UBC is a well ranked school compared to  others except Uwashington, I don't know how bad it will look on my resume)
Have to take additional tests such as GRE ( it's optional for most schools but things might change as the pandemic passes)

I might have been missing other things but I am in torn between these two options. 
Is there any insight someone can provide that would help me to make a decision? Also am I missing anything here?
Thanks

My main intention was to get into a big name company (faang, quant farms, salesforce, unicorns etc) but it's either my bad luck or something with my resume that is not getting me interviews at any of the big tech companies.
I will have done 4 internships by fall 2021 at mid sized Canadian companies ( more than 200 employee and more than 10 years in business) in Vancouver.
I have had referrals and got my resume reviewed several times with 0 luck. 
Now one of my backup plans is to graduate and get 1 year of professional work experience, and then go to grad school as I heard a master's degree with professional experience boosts someone's chances significantly. Also hopefully by that time (late 2023 or early 2024) the pandemic will be over and hiring will be in surge again.

(Main Part): Now I am deciding between Waterloo ece masters vs US schools. I will list pros and cons from my perspective from both

Waterloo pros:
Cheap domestic tuition
High flexibility ( since I am domestic I can take a semester off to do internship or do whatever I like
Not bound by certain restrictions an international would have)
Very high reputation in terms of job search
High probability for me to get in (talked with admission committee and they told me I have very high chance with my GPA of 86% vs their required 75% for ece masters)
Cons;
Won't have access to us job markets due to visa issue
Can only get into ece master's, don't have good shot at Cs masters (although I don't care as UWaterloo ece masters have lots of software engineering specializations such as ml, networking, security etc)

Us schools: I am mainly looking at Washington state, Uwashington eece masters and UC San Diego 

Pros: Access to us job market as I will have cpt and opt which means at least for internship I won't require sponsorships

Cons: highly expensive (excess of 100k usd)
Inflexible (I will be international which means I cannot do a lot of things that a domestic can do)
Low ranking: (since UBC is a well ranked school compared to  others except Uwashington, I don't know how bad it will look on my resume)
Have to take additional tests such as GRE ( it's optional for most schools but things might change as the pandemic passes)

I might have been missing other things but I am torn between these two options. 
Is there any insight someone can provide that would help me to make a decision? Also am I missing anything here?
Thanks

I graduated from an engineering technology program quite a while ago, worked for a company for ~2 years. Then travelled/bummed around for a few years while doing some contract work for the same company when I was in town. Then worked for a different company for ~2 years before deciding to go back to school for an engineering degree. Currently doing an internship at the same company. 


Most of the work I did at both companies would be considered engineering level tasks/projects.  


So anyway for future internship/job searches I am trying to decide between these three options:


1. List all education and experience. This will tell anyone looking at my resume that I am 30+. Yes experience is great but there is definitely age bias, especially for internships. 


2. List all education and some experience. If I list my tech diploma without a grad date and only my second tech job, I will still have a fair bit of experience without letting them know I’m old-ish. 


3. Only list my engineering degree/internship. This way on paper I am just a regular engineering student attending a top university with internship experience. I’m thinking this is my best bet for internships at big companies. 


Let me know what you guys think is best, or if I should use certain approaches for certain types of companies/positions."

It's considered a state school since it's public but has a student body of around 5000-6000. I initially chose to attend this university due to the financial value of commuting instead of paying for dorms but my situation has changed to where the value is no longer there financially. However, being a smaller school did provide some benefits, particularly with TA/professor and student interaction.

My professor would host zoom calls to help people after class for around 1-2 hours before the deadline. The college I went to focused on undergrad teaching much more heavily so it made sense, but he was available for *a lot* of the time. I felt like I became a friend with him, I got to attend a get together at his house, it felt genuine. The professors were awesome and I felt like I was learning a lot, However, the opportunities provided by the university for CS aren't great, with the career fair not even existing for CS.

The university I'm trying to transfer to is 5-6 times bigger and is more well known, especially for CS and cybersecurity. Has very strong career fairs and internship opportunities and is also much closer to a city while also having good placements for graduates.

Should I simply stay or should I continue trying to transfer to the second university?"

nyayfy,57,2021-06-12,"Tips for a better internship recruiting season (long, but I hope it benefits someone)",PvtWangFire_,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/nyayfy/tips_for_a_better_internship_recruiting_season/,"I’ve learned a lot about applying, interviewing, and the internship process, mostly because of countless rejections and times when I’ve made mistakes. I was able to use these tips to increase the number of interviews I got this year by 5x compared to last year. Hopefully, they can help some people because now is already a great time to start preparing and get a head start on the 2022 internship recruiting cycle.

1. Waiting too long to start applying is a big reason why it can be difficult to get interviews, and it’s also the easiest to fix. I’ve gotten interviews/offers from positions that I feel like I wasn’t qualified for, partly because I applied in July/August when most people didn’t start applying yet. For many companies, August to November is when the highest volume of summer hiring gets done, and February to April are for whatever positions are leftover. Don’t wait too long to start applying. If you think “I'll wait until \[month\] when my \[whatever\] will be better"", tons of positions will be filled in that time that you’ve missed out on. 
2. How to prepare this summer: Update your Linkedin &amp; resume, figure which companies and roles you want to apply for, and write your cover letters now. The next tip is about resumes, but figuring out which companies and roles is super easy. Look up “intern” on Linkedin, sort by people, then by companies. You’ll find people doing internships this summer and you can see what roles they’re doing. See who you have a similar background with, and now that’s a role you can apply for when recruiting starts. You can also reach out to people for ""informational interviews"" to learn about what they do advice to get where they are right now. Cover letters focus on the role, the company, and why you want to work there. You can write cover letters now about why you want to work for companies, so you don’t need to write these in the Fall when you're focusing on school and interviewing.
3. Resume advice: You don’t need a “resume builder website” to make an awesome resume. All you need is Word, 1 page, 11-12pt font. Sections: education, work experience, project experience, skills, and extracurriculars. Don’t include a summary, objective statement, awards, coursework (unless its a super relevant to the role), or hobbies. Make sure the bullet points outline your impact instead of your objectives. Instead of “created X to make Y more profitable”, write “created an extra 500 X per month, making Y 25% more profitable”. Exact figures and amounts are great because numbers stand out in a sentence, and can easily show the impact you’ve made. Make sure the format stays consistent with bold, spacing, aligning, and underlining.
4. Don’t put all of your energy into “reach” companies. I applied to almost 50 positions with a few ultra-selective companies, and got interviews with none of them. There’s nothing wrong with interning at smaller or less-known companies, and it’s easier to get to the interview stage with them than with the Googles or the Teslas of the world. Apply to any company that you can, but it’s not worth it to focus too much on companies that hire \~1% of applicants.
5. Career Fair Advice: Attend every career event your school does. It is always easier to get a job from a career fair than applying online. My interview rate this past year was 30-40% from career fairs, and 5% from online applications. Apply online before the events! You’ll know which specific positions the company is hiring for, their preferred qualifications, and the job descriptions. Knowing these things make it easier to have a meaningful conversation with the recruiter because you’re able to relate your experience and your background to a specific position, instead of asking them easy-to-answer questions like everyone else does. Be able to say why you want to work for that company and in that role while referencing their projects, mission, company values, and current events. Knowing these things allows you to drive and steer the conversation your way. Confidence is very important, and being prepared is a great way to naturally be confident in what you’re saying.
6. Work on your interview skills. If you’ve made it to the interview, they have determined that you’re qualified on paper. The interview is meant to see if you’re a good fit with the team or the company. Every rejection I’ve gotten after an interview was from not doing a good job at conveying my thoughts and demonstrating my impact. Nerves and anxiety can sabotage you in an interview so it’s best to prepare. Anxiety or speech impediments won’t affect you in the interview as much if you know what they'll ask and how you'll respond. Research the company, practice using the STAR method, and think about how you’d answer their questions. Every behavioral question they would ask is written in some “most common interview questions” list online, so that’s an easy way to practice. Glassdoor is also a good site for company-specific interview information. Find someone to do mock-interviews with, it can be good practice for both of you. I used to have really bad anxiety and stuttering during interviews, but consistent practicing and preparing caused me to naturally feel more relaxed and conversational.
7. Don't underestimate extracurriculars. I have low grades, so I got involved with a bunch of clubs at school, and they've been great talking points with recruiters. Being in a leadership role in a club shows that you're organized, can manage your time, work with other people, and can be a leader. I've seen ""leadership role in a campus organization"" on a few job descriptions, and you'll find that most interns at companies are involved with something outside of classes. If the thing you're involved with is relevant to the company, that's a plus (Fsae with auto companies &amp; investing club with banking companies).
8. Do things this summer to make yourself a better candidate for next year. I don’t have a full 40 hours of work to do each week at my internship right now, so I use my little free time to network and practice learning new software. It’s even better if you can do a project using that new skill you’ve learned, and have something to talk about with recruiters at career fairs next school year. There are tons of resources to learn new skills and apply them in a demonstrable way. 

I wasn’t doing any of these things during 2019-2020, and it showed in my internship results. These are all things I’ve remembered from various mentors and recruiters over the last year, and I hope they can help other people too."

Hi fellow teachers, I just wanted to share a new educational program I found out about so that you too can recommend it to your students.

It is called the Tiger Global Case Competition. It is a global case competition where students around the world compete to earn attractive prizes such as USD 1500 cash prize and internship at major firms such as pwc. Furthermore, the competition also provides training and workshops by professors so students can learn a lot. The competition is targetted at the youth

I recommended this competition to some of my students last year and they loved it. The experience was very enriching and they met a lot of friends from around the world through the virtual sessions. I highly recommend this competition for your students as well.

The competition does have a registration fee of 15 USD per person but you can get 50% off using the code TGCC127. For more information check out the official page [https://www.casecomp.org/](https://www.casecomp.org/)"
nyclbf,1,2021-06-12,Investing and mental health,Public_Nature_8616,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/nyclbf/investing_and_mental_health/,"Greetings, I hope the following reading can be an eyeopener, and for some to maybe relate to what I am going through.

Ever since the corona stock market crash I was traumatized and stuck in a Bearish mode which made me bias to shorting the stock market with glass-hands.

**My story**

I was blessed to have my first child in January 2020 and being a Business Student in a foreign country living on limited income I tried my luck on the stock market.

During this time I was pending from 1 city where my University was located where I stayed during the weeks and to another city where my girlfriend and daughter was staying with her grandma and grandpa where I stayed during the weekends (Roughly 10H bus drive between the cities)

I was very ambitious previous year 2019 when we knew that we were going to have a daughter, and being a student with 1,5 year left for a 2-degree bachelor program in Business management and Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship I took on the opportunity to do some relatively demanding internship positions which would last until I finished my degrees.

My income came from student loan every month as well as internship jobs which totaled in roughly 13k (I was working 2 internship jobs, 1 gave a little bit of pay but the other did not) and this money was deposited mostly into the trading account.

Being extra ""cautious"" after the sudden fall of the stock markets around the world I developed a very short-term glass-hand behavior with the mindset of ""If you need the money within 3 month, don't invest it"" So I did short term trading instead mostly in X20 Bull/bear Certificates which followed the indices of DAX / OMX / Nasdaq.

I had around 60k SEK at the beginning and after the first week of trading I was + around 10K and I was thinking to myself ""Wow! Why didn't I start doing this earlier!"" And I was giving hope to my girlfriend that the good life was waiting in the horizon.

After another week or so I was not really doing so well anymore, being +- 0 and after some more time I ended up with some more loss trades. After one of those loss trades I decided to hold my X20 Bull certificate following the OMX Index over the night AKA a ""Revenge trade"".

When the market closed and the X20 BULL Certificate was not going to be tradable until the following day I followed the stock markets movement, and they all plummeted. I was watching live how the OMX index after hours gradually and steadily went down and down, I cant remember exactly how much but around -3%.

The following day came and I was down from roughly 65k to around 24-25k and I was totally devastated thinking how the hell am I going to come back from this. Having in mind that this is all the money that me and my family have I had to suck it up and try to reset by getting up on the horse.

I fought back and traded +5 or 7k the following week which was great because I needed to make a withdraw and the withdrawing's are for around 5k 2-3 times every month to covers for living costs etc.

But at this point my trading was not stable, together with withdrawing's it felt like I took 1 step forward and 2 steps backwards.

Kept on trading but the capital was not growing but was decreasing, to the point where I only had 5k left, at this time I was truly desperate and I asked my brother for help, he sent me 70k, and shortly after my dad sent me 50k as well. So all of a sudden I had 130k borrowed from my family, the feeling I had was a great great relief, but also lots of pressure because I know had money borrowed from my family, it was a big hit to my ego and self-image but of course immensely grateful to have their support.

In the next 4 month, those 130k turned into 50k, due to withdraws but of course trading losses.

I just could not comprehend what I had done, it was revenge trade after revenge trade. I was obsessed with X20 Bear/Bull certificates trading and every trade I made seemed to lose money. I was a total mess inside my head, thinking about how I can recover, how do I tell my family that I lost so much money, how can I look at my girlfriends face and my daughters eyes knowing that I'm such a big failure, I failed all of them so hard, they deserve so much better.

But of course I need to put up a charade and smile to keep our life together saying that everything is going to be good, the other option is to die, which I have and is thinking about often and is telling myself that I should die, I am such a big failure. But then again, I can not leave my girlfriend and daughter with nothing, everything I do is for them, and I also have experienced what suicide can do to someone since my Grandfather killed himself and it have deeply impacted my father, so for him to have a son who also suicide, I could not do that to him,

Now more than a year of trading X20 certificates it is at best a zero sum game for me, I have deposited my income to the trading account, make a few win trades and going on a streak, to then have some bad losses, but I am mentally stuck on that I if I just make over a certain amount then I can build a portfolio and stop trading these certificates, but I now only have 15K left which has been the case for the past 6 months, I've been able to grow 5-10k every month, but need to withdraw for living costs so I'm stuck at 15-20k, and a big setback for me is that I do not longer have any income because halted my last semester at University since I cannot pay the tuition fee, I do not longer have any internships.

We are currently waiting for visa approval to move back to my home country where I have plans for start working at ANY job and for my girlfriend to get a permanent residence visa, but the funny thing is that my girlfriend needs to show evidence that I can support her which I cannot provide... so I am currently on an expired Visa in a foreign country because leaving my girlfriend and daughter is absolutely not an option. So, my hope is to grow these 15k to the sum enough to validate her Visa so we can move back to Sweden, but that is not going so well yea....

**Learning points**

I do not want to tell anyone what they should trade or how they should do it, but I will list things that I have done that has not been successful.

These are the things I have done that have led to big losses trading X20 Certificates

* Holding over nights
* Putting all of the capital in single trades
* Make a trade and go do something else and hope for the best
* Riding losers long
* Thinking that Today is the Day where the market will keep on falling or keep on going up
* Getting emotional I.e, stopping a trade in bull direction because its losing and !immediately! buying a Bear product just to see that a support level has been hit and the direction is now changing that same minute that you bought it.
* Going into the trading with a stressed up mind and chasing money or knowing that you absolutely need to make money.

When I'm writing this I understand that it is more complex and that each point can be discussed and further elaborated upon, because I'm also thinking of things that have led to win trades and I don't want to say that you need luck, because one makes they own luck.... one win factor is determination, but for me it has also been a lose factor, I don't have a winning formula sadly, so one revelation that might help is to have someone to talk the market with, to have someone that is equally interested in the broad and complex World of finance is something I feel would help me, for me twitter has been helpful, but its a double-edged sword.

I'm thinking if I should just delete the Learning point part but I will leave it here, maybe its useful for someone.

But this following part is important, at least for me to be said.

I have had so many sleepless nights, thinking to myself if I did this or that then I would be rich. I feel so f##ing bad, I am in a really bad place mentally, I have stopped answering messages from friends and former professors, and people that I like because I am really ashamed. I know that I am a failure with trading, it have made me hate. I wish I had never started trading these products, but I feel like this is the only way I can comeback....I have been blaming many things, but I have only myself to blame, and now trading these high risk is the thing that keeps me afloat, for now... It have made me lie, to my girlfriend, to my family.

**So from my experience, don't do high risk trading, the way I have done it, it is not the way.**

On the positive side, I have learned to appreciate, the very smallest things, I love my daughter and my girlfriend, they are my everything and I promised myself that I will give them a good life.

Do not take anything from granted, I am today 29 years old, I did enter the stockmarket 2014 and became a SEK millionaire after an incredible run in a stock named Fingerprint cards, I did then put all of my money that I earned to a single stock named Etrion which has been slooowly going down meanwhile I have only been doing withdraws and ""living life"" until I finally sold during the corona crash at the very lowest low and started trading.. I have been able to get experience and got to reflect, and I do believe that I will comeback from this total financial low point that I am currently in my life which is affecting me in so many ways, I will become better. But right now, I'm weak and vulnerable.

I guess this is some part of a solo therapy for myself, but it is also a message out to the cyberspace for anyone that might need to read this and can make a better turn than I did, and of course, maybe a billionaire will read this and feel sorry for me and grant me a million or so!

**Last word**

To emphasize again lastly, on one point that I did not make clear enough, if you are in the same position as me, Do Not Take Your Own Life, you might try to cry and cannot, you are stone cold without emotions, but it is not the way to go out.... Keep struggling, because."

I just got off the waitlist for GaTech CS recently. I’m not sure on if I should transfer there or not. I’m a rising sophomore.

I really enjoyed my time at UNC a LOT more than I expected, and I even secured an internship, a TA position for next semester, and research for next semester.

At the same time, GaTech is a top 5 school in CS and I know it’s known for its great opportunities. 

I’d like to work at FAANG or better, for reference. I really don’t know what to do. What do y’all recommend? GaTech students especially!

Edit: thanks for all the responses so far guys! One issue I have with staying at UNC is that I’ve seen a lot of people who seem very accomplished on this sub, but they make posts about struggling to gain internships because they don’t go to a T10 CS. 

These people say things like they have amazing personal projects and can easily ace OAs. How common is this issue where you have such accomplished people and they can’t gain top tier internships?"

I am finishing my Masters of CS in August, and due to covid, lost a lot of time for internships and instead did volunteer work for hackathons. When applying for junior level positions across AngelList, LinkedIn, etc., I keep reading over and over again ""top x% candidate"" as I have extensive skills and managed to do quite a bit imo over my Master's degree. Always though, for basic level positions whose requirements are sometimes well below my own work, I get ""sorry, but we have decided to move forward with another candidate"". This has happened in places where I was notified as the only candidate and before even a first-round interview! I understand inside hiring I a thing, but it is quite frustrating when junior level positions easily toss your resume aside simply for lacking formal industry experience.

I would freelance if I felt comfortable in understanding how it worked. I have done 1088T's in the past, but not in the computer industry.

How am I supposed to keep ""my chin up"" when several companies won't even give the time of day despite meeting above and beyond their minimum expectations? I understand, it is their right to hire and right to interview, but after nearly 200 applications, only 3 first rounds? Almost got to a second round, but unfortunately, I had to admit (didn't want to lie) I have not hardcoded to boards."

I am a senior civil engineer expected to graduate in the fall 2021 semester and immediately starting my masters in structural engineering in the spring. I should graduate with my masters in the fall 2022. I am terrified for what awaits me when I try to look for a job.

I have been trying really hard to get internships but I have failed this summer specifically. 
Two summers again I worked with a mentoring program so I was able to gain minimum experience in my field, but the program didn’t really help much. 
Last summer I optioned an internship but it was canceled because of covid. 
This summer I was able to get a last minute research job with a professor but it’s in water resources which doesn’t really help me. 

Am I in trouble? I feel like I’m underprepared. Even if I get an internship next summer, I feel like that isn’t enough if I’m graduating with my masters. 
I love structural engineering and I want a really good job. I’m scared that I would be stuck to accept a job I don’t want because any great structural engineering firms won’t see value in me. I work very hard in school but I know that doesn’t help in a real firm. I do anything to prepare myself. 
My dream is to work for companies that construct skyscrapers or bridges, that’s what I truly have passion for.

I have a degree in psychology, and have worked with several research psychologists in the past. I have worked in fundraising for the past two years. I also am part of a fellowship where I have participated in several design-thinking projects, validation challenges, and pitch completions, one of which was conducted by IDEO.

I am working on teaching myself UX research and design on my own time. I am planning to apply to a free UX program (through a nonprofit) this fall. I am developing out a portfolio and I’m reviewing other portfolios to see what I should feature. Some things I have considered including are a design/product development project I did with IDEO through a fellowship I am in, another personal product pitch completion I did through my fellowship, and another product development project I did through a scholarship I received/another program I participated in. I’ve also considered including website redesign work for improving UX for existing websites but it’s unclear to me whether this is legal to do or worth asking the permission to do if I could possibly go through all the work to not be able to ultimately feature the work in a portfolio. 

Also, I have read that it’s hard to break into the UX field as an entry level employee and that it’s over saturated. Is it worth going through all the effort to try to make the transition now or are there steps that I can take to bolster my resume and eventually make the transition in when I have more experience? For example, some people have told me it’s an option to work for a university to get a masters paid for that way which might give me better access to connections and more credibility to potentially get my foot in the door without having to take on a lot of debt (which I am not in a position to do). Others have told me they feel I should teach myself on my own time rather than spending the money on a program. If I am able to get into the UX program offered for free by a nonprofit then that seems like I would need to continue working in the meantime without directly working in the UX field until I had completed my program. 

I apologize that this has a lot of rambling but I am just trying to consider all my options. I am trying to make sure that I am being intentional about my time and that my next steps move me closer to where I ultimately want to be in my career rather than further from it. I hope that this transition is feasible. I have a tendency to get in my head and worry and over plan things rather than just executing and having faith and I know that’s what I am doing now but also, I want to have a solid plan. Any advice that you have, especially if you have been through something similar would be greatly appreciated. 

Namely, some questions I am pondering are:

Is the time investment of teaching myself UX on my own time and building out a portfolio worth it? Or will I not be considered at all since I don’t have direct industry experience? 

Have you made the transition into UX from some other field? If so, how did you accomplish that?

Should I be looking for roles directly within the UX field right now without having direct experience or should I try to find another way into the field while working in another field for the time being? For example, should I get a job at a university so I can get a masters paid for? Should I get a job at a startup and express to them that I would like the chance to potentially transition into UX after a set time at the company and proving myself and developing my skills? Should I try to look for UX internships that would be willing to accept someone who is not a student (don’t know if those even exist)? Should I offer to do volunteer work for local businesses or family members to add to a portfolio rather than just focusing on my past personal projects (again, not sure the legality of featuring copyrighted brands in a portfolio).

Any and all advice is welcome, thank you!"
nyfbkl,11,2021-06-12,for anyone who is wondering if why extracurriculars matter,anafujoshi,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/nyfbkl/for_anyone_who_is_wondering_if_why/,"hello! this is actually a comment that i left on another post, but it struck a personal chord in me and i thought i might share it for anyone who needs to see it! basically the original question was a rising sophomore who wanted to know if they needed to do extracurricular activities to get into university because OP wasn't interested in joining clubs, etc. i'm a rising senior who was in a similar position as you a few years back. short answer: yes, you should have some extracurricular activities.

colleges value high GPA and stats because it shows that you're a good student and a dedicated learner. however, colleges usually like to see that you're doing more than the bare minimum and that you're exploring your interests outside of school as well. it shows that you are not only a good student, but an effective member of your community as well. it's nice for admissions officer to know that you're understanding the subjects you are being taught, but it means more to them when you are going out of the way to apply and reinforce that knowledge in a real-world context to further your own interests and support others who are not in the position you are! being a high-achieving student is nice, but being a well-rounded student is more important when it comes to colleges. for example, a college is more likely to pick a mediocre student with outstanding extracurriculars, awards, and community service than a high-achieving student who is just that.

is there a particular reason why you disliked clubs and extracurriculars? i will say that, in my experiences, clubs are very different in high school in that there's a much bigger pool and lots of different ideas/opinions. when i came to high school, i also had a super negative perception of school clubs, especially since i was a bit of an outsider joining a private high school where i knew no one. it was difficult to go to club meetings when i was the only one left without a group or partner, etc. however, something i soon came to realize when i started actually joining clubs in 10th grade is that being part of activities outside of school allows you to meet ppl with similar interests and form connections that way.

all in all, something you have to realize is that the vast majority of college applicants are very good students, so GPA doesn't mean too much at a certain extent. of course, it matters that you get good scores, but a college won't necessarily weigh a 4.65 GPA higher than a 4.43 GPA based on just that (source: i've talked extensively with my three school college counselors, who are all ex-AO for ivy schools + Stanford). colleges are increasingly recognizing that GPA are not an accurate measurement of intelligence or how well you do in school. they're also moving away from standardized testings (SAT and AP exams): many colleges are considering continuing optional testing after the pandemic and most top colleges are offering less and less credit for AP/IB/AICE exams. what colleges are caring more and more about is taking a holistic view of the student. they genuinely want to know whether you'll be a good fit for the school *community*, not just in a classroom. they want to know what you're doing outside of school, what your interests are and how you're expanding them, what type of person you are, and what is your relationship with the other people at your school and your community. colleges value leadership positions because it shows a lot of dedication into your endeavors. colleges value community service because it shows you care about your community and improving it. colleges value internships and externships because it shows that you have strong interests and are proactively trying to work towards them at a young age.

there are things that you might not consider extracurriculars but are! babysitting, jobs, walking, exercising, hiking, etc. are all valuable extracurriculars that show a lot about who you are as a person. there's a post linked in the A2C wiki that talks about different extracurriculars for people who ""don't have any extracurriculars.""

please feel free to reach out if you want ideas of extracurricular activities that are a good fit for you! another good resource could be your school counselors, if you're not comfortable talking with a random hooman from the internet, but i do think that there are extracurricular activities for everyone! best of luck for you all!"

For the past 9 months our startup had a social media intern building our brand awareness. She did a fantastic job but left for another career opportunity.

We've now been in a bit of a rut over the last couple of months trying to find a replacement.

Our main source of talent has been Upwork, but the last two candidates did not get the brand, our tone of voice and the imagery they used has been low quality - with the belief that it has been oursourced. 

We're totally happy for people to use Canva (as our previous intern did) but we still want it to be on brand and at a certain quality level. The new role is also not an intern position, but a part-time social media manager - as we'd like someone who has experience to restart our social and help grow our brand through regular posting, community engagement, giveaway and influencer campaigns - all with targets and results to be met.

How have you found your talent / what would you recommend?

Upwork is not working out for us as of late - would love to hear your thoughts please!"

I am joining PWC this summer as a seasonal tax intern. I am very excited about the opportunity and looking forward to the job. I have seen so many posts about the work-life of big4 that I wanted to take a minute to ask some questions.

When someone says busy season, what does that even mean? What months does the busy season fall into? In your personal experience, what have been the worst days/weeks (like most time spent in work/working) versus the easiest days/weeks? What would you say, on average, is the time you get to and leave the office for both busy and non-busy seasons? As an intern, on average, what do you think those times would be? And, due to my interest, what is your most favorite and least favorite thing about PWC? Why do you think PWC stands out amongst the big 4?

Lastly, I enjoy doing stand up comedy in my free time. I look at it as a hobby right now but still want to perform as much as possible. My jokes sway between blue (dirty humor) and clean. That being said, is there any case of employees being known to do comedy at PWC? If so, what is the company/office's opinion? I ask because I don't want to do a dirty joke on stage, risk getting seen by an employee, they say something and end up losing all hope for a return offer. On top of that, I just don't want to make the people I work with uncomfortable because I have a twisted hobby. I'm not sure, is that even rational thought? I really don't want to cut out my dirty humor because those get the biggest laughs (And I just enjoy doing them), but then again, I also want to have a career outside comedy."

I'm a rising sophomore studying computer engineering.  
  
Reasons for transferring:  
* If I did a 5-year masters, GATech has the better masters program  
* Atlanta is way nicer than College Park  
* A more engineering-focused student body?  
* Better surrounding industry (for internships)?  
* Brand name/ranking  
* Nicer campus  
  
Reasons to stay at UMD:  
* Better ECE curriculum  
* Cybersecurity minor (but GATech has cybersec threads, sooo...)  
  
I've been assured that cost is no object in my decision (I'm OOS for both anyway). Am I accurate in saying that UMD has a better ECE curriculum? I know rankings show GATech to be much higher but I've read a few posts about their program being a bit of a mess from /r/GATech. Also, it's likely I'd have to be off-campus due to being accepted after the housing deadline. I don't know if this is a problem though.  
  
I was initially set on staying at UMD but my dad brought up some of the above points. He stresses the importance of the student body and thinks I'd fit better with GATech. I'm inclined to agree because of the engineering reputation. Thoughts? Anything I haven't considered? thx"

Sorry if the title is a bit obtuse, needed to modify it to fit into the posting guidelines 

I'm in a bit of a dilemma and I'm not sure what to do. I am about to finish my [B.Tech](https://B.Tech) in CS from a decent college (read, not NIT/IIT/IIIT/BITS). I am very keen on eventually doing an MS and even possibly a PhD in CS, specializing in machine learning. 

I had applied for Fall 2021 MS admissions, and I managed to get into just one university in the US. This application was a 'safe' option, and the university is known for admitting a lot of graduate students (\~2.5K in CS alone). I spoke to some alumni, and while they had a good time there, they did comment that the huge size of the grad department caused multiple issues, especially for things like on campus placements. The place is also extremely expensive. Finally, I haven't managed to book a visa appointment slot yet, so if I need to go there, I need to really rush through these next few months. The university is not offering a guaranteed deferral, so if I don't go this year, I'll have to move my application to next year, without a guarantee of the admission decision. I can do a semester online, but online classes really don't suit me.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, I have a job offer from a very well known tech company for an SDE role.  The company itself has a great reputation, culture, and pays well, but I have zero knowledge about the role itself - I'll only know the team and the work after accepting the final offer. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some people I spoke to said that they had an easier time getting job offers and internships with prior work experience. Others said that if you apply after having work experience, your profile is going to be critiqued a lot harder, so they suggested going this year. I honestly have no idea what choice to pick. On one hand, I feel like my profile will be stronger this year so I have a chance at the universities I was hoping to get into - I just had my first paper accepted and I did a great research internship at a different company, plus my GRE and TOEFL scores will still be valid. But on the other hand, there is the dilemma of possibly not getting into any universities next year and I'm concerned I'm being too greedy.

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure what decision to take. Any guidance/experience would be greatly appreciated. If you'd like details about my profile, or the company/university, I'm happy to provide info via PM.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR - graduating in CS next month. Is it better to accept my admit at a university I am not all that keen on, or accept an offer at a company where I have no idea what kind of work I'll be doing and reapply next year?"

I need to hear that a day in the job of a developer is composed of minimal human interaction with bosses and plenty of alone time. I'm pretty sure it is but I need to hear someone say it because I find that since I am working retail, I no longer look forward to tomorrow and I need to know that this will change eventually.

Since I have not taken this course yet, would technical interviews be much more difficult for me? 

What kind of technical questions were any of you SWE interns asked in interviews, if you don't mind me asking?

I have yet to land an internship, so in the event I get an interview anything would be appreciated. Additionally, if any of you guys have any advice on what it even takes to get to the interview stage, I would greatly appreciate that as well.

I am just feeling a wave of anxiety right now for the coming future since I don't know how or if I will get an internship so I apologize for this lengthy post and the barrage of questions. I just want to be prepared the best way I can."

(no matter if you're born in the US or not, international or non international)",dreamy_in_water,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/nysblu/for_cal_students_coming_from_asian_families_do/,"I want to get some words off my chest, but also I want to see how other people in my shoes deal with the complicated relationship with their parents. Asking here not only because we all know the effect of Cal's competitiveness has on our emotional health especially when combined with other stress factors, but maybe I just want a friend from Cal who can resonate with me. 

To put it short, I am only able to come to the US and attend Cal because of my parents. However, for the past few 4 years or so, I've basically financially supported myself through student loans, part time jobs (some being really crappy restaurant jobs), scholarships, and internships as my resume gradually built up. My parents haven't given me a cent except for my first year in the states, and I'm not that mad about that--but the problem is, they have began asking me for money. Not for an emergency. Over the years they have built up debts through various channels and haven't found a stable source of income. Now it's clear that they have nowhere to borrow money anymore, and I being a Cal student in an engineering major means I will be an easy income for them to leech off. It has dawned on me that my parents want to immigrate here but before that I will have to pay their debts off or the legal processes won't allow them to do that. Another thing I have to mention is I sustained through physical and verbal abuse as a child from one of my parents. (At the same time, this parent also cared for me a lot, it is exactly a love-hate relationship) 

I have been doing therapy and while it helped me to mitigate my depression and anxiety, I still don't know if I can ever find a perfect solution for my situation. Being Asian means I'm morally obliged to filial piety, and even though my American friends will tell me to cut off with this toxic relationship with my parents, something inside of me just can't accept that idea. Even after my efforts, I realize that I get emotionally manipulated easily and I tried but still can't talk back to them or throw a tantrum at them, despite knowing that I have to grow a spine and be able to think about myself before them. 

I want to know if anyone is also having issues dealing with the expectation from your family to provide for them and being their source of income."

Will be applying next fall, graduating HS in the Class of 2023

**Demographics:** Male, Indian, private school, top 6-7 in the country, kind of a feeder, sending 20-25 kids to T20s, and 1 or 2 to Stanford, Harvard every 2 years, 2-3 to Uchicago every year, although idk anyone from the past 10 years who's gotten into Wharton (btw 80% of these ppl who get in are IB kids, but I'm ISC, so lmk if you think this makes a difference. But many say its just self-selection, since ISC kids don't wanna go abroad)

Hooks (URM, first generation, legacy, athlete, etc.): None, except sibling legacy at Uchicago

**Intended Major(s):** Finance/Economics, with a minor in CS/STAT

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:** Not given yet, but practice tests on ACT showing 35

**UW/W GPA and Rank:** School doesn't weigh, follows the ISC-ICSE system in India. School sends decile ranking, so I'm 1st decile (10%)

9th: 92.5%

10th: 95%

11th, 12th: NA, but should be 90+

**Coursework:** AP/IB/Dual Enrollment classes, AP/IB scores, etc

We don't have IB or Dual enrollment, but my subjects are:

English, Math, Accounts, Physics, Economics

APs: Macro (4)(gave this in 8th grade lol), Micro(5), Giving CompSci A, Calculus BC, Stat this year, expect   5 on comps, and either 4 or 5 on calculus and stat

**Awards:**

1. Young Entrepreneur Award 2021 given by the Indian Achiever's Forum, affiliated with the Government of India for activity #1
2. Havard Business School International Case Competition organized by (Redacted) Institute from HBS. Won Best Delegate, with a cash prize and networking sessions with HBS grads, Citi, and other corporates
3. 1st in 5 national economics and business competitions with 50+ best schools across India, but idk if they're considered prestigious cuz they were organized by other high schools as events. Pretty tough to win anyway. These were start-up pitches, stock simulations, and other economic events and competitions. these were rlly fun tho
4. National Creative Olympiad - 4th in the country, 1st in the state, and 1st in school, among 9000+ students from 800 schools (this isn't considered v prestigious tho, so lmk if you think I should put this on my app)
5. Received acceptance to Georgetown's 3-week summer Economic Policy Academy, with a scholarship - couldn't attend cuz of my school's MUN at the same time + timezone problem.
6. Cultural Badge given by my school for my extra-curriculars, winning at national and international competitions - the only student in 3 years to be given this, but there isn't any such rule that 1 student every 3 years is given, its just that I was the only one, (so how do I show this selectiveness to colleges)
7. Most likely an Ashoka Young Changemaker this year, and another national child honor i may get. (both are really prestigious, but the child honor is v unpredictable so idk about it)
8. I'm also giving quite a few finance and eco olympiads this year, plus competing in the Wharton Global Investment Challenge, so those could come up here if I win
9. Also an ASSET Talent Scholar, for top 5% percentile lol but idt it matters

**Extracurriculars:** Include leadership &amp; summer activities

1. Founder, CEO of India's largest (product redacted) dropshipping start-up. This is an initiative to help roadside (product) vendors struggling due to the pandemic with a permanent source of income. We've collaborated with numerous vendors and small businesses + a recent collab with India's largest (product) distributor. We've had roughly INR 200k in MRP sales in 3ish weeks, so expect INR 2 mil (USD 35kish) in sales this year. We've reached 40 countries in 5 continents, with 40k visitors a month, and sold 200+ of these products to date. Accumulated 500 members in these 3 weeks. Being featured in India's largest newspaper as a 'Beacon of Hope' (could I mention this in the awards?), as well as a few local newspapers. Plus I received 300+ college students from IITs as applicants for an internship at my start-up, interviewed, and selected 2. Also in talks for an angel investor, and the largest (product) seller in India has also shown interest to invest in/acquire the start-up.

2. Co-founder (1 of 3) at a consulting firm that helps non-profits, small businesses, and student-run organizations in various areas such as web development, marketing, restructuring, etc. We have 10 clients with USD 2 mil in combined revenues till now, and we've just started out, so these numbers should go up soon.
3. Founder, President at my school's investment and finance society. Started this in junior year, a few weeks ago, since my school doesn't allow us to start many clubs in general, and none in freshman/sophomore year. We are having corporate guest speakers, education sessions, and participating in competitions. I'm also hosting our very own flagship stock simulation competition, with our own computer systems. Plus competing in the Wharton Global High School Investment Challenge as Team Leader. Also launched our finance newsletter, I am Editor-in-Chief.

4. Published my research paper on the situation of migrant workers in India, in a very reputed journal, that I won't mention here to avoid being doxed. But the impact factor of the journal is pretty high, 6.64. Also presented the paper at The College of Business, University of Delhi. Was a very thorough self-researched paper of 15 pages, explaining everything from a macro and micro perspective + analyzing government stimulus.

5. Institutional Trading Intern at a small, but 100-year-old trading firm situated in the Bombay Stock Exchange. Prepared stock reports using DCF Modelling. These reports were referred to by institutional traders making trades of 100cr+ (USD 10m+) (this may sound like cap but it isn't lmao, they just glanced through my report summaries, so technically counts)

6. Active member of school Symposium (MUN) Club since 8th grade. Won 1 Best Delegate, 2 Oustanding delegate, 2 honorable mention awards, all were national and international MUNs. Additional Director of the economic committee at my school's MUN this year, which is the oldest and largest MUN in India. Going to be Director of the economic committee next year at the MUN.

7. Entrepreneurship Club. May get leadership position senior year, but this is a lil weird since normally IB students only participate in this, I'm the only ISC/ICSE student working on this. We basically organize talks from entrepreneurs, other sessions, etc. Will organize a finance, business, etc. competition this year, with students from schools all over India.

8. Active member of school Nature Club, will be President in senior year. Conducted plantation drives, sold plants in school fun fair, participated in poster-making competitions, and other environmental competitions like the ClimateScience Olympiad (selected as a semifinalist, probably not gonna be a finalist but I don't really know lmao).

9. Prefect of student body, House Captain of my house, both senior year, practically confirmed. Will conduct all inter-house events, lead a student body of 1600+ students. Maybe will place 1st or 2nd in inter-house events. I also represented my house in a lot of inter-house events, and placed in stuff like elocution, debate, etc.

10. Hindi Debates captain, Best Speaker in inter-house debates, plus gonna participate in many online debates, but this isn't too huge. But additionally, wrote scripts and acted in Independence Day, Republic day assemblies, and author for the school magazine.

11. These are my athletics. (this one's weak lol so pls give suggestions on how I can work on this) Chess Captain likely, but I'm not FIDE rated. Represented my school in the district tournaments, but also had a few chess awards when I was 5, post which I quit until 7th grade. Inter-school cricket squad, played quite a few matches, didn't place tho. Inter-house badminton, chess, etc. 1st position, plus was in the inter-school teams for these, but didn't place anywhere.

12. Donated essential products to relatives of patients at a famous hospital in my city, since 8th grade. Continued during the pandemic, provided sanitizers, etc. Also hosted a charity game night to raise money to buy sanitary pads for women through an NGO.

13. A bunch of Udemy courses on stock market, web development, etc. and CS50, Private Equity Venture Capital, etc. from Harvard and all through Coursera (did the ones I liked only, not for college)

14. Oh forgot this - a JuniorMBA certification in Business Technology from this Ed-tech company (isn't prestigious but I learnt a lottt so I was happy)

15. Karate Green Belt certification (pretty sure this doesn't matter but just put it lmao)

Things I'm planning to do:

1. A global organization that'll focus on investing, I've got this planned out, will work on it and launch before the end of this year.

2. Planning more things for the finance society (don't wanna reveal it since someone from my country could do the same earlier), but this will be pretty big, and on a country-wide scale.

3. Writing a book on a vvvvvv unique economic topic, that's very unexplored, I'm done with like 40 pages of this, but looking to write a full-length 100 page one, so will take a bit of time. But I reached out to a few professors at unis, and the idea seemed interesting to them, so I think I could get a few comments from them about the book. I also contacted a leading publisher in India, and while they liked the idea, they want to see the proper book before they decide on publishing, so that's that.

4. Will do 1 more internship in summer 2022, something related to stocks, cuz I love it

5. Summer programs - Lmk which ones yall think are useful, cuz I've heard most are cash cows.

Wharton - Leadership in the Business World

LaunchX

Notre Dame Leadership seminars

Stanford SUMAC

YYGS

Just to add - I'll be submitting college applications while I'm 16, and the age barrier is what prevented me from applying to these summer programs this year, so will hopefully get into some.

**Essays/LORs/Other:** Optionally, guess how strong these are and include any other relevant information or circumstances.

I'll begin writing in March 22, so I should be fine in essays, I've got some good topics in mind, and plus for the Uchicago quirky essay I've got a really good idea

LORs:

Economics teacher: loves me, says I'm the best student she's had, and since I took sm initiative with the finance society, she really likes that. Lmao in fact since I did macro and micro APs before junior year she says there's nothing more she can teach me (not to sound arrogant sorry), but in essence this one will be great

Accounts teacher: Accounts isn't particularly there in the US, so most of y'all wouldn't know, but its about balancesheet etc. I worked a lot with this teacher about the finance society, so she knows me very well, and will write a very good LOR for me.

3rd LOR:

Here's where I really need advice.

So what I was planning is, since I've worked with roadside vendors for my start-up, they know me and my work ethic very well, plus there's a very unique story of how I managed to convince them to trust me although I was a 15 year old kid. So their native language is hindi, so they could give some points, and a teacher or someone could translate them, as well as provide the original copy to unis. But idk whether this is a good option, so lmk what y'all think. I will of course be emailing unis also about this.

**Schools:** List of colleges, ED/EA/RD, etc

Income - $110,000

Colleges I'm currently planning for:

EA - Uchicago, with aid

RD - Wharton, Stanford - Full pay

Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stern - with fin aid

Pls give college recs, which ones I should apply to. Also about safeties - ik I'm applying only to reaches, but I have a very comfortable option in my home country, which I love too, so I'm fine with staying here. Do lmk if you have any matches/safeties in mind though? (altho probably not, since I'm an Indian male asking for aid lmaoo)

Many people think this sounds dumb and I should ED Wharton, and that it's at par with Harvard, but I really want to apply to Harvard, and Wharton going full pay will be a bit of a strain on my family, so that's the reason. Feel free to lmk your views tho.

Thank you!!"

I’ve been a developer at a great company for 8 years. I work with great people and have had a ton of opportunities to grow other skills than just coding. 

At this company, I’ve been able to expand my skill set and was able to write requirements, led 2 IT department wide initiatives, including developing a IT internship program from the ground up, functioned as a project manager, was a lead developer on 3 major projects, all while writing countless lines of code.

After 3 years of asking They still refuse to promote me to senior developer. They can’t give me and solid reasons why, and my leader just keep saying “you’re doing great, just keep doing what you’re doing” after asking for feedback for years from my leader and the other senior devs on my team. 

Pre covid, we were allowed 1 day of remote work a week. During COVID we have been remote for 15 months and I’ve grown a custom to it. Now over the next 2 months we will have to be in the office 3 days a week with 2 flex days. 

Both of those factors have left me in a position where Ive started asking around to my contacts I’ve built over the for possible openings elsewhere 

One of my very good friends told me about an IAM engineer position (Sail point)on his team he has not been able to find a good candidate fo, and he wants me to apply for. The starting pay is 15-20k more than I make now and it’s a full time remote job.

I feel some loyalty to my current company and moving jobs after 8 years is really scary.  The technology I’ll be working with is different as it’ll be an IAM job vs my current Java CMS job. 

Does anyone who made the leap to IAM have any advice on the topic?"

The one that I'm most happy with is a ""syllabi"" web app that essentially helps a studio put their curriculum online. Users can sort requirements by the Rank of the belt they're aiming for or by the Category the requirement belongs under. It can also put videos and images related to requirements behind Django's authentication system, which is something the martial arts studio I'm working with has wanted to have for a very long time.

The one that most likely belongs in r/ProgrammingHorror is my ""blackbelts"" app. It's supposed to be a Hall-of-Fame-esque app for students and instructors that have reached the highest rank in a school of martial arts. It's a small app and it does the job well enough, but some of the decisions I made when I was writing the code were NOT in best practice at all. The other two I made are waaay better in that sense.

The last one I made was an ""announcements"" app that basically let's staff members and admins post upcoming events and alerts on the site. Authenticated users can sign up for events as well which I'm happy I was able to figure out. I do feel like there must be more feature rich announcements apps that are Django apps though, so the ""syllabi"" apps is still my favorite.

It was a struggle to put these together, but it was fun building them in hindsight. At the very least, I don't think I wasted my time these past few months, but now that they're more or less finished, I'm wondering what I should do next. I feel as though the time I was allotted to work on unofficial projects has past. Now that quarantine restrictions are slowly being lifted, I'd like to focus on getting a job, but is what I've done thus far enough to get an internship or something more tangible? Should I try to find jobs on fiverr or something using what I've made?

I hope you all are doing well! :))
This is my 1st time posting in Reddit XD 

I am currently a senior in high school, and I will be attending Rutgers New Brunswick next year.

Just a bit about myself ... I have been interested in bio throughout all of high school, and I have a lot of bio experience mostly from competitions. I also like Computer Science a lot, and I have been programming projects since 7th grade. I am an honors/AP student with a decent GPA and ECs.

After undergrad, I am interested in any Bio/CS Job (ex: Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, programming Medical Devices, etc). However, if I can't find a decent-paying job in any of those fields, I am OK getting hired for a general CS Job (ex: IT, Software Engineer, etc) ... or getting a Masters, if I feel like that at the end of Undergrad :O 

So originally, I enrolled in SOE and I was intending to do a BME Major/CS Minor, and despite the low job prospects for BMEs, I had thought a Masters in BME would help me get a job. However, after reading a lot of Reddit and Quora posts, I decided to switch to SAS, and I am currently intended to do a CS Major/Biological Sciences Minor (or maybe double major in CS and Biomathematics).

I was just confused about how I should tailor my internships and ECs ... 
I have 3 Options:

1. More Bio/CS-related Internships/ECs: this would help show my interest and get a job in Bio/CS, BUT might pigeonhole me into that field, which would be detrimental if I can't find a decent-paying job in Bio/CS.

2. More general CS-related Internships/ECs: this would help me be more versatile when I go job hunting, BUT might make me seem less specialized. And when I apply for general IT jobs (assuming I can't find Bio/CS jobs), I would be nothing compared to the genius applicants who did CS all their life :O

3. A mix of Bio/CS and general CS Internships/ECs: this may be a good blend of Bio and CS, BUT might make me seem indecisive b/w those fields to employers 

Also, in regards to Bio/CS, is it better to have internships/ECs focused on a specific field of Bio/CS (ex: Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, etc), or is it fine if my internships/ECs are a mix of different general Bio and Bio/CS fields?

It would be amazing if someone could help clear my doubts ... 
You guys are SO AWESOME thanks so much!!"

(Web dev and/or Data science/ML),mr_solo_dolo01,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nz07p9/personal_project_ideasrecommendations_to_help/,"Hi all, I’m currently a rising senior in my undergrad with only 1 semester left before completing my degree in CS and math, and I unfortunately failed to swing an internship this summer. With my free time, I’ve been taking Udemy courses to build on my knowledge from my coursework and have achieved a solid base knowledge in front-end web development with React as well as building not-so complicated neural networks with TensorFlow. 

I come to ask if anyone has found themselves with a similar level of knowledge and in a similar job-searching position, and what sort of projects did you develop to demonstrate your knowledge and skills for employers? Through my udemy courses I’ve built some small projects and put them on my GitHub, but I feel like I can (and should) develop something a little more advanced if I want to earn myself a full time job.

Side note: I understand that jobs in AI/ML/Data science generally require more schooling and experience to achieve as compared to a software dev role. I’m not really anticipating some miracle project idea that will land me a dream job, just thought I would mention that I have some experience in case anyone had any guidance in that field. 

TLDR - What projects did you develop in your early dev career to help with your job search?"
nz08zu,1,2021-06-13,Problem getting internships in infosec.,Snoopdawg16007,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/nz08zu/problem_getting_internships_in_infosec/,"Hello! I'll really appreciate any answer to my questions. 
I am an Indian undergrad in 3rd year specializing in cyber security and networking and system security. I have a pretty well rounded resume with a wide array of skills, couple of projects I have developed, and I am a CEH, IBM CCSA as well as a CCNA security. In short, I have everything to make my resume stand out I would say. The problem is there is so less internships available in the field of infosec and networking in India! I never thought this country would be so negligent towards cyber sec. I applied for two on LinkedIn and got them but they were both trying to on board me instead of giving me a summer internship :3. So I denied. Then I searched for more internships (good ones from reputed companies) but to my utter disbelief I didn't get more than 3! 3 ffs. Amongst them one rejected me because I'm pretty sure they were looking for undergrad interns rather postgrad or experienced people. Hence I don't know what to do. 
Tell me something, why is there an abundance of software development/ data science jobs/internships loitering around compares to infosec/networking? It really pisses me off. 

Even when I look through full time jobs for freshers there's hardly any. Most of them look for 3-5 years of experience. And even so the pay is so less in infosec or any field remotely related to cyber security. Where as in software development or data science it's a fucking playground it seems. Even the packages are better for freshers! What is this biased nature of the industry? I don't wanna change my field because I am hooked to security :3. I find any other IT field relatively boring. 

So is an Indian cyber sec fresher doomed?"
nz0ok4,14,2021-06-13,"First year in game development degree, terrified of employment chances after graduation. What do I do?",dooomslayer,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/nz0ok4/first_year_in_game_development_degree_terrified/,"Hi everyone! I’m currently in my second semester of my first year in a game development degree. I really love all the content I study and the assessment I create, and I’m very happy in this degree.  I do very well academically and I have no concerns for my future in that regard.

However, I am terrified of my chances of getting a decent job in the games industry after I graduate. All the job listings I see want years of experience, don’t pay well, or just don’t exist. I’m not naïve and I know I’ll inevitably start out in a small fry position, but even getting my foot in the door seems impossible. 

Every now and then I consider changing to a standard IT degree, learning cybersecurity or web development, and just becoming a code monkey after I graduate. I would hate it, but it seems like I would at least have a shot at decent employment.

I want a fairly stable job or even just an internship in a bigger game company, but I have no idea how to find opportunities like that. It feels like they don’t exist. I’m so interested in narrative and world design, gameplay mechanic development, user experience testing and so many other things but i find just….nothing. I’m terrified of my future and being financially unstable.

Does anyone have any advice that isn’t the standard “go to meetups! talk to people! live laugh love!” crap you see everywhere? Should I seriously consider changing my degree while it’s still early? How should I try to find game jobs other than by frantic google searches at 3am? Do really good jobs in game development even exist?"

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the terrible grammar.

&amp;#x200B;

So some background thats probably going to be too long

\-Studying for my bachelor in informatics, i currently have 99 ec and need 11 ec to be able and do my last internship for graduation. I am doing this study accelerated, 3 years instead of 4 and now at the end of my 2nd year.

\-We(group project) flunked an assignment that we have to redo on 3 weeks. So we have 3 classes to pass in total, fail one off them and i can't graduate.

So now what happened that made me feel stuck, well something moved up the schedule a bit and suddenly i started getting sick just thinking about the new deadline. Started to gag, feel nauseous and i just didn't want to continue, i had gone over the top.

So then i contacted 2 off my teachers, one from the class and the other my mentor. Both off them said to take 3 days off which i have done, plus we talked about some general stress tips and how to deal with it, some imposter syndrome and the likes.

Well now its the end off my final 'free' day and im dreading going back into the routine, my heart is pounding with anxiety and i feel like i've lost control over it.

One off the tips i got was to define better boundries, since before i just worked worked worked and neglected the rest off my life. So one off those is a max of 8 hours of work a day. And i want to abide  to that, but i already know that when im not working im back in anxiety mode. and i hate it.

I have thought of a couple situations in my head to deal with this,

1. 8 hours a day working on it, being anxious in the evening and hopefully passing
2. more than 8 hours a day of working on it, feeling horrible, neglecting my life and also hopefully passing
3. dropping the 3 classes, pick up my life from the gutter and take the time to improve myself so next year i won't have this again.

&amp;#x200B;

These 3 days of off-time has gave me a good perspective of how bad its actually gotten. I've seen friends that i haven't seen in months, i've been able to go into nature with my dog, going out with my boat.

But tomorrow i'm going back in, back into feeling the anxiety and feeling like im not good enough, i don't want to feel that way again.

i just want to feel good about my life, and currently im just not feeling good about it.

I want to be able to get back into the gym and improve the terrible state my body is in.

I want to hang out with friends and socialise.I want to actually be able to do my hobbies without the looming fear of the next deadline."

Thank you!!

Will be applying next fall, graduating HS in the Class of 2023

**Demographics:** Male, Indian, private school, top 6-7 in the country, kind of a feeder, sending 20-25 kids to T20s, and 1 or 2 to Stanford, Harvard every 2 years, 2-3 to Uchicago every year, although idk anyone from the past 10 years who's gotten into Wharton (btw 80% of these ppl who get in are IB kids, but I'm ISC, so lmk if you think this makes a difference. But many say its just self-selection, since ISC kids don't wanna go abroad)

Hooks (URM, first generation, legacy, athlete, etc.): None, except sibling legacy at Uchicago

**Intended Major(s):** Finance/Economics, with a minor in CS/STAT

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:** Not given yet, but practice tests on ACT showing 35

**UW/W GPA and Rank:** School doesn't weigh, follows the ISC-ICSE system in India. School sends decile ranking, so I'm 1st decile (10%)

9th: 92.5%

10th: 95%

11th, 12th: NA, but should be 90+

**Coursework:** AP/IB/Dual Enrollment classes, AP/IB scores, etc

We don't have IB or Dual enrollment, but my subjects are:

English, Math, Accounts, Physics, Economics

APs: Macro (4)(gave this in 8th grade lol), Micro(5), Giving CompSci A, Calculus BC, Stat this year, expect 5 on comps, and either 4 or 5 on calculus and stat

**Awards:**

1. Young Entrepreneur Award 2021 given by the Indian Achiever's Forum, affiliated with the Government of India for activity #1
2. Havard Business School International Case Competition organized by (Redacted) Institute from HBS. Won Best Delegate, with a cash prize and networking sessions with HBS grads, Citi, and other corporates
3. 1st in 5 national economics and business competitions with 50+ best schools across India, but idk if they're considered prestigious cuz they were organized by other high schools as events. Pretty tough to win anyway. These were start-up pitches, stock simulations, and other economic events and competitions. these were rlly fun tho
4. National Creative Olympiad - 4th in the country, 1st in the state, and 1st in school, among 9000+ students from 800 schools (this isn't considered v prestigious tho, so lmk if you think I should put this on my app)
5. Received acceptance to Georgetown's 3-week summer Economic Policy Academy, with a scholarship - couldn't attend cuz of my school's MUN at the same time + timezone problem.
6. Cultural Badge given by my school for my extra-curriculars, winning at national and international competitions - the only student in 3 years to be given this, but there isn't any such rule that 1 student every 3 years is given, its just that I was the only one, (so how do I show this selectiveness to colleges)
7. Most likely an Ashoka Young Changemaker this year, and another national child honor i may get. (both are really prestigious, but the child honor is v unpredictable so idk about it)
8. I'm also giving quite a few finance and eco olympiads this year, plus competing in the Wharton Global Investment Challenge, so those could come up here if I win
9. Also an ASSET Talent Scholar, for top 5% percentile lol but idt it matters

**Extracurriculars:** Include leadership &amp; summer activities

1. Founder, CEO of India's largest (product redacted) dropshipping start-up. This is an initiative to help roadside (product) vendors struggling due to the pandemic with a permanent source of income. We've collaborated with numerous vendors and small businesses + a recent collab with India's largest (product) distributor. We've had roughly INR 200k in MRP sales in 3ish weeks, so expect INR 2 mil (USD 35kish) in sales this year. We've reached 40 countries in 5 continents, with 40k visitors a month, and sold 200+ of these products to date. Accumulated 500 members in these 3 weeks. Being featured in India's largest newspaper as a 'Beacon of Hope' (could I mention this in the awards?), as well as a few local newspapers. Plus I received 300+ college students from IITs as applicants for an internship at my start-up, interviewed, and selected 2. Also in talks for an angel investor, and the largest (product) seller in India has also shown interest to invest in/acquire the start-up.
2. Co-founder (1 of 3) at a consulting firm that helps non-profits, small businesses, and student-run organizations in various areas such as web development, marketing, restructuring, etc. We have 10 clients with USD 2 mil in combined revenues till now, and we've just started out, so these numbers should go up soon.
3. Founder, President at my school's investment and finance society. Started this in junior year, a few weeks ago, since my school doesn't allow us to start many clubs in general, and none in freshman/sophomore year. We are having corporate guest speakers, education sessions, and participating in competitions. I'm also hosting our very own flagship stock simulation competition, with our own computer systems. Plus competing in the Wharton Global High School Investment Challenge as Team Leader. Also launched our finance newsletter, I am Editor-in-Chief.
4. Published my research paper on the situation of migrant workers in India, in a very reputed journal, that I won't mention here to avoid being doxed. But the impact factor of the journal is pretty high, 6.64. Also presented the paper at The College of Business, University of Delhi. Was a very thorough self-researched paper of 15 pages, explaining everything from a macro and micro perspective + analyzing government stimulus.
5. Institutional Trading Intern at a small, but 100-year-old trading firm situated in the Bombay Stock Exchange. Prepared stock reports using DCF Modelling. These reports were referred to by institutional traders making trades of 100cr+ (USD 10m+) (this may sound like cap but it isn't lmao, they just glanced through my report summaries, so technically counts)
6. Active member of school Symposium (MUN) Club since 8th grade. Won 1 Best Delegate, 2 Oustanding delegate, 2 honorable mention awards, all were national and international MUNs. Additional Director of the economic committee at my school's MUN this year, which is the oldest and largest MUN in India. Going to be Director of the economic committee next year at the MUN.
7. Entrepreneurship Club. May get leadership position senior year, but this is a lil weird since normally IB students only participate in this, I'm the only ISC/ICSE student working on this. We basically organize talks from entrepreneurs, other sessions, etc. Will organize a finance, business, etc. competition this year, with students from schools all over India.
8. Active member of school Nature Club, will be President in senior year. Conducted plantation drives, sold plants in school fun fair, participated in poster-making competitions, and other environmental competitions like the ClimateScience Olympiad (selected as a semifinalist, probably not gonna be a finalist but I don't really know lmao).
9. Prefect of student body, House Captain of my house, both senior year, practically confirmed. Will conduct all inter-house events, lead a student body of 1600+ students. Maybe will place 1st or 2nd in inter-house events. I also represented my house in a lot of inter-house events, and placed in stuff like elocution, debate, etc.
10. Hindi Debates captain, Best Speaker in inter-house debates, plus gonna participate in many online debates, but this isn't too huge. But additionally, wrote scripts and acted in Independence Day, Republic day assemblies, and author for the school magazine.
11. These are my athletics. (this one's weak lol so pls give suggestions on how I can work on this) Chess Captain likely, but I'm not FIDE rated. Represented my school in the district tournaments, but also had a few chess awards when I was 5, post which I quit until 7th grade. Inter-school cricket squad, played quite a few matches, didn't place tho. Inter-house badminton, chess, etc. 1st position, plus was in the inter-school teams for these, but didn't place anywhere.
12. Donated essential products to relatives of patients at a famous hospital in my city, since 8th grade. Continued during the pandemic, provided sanitizers, etc. Also hosted a charity game night to raise money to buy sanitary pads for women through an NGO.
13. A bunch of Udemy courses on stock market, web development, etc. and CS50, Private Equity Venture Capital, etc. from Harvard and all through Coursera (did the ones I liked only, not for college)
14. Oh forgot this - a JuniorMBA certification in Business Technology from this Ed-tech company (isn't prestigious but I learnt a lottt so I was happy)
15. Karate Green Belt certification (pretty sure this doesn't matter but just put it lmao)

Things I'm planning to do:

1. A global organization that'll focus on investing, I've got this planned out, will work on it and launch before the end of this year.
2. Planning more things for the finance society (don't wanna reveal it since someone from my country could do the same earlier), but this will be pretty big, and on a country-wide scale.
3. Writing a book on a vvvvvv unique economic topic, that's very unexplored, I'm done with like 40 pages of this, but looking to write a full-length 100 page one, so will take a bit of time. But I reached out to a few professors at unis, and the idea seemed interesting to them, so I think I could get a few comments from them about the book. I also contacted a leading publisher in India, and while they liked the idea, they want to see the proper book before they decide on publishing, so that's that.
4. Will do 1 more internship in summer 2022, something related to stocks, cuz I love it
5. Summer programs - Lmk which ones yall think are useful, cuz I've heard most are cash cows.

Wharton - Leadership in the Business World

LaunchX

Notre Dame Leadership seminars

Stanford SUMAC

YYGS

Just to add - I'll be submitting college applications while I'm 16, and the age barrier is what prevented me from applying to these summer programs this year, so will hopefully get into some.

**Essays/LORs/Other:** Optionally, guess how strong these are and include any other relevant information or circumstances.

I'll begin writing in March 22, so I should be fine in essays, I've got some good topics in mind, and plus for the Uchicago quirky essay I've got a really good idea

LORs:

Economics teacher: loves me, says I'm the best student she's had, and since I took sm initiative with the finance society, she really likes that. Lmao in fact since I did macro and micro APs before junior year she says there's nothing more she can teach me (not to sound arrogant sorry), but in essence this one will be great

Accounts teacher: Accounts isn't particularly there in the US, so most of y'all wouldn't know, but its about balancesheet etc. I worked a lot with this teacher about the finance society, so she knows me very well, and will write a very good LOR for me.

3rd LOR:

Here's where I really need advice.

So what I was planning is, since I've worked with roadside vendors for my start-up, they know me and my work ethic very well, plus there's a very unique story of how I managed to convince them to trust me although I was a 15 year old kid. So their native language is hindi, so they could give some points, and a teacher or someone could translate them, as well as provide the original copy to unis. But idk whether this is a good option, so lmk what y'all think. I will of course be emailing unis also about this.

**Schools:** List of colleges, ED/EA/RD, etc

Income - $110,000

Colleges I'm currently planning for:

EA - Uchicago, with aid

RD - Wharton, Stanford - Full pay

Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stern - with fin aid

Pls give college recs, which ones I should apply to. Also about safeties - ik I'm applying only to reaches, but I have a very comfortable option in my home country, which I love too, so I'm fine with staying here. Do lmk if you have any matches/safeties in mind though? (altho probably not, since I'm an Indian male asking for aid lmaoo)

Many people think this sounds dumb and I should ED Wharton, and that it's at par with Harvard, but I really want to apply to Harvard, and Wharton going full pay will be a bit of a strain on my family, so that's the reason. Feel free to lmk your views tho.

Thank you!!"

I am currently about to start my second role as a software developer. My first job was working for a small startup(about 4 devs) were I was an intern. I did a lot of work there and I believe I did really well since they were always genuinely happy and even offered me a full time position. I ended up developing two brand new features for them, one of which is a very important feature of the app and that made me feel like I am doing well. I recently got offered a position from a larger company (around 100 employees). I decided to go with the larger company because there are more devs there (about 30-40 I believe) and I thought it's gonna be a better career choice for me. Now I am just staring to get scared and overwhelmed. Thoughts of underperforming and doing bad are constantly in my head and I haven't even started working with them yet. Maybe it's because I am still very junior in this industry, maybe because they use technologies I haven't used before or maybe this is just normal. Any advice for someone like me who wants to do a good job?"

I was looking for data science/ data analytics roles in tech and biotech. I’ll be a senior at a top public university next year, and will be looking for another internship after next year (I’ll be getting a masters degree after next summer if all goes to plan). I’m hoping people might have some advice to improve my search next time around…

I have a 4.0 in Computational Biology (CS, math, biology, chemistry, physics etc.)

I’ve worked in two research labs. In one, I worked on natural language processing of electronic health records. In the other lab, we are going to be imminently publishing a literature review on a new MRI imaging technique, and my next project will involve neuroscience based graph theory work.

I have other experience in the medical sector, and I make money through private tutoring when I can.

My question is, how do I land my first internship? Based on my profile I would think I’m doing pretty well other than no paid industry experience. But obviously I need to get a first industry position at some point.

I am looking for some career advise, as I am not really sure what to do at this point in my life. I went to school and have earned a dual master's degree in history and library science. 

Originally, my goal was to become either an archivist or an academic librarian. While I have some experience as an intern at a local archive, it hasn't helped me much. The field is very competitive. I was going to try and get a part time job or experience in a library, as I thought that a) I would enjoy working with people and b) the field may be more stable. However, covid was really bad in my area, and the libraries have all but closed down. I am now thinking of what to do, as I feel at a loss. I feel as though I have invested in education, but I am not sure if my two degrees were a good investment for my future. 

Thankfully, I am working now, but it is essentially a receptionist job. I like what I do, but I am not sure I want to do it for the rest of my life. I was wondering if anyone has any advice? I am thinking if I should try to find a job in a library (even though I don't really have any experience), or if I should maybe go back to school to become a teacher, or another field more practical? 

To clarify one point: I went to my local state school for my two degrees, and while the staff at my school are well educated and good people, it was an extremely ""get you in, get you out"" experience. I do not really feel comfortable reaching out to the staff in my school, as I have expressed concerns about the job market in the past, and have received very little in the way of help. This is why I am turning to the internet. Again, if anyone has gone through a similar experience, and could pas along advice on how to proceed, I would love to hear.  Thank you."

SIDE-NOTE ABOUT ME (optional read) - I do have to admit I am a bit of a procrastinator which has resulted in me not doing as much as I should have been to secure internships etc., for the past year. Also, CS and software development is not something I am super passionate about, but I would say I am pretty decent at.

I am most experienced and comfortable with Java and have recently built CV and ML programs with Python. I am learning web development (full-stack) along with mobile app development with React Native (because I want to build this one app I am a little ""passionate"" about). My question is how did people know what they wanted to do? I never thought I would want to do web development (had weird feelings about HTML and CSS), but I am trying to learn React Native and back-end to see if that is something I can enjoy as it is high in demand, along with maybe SQL (with Python). I also realize that some people learned about their current in their internships? That's why I am introducing myself to new topics to secure one.

Any feedback and help is appreciated!! (Here's a link to my [resume](https://imgur.com/a/l8VGfkk))"

I cGPA is under 2.5, I landed my dream internship. Your GPA can't get in the way if they never ask, and they probably wont. The company I'm interning for said they liked my projects, and competitive programming experience. My projects showed motivation and ability to pursue things on my own.

I also joined my schools competitive programming club, where we pretty much just do leet code/style problem. Which helped me ace the programming screenings and interviews. I also don't go to a top school, it's maybe Top 150? Top 5 in Canada?.

nz4nj7,6,2021-06-13,"Late Starter, looking for advice.",The_Mootz_Pallucci,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/nz4nj7/late_starter_looking_for_advice/,"Hi everyone

So early in life (16-24ish) I suffered from mental illness (clinical depression and anxiety \[which may be considered bipolar in my case\], marijuana/alcohol abuse) and I made really poor decisions. As a result, I missed almost all of the normal opportunities available to undergrads. I managed to get out of a great state university with a BA in Economics, albeit with a 2.47 overall GPA, and no internships or research. The closest relevant experience would be having been a teaching assistant for an intro econometrics course.

Now I am 28m working in auto insurance doing what amounts to endorsement processing and data entry for 40k/yr. 

Clearly my aspiration of being a quant is long gone. 

If it matters, I have taken courses through multivariable calculus, linear algebra, differential equations (failed), probability and statistics, econometrics, discrete math, intermediate micro/macro, financial institutions/banking, corporate finance, However, I have forgotten almost all of the finance and economics (at least from a rigorous textbook/course point of view). The math, ironically, is my strongest of the bunch.

Over the course of the pandemic I committed to learning R, Python and SQL through Datacamp and have had a great time doing so. I have heard mixed things about their offering, but I enjoy it and have learned a lot, so it's working well for me.

Even though it is unlikely I will ever be a quant, I would like to get as close as I can. So I recently decided that in addition to what I have learned about programming, statistics, machine learning, and data science, I need to learn some real financial modeling.

I have come across Breaking Into Wall Street and Corporate Financial institute as two potential providers of such knowledge and skills. I need to convince employers that I am serious about making a 'transition' (if we can call it that, it may be more of a really late start).

From BIWS, I am looking at their premium program here: [https://breakingintowallstreet.com/biws/biws-premium/](https://breakingintowallstreet.com/biws/biws-premium/)

From CFI, I am looking at two of their programs here: 

FMVA: [https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/certifications/financial-modeling-valuation-analyst-fmva-program/](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/certifications/financial-modeling-valuation-analyst-fmva-program/) and

 CMSA: [https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/certifications/capital-markets-securities-analyst-cmsa/](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/certifications/capital-markets-securities-analyst-cmsa/)

CFI's FMVA and BIWS both look comprehensive, from their introductions to Excel up through modelling and valuation. As a result, I am sort of 50/50. I think that after I complete one of these programs I would like to work through the CFI CMSA if I have not landed a role this domain.

My target starting salary is in the range of 60-75k which I think is fair given my lack of finance experience and presence of data analysis in Python and R, as well as SQL.

Questions for you guys: 

1) Does this sound like a good plan? Am I totally delusional? Am I down for the count?

2) If you have completed any of these programs or have knowledge of them, what would you recommend or advise?

3) If you have any general comments, remarks, or advice, please share!

\*\*Note on graduate school: Given my GPA and financial situation (50k student loan debt), I do not see graduate school as a viable option until I am earning far more money than I am now, unless an employer would sponsor/reimburse. Even then, my GPA being low forces me to retake certain courses such as linear algebra, calc 3, and probablility/stats, then study and take the GRE/GMAT and go from there for an MS in stats, econometrics, QF (as if), or an MBA.\*\*

Thank you all very much for your time and any words you offer, even if they're harsh."

nz5dp1,575,2021-06-13,Any companies hiring based on problem-solving tests rather than LeetCode tests?,lifethrownaway-_-,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nz5dp1/any_companies_hiring_based_on_problemsolving/,"Heya,

I'm a physicist at NASA and I'm considering a career change due to my overall unhappiness/boredom. I realize that the part of my job that I enjoy the most is writing code and analyzing data, and that I spend about 80% of my time doing stuff other than that. I don't care so much about the general academia lifestyle such as writing papers, going to conferences (other than for the free beer), listening to seminars, etc. I just want to code and do something with data.

However, given that it's been literally 15 years since I took algorithms &amp; data structures class there's likely a big mountain to climb to grind the basic algo questions to pass the relevant screening. I don't care about salary as much as some others in this field. I currently make $85k in a HCOL city (this is with 15 years experience of writing code, and a STEM PhD), so presumably even a lower tier company would be able to exceed this. Due to how NASA works there's very little room for advancement (for several reasons I'm not going to get a civil servant position anytime soon, so I'm bound by the crappy contractor payscales).

What I care about the most is being able to work on something relatively interesting and just use my brain muscles. During my 20s I did a summer internship at an AI startup and I really loved that given that we were just trying to figure out stuff that nobody had done yet, but I haven't followed any of the developments in that field for ages so I don't think that's necessarily the most realistic option for me at the moment. I have a wife and a young kid so I do value a reasonable work-life balance (which also limits the amount of time I'm ideally planning to spend on interview prep).

Any ideas would be welcome. I'm not all that familiar with the different types of companies hiring SWE/DS types but from what I've gathered is that FAANG requires a lot of prep for their interviews rather than testing non-preppable cognitive skills, so that's probably not for me."

I took the only AP offered by my school for 10th grade this yr - AP World History - and have an A in it (though we have to argue our grade so ig I'll see whether I get an A or B? If u get a B in an AP course it gets bumpd) and have had A's in every other class I've taken this yr. I didn't take the AP test for it this yr bc I've been having mental health struggles and didn't want to pay for it, will pay for my tests next yr. Wasn't sure if it mattered or not. I had all A's in freshman yr too with the exception of Geometry, wherein I had a B second semester. I'm signed up for AP English, AP Statistics, and AP Biology for junior yr alongside Spanish 3 and normal History (non-AP - I was initially signed up for the AP version but decided I didn't want to kill myself lol.)

I do think that I want to go into the medical field, am leaning toward nursing but feel like I haven't really had enough time to explore...? Am thinking i want medical field doe. I am mostly looking for advice on college apps, on how to cope w junior yr, etc. I know that the seniors had a v tough yr college-wise due to the pandemic and imagine that the juniors will unfortunately maybe have a tough yr too, even though it might be a bit better? I also need to know whether or not I'll have to take the SAT/ACT, I imagine I will bc I'm Class of 2023?

I'll list off my extracurriculars too if it helps:

\-Co founder of youth activist org in my city, am senior member and help lead one of our committees. We have over 2,000 followers on Instagram and planned protests last summer/plan protests. Have had some drama w one or two org members which made me consider quitting but I have ultimately decided that I actually, def won't. We started our work last summer (summer of 2020.)

\-I am also co-president of our youth activist club that we started at school to ensure we get people volunteer hours and summer opportunities. Started club this yr.

\-Completed Nursing Workshop (that is moreso geared toward college students but they let me in lol) and received a certificate (idk if my parents lost the certificate or not, it was virtual and during COVID so ig I could email the guy and ask for one again...? But I did learn a lot abt nursing)

\-Did track in freshman yr, wasn't able to really go far w it bc of COVID cutting our season short. Didn't do it this yr due to COVID fears. Intend on doing it next yr but might not be able to bc I'll need to be vaccinated and my mom is really weird abt the COVID vaccine, kind of up in the air, I do want to do it though?

\-I was president of BSU this yr but wasn't voted in, was appointed by club advisor. Have decided to not do it next yr even though I was also apart of it in freshman yr just bc there's some resentment there due to having had interpersonal drama w another co-president (due to me doing all of the work) and with our Treasurer, who has always bullied me even though I did her job for her

\-Am a part of summer program Girls Inc, joined it summer before my freshman yr. Have a job shadowing opportunity this summer - opportunities are volunteering at pre-school (which I wanted but might not be able to get bc my mom doesn't want me to get vaccinated,) and journalism opportunity (which I actually really don't want, is it going to kill my like chances?)

\- I want a nursing internship but probs won't be able to get that until next summer :( Everyone said I can't do it this yr bc of COVID

\-Was on racism sub committee appointed by City Council representatives to make suggestions for City Council

\-Am part of Youth Advisory Board, we work with SBHC to teach students about health-related topics. I did it this yr but it's on Mondays and \*might\* conflict w another extracurricular I have for next yr? I did enjoy it this yr and think I want to next yr, I joined this yr but it admittedly felt different than it might normally bc of COVID?

\-I was School Site council rep for my grade this yr, worked w the principal, was voted in by peers

\-Was nominated by BSU club advisor to do something called Martin Luther King Jr. Freedom Center and actually do like attend the meetings? They offer leadership seminars on certain days of the week, it seems interesting and you do it over summers too.

I want to do more actually for junior yr but can someone help and give me advice?"
nz69vh,1,2021-06-13,Eager for a career change. What do you recommend based on what I want and don’t want?,concerneddogmom,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/nz69vh/eager_for_a_career_change_what_do_you_recommend/,"**About me:**

I’m in the process of changing my career. I graduated in 2017 with a degree in Entrepreneurship in San Francisco, CA. I now live in Los Angeles and am open to moving. I am known for having a lot of ideas, which I am proactive about and quick to initiate, but I often get lost in the details bc I try to do things perfectly the first time, and then I get distracted with a new project or life comes up and I don't follow through to the end or circle back to finish it. My career, as of now, is a means to an end. I don't necessarily need or expect it to pertain to my degree. Its purpose is to pay for my expenses and be straightforward and predictable so that I can have the time, energy, and money to support my family and fund my dream business in the future. My north star is to own and run a recreation center that also functions as a music venue. 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**My work history:**

During college, I began pursuing internships, volunteer opportunities, and jobs that would bring me closer to my goal, like how to create programming that supports and engages the community. I freelanced in the event industry as an event coordinator for 8 years, while also exploring the nonprofit world of arts, music, and education with experience in sales, marketing, project management, recruitment, operations and accounting, and teaching. Because of the nature of work, all of my jobs were independent contractor gigs or part-time. I enjoyed it and learned a lot, but it was ultimately unsustainable for me and I wouldn’t do it again unless I could be my own boss and determine my workload and salary. 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**About my lists:**

I want to keep my options open and I have a gut feeling that I’m not thinking big and broad enough about what’s out there. So instead of boxing myself into one industry and because I’ve had a lot of time to think about this while unemployed all quarantine, I wrote down what I want and don’t want from my job. I certainly don’t expect a job to check off every single box, so these are roughly in priority order. I also recognize that most of these things pertain more to how a company is run, but I imagine some of them are also cultural norms in an industry.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**I do NOT want...**

1. An unpredictable schedule, and consequently an inconsistent paycheck, both in amount and regularity
2. Things to fall apart if I’m gone for one day / the unspoken pressure to never take a day off or to work on my day off so nothing/nobody else falls behind
3. No work/life balance: unclear boundaries, the expectation to work or communicate outside of office hours, especially under the guise of “unlimited vacation / PTO”, the need to take work home (whether it’s implied, explicit, or is the cultural norm)
4. To give or be expected to give 110% of my time, effort, or energy / the expectation that my job is my top priority and that I will drop everything for it
5. A company or workload that is unstructured: no foundation or procedures to build upon,  undefined tasks, no deadlines
6. To be in a capitalist-driven environment (profits first) that treats their staff poorly (e.g., unfair compensation, no compassion)
7. To be at or near the top of the hierarchy: too much pressure and too many decisions
8. A sales job -- I don’t want to have to convince anyone to buy or do anything
9. A marketing job: similar to sales and it feels manipulative to me
10. Only qualitative / immeasurable goals for me to reach
11. To jump through hoops just to take a day off or move my hours around as needed
12. Zero support, guidance, or mentorship from my colleagues or superiors

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**I DO want…**

1. A predictable schedule and consistent paycheck in both amount and regularity -- can be salaried or hourly
2. To be able to take a sick day without stopping the workflow of others, causing the whole operation to fall apart, or being expected to still work from home
3. Work/home life balance: low stakes/pressure role, clear boundaries, workday starts and ends at the same time every day, I’m only available and communicative during my hours, no work to take home, flexible hours 
4. A workplace / boss that understands that I have other priorities and responsibilities outside of my job -- my job will never come first
5. A structured company and workload: policies and procedures already in place, tasks assigned to me and clearly laid out about what I need to accomplish, I only need to make decisions about how I schedule my day and meet my deadlines
6. Clear and regular communication of expectations, opportunities, feedback, and measurable goals
7. Benefits (in order of priority): medical, therapy, dental, PTO, sick days, maternity leave, commute compensation/reimbursement
8. A human-centered environment that does community and/or justice-focused work
9. Remote work or a short commute
10. To write, research, compile resources, share important information
11. Administrative duties (e.g., filing, making/improving systems, backend) 
12. Some interaction with people / relationship building, even if it’s just with my colleagues
13. Support, guidance, or mentorship from my colleagues/superiors for growth in and out of the workplace; they are understanding and supportive of my goals, even if it doesn’t benefit the company
14. Opportunities to learn new skills (e.g., on-the-job training, courses, skillshare)
15. Coworkers with similar values and vision for the world

**Based on these lists, what industry or job title do you recommend I explore? What should I definitely avoid?**"
nz71sf,3,2021-06-13,last second internship opportunity - advice appreciated!!,M_E_E_N_B_e_a_n,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/nz71sf/last_second_internship_opportunity_advice/,"In a last second opportunity to get an internship this summer after not getting one, here's the **situation:**

I (senior mech eng) was unable to get an internship this summer, but recently came across a pretty small company in a nearby city that I am actually very interested in based on the work they do.  I am trying hard to make the best out of this last chance opportunity. Here's a **timeline:**

**1 month ago** \- short call with their HR manager to briefly discuss company and if they are still hiring for this summer, emailed HR manager resume and project portfolio with relevant and diverse projects. HR manager said it will be forwarded to COO for review (edit: this was an internship posting they had on their website, not a cold call)

**2 weeks ago -** email follow up with HR manager and was told they are still waiting to hear back from COO and will let me know as soon as they hear back.

**Current thought process:** I am a little worried that since this is a small company and they still don't have their interns selected halfway through summer, it might not be a priority for them anymore.  I want to follow up one more time with something to show my genuine interest and that I will be worth their time.  A few ideas I had are:

* (since I am out of town and had my location on my resume) let them know what I have family that lives close to their office that I can stay at so that commute/relocation would be super easy for me
* ask about possibility an in-person visit or tour of their office
* just another simple follow up email expressing my interest and how I will do everything I can to learn and add value to their company

What do you think I should do in this situation?  Are any of these ideas too desperate, should I just wait to hear back from them?  Should I keep following up to show my interest?  All feedback welcome!"

Not only because everyone procrastinates, but because I feel like I “could” do everything anyway, but it just feels like running across hot coals instead of walking. I’ve had periods in my life where I’ve been focused night and day for weeks, where, if anything, my attention problems ironed out all of the little flaws in my academic work that made me get basically a 4.0 in u.s terms. 
But on the other hand,now at my first serious internship, my coworkees are already mad at me for not finishing a simple excel, and i am forced to work weekends to compensate for my bullshit.
Almost everyone i know tells me that “i just want adderall,everyone wants adderall”, but i just want to sit down and work instead of going on to reddit like i am doing now.
From personal experience, ive also veen diagnosed with depression but I chose not to take the meds and “fix” me myself and it worked. I am genuinely truly happy, and if anything i have a sick sense of pride where i feel like yeah i did all of this and I cant focus on a lecture for more than 5 minutes. I also have  fear of becoming dependant on drugs or having my personality be altered, which is why i didnt take the depression meds.
I just wanted to know whether there are adhd people who share these feeelings with me and that i am not totally of base."

I kind of set a summer schedule for myself to basically learn and solidify my foundation by myself. 

My question is what's the most efficient way to properly learn data structures and algorithms in 2 weeks (starting from today, since my summer just started)? Because obviously I've taken that course 2 years ago but I feel like I have a horrible foundation. My next thing on my schedule after self-learning (for 2 weeks) it all again is to read and do CTCI problems for a couple weeks and then go crazy on leetcoding for 1 1/2 months. By then it will already be early-to-mid September (basically the end of my summer), and that's when I want to start applying for New Grad jobs, and I want to be fully prepared for that. Keep in mind I'll be doing a fulltime internship so I'll only have like 3-4 hours PER DAY to myself to do all of this. Feel free to PM me too! Also, if you have a better schedule than mine, please let me know. 

Oh also, I'm already enrolled in that online course on Udemy, ""Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms by Andrei Neagoie""

Thank you!!"
nz9kht,0,2021-06-13,Should I give up? Job search is 14 months and counting...,CarrotCorn,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nz9kht/should_i_give_up_job_search_is_14_months_and/,"I can't even concentrate on the task at hand. I feel that every time I'm trying to learn, I can't get the thought out of my head that this is a massive waste of time.   


About me, I'm 27, no degree, only a certificate in web development. I took a 10 month bootcamp that is basically a 2 year diploma's worth of information. I graduated in may of 2020, since I've been looking for a job, and immediately after I graduated I looked for a job. The school I went to would have at the least given me SOME networking ability with companies since the last month was basically an internship where the majority of people that graduated with 85% or greater would(me) land a job, or at least they said. Anyways, covid fucked that up and instead of having a month, working with people hiring in my area, we did ""industry projects"", working in a team making mock applications. I was in a team and we made a doctor's office check in application. I did the majority of the front-end and it was good, I feel accomplished.   


Basically I've been just stumbling along doing random projects to bolster my portfolio, trying to learn new things, hone my react front-end skills, but recently I've just hit a massive wall because it seems all for naught. I'd be a plumber or some tradesman if I could, but a sports injury has me relegated to a desk job (I can't stand for more than a few hours at a time). I feel like a complete failure. I still fuck up very basic code. TBH I can barely do the easiest questions on leetcode. When should I cut my losses and just do something else. I can't tell if this is just some funk I'm in or if this is legit. I used to really enjoy coding, but now I detest it. I'm not looking to get rich. More than anything, I just wanna put my education to use. I've applied to hundreds of positions, I've been to a few virtual job fairs that had me in contact with some hiring teams, and the closest thing I've been offered is a single unpaid internship  and I didn't even get that because of the time it took me to answer the whiteboard questions(it was some unroll array thing that I did solve, but took me a couple hours too long).   


I'm no stranger to hard work. I've fucked my life up pretty hard in my early 20's with a fentanyl and xanax addiction on two separate occasions. I felt like this would get my life on track since in the beginning I felt this was a solid career path since I felt I had an actual aptitude for code, but now, I wanna just jump in front of a truck.  I have never felt so fucking helpless, and I've gone cold turkey on the most hardcore opiate available. I willing to grind through it, but I can't help but think that what I'm feeling is a sign that I should give up. It has been close to 14 months looking for a job, and everyday I work on something, apply, and don't hear back, gives me more reason to say fuck it."

I don't know if I'm just not smart enough or if I should start with something smaller then make my way up?

My question would be what do you guys recommend? I'm really trying to get super comfortable in python because I'm a rising junior right now and I will be applying for internships in 3 months, so I at least want some projects in my resume with python and want to be comfortable enough to where I can take the coding interview in python as well.

Sorry for the long post and thank you for reading :)


Edit: Thank you all who gave me tips and recommended different approaches. I'm glad this community is so willing to help others.

Turns out I had given myself a mental block, once I sat down and after reading a couple comments of encouragement from yall I decided to start coding and was able to come up with a brute force. From then I kept of breaking it down like most recommended and was able to see what I was getting confused on. Turns out I have to look back at algorithms."

I haven't landed a long term job quite yet. 

Out of curiosity, I was looking for some information on which is more valuable on a resume: Job Experience or Internship?

I haven't gotten an internship. However, I've had been working in the IT field for ~2 years now. They were extensive IT contracts that I got.

The IT contracts gave me a ton of Corporate IT experience. I definitely learned a lot. The managers there even treated it like an internship for me, so I received even more knowledge than my other coworkers. 

My question is this: Should I put on my resume that I had these positions as a ""job"", or should I say that they were internships? Which one would be more valuable? I used to think that having on-the-job experience is more valuable than an internship, but I am now second guessing this logic. Internship is a real keyword it seems.

Any thoughts or suggestions?"
nzflgp,1,2021-06-14,How experienced am I in terms of career?,Nut_Flush,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nzflgp/how_experienced_am_i_in_terms_of_career/,"I graduated at the end of 2019 with relatively quantitative degree that isn't mathematics and computer science, although I've forgotten 90% of the maths/stats but I do know how most regressions work, at least at the high level. 

I've done one internship that lasted 9 months and I became relatively decent at SQL, with some exposure to Python and R. 

At my current job, I've been more hands on with R and Python, and I was wondering where I stand in terms of experience, especially since I've been here for almost two years. 

Currently:

SQL - I've used SQL extensively, especially during my internship. I've applied some of the more advanced functions like window functions into my scripts, as well as regex and CTE's. I've also used SQL in R and Python using ODBC, as well as create/update tables into our PROD, doing some very basic testing such as finding duplicates using row counts. However, I don't optimise my SQL queries (I haven't needed to). 

Python- My first script was a webscraping script that scraped an entire catalogue off a large retailer website but that took over a week for me to write. Since then, I've used Selenium to scrape a few other simple websites for data collection as well as some basic ML (less than 150 lines) models that I shadowed from Kaggle. I know how all the basic things like functions/loops work for Python but outside of that, I don't have much experience to add. I'm also aware of what data structures are just from reading about them, but I wouldn't say I have a strong grasp of what they are, compared to a compsci graduate. Lastly, I did a course on OOP just for interest, but I've yet to use it.

R - Similar to Python, I've written my own ML code for fun, but nothing spectacular, mainly just googling and cherry picking things off the internet. I've created my own package as well, although it's very generic and was only something that I did to understand how packages worked. Most of my R work right now entails SQL to Excel automation, which I'm decent at, thanks to the various ODBC packages that R has. I'm also learning to wrap my code into functions, although most of my scripts are still just the one R file. I'm also trying to get around functional R programming.

Aside from this, I've also used Tableau for a couple of months and I use Git relatively often, mainly just to push/commit code into my teams repository. 

Could someone let me know how I'm going in terms of experience, what to aim for next and gaps that I need to fill?

Thanks!"

Normally I am just turned off by the take-home assignments if the submission is longer than a day like you take your personal time, put some effort into doing it and some companies have literally ghost after that.

My question here , is it just this employer's expectation, or do you have to put maximum effort and go well above and beyond the expectations when it comes to take-home assignments all the time? I was under the impression that as long as you solve all the requirements it should be fine but I want to correct myself if I am wrong."

So If I do all of this, will I find it easier to find a job at one of these firms. Like I don't mind applying for something like 150 positions, as long as I get a few replies. Do you think this is possible?

We've collaborated with numerous vendors and small businesses + a recent collab with India's largest (product) distributor. We've had roughly INR 200k in MRP sales in 3ish weeks, so expect INR 2 mil (USD 35kish) in sales this year. We've reached 40 countries in 5 continents, with 40k visitors a month, and sold 200+ of these products to date. Accumulated 500 members in these 3 weeks.

3. Founder, President at my school's investment and finance society. Started this in junior year, a few weeks ago, since my school doesn't allow us to start many clubs in general, and none in freshman/sophomore year. We are having corporate guest speakers, education sessions, and participating in competitions. I'm also hosting our very own flagship stock simulation competition, with our own computer systems. Plus competing in the Wharton Global High School Investment Challenge as Team Leader. Also launched our finance newsletter, I am Editor-in-Chief.

5. Institutional Trading Intern at a small, but 100-year-old trading firm situated in the Bombay Stock Exchange. Prepared stock reports using DCF Modelling. These reports were referred to by institutional traders making trades of 100cr+ (USD 10m+) (this may sound like cap but it isn't lmao, they just glanced through my report summaries, so technically counts)
6. Active member of school Symposium (MUN) Club since 8th grade. Won 1 Best Delegate, 2 Oustanding delegate, 2 honorable mention awards, all were national and international MUNs. Additional Director of the economic committee at my school's MUN this year, which is the oldest and largest MUN in India. Going to be Director of the economic committee next year at the MUN.
7. Entrepreneurship Club. May get leadership position senior year, but this is a lil weird since normally IB students only participate in this, I'm the only ISC/ICSE student working on this.

8. Active member of school Nature Club, will be President in senior year. Conducted plantation drives, sold plants in school fun fair, participated in poster-making competitions, and other environmental competitions like the ClimateScience Olympiad (selected as a semifinalist, probably not gonna be a finalist but I don't really know lmao).
9. Prefect of student body, House Captain of my house, both senior year, practically confirmed. Will conduct all inter-house events, lead a student body of 1600+ students. Maybe will place 1st or 2nd in inter-house events. I also represented my house in a lot of inter-house events, and placed in stuff like elocution, debate, etc.
10. Hindi Debates captain, Best Speaker in inter-house debates, plus gonna participate in many online debates, but this isn't too huge. But additionally, wrote scripts and acted in Independence Day, Republic day assemblies, and author for the school magazine.
11. These are my athletics. (this one's weak lol so pls give suggestions on how I can work on this) Chess Captain likely, but I'm not FIDE rated.

13. A bunch of Udemy courses on stock market, web development, etc. and CS50, Private Equity Venture Capital, etc. from Harvard and all through Coursera (did the ones I liked only, not for college)
14. Oh forgot this - a JuniorMBA certification in Business Technology from this Ed-tech company (isn't prestigious but I learnt a lottt so I was happy)
15. Karate Green Belt certification (pretty sure this doesn't matter but just put it lmao)

Things I'm planning to do:

1. A global organization that'll focus on investing, I've got this planned out, will work on it and launch before the end of this year.
2. Planning more things for the finance society (don't wanna reveal it since someone from my country could do the same earlier), but this will be pretty big, and on a country-wide scale.
3. Writing a book on a vvvvvv unique economic topic, that's very unexplored, I'm done with like 40 pages of this, but looking to write a full-length 100 page one, so will take a bit of time. But I reached out to a few professors at unis, and the idea seemed interesting to them, so I think I could get a few comments from them about the book. I also contacted a leading publisher in India, and while they liked the idea, they want to see the proper book before they decide on publishing, so that's that.
4. Will do 1 more internship in summer 2022, something related to stocks, cuz I love it
5. Summer programs - Lmk which ones yall think are useful, cuz I've heard most are cash cows.

Wharton - Leadership in the Business World

LaunchX

Notre Dame Leadership seminars

Stanford SUMAC

YYGS

Just to add - I'll be submitting college applications while I'm 16, and the age barrier is what prevented me from applying to these summer programs this year, so will hopefully get into some.

**Essays/LORs/Other:** Optionally, guess how strong these are and include any other relevant information or circumstances.

I'll begin writing in March 22, so I should be fine in essays, I've got some good topics in mind, and plus for the Uchicago quirky essay I've got a really good idea

LORs:

Economics teacher: loves me, says I'm the best student she's had, and since I took sm initiative with the finance society, she really likes that. Lmao in fact since I did macro and micro APs before junior year she says there's nothing more she can teach me (not to sound arrogant sorry), but in essence this one will be great

Accounts teacher: Accounts isn't particularly there in the US, so most of y'all wouldn't know, but its about balancesheet etc. I worked a lot with this teacher about the finance society, so she knows me very well, and will write a very good LOR for me.

3rd LOR:

Here's where I really need advice.

So what I was planning is, since I've worked with roadside vendors for my start-up, they know me and my work ethic very well, plus there's a very unique story of how I managed to convince them to trust me although I was a 15 year old kid. So their native language is hindi, so they could give some points, and a teacher or someone could translate them, as well as provide the original copy to unis. But idk whether this is a good option, so lmk what y'all think. I will of course be emailing unis also about this.

**Schools:** List of colleges, ED/EA/RD, etc

Income - $110,000

Colleges I'm currently planning for:

EA - Uchicago, with aid

RD - Wharton, Stanford - Full pay

Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stern - with fin aid

Pls give college recs, which ones I should apply to. Also about safeties - ik I'm applying only to reaches, but I have a very comfortable option in my home country, which I love too, so I'm fine with staying here. Do lmk if you have any matches/safeties in mind though? (altho probably not, since I'm an Indian male asking for aid lmaoo)

Many people think this sounds dumb and I should ED Wharton, and that it's at par with Harvard, but I really want to apply to Harvard, and Wharton going full pay will be a bit of a strain on my family, so that's the reason. Feel free to lmk your views tho.

Just gonna add this here -  people think I’m overworking myself and not enjoying HS - believe me, that’s not the case. I facetime my friends for like 4 hours every night, and play sm PC + phone games, so I’m enjoying HS a lot. It’s just that I was lucky to not be affected by the pandemic sm, so I could do a lot of stuff that I liked. 

Thank you!!"
nzjzpl,5,2021-06-14,Conflict in skills vs interest - Mediocre in technical skills but good soft skills,ENGTA01,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/nzjzpl/conflict_in_skills_vs_interest_mediocre_in/,"Hi everyone :)

So, I have a bit of a weird ""problem"". I'm currently a mix of data analyst and project manager on a financial services company. Whenever I'm doing the technical work like coding (SQL and VBA mostly) or deep diving the data I really enjoy it, but the problem comes because I'm not really good at it. I'm mediocre at best. However the project management side (communication, stakeholder engagement, translating requirements, documentation, timelines...) I don't really enjoy, but I'm consistently praised for it and I don't want to brag but I do think I have a certain talent for it.

So my question is, should I invest more on my technical skills? Or leverage my aptitude to PM and soft skills to drive my careers towards these positions, even though I don't really like the role? Play to my strengths and soldier through my career or run against the wind to do something I enjoy more? I am thinking about doing either an MBA (if I decide to go the PM/business route) or a MSc (if I decide to invest in the technical skills), so this decision is quite important to me.

Bit more info about me: late 20s, around 4 years of experience and 1.5 year as an intern (5.5 in total). Half of the experience is in a not really pertinent role (supply chain management). Bachelor in chemical engineering from an unknown university in the European job market (although it is top 3 in my country), self taught coding skills.  Definitely not satisfied with current salary (30k EUR in Spain) but I don't want to be a millionaire or anything if it comes by sacrificing work-life balance.

Thanks in advance for the help 😊"

I want to apply for 2022 quant trading/reasearch internships. My current grade is 2:1 (68%), I'd say there's about 50% chance that it will improve once I get results for summer exams and very low chance of it falling below 2:1. I've also recently started doing a python course, I don't know Python enough to put it on my CV yet, but I believe it might change after a month.

So do you think that it's worth for me to wait or should I apply for the internships now?

Edit: I'll also add that I've worked with R for the past year in my econometrics course so I have R in my CV.

Many thanks in advance for all help!"
nzm4rh,3,2021-06-14,Help to understand Vdsat value in analog circuits design,gvevance,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/nzm4rh/help_to_understand_vdsat_value_in_analog_circuits/,"I am a final year undergrad in Electrical engineering with a focus in analog IC design. I have also done a course on Digital IC design where I was introduced to the idea of velocity saturation in minimum ( and lower ) channel length mosfets. As I am relearning some of my Analog IC courses, I have noticed that my professor wrote Vdsat to denote the VDS headroom that you need to allocate for a mosfet to remain in saturation and used this “Vdsat” in several common mode ranges expressions. I have done an internship in which the input transistors in a fairly low GBW opamp were biased in the subthreshold  area.

What I don’t understand is : what is Vdsat in the case of subthreshold biasing. Is this at all related to the Vds beyond which a mosfet goes into velocity saturation ? 
Or does Vdsat refer simply to Vgs-Vth? 

I feel the Vdsat concept is more applicable to the cases where mosfets are biased at moderate or strong inversion but I can’t get around the feeling that I’m missing something fundamental. 

Thanks in advance."

I wanted to do something with security but they said as of now they have no security fixes that are urgent. So i was wondering if it would be okay to ask my manager to see if I could be switched to different department more focused in security, risk, or UX.

Many people think this sounds dumb and I should ED Wharton, and that it's at par with Harvard, but I really want to apply to Harvard, and Wharton going full pay will be a bit of a strain on my family, so that's the reason. Feel free to lmk your views tho.

 Just gonna add this here - people think I’m overworking myself and not enjoying HS - believe me, that’s not the case. I facetime my friends for like 4 hours every night, and play sm PC + phone games, so I’m enjoying HS a lot. It’s just that I was lucky to not be affected by the pandemic sm, so I could do a lot of stuff that I liked. And I decided that I wanna go to the US like 4 months ago, so my activities weren't done keeping in mind colleges, just to lyk.

PS: Other people have said that since I have a lot of ECs, it'll look like I didn't do anything in-depth. But in fact, I wouldn't have received the recognition I did for my start-up and research paper if I hadn't invested a lot of time and work in it - how do you recommend I can show this to colleges?

Thank you!!"
nzmw5h,2,2021-06-14,Seeking help (my story),Ih8myselfYEP,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/nzmw5h/seeking_help_my_story/,"It’s going to be a long read, and English is not my native language so excuse me if I make some mistakes. (25 years old male)

I’ve stuttered for a while when I was a kid, but then it disappeared. At school I had no problems with stuttering, and I had good grades, taking places in Olympiads (contests for math, chess, languages… etc.) and everything. There was even a “contest” for reading fast and I was pretty good at it. 

Until about the 7th or 8th grade (let’s define my school starting from 1st till 12th grade, then going to university), everything was fine, I loved school, was like a pretty popular guy… etc. Except I always ran into troubles, because of my “arrogant” (not sure if it’s the right word here) attitude. I was very cheeky with teachers, making jokes during the class, maybe laughing with other children… etc. Basically nothing over the line in most cases, usual childish attitude. But because of that, I often had bad “behaviour marks” and my parents were also sometimes called to school because of that.

So in the 8th grade, after my dad came to school once in a morning because I made a bad joke to the woman who washes the floors in the school (I don’t know the right word for it), he was so sick of my bad behaviour I guess, that before leaving to work and me for classes, he slapped me (on the cheek). I remember that slap was very strong and unexpected for me. It caught me off guard. And he did it with much… despise I’d say. Luckily if was during classes so nobody was in the hallways and nobody saw it, except 1 teacher, that stepped in to take me away and she told my dad that what he did is not right at all. 

I went to my class, terrified, and with my face half red from the slap. It was a language class. The teacher didn’t really like me (because I was too cheeky) so she asked me to read something from the book. And that is the first time I remember stuttering in my adult life. For me, in my mind, that’s the root of my stuttering. I started reading, stuttered and at the end she made a joke referencing my stuttering and everyone laughed. It wasn’t pleasant, especially since I was still in shock from what happened in the hallway and everything. 

Since that moment, I developed a fear of reading something out loud to people. I didn’t realize this at the time. But I began stuttering and completely blocking my speech when I had to read something. My heart would beat fast, breathing would intensify, intensive sweating… etc. almost like having a panic attack each time I had to read something in school. This, of course, completely demolished my self-esteem in front of my class. I was a pretty confident person before that, but after stuttering each time I read something, I felt like a joke in front of everyone. So it was a vicious cycle, I stuttered, that crushed my self-esteem and stressed me even more, that made me stutter and stress even more.

Around that time, I got a girlfriend that I really didn’t deserve. She actually fell in love with me before I started stuttering, when I was a normal cool boy at school. She was very supportive with me, kind and gentle. She noticed my stuttering and everything, but didn’t know what it was or why was it happening. Even I didn’t know at that time what the f. was going on with me. She knew that it was bothering me very much, but I didn’t want to talk about it, because it was my biggest weakness. I didn’t want to look weak for her. Nevertheless, she was supporting me how she could (holding my hand under the table when I was stuttering during class for example), because she really loved me and I loved her back in return. I loved her more than myself or my family. My parents were often arguing at the time, during evenings, maybe even at night. So I heard them before falling asleep often. I was only thinking about 1 thing. To faster get to finish school, 12th grade, and leave to another country with my girlfriend. 

To summarize, my last 4 years of school were hell for me. I never wanted to go school, I sometimes skipped classes that certainly would require reading or public talking. If somehow I still got to read something, it was horrible. I even tried to go out to toilet when it would be my turn to read… etc.

The only good thing in my life was her, my girlfriend. As I said, I really didn’t deserve her and she felt like a blessing for me. 

I never talked to anyone about this issue of mine except the psychologist from my school. I tried telling my parents once, but my mom didn’t take it seriously and my dad said that it’s because I play too much videogames instead of going out. I remember I cried that day, because I gathered up a lot of courage to tell mom about my struggle, in order to be “bullied” and not be taken seriously.

Usually I just want to pretend that I’m not stuttering, and forget about it, avoiding any situations that would make me expose my stuttering. It was pretty difficult to do that in school, because I had to go to school and do what teachers asked me. I hoped that maybe with age, it will disappear, by the time I get to university, but it didn’t go away.  
 

My first year of university was hard, different country, different language, complex subjects (engineering school). Somehow I passed it even though I procrastinate a lot, but during the last days before exams, I can prepare a bit and do ok at exams with some luck. I never really talked during classes, never posed questions like other students and skipped classes where I knew I’d have to read/present something. Not always though, because I couldn’t have a lot of absences and I couldn’t find veridic excuses for all of them. The good thing was that, since I was in a foreign country, speaking not my native language, often I could make people believe that I’m just bad at that language and that’s why I stop talking or stutter, even if that wasn’t the case. It was easy to hide the stuttering and blame it on the language!

In the summer break after the first year, my girlfriend left me. It would be a long story to try to explain the reasons, because even I don’t know the exact reasons, but after years of thinking on this subject, I think I can write a TLDR: as stuttering progressed over the years, my self-esteem and confidence levels dropped down a lot, and insecurity levels rose up proportionally. Now this obviously changed me as a person. Now of course I want to be confident and be the best man possible for her, but instead, I was ashamed of myself and angry at myself. This anger also reflected on her slowly, even if it was unintentional. I was very jealous for the smallest things, very possessive and our relationship had a lot of fights towards the end… I’m a lot wiser now than I was back then, and I can see a lot more things that I couldn’t see back then. Basically I just wasn’t the same person that she fell in love with and she couldn’t see her life with me anymore in the future. All our dreams of living together forever happily were shattered.

She left me after 6 years of relationship during the summer break and I entered a very dark period of my life after that. I cried, a lot, begged her to reconsider, to come back, threatened her with suicide… etc. I also did stuff that I regretted right after, like calling her names, threaten to expose some pictures of her (I know, pls don’t judge, I was really desperate). I really wasn’t myself during months after the breakup. I felt empty and with a huge scar in my body. I was lifeless, with no intention to live, to do anything. She was my soulmate for all those 6 years. We were together every day at school, same class, same desk, eating together… everything. As I said, I loved her more than myself or anyone else. I loved her like a sister, girlfriend, wife, all types of love. I just don’t know how to explain how important she was to me in a structured manner right now since this post is not about that entirely and it’s already too long. 

The worst part was that she didn’t directly tell me why she left me, so I was left hanging with my thoughts for years after, thinking every day why. That really did feel like anguish and brain torture. I blamed her in the beginning, but after some time I started blaming myself, and hating myself even more. She tried to make me a better person and she did, but stuttering made me worse, without me even realizing.

I lost many friends after the breakup, because most of our common friends sided with her, and left me since in their eyes I was a monster and I didn’t have other friends since she was the only friend I needed and I spent 95% of my time with her. I really felt lonely and empty.

2nd year of university, I’m lifeless, in depression, no will to live or to study. Skipping classes when I can to not stutter, stuttering in those that I cannot skip. It was painful, but not as painful as the pain I had in my chest after breaking up. I didn’t pass my 2nd year, but since my grades weren’t that bad, I was allowed to repeat it.

3rd year of university, I’m repeating the 2nd year and living alone, in a small dorm chamber. Every morning I woke up with suicidal thoughts. The only thing that stopped me were the thought about the suffering I would cause to all my family if they found me dead. They have a lot of trust in me and think of me as an example for my younger cousins. When in reality I was becoming more and more insecure to the point I was afraid to go out and seeing people, or just buy bread. I was living, but just surviving each day, to not die, and to not make my family suffer. I failed the 3rd year but it was easily passable if my mental health was not completely in the gutters. In the end, I sent a mail to my university explaining them my stuttering problem and trying to make them understand that that’s the reason I failed, but their reply was that it’s too late for that…

Year after, wasn’t enrolled in any university, since I found out that I didn’t pass kinda late and I didn’t apply for anything else in time. I mostly sit at home and played video games with minimal expenses, I was able to live and not starve since I had some money saved. My parents didn’t know about anything, they think I’m still in uni, doing the 4th year. I just couldn’t tell them. I couldn’t look like a failure, which I consider myself. I still visited them during the holidays, trying to act normal. I was feeling pretty useless for not doing anything, but at least I didn’t have to think about stuttering for a long time that year.

Year after, I started another uni again (directly in the 2nd year), because something has to be done, right? I was pretty easy for me since I already did years of uni before and the hard part was, as always, avoiding reading or making presentations. As covid started, I had the luxury of doing the classes online (just as everyone else) and this was perfect for my social anxiety. Except that at the end of the year I had to find an internship for a few weeks to validate my year. I was very scared of doing interviews and I didn’t do any so I didn’t find any internship. Luckily, I blamed it on covid (because many people actually had troubles finding jobs/internships during that time) and the university allowed me to do the internship for them. The problem was that at the end I had to make a presentation of what I did. Somehow I managed to do it, online. I was a bit more confident of myself since I had all my notes on a 2nd screen and I could peek at them as much as I wanted. And the jury was very indulgent. I passed my year and was very happy about it. I also managed to find an “internship” to work and study at the same time for the 3rd year of uni. The internship is not great, but I was just happy that I didn’t stutter a lot during the interview so they didn’t notice much that I have difficulties talking. Again, they saw that I’m a foreigner and blamed it on the language…

I skipped already 2 presentations during the year at the university, lying that I forgot about them, or since it’s covid, I thought they are online, but I knew they weren’t… etc. Basically I have to lie a lot to hide my stuttering and that makes me feel bad. I have to change words mid-talk when I know I’ll stutter on a syllable. I stutter even in my dreams, or in my thoughts and this terrifies me. It’s a sign that the problem is very deep and I’m never going to recover.

I managed doing some presentations online by recording my voice beforehand and playing it like an audio file when it was my turn on talk. As bad as this might sound, this covid situation helped me a lot… 

To finish off my year, I’ll have to do 2 presentations for 20 minutes each, one now, and one in 3 months, explaining what I’ve done at work and such. This is completely not possible for me to do. I am so stressed and I already lied about having covid so I can delay my first presentation which had to happen 2 weeks ago, and it was rescheduled for 23th of June. I have 1 week to try to do something. Yesterday I wrote an email to my communication teacher, asking her for advice and help, explaining her the situation a bit. 

And today I decided to write this on reddit since I wanted to do this a long time ago, to ask you what should I do? How do you live with stuttering? I don’t have suicidal thoughts as before, but it’s still hard to live each day in fear of stuttering. The only thing I want in life is to be able to speak like other people, like every other normal people. I feel like so many doors would open in front of me.

I have also done a course on Digital IC design where I was introduced to the idea of velocity saturation in minimum ( and lower ) channel length mosfets. As I am relearning some of my Analog IC courses, I have noticed that my professor wrote Vdsat to denote the VDS headroom that you need to allocate for a mosfet to remain in saturation and used this “Vdsat” in several common mode ranges expressions. I have done an internship in which the input transistors in a fairly low GBW opamp were biased in the subthreshold  area.

What I don’t understand is : what is Vdsat in the case of subthreshold biasing. Is this at all related to the Vds beyond which a mosfet goes into velocity saturation ? 
Or does Vdsat refer simply to Vgs-Vth? 

I feel the Vdsat concept is more applicable to the cases where mosfets are biased at moderate or strong inversion but I can’t get around the feeling that I’m missing something fundamental. 

Thanks in advance."

So I am working my first internship at a top 20 bank and am starting to realize the upper management for cyber security usually don’t even have cyber security backgrounds. All of them have MBA’s of some form with undergrads ranging from mechanical engineering, all the way to finance. I am going into my senior year at my university and have applied for a 4+1 program to get my masters in one year after my undergrad since I am already taking masters courses now in secure software design. What should my game plan be looking at my future in the long run?

1.) Go to school for one additional year and finish my Masters in Cyber secure software design and pay the 30k out of pocket

2.) Go to school for one to two years and get my MBA in engineering to work as a manager and pay 30k out of pocket

3.) Work at the bank doing cyber work and have them pay partially for my cyber masters

4.) Work at the bank doing cyber work and have them pay partially for my MBA

Thoughts anyone on how to maximize my career, salary, and education?"

Here is the sixty-eighth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

I like programming and that's where i'll probably start out, but I see my future as more on the management side and have started to feel like getting an MS might open more doors down the line in terms of promotions or even just a higher salary. My school has a 4+1 where for 1 year more i'd get an MS in CS. I think it's in the ballpark of 15k, and I think I'd be able to pay for it using internship $ or a small loan.

I am currently about to go into my second year of CS Software E at a large state school with a good engineering program. I currently have a 3.95 GPA after one year of school and am loving computer science so far.  I have a good understanding of most topics covered this semester and as long as I have a brief refresher I should be able to explain them throughly. I am starting leet code now to study for interviews and I have a decent amount of experience. Currently I am interning at a midsize company out of the country working with both their IT team doing anything from pretty basic CRM test cases and creating filling IT requests from the rest of the company to more complicated scripts in Microsoft Power shell that create shared mailboxes and search the active directories for duplicate users In addition, with the data science team (theres only one of them at this company so he threw the project at me since he was quite busy) I completed the training, implementation, and inference of the SAP AI SDK. With this I dealt with List comprehensions, creating schemas from 3000 line CSV files, and creating confusion matrices from the data that the AI model predicted.

In addition to the experience above this coming year I am a TA for our object oriented programing class and a Resident Assistant. So my question is how important are projects. Work has really been burning me out with me being there everyday 7:30-5PM working with the IT team or Data Science team so I haven't had much time to get to projects. I feel my resume is going to be pretty solid when I go to apply for internships and that I will need to study quite hard for the technical parts(already knew this a while ago) but the only thing missing is my project. I have one now and its a pretty basic GUI as I am typing this of my favorite game (Set) but I lost most of my motivation to do it probably due to long work days and the how easy it is to get distracted in this country.

I would love to hear input from people of all software engineering levels on how my experience will look and how important a project is to be on a resume when I start to apply for internships.

I graduated in December. Finished student teaching in April (high school biology, anatomy and chemistry) . Long term subbed in middle school 8th grade. and I also had a year internship of basically full subbing before my student teaching in a high school. So I have experience in schools.

I’ve had 7 interviews since April

Insight:

3 of them went really well and I even got to round to for a demo lesson for one of them. I was complimented that I did really well and was strong on multiple parts of the interview. I've received good comments that my resume is strong, but it ultimately comes down to they are going with more experienced teachers. Some of them I will say seem to have been hiring internally and I was just a filler interview. 2 of the interviews I will say I am glad didn't go well due to things I saw during the interview that turned me off.

I do have the option to stay at my current school I’m LTS at, but I do want to see what opportunities are out there. Not that I don’t like the place I’m at, but I’m from the area, went to the school and would prefer high school. I want to broaden what I know outside of my hometown I guess is how I’m feeling. It also just doesn’t feel to be the right fit. I feel selfish for giving up an opportunity. But I know it’s important to choose a school I will feel comfortable in.

I even had one school email me to tell me they aren’t going to interview me and when I talked to them, it was because I didn’t have enough experience to be interviewed.

I do feel like I am a strong candidate with what I am qualified for, my recommendation letters and the experience I have gather so far. But, I’m feeling a bit disheartened at this process, as I was told I’d have no issue as a new teacher who would get chosen because they’d have to pay me less and because my area is a shortage area. But it’s seeming to be the complete opposite so far"

Just wanted to share what has been going on. I'm currently an undergrad (rising junior) at uni in the US, majoring in Computer Science. I wasn't able to obtain an internship in the industry but was able to get a research internship under a professor at my uni. I should've put more thought into this before agreeing to it but I was kind of desperate to do anything CS related over the summer. With no prior experience in research, machine learning, and the use of statistics (other than an intro to stat course I took), I agreed to be an intern. I thought this could be a learning experience for me. Right now I'm in my 3/10 weeks and I feel like I'm in a hole. I was blasted with a bunch of csv files and data I have no idea what they're about. At first, my research advisor has the expectation that I knew Python such that I was able to code a machine learning model. But after telling her that I wasn't familiar with that, she gave me tasks relating to Exploratory Data Analysis. She wasn't clear on what she wanted from me, I analyzed the data and gave her feedback. However, my feedback was not what she wanted and I can hear the disappointment and ""God, she is so useless"" in her voice. To be honest, I literally, and I mean literally have no idea what's going on, like what she wants from me. I'm so lost in interpreting data. Now I know I shouldn't be so quick to be like ""I should give up."" But really, at the end of each day, knowing that I barely got anything done, and showing no progress has made me feel guilty and sad. And the thought of quitting been on my mind lately. This is my first time doing something work-related in the CS field and don't know how to handle it. I know I have my advisor but I feel alone and nervous about everything at this point. And I'm not sure whether I can continue this internship or not.   


This is my first experience in research and is not sure that what I am going through is a sign telling me that research is not my thing. I mean I had to experience research to know if I had a passion for it, and since I'm currently doing research, I think I don't. The thought of maybe quitting this internship makes me also think that like I'm lazy and am not putting in the work and stuff. But I am trying my best, and this is where I am now. The idea of quitting something is scary.   


Sorry if this post is all over the place, but yeah, that's all.

Thanks."

How should I proceed?,fishbones888,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nzwszw/switched_my_major_to_cs_in_junior_year_with_no/,"Anyone here have experience job searching as a new grad without any relevant internship experience? 

As background: I’m an ex Bio major and rising senior at a fairly high ranking school. I never really had any interest in biology, but stuck with it because of pressure from parents (who wanted me to be premed). My school requires us to take an intro computing class (which was my first ever exposure to coding), and I found that I really loved programming. After slogging through two indecisive years of undergrad, I finally switched my major to CS last fall, but I had no clue about the internship search process. Didn’t start looking until late February/March and failed miserably at the couple of interviews I was able to get (had no idea what LC even was until browsing this subreddit). Now I’m spending the summer doing bio research at the lab I was at last summer. 

I do have two small personal projects and a couple of class projects, and I had to do some analysis with R for my bio research, but aside from that I have basically nothing relevant to put on my resume. I plan on practicing coding problems and doing some larger personal projects this summer, but I don’t think I’ll be able to take on a fall/spring internship in senior year due to the heavier course load from finishing the CS major requirements. I also don’t have the finances to spend additional semesters at school/delay graduation. So most likely I’ll be graduating without any actual work experiences.

Any advice on how to proceed or anyone with stories similar to mine? How did job searching in senior year go for you? Obviously, I won’t be able to get any prestigious job offers, but how hard of time will I have getting any offer at all? Ideally, my plan is to work a year or two to help finance a CS masters, and I’m trying to stay in the Midwest or somewhere with LCOL after graduation to minimize expenses. 

Any thoughts are appreciated. Thank you for reading!"

nzx6mz,1,2021-06-14,Conflicted about continuing my “human services” major (long),emi_abo,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/nzx6mz/conflicted_about_continuing_my_human_services/,"**TL;DR** I am 21 and soon to be a senior at a state university, and it's all coming at me fast. I am not sure if I can even complete the major I fell into, given it doesn't really fit with the rest of my interests, but conflicted on whether to consider switching to something else (not my first major change).

Long story, when I was in high school I took a few programming classes, I was always considered the ""computer person"" within my family. When I graduated, I figured I would end up studying computer science because I live in a *very* tech-centered part of the country (western WA). I liked the coding classes, but I came to realize that I don't exactly have persistence when it comes to fixing bugs/solving difficult logical problems (I have Asperger's, so I was always sort of told this is something I would be good at, but more recently I have started to suspect I might also have ADHD).

When I got to university, however, I quickly realized that the CS program is *incredibly* bottlenecked, overcrowded, and competitive, and the professor I got for my algorithms and data structures class was distant and even the lab TAs were never very helpful. The math course requirements ended up more than I could handle due to my attention issues, so by the time I finished Calc 1 and that data structures class with Cs, I basically resigned I was not getting into this program. I didn't want to end up working as an engineer at a big tech company like Amazon, preferring something that is a little more ""mission-driven"".

All the while, I was taking general ed classes and getting involved with a few clubs on campus that I came to be an officer for, the main one being a small weekly social gathering for trans students and a couple campus Discord servers. I came across a class about transgender history, in a department I had never heard of before called Human Services. The class was everything that my other classes were not: small class size with small group work (and most students and the professor were part of the LGBTQ community), lots of interesting (although often intense) readings and videos, and a focus on increasing community awareness. At the end of the quarter we put together an event where we set up a table and talked to people on campus, and even held a small concert with revenue benefiting a national charity. All this led me to believe, at what felt like a crossroads in my life so far, that this would be a decent fit for a new major for me that had a culture I enjoyed more than the STEM programs at this school.

I was more interested in the ""indirect service"" part of the human services major, policy advocacy, volunteer coordination or community building for a nonprofit or even university office seemed great and not nearly as corrosive for me as working in a big company, even if it meant radically less pay. Being an introvert, I thought that anything direct like case management or ""social work"" would end up a disaster for me. I judged that college should be a time to shore up my weaknesses (in communication) rather than just focusing on strengths, so entering a major slightly outside my comfort zone would make me a more well-rounded worker in the future. After a few quarters in the program, however, I am not sure if I can do it.

See, it has a pretty sizeable internship requirement, 240 hours at 2 different sites. I applied to one internship at a local nonprofit that does summer music camps for girls and queer youth, even got an interview, but didn't get it, even though I thought I would be qualified. I know it's normal to have to apply to a million places and only get a few offers back, but...I've dug myself into a hole with mainly wanting to focus on LGBTQ and disability advocacy and being unable to envision a lot else, because there aren't as many different organizations here doing this as I thought. I'm kind of tired already of being in a field that relies, probably more than any other, on being *extremely passionate* about the work, even at the cost of potential future pay and regular hours. I entered this because I thought I would lose out in anything tech to more talented applicants, and now I'm going to lose out to more passionate applicants here. Really, I picked this major because I felt that time was running out in college because of the pressure to complete a bachelor's in 4 years. I judged that getting a bachelors in *something* was better than having ""some college, no degree"" because I wasn't smart enough to go to city college and get an associate's in something. The one thing I can't do is drop out of school entirely. Family would never let me, considering how much they saved for me all this time.

**So, disregarding my winding collegiate path for now**, what are semi-employable skills that I would like to work on? Not intense coding or engineering, but web design (as in, HTML/CSS type frontend stuff) is actually pretty enjoyable for me, a nice mix of visual design, which I was always afraid to study because it requires building a portfolio, and the satisfaction of making code work. I'm not sure what the market for that is as a career for me, when premade website services like Squarespace or Wix exist, though. Writing, too, I guess? I am very...rambly and stream of consciousness when I write, as you can tell, but I have tried several times to start a personal WordPress blog where I mainly talk about shows and games I like and occasional tangents about tech topics. I don't really care if many people read it, but it would be nice as a little side project, especially if I could make even a small amount from it through donations. I feel bad that I haven't been consistent with it because I've been so busy with college, and my media analysis skills need work if I'm going to become some kind of essayist. This is a *real* long shot, but I would like to get back into studying Japanese, which I originally started just as a hobby but wonder what would open up if I continued down the path to decent literacy in it, if not immediate *spoken* fluency due to lack of experience. Translation?

Honestly, I just want a career where I can live on my own without worrying about paying rent or health insurance. Something with somewhat regular hours, that could maybe even be done from home sometimes. Figuring out my next steps with this college thing is the first priority. I'm taking a summer class on more advanced web programming/site management and there is a minor connected to it called ""Internet Resource Creation"" that combines it with things like technical writing or newswriting. But given that I am a senior, the only thing that keeps me up at night is...should I even consider changing majors *again* and adding another year or two of tuition? And what could it even be?

Sorry for the ridiculously long post."
nzxjfk,3,2021-06-14,2 years out of college. No professional experience outside of foodservice and retail. Need some advice and help digging myself out of the hole I dug myself into.,Some1toKnow1,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/nzxjfk/2_years_out_of_college_no_professional_experience/,"  

Hello there everyone:

It’s been two years out of college and I’ve been having trouble landing any jobs other than food service or retail despite going to what is supposedly a good college (supposedly a top 10 college in the region I live in) and getting a degree in the STEM field (Bachelors of Science in Mathematics). A lot of this might be my fault for not getting a single internship in college and lack of motivation caused by rejections and failure; some of it might be just things that aren’t meant to be; but to begin this post / autobiography / case study, let me walk you through my life history beginning from my freshman year of college to where I am now.

**Freshman Year of College: Pollyanna**

I begin my freshman year of college as a starry-eyed young adult deciding I wanted to be a math teacher right out the door because I enjoyed helping people realize their potentials and I wanted to make a difference in peoples’ lives. A bit before my first day of college, I signed some four-year promise with the university (I guess because people were taking longer than four years with their Bachelors Degrees and were unsatisfied with the amount of debt they came out with) promising them I’d take at least 15 credit hours per semester, maintain an above 3.0 GPA, not fail any class during my undergrad, and if it’d take any longer, the college would pay for the degree. Little did I know that signing that paper would be one of the anchors that would weigh me down later down the line. I would go on to take 15 credit hours in my first semester and do well enough to earn my first Dean’s List award. My second semester was 16 credit hours and within that semester, I started learning about teaching from shadowing. I did not bother finding an internship during the summer because I was sure I wanted to continue teaching. So far, so good.

**Sophomore Year of College: Troubled Waters**

When I went into my second year of college, I felt something was off about the college. It seemed like half the people I would see at school clubs and the following just up and left, likely due to the college quickly rising about $3000+ in cost per semester, going from a great value college to simply just being of average value. Regardless, I continued on with my learning. My first semester back to college saw me taking 15.5 credit hours and earning my second Dean’s List award. However, it took until my second semester in my sophomore year for some cracks to start showing. I took 16 credit hours my second semester and continued my learning about teaching by more shadowing and learning about best practices and lesson plans. However, the balance between what I was doing with the Mathematics section of my degree and the Education section was starting to overwhelm me. I even ended up failing one of my classes in Lifeguarding because I did not dedicate the time into learning the rules from the manual, erasing the four-year promise I had signed in my freshman year of college (I didn’t know it at the time, so I just continued trying to keep afloat by taking more than I could chew off). Anyways, I now had a dilemma on my hands. I ended up realizing that I enjoyed the mathematics section of my degree more than I did the Education section. In the end, not realizing yet that I had broken the four-year promise, I still kept moving on trying to be a math teacher anyways because I had fallen into sunk cost fallacy and if I wanted to change my Minor in Education to something else, I would have to take an extra year or two to change it. I didn’t want to get my parents into more debt than I already had them in, so I decided to keep course despite the warning flags starting to show up now. Once again, like last semester, I still wanted to teach, so no summer internship for me.

**Junior Year of College: Scraping the Bottom of the Barrel**

Even with the rocky year that was my sophomore year, I went into my Junior year with hope that things would be better. Little did I know that my As I would usually get in my classes would start to turn into Bs and Cs with harder classes and I would almost reach my lowest mental points with some signs of mental burnout from taking off way too much more than I could chew, but still managing to get through the year unscathed. With my first semester of my third year of college, I would end up taking my most credit hours up to this point at 17. No Dean’s List this time though, as I would end up getting my first C+ within my major in Advanced Calculus. My second semester, however, would see me taking my most credit hours ever at 18 and would have some of my hardest classes and professors I would have to deal with. I would once again do the teacher shadowing and would learn how to do lesson plans. However, near the end of the semester, something different happened. The teacher I was in charge of shadowing pulled me aside and told me I should have been interacting with the students more and have had a more commanding presence during the semester rather than taking notes off to the side like I usually was. This should have been the breaking point that I should have just stopped with the teaching aspect and focused on something else to do with my minor. Once again, I fell into sunk cost fallacy and refused to do anything about it. This consistent indecision during my undergrad would later be paid back in kind to me later on during my senior year with the internship waiting for me in my grasp that would be a promise of a teaching job if I would have gotten out.

**Senior Year of College: Bottom Falls Out**

During the summer between my Junior and Senior years of college, I had almost completely forgotten about the teaching internship I had waiting for me during my first semester of my Senior year of college. It wasn’t until I checked my college emails that I had realized that I was supposed to meet with the teacher who would be my supervisor. He was abroad teaching students in Europe for June and July and it wouldn’t be until August that we would finally meet and get everything sorted out before my Senior year started. Already starting disastrous here. The disaster, however, would continue into my first semester of my final year with me barely keeping afloat with the three mathematics courses and three education courses (including the internship) totaling 16 credit hours for the whole semester. I would often not have the time nor the motivation to write lesson plans and would often be at the back of the classroom taking notes like my first three shadowing opportunities and would often have to improvise with what had been in the lesson book and what was on the projectors before class had started. I was barely sleeping (about 4 hours or less on average including naps during the day) and would often drive to the internship greatly sleep deprived. Halfway through the semester, the professor in charge of the internship would pull me into the office and would talk with me about my underperformance in the internship, telling me it would be cancelled if I couldn’t deal with the workload of the internship. I would still try my best with trying to do lesson plans and the like, but I simply couldn’t deal with the internship on top of all the classes I was taking, causing the internship for me this semester to be cancelled. The professor told me I would end up graduating with an Education minor degree (which pretty much should have been a Bachelor’s Degree) regardless of the Internship, but to get the credentials to teach (what really mattered), I would have to try again in the fall next year. Finally realizing that teaching isn’t for me, I eventually turned him down and took the Education degree. With an Education sized weight off my shoulders, I now had a lot questions to solve: What do I want to do with my life now? What can I do with just a Mathematics degree? Will a Mathematics Degree still be useful on its own? With the first semester coming to a close, I could have graduated then with both the Bachelors of Science in Mathematics and the Education minor then, but with so many questions looming on my mind, I tried to use what little time I had left in my second and final semester to answer those questions. Sadly, within that final semester, with looking at jobs like actuarial science and programming, I could not find an immediate answer, as those seemed to be too much work for me. I ended up coming out of this four-year journey bruised and battered with a 3.3-3.4 GPA and not valuing the degree(s) and accomplishments I got along the way (my parents to this day seem to value them more than I do), but still, I realized I had (and still have) an even longer journey ahead of me.

**Post-College Journey: The Bleeding Continues**

Like most students coming out of college, I felt slightly confident about my chances of finding a decent job that would finally give me some form of financial security. I mean, I had a STEM degree, people should / would be tripping over me to hire me like they said they would my first year of college! Sadly, I would quickly learn that wasn’t the case (especially where I am in the middle of flyover country), as I realized that without practical internships, my degree was useless and I would receive first round interviews and nothing more (doesn’t help that I’m not really good with interviews as a whole). I watched as I saw my classmates with similar degrees to me get accepted into positions at companies like KeyBank, Luxotica, NASA, USPS, etc. (They all seem to have had internships in the past). Meanwhile, I was stuck at home still trying to apply for various jobs in my state. About a month into the summer, I ended up settling and taking a tourist trap restaurant job somewhere within the state I live in just as a way to make extra cash and to buy myself time to think about the careers I could pursue. I would end up setting no expectations for myself and the job I was in and would usually work 8-10+ hour shifts with only a 30 minute break to eat, often working almost start-to-close and would often have to close the store at night while also helping out all around the restaurant. I would often come home from this job tired and not want to bother applying for more jobs as that would exhaust what little mental and physical room I had left when I got home. I would end up leaving the job about 6 months later without a backup plan in sight, something that I now realize was a bit of a mistake for later. Once off the restaurant job, I would continue off-and-on applying for positions in the hope of landing something related to my degree. I finally get a response back for a Data Analyst Internship position at a hospital, passed their test, and waited for a response for an interview in late February 2020. Then, in early March 2020, Covid happens. The internship position I had wanted just simply up and vanished and I had never heard a response back as the position had likely been cancelled by Covid. By then, what little confidence I had left of finding something I wanted to do just disappeared. I had just simply given up by then, not bothering to apply to anything, questioning the point of bothering trying to find the position with millions of people in the same position as I was, all the while all the unrest and Covid situations around the world wracked what was left of any sense of pleasure I could have experienced up to that point. After some bugging off and on by my parents to get a job (so they don’t have a daily reminder that their son’s a freeloader / basement dweller in their house) throughout the months of the early pandemic, I finally landed a position that I thought would be relaxing as a third shift stocker at a retail store a bit from my house. The job, while a lot easier on my feet than the food service job along with paying better, ended up being faster paced and more toxic than the food service job. I was often expected to do the jobs of two or three other people, could only offload one large pallet every two hours, was forced into a union which never stood up for me even once, and would often be reprimanded by managers who wanted me to pick up the pace when I already was working at my max speed. The job only lasted three months where my three-month contract I had apparently signed to during the beginning of the job was terminated. By the end of that job, I had decided I was done working in retail unless I would be in a situation where my finances are really desperate and I need a job to help pay off debts I have, bringing me to my situation now almost seven months later.

**Conclusion**

The only question I have now with all my past faults, embarrassments, traumas, and two years of not using my Mathematics degree is: Where do I go now? Clearly, even with all the applying I’m doing and all the changing around I’m doing with my resumé, it’s going nowhere and I’m feeling that day-by-day, the degree has piece-by-piece withered away in value. I’m feeling as if employers look at my resumé, see only retail and food service on it with no sort of internships on it, see that I haven’t been to college in two years, see that I’m connected to nobody in the company, and think “This person has no place here. He has no ambition or skills to stay at this company.” My parents are growing more and more agitated that I’m not bothering to find a job, turning down their recommendations to work at more retail jobs or amusement parks that are hurting for workers, even though those wouldn’t be resumé builders, and refusing to go to grad school as a result of it not being guaranteeing me a job when I get out and only guaranteeing me debt. The only things that motivate me to get out of bed in the evening and bring me any sense of happiness are leftover food in the fridge, checking my Youtube subscription box to watch videos, and browsing Reddit for the rest of the time I’m awake because I know at the end of the day that the only jobs posted on Indeed and the like are the leftover scraps that nobody wants because of low pay, toxic environments, or some mix of both and the only jobs that actually pay worth anything you have to get through connections, which I have none other than the two professors that helped me through college that I haven’t spoken to in two years. I often think to myself in this regard that “I know nobody; therefore, I am nobody.” Perhaps I should just ask some classmates I have only spoken to for two minutes in class on LinkedIn if they have any jobs available at their companies I would be applicable for. Perhaps I should seek psychotherapy after going through multiple periods of mental burnout throughout college and up until now. I honestly don’t know. Let me know your comments and suggestions on my situation and perhaps I’ll try to take what you guys can give me. Thanks for any suggestions any of you may have."

nzxr3h,0,2021-06-14,is an IT internship bad for a first-year?,kwish_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/nzxr3h/is_an_it_internship_bad_for_a_firstyear/,"I'm currently a first-year compsci student with absolutely no experience in the tech field.

So far in my first year at school, I've been working hard on mastering my java skills but that is basically all that I know. I watch youtube tutorials on different topics to become more knowledgeable and I am taking my data structure and algorithms class right now during my summer term.

I am in my school's coop and have applied to about 60 job positions so far in preparation for my work term in fall, and I have only received one interview offer today, which is for a pretty well known aerospace company in my region.

Thing is that the job position I applied for is an IT Operations intern type of job. When looking at the description more specifically, it could be described more as help-desk/customer support type of work. There is really no coding involved in this internship, it's much more about troubleshooting and fixing basic technical issues with printers and documentation.

A lot of people from my school discord have told me that those types of jobs are a waste of time since there's no coding involved and that I wouldn't learn anything useful for my future career in tech. Would this type of internship with very basic technical tasks look bad on a CV to future employers? Should I keep applying to higher technical jobs although my chances of getting hired are pretty low due to my lack of experience?

I was excited at first at the prospect of working for a well-known company and just getting a feel of what it's like to work in a technical field but I feel discouraged now thinking that maybe applying to such a job was a mistake.

Any advice? are IT jobs a good start for a first-year with no experience?"

o01yi9,487,2021-06-14,"US MD student applying for residencies this summer. I took STEP 2 CK two weeks ago when the Prometric system crashed, and just today they're telling me that they lost all of my data and that I need to go re-register and sit for another exam. I literally don't have time for this. What can I do?",Variations,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/o01yi9/us_md_student_applying_for_residencies_this/,"For the uninitiated - there are 3 STEP exams that one takes throughout medical school and residency, which are day-long standardized tests administered at Prometric centers across the country.

Some backstory for me, the other super-important medical school standardized exam is STEP 1, which you take at the end of your second year before your third year clinical rotations. It is normal for these exams to be preceded by a ""dedicated"" study period, in which all you do is grind out questions, practice tests, etc. for weeks, even a couple of months. Somewhat infamously detailed in some posts on this subreddit in 2020, a bunch of these exams got randomly cancelled last year as Prometric was Thanos-snapping exam seats in order to facilitate social distancing. My exam was randomly cancelled three times from March to April to June, after which I eventually took STEP 1 in the middle of my pediatrics rotation. As you can imagine, I was completely underprepared for it since I was in the hospital from 6am-5pm the entire week and NOT studying like what I was doing in February. So as you can imagine, I am not a big fan of Prometric.

Anyway, on May 28th of this year, I sat for STEP 2 after having studied my butt off in order to make up for my mediocre STEP 1 score. I used a good chunk of my vacation time in order to guarantee that I would as prepared as possible, and ready to knock this exam out of the park. However, the server crashed at the Prometric center crashed before I could submit, and everybody taking a test that day was ushered out of the testing room into the lobby. We were then told to sit and wait while the center staff worked to get the server back online. Eventually they gave up, and sent us all home with ""customer care"" numbers to get in contact with instead. The Prometric staff I spoke to, as well as an National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) representative assured us our progress was saved, so much so that the NBME was holding my eligibility number while they investigated the situation, so I couldn't just out and register for an exam at another location. At a worst-case scenario, they would just grade my exam out of the total number of questions that I did answer. As it was a long weekend, all of the test admin representatives had left the office by the time I submitted my incident report. On the next Tuesday, I received confirmation that they had received my incident report, and NBME was looking into my case.

Two weeks later, I receive [this letter](https://i.redd.it/p9uxnladta571.jpg) basically stating that Prometric lost my entire exam, and that their only option is to have me re-register and sit for another 9-hour exam. I have not looked at this material in weeks, and feel completely unprepared to do all of this over again. i also cannot afford to take any sort of dedicated or study period, even for a week or two. I am in the middle of my 4th year rotations, and am also on the heels of my sub-internship, a rotation in which a 4th year med student is challenged by their chosen specialty to perform at the 1st year resident level. This is an extremely taxing gauntlet, and I cannot be expected to grind question banks or practice tests to hit my target score while performing at an acting intern level this summer without both performances suffering.

This is a high-stakes exam, and to just be told that nothing I did matters, and to prepare for a retake feels TERRIBLE. This exam needs to be in my residency applications when they are due in September, and I cannot find any free moments to sit down and accomplish that. At the very worst, I would retake this exam, do terribly due to all of my other current commitments, and fail, and have to figure how to retake it a THIRD time before then. It really feels like I am being punished for having to retake STEP 2 for something that is entirely not my fault.

What are my options here? Obviously I just want my test graded pro rata, but if my entire exam form is lost, then I guess there really isn't anything I can do about that. Can I beg NBME to settle for an ""average"" sort of score instead?? And if I do have to bite the bullet and figure out a retake, it will be a nightmare with my school to see how I could work out even an extra week off during such an important time. In the letter, they say they are refunding my exam application fee at least, do you think I could squeeze some extra compensation in order to purchase access to my study materials that have since expired? e.g. UWorld, Self Assessments, question banks, etc.

Any advice would be appreciated.

My school cancelled spring break so it was a straight 15 weeks with one day off. After my last final, I had a week of break before my current program started. 

Current program is 6 weeks of in-person coursework (9 credits) from 8am-5/6pm depending on the day. I'm now in my 4th week and I am extremely burned out. Every weekday I come home exhausted. My cooking/meals are basically at the ""I've lost the will to live"" level of the recent post on r/cooking. I try everyday to go into class fresh and excited but by the 4th hour of straight lecturing on the same subject content sitting in the same seat, I feel so drained. It has been effecting me emotionally and I am so happy I only have 2 weeks left.

But, I just got notified that I landed a 6 week paid internship with a professor I really like. She specifically modified the internship for me so I can do it after my program's coursework. But it is 6 weeks, meaning it will end a week before the fall semester starts. Which is when I will need to do training for my new fall semester lab job. So I won't have any summer break nor will I be able to go home and visit my family and pets until Thanksgiving.

On one hand, I have not had any college-level internship experience related to my major and I am going to be a senior in the fall. The internship would be great and I know the professor.

On the other hand, I am just so burned out and mentally and emotionally exhausted. I haven't seen my family and pets since New Year's and I miss them a lot. I want to spend time with my boyfriend who is also a couple states away. This is probably the last ""free"" summer I will have since I graduate next year and will probably be working full time immediately. And this summer covid restrictions will finally lift so I will get to enjoy that before going back to school.

I would feel really bad about turning down the internship since the professor had been keeping me in mind since April and is willing to make an exception specifically for me to intern for 6 weeks instead of 10. I want to do it but I am burned out and want to enjoy some part of summer. Is it worth it?"

Work:

Have worked as a Lifeguard now for 2 years (Year round due to indoor and outdoor pool), and a swim instructor at the same establishment beginning this year around may. Use this job to help support family, but also because I enjoy it, including the aspects of helping people, preventing injury and drowning, and providing first aid when needed.

Essays/LOR:

Chem Teacher : Have had for 2 years, am one of her favorite if not her absolute favorite student, spent extensive time in her tutorials hours studying for the AP Chem exam, have shown great leadership in her class, will probably be my strongest letter.

APUSH Teacher : Will have for 2 years, as he teaches AP Gov, so next year will be my second year with him, am one of his favorable students, although I can't say for sure that I am the favorite, has compared me to a younger version of himself (no idea if thats good or not), will probably also be a strong letter.

Essays: Will tie together my love for human services and medicine, gonna talk about how initially I began powerlifting to help better myself during a hard time, but how it is foundational in my love for medicine, and is the reason I wanted the leadership position I hold in band (being fitness and health related), the reason I want the job position I hold, as I want to help serve people and provide aid, and why I have such an infatuation with chemistry and biology, as I want to truly understand the mechanics behind them, so I can eventually lead research in finding medical treatments in the biochemical field.

Schools:

UT Austin (Applying to Dean's Scholars, I get automatic regular acceptance through being top 6% at a state public HS), Rice (In state, Reach), UChicago (Reach), Vanderbilt (Reach), Harvard (Reach), Yale (Reach), CalTech (Super Reach)

Questions: Essentially I made this post to ask about Powerlifting as an extracurricular. Given that I'm an incredibly strong competitor at a national level, and plan to work toward being a national champion as a collegiate competitor, will that be enough to cover the top schools, being ivies and Rice/Vanderbilt/UChicago etc. desire for extracurricular strength, or do these schools not even view powerlifting as a real, legitimate extracurricular.

My second question revolves around my application holistically. In my mind, everything I've done in the past 4+ years, has been for medicine, for fitness, etc. in order to reach my end goal of eventually participating in research in the medical field, in order to discover new treatments and really help people. However, would this be viewed as a spike of interest by admissions counselors?

I hope I can get these questions answered, and potentially get some advice on my essay structure idea, as anything I can get to make my application stronger will mean a lot."

2. Significant challenge - Economic and difficulty to participate in extracurriculars because of no car, but utilized online learning to take more opportunities
3. Talent - Compassion and teaching others, specifically adult students like my Tia, whom I tutored through her GED courses in Statistics and Algebra during the summers after my sophomore and junior years. I discussed how I wanted to give back to those who gave everything for me, including my parents and tias, who all immigrated from Mexico and Guatemala for my future, meaning they lost theirs
4. Leadership - Discussed the culture of sexual violence and how I was a victim. Being the oldest and a victim then prompted me to protect those in my family and ensure they were always safe and loved. My home was broken into twice when I was about nine and ten, and for weeks, my little twin brothers slept in my bed while I stayed awake at the bedside to protect them. I would give everything in those moments to make sure they felt safe and protected from footsteps in the hallways.

This is gonna be a long one so bear with me, please. 

Background information:

I (M21) am currently in my final year at university, doing a double degree in business and business information systems. My grades are nothing to boast about – getting distinctions, high distinctions, and occasionally passing or credits now and then. I currently work at a retail store as a permanent casual and I have been job hunting for the past two years now.

It was at uni where I met my GF (F23). We have been together for nearly two years now and we love each other so much. We call every day, try to hang out as much as possible and joke around with each other. I promised her that I would move in while she was on her temporary visa. This is where the problem begins.

I told her that I would be 21 by the time she gets her temporary visa, and I would be able to move in with her as I would be an adult and would have more freedom than when I was 20. However, my traditional Chinese parents would not let me and insist that I save up to buy investment properties as they did.

Both my parents are quite toxic to me. They would treat my little sister (F17) as a princess, giving her food, driving her to school and letting her stay in her room to rest whilst I had to do all the chores in the house with no help, catch transport by myself and get belittled at least three times a day.

I remember when my sister came out to me as trans. Me, being the progressive big brother, I am supported her 100% and congratulated her. However, when she came out to my mom and dad, they instantly started scolding me. They said it was my fault that she came out as trans because I was acting too ‘boyish’ around her and lied about how I made fun of her whenever she wore dresses. My mom would fabricate lies such as “you bully her and make fun of her, that’s why she is an introvert and trans because you are a bad brother” or “the reason why she likes girls is because she always follows you around and you influenced her to become like this!”. 

I pretty much do all of them in terms of chores, except house maintenance, which my dad does. He owns some properties and is a very ‘hands on’ landlord. He would climb onto roofs and fix gutters or lights, etc. I do general housework such as mowing the lawn, washing the dishes, vacuuming and mopping, etc. My parents scold me loudly whenever I don’t do the chores and constantly call me lazy. I remember this when I had come back from a 10hr shift, studied at uni for 5 hours, and was super exhausted, but when I was about to go to bed, I was scolded as I was ‘lazy’ and treated the house like a hotel.

They never admit they are wrong. I was blamed for things that my sister did and was even belittled in front of my whole family and my girlfriend, but when my sister admitted it was her who did it, my mom didn’t even say sorry, she just acted as if nothing happened. 

I want to move out. But my parents say I am not ready to move out with my GF as I don’t have a full-time job and they don’t want me to be like the people they know who got their partners pregnant and had to get abortions and whenever I bring up about moving out, they would call me selfish, stupid, too financially dependant and once they even said they would disown me because I did not put family first.

The thing is, my GF is from Thailand. She has been here for 4 years now and wants to go back home badly. At the same time, she knows that if she does, due to COVID, she won’t be able to come back and would get really depressed not having me there with her. We both want to get a defacto visa here (In AUS) and we need to live with each other for at least 12 months, preferably before August 2021. I promised her I would move out this year, but I kept pushing the moving out date further and now she is getting more and more depressed.

If my parents let me live my own life, I would have already moved. But they guilt trip me into staying with them, even though they treat me like dogshit and I know that if I moved in with my GF, my mom would spread rumours about my relationship and my family will essentially hate me. 

I am tempted to just sign a lease, tell them it’s so I can be closer to internship opportunities and uni, and when they scold me and say “I will not let you leave!”, I can just tell them I have already signed the contract and there is no going back.

Please give me some advice as to what to do. Do you think my rationale for leaving is warranted? Am I being ungrateful for leaving my family and going against their wishes?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: My parents manipulate me and guilt trip me to get what they want (their ideal son), but I want to move in with my GF and they keep making me feel like shit for wanting to do so, threatening to disown me too. Can I please get some advice as to what to do?"

I am a current computer engineering senior at UBC (top 3 schools in Canada) who is on the dean's list, and have almost a 4.0 major (last 2 years). I will have 4 coop work terms (almost 16 months of internship experience) completed by fall 2021, and my current internship is planning to extend internship if I want to.

However, I am having trouble landing interviews at big tech (such as Facebook, google, amazon, MSFT, salesforce, wish, uber, doordash etc, any fortune 500 and or big-name companies) for fall. I knew due to covid the competition was stiff for summer 2021 but since hiring is ramping up now, I was expecting to get at least a few callbacks from a few big names. So far I only received interviews from SAP.

I know people from less known schools with fewer internships than mine have secured internships at those companies even during the pandemic so I am pretty sure I am doing something wrong.

I had referrals at several of them, on top of that, I got my resume reviewed by senior engineers at MSFT, amazon, my coop coordinator who herself was a recruiter, my friends who graduated and landed roles at big tech etc. I am not sure what am I doing wrong.

Is there anyone who can guide me in the correct direction as to what is wrong with my resume?

Grade: 10th, going on 11th (entering 11th in fall.) I'm first gen

SAT/ACT score: don't know, haven't taken it yet.

Grades: A's in all classes taken in 9th grade w exception of Geometry. All A's first semester sophomore yr. Have a guaranteed A in AP World History, my grade for Student Gov doesn't show but it is either an A or a B (probably a B,) and I took finals for Algebra 2 today, which are worth 60% of our grade - I have a 93.3% in the class so if I got 87% or higher on finals my grade remains an A, if I didn't then ig it'll j be lower than that lmao.

Classes: Have taken the required classes for graduation so far (Honors English this yr and AP World History are the first more challenging ones.) Next yr, I am signed up for AP Statistics, AP Biology, AP English, Spanish 3, Art (which I have to take to graduate, figured I'd get it out of the way,) and History (I signed up for the AP version but decided to drop it just bc three other AP's will already be p time consuming.)

I'll list off my extracurriculars too if it helps:

\-Co founder of youth activist org in my city, am senior member and help lead one of our committees. We have over 2,000 followers on Instagram and planned protests last summer/plan protests. Have had some drama w one or two org members which made me consider quitting but I have ultimately decided that I actually, def won't. We started our work last summer (summer of 2020.)

\-I am also co-president of our youth activist club that we started at school to ensure we get people volunteer hours and summer opportunities. Started club this yr.

\-Completed Nursing Workshop (that is moreso geared toward college students but they let me in lol) and received a certificate (idk if my parents lost the certificate or not, it was virtual and during COVID so ig I could email the guy and ask for one again...? But I did learn a lot abt nursing)

\-Did track in freshman yr, wasn't able to really go far w it bc of COVID cutting our season short. Didn't do it this yr due to COVID fears. Intend on doing it next yr but might not be able to bc I'll need to be vaccinated and my mom is really weird abt the COVID vaccine, kind of up in the air, I do want to do it though?

\-I was president of BSU this yr but wasn't voted in, was appointed by club advisor. Have decided to not do it next yr even though I was also apart of it in freshman yr just bc there's some resentment there due to having had interpersonal drama w another co-president (due to me doing all of the work) and with our Treasurer, who has always bullied me even though I did her job for her

\-Am a part of summer program Girls Inc, joined it summer before my freshman yr. Have a job shadowing opportunity this summer - opportunities are volunteering at pre-school (which I wanted but might not be able to get bc my mom doesn't want me to get vaccinated,) and journalism opportunity (which I actually really don't want, is it going to kill my like chances?)

\- I want a nursing internship but probs won't be able to get that until next summer :( Everyone said I can't do it this yr bc of COVID

\-Was on racism sub committee appointed by City Council representatives to make suggestions for City Council

\-Am part of Youth Advisory Board, we work with SBHC to teach students about health-related topics. I did it this yr but it's on Mondays and \*might\* conflict w another extracurricular I have for next yr? I did enjoy it this yr and think I want to next yr, I joined this yr but it admittedly felt different than it might normally bc of COVID?

\-I was School Site council rep for my grade this yr, worked w the principal, was voted in by peers

\-Was nominated by BSU club advisor to do something called Martin Luther King Jr. Freedom Center and actually do like attend the meetings? They offer leadership seminars on certain days of the week, it seems interesting and you do it over summers too."

I’m currently in my 2nd year of IT at UTS majoring in software development, so i take a lot of CS subjects - eg programming subs, data strucs and algos, intro and advanced software dev, OOP, etc. 
I also have internships lined up for end of this year and end of next year too, so I’m completely fine in that area.

The problem is that tbf UTS is kinda sucky in terms of quality of teaching - lazy subject coordinators and outdated lecture material, and other students are coasters, and from what I’ve heard the content in general is way less rigorous than unsw. So there’s no doubt unsw is better yet harder. I’m reluctant due to the issue of trimesters, and if its worth going through all the effort of transferring in my context. 

Any advice is very much appreciated, thanks !"
o06lxq,0,2021-06-15,Confused on what to do with my career,IndecisiveZillenial,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/o06lxq/confused_on_what_to_do_with_my_career/,"Hi cscq,

A year and a half ago I graduated with my bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering (the courses I took were more on the computer engineering side). 

My goal in life was to be an engineer for an aerospace company and so my first two internships I was doing engineering work for a defense contractor and the other was at Boeing. 

I did not enjoy working for a defense contractor given the fact that the work was making weapons and I would feel guilty doing that for a living (and the work wasn’t interesting either). Boeing had always been my dream company, but I didn’t enjoy the internship there. I’m not sure if that was just because of the team itself or the company overall. 

I had enjoyed coding so I decided to apply for entry level software positions and landed a 6 figure job out of college (this was literally 2 months before the start of the pandemic). At my current position I’m not doing a whole lot of coding, and the team I’m on isn’t very interesting (we write automation for the cloud, which feels super abstract. I am very distant from the actual product). I don’t enjoy my job and I want something new. I also want to get out of my hometown and explore a cool new place (lived here all my life). 

I have 4 options I’ve been considering: 

1. Move abroad since my company has positions in the UK as well as Australia. This would require staying at my current company but maybe transferring to a more enjoyable position. Pros are that I would get to experience living in a new country (I currently live in the US) and potentially I could find a team I enjoy. Cons are that I might still dislike the position and I would get paid way less in the UK (probably half or more). Also, I don’t want to stay at the same company for way too long. 

2. Find a new position at a different tech company that’s in a different city, but still in the United States. Pros are that it can give me a salary bump, help me to understand if it’s software engineering I dislike or just the prior company, and allow me to live in a new city. Cons are that I still would stay in the US given that it’s very difficult to apply abroad unless you work at that company already, and I potentially might find I don’t enjoy software in general. Also another con is that applying for software positions is a pain because of leetcode :/ 

3. Re-apply back to Boeing and try out an engineering role to see if I want to come back to doing more computer engineering stuff instead. Pro is that I can work on a product that is very interesting and learn if a more engineeringy role is for me, con is that pay is lower, the work is slow, many coworkers are super old. Have less choices on where to live too.

4. Save up and quit my job and travel the world for like 6 months???"

Most of the hack attempts are totally random, typically trying to find WordPress files that do not exist. I want to restrict access to the website, and only allow certain users to connect in a controlled way.

&amp;#x200B;

I have thought of using either a VPN or employ MTLS (Mutual TLS).

&amp;#x200B;

**\[AWS Client VPN\]**

The AWS Client VPN option seems too costly, 0.2/hour/user. 

&amp;#x200B;

**\[Two interconnected VPN's\]**

Alternatively, I could host a VPN Firewall appliance and connect it to the AWS Site to Site VPN. Clients connect to the Firewall VPN which intern connects to the AWS VPN.

&amp;#x200B;

**\[MTLS Mutual TLS\]**

If I were to use MTLS, then I would have to write several pieces of software to

control certificates: create, revoke and distribute the certificates. And also to verify the client certificates.

&amp;#x200B;

The last options seem cheaper than all the other options.

Which option would you recommend?"

What would you suggest to me? Talking to team lead/HR/applying other jobs?

If I talk about these concerns to my team lead, would I sound mean and arrogant that as a new graduate looking for money but not for experience? I neither can accept my rights and time investments being ignored nor leaving this lovely company and team."

\- You need to write 3 different 600-character writeups for 3 courses, but **only one 1000-character writeup**! (can paraphrase for similar courses) ​This is because **all 3 schools can see all your write-ups**, so it is bad if all your write-ups are the same, and may be **used against you** in your interview.

\- You can get **more than one interview and offer**, but your final offer will be chosen **based on your ranking of choices** (even if you are accepted in more than 1 course)

**Steps for write-up:**

1. **Research!** Every course, regardless of similar names, will have different specialisations and electives so take a look and see what is best for you. **Our website is great for this as we aim to have a complete compilation of experiences for ALL courses in Singapore!**
2. Shortlist **12** courses based on your interest and note down the name, L1R5/ ELR2B2 cut off points and the course's code for reference (this info is needed to fill up the application form)
3. Rank these courses **by interest** \- When in doubt, research and list the pros and cons.
4. The **top 3 courses** is what you should apply for your EAE or DAE
5. Rethink if the top 3 are best suited for you and re-rank, to **confirm if you really want these courses**, before doing the write-ups to save yourself precious time!

**What to write:**

\- Interest (What ignited the passion)

\- Relevant activities (e.g. CCA, AEM, competitions)

\- Activities beyond school (e.g. work experiences, internships, non-school volunteering)

\- Aspirations and long term goals

\- Talents and Achievements

\- Relevant personal experiences

**What NOT to write:**

\- Personal particulars

\- Subjects and results

\- Generic information

\- Introductions (e.g Business is a amazing world of interlinked connections that can. change the world...)

\- Vague information

\- What you will learn in the course

\- Describing the course

\- Irrelevant talents/ achievements

\- Things that you are bad at

your 600 character write-up

Based on aptitude and passion - with relevant experiences, examples and achievements only! (Non-relevant can be written in the 1000-character essay) **Emphasise on what makes you unique!**

**Main 3 points to write about:**

1. When/What/Who/How triggered my interest (Personal story)
2. Relevant experience/ Personal qualities (Use real life examples!)
3. Long term plans/ aspirations

**Secondary points:**

1. Talents and achievements (related to the course)
2. Relevant school-related activities (e.g. workshops, CCA, AEM, competitions)
3. Relevant activities beyond school (e.g. work experience, internships, volunteering)

Your 1000 character write-up

Based on talent and achievements - non relevant experiences/ achievements are written here (Mainly entrepreneurship, leadership, community service and art/sports. Other achievements are also accepted.)

There will be a question: Do you have any other achievements/ talents to highlight? **Always click YES!**

When you write your write-up, most of the content can be copied from your report book/ CCA certificate! However, DO NOT use short form (e.g. instead of NYAA, write National Youth Achievement Award), even if it saves space. You must also support the achievements with real life examples/ events! (E.g. when you write that you have over 80 hours of VIA, state some of the places you've volunteered at)

**Format for writing: (Rank by most outstanding to least)**

In year, I attended competition/course and achieved award/medal.

* CCA achievements
* Non-related achievements
* Personal experiences (e.g. work experience, volunteering)

I always thought I was a gifted child. I was really good at school. I graduated high school with fairly good grades however I ended up slacking off towards the end and that did fudge up my grades a little. I go into a fairly average law school.

However, I was glad that I got to move away because majority of my issues stem from home. I developed binge eating while I was in my second year and put on a lot of weight. 

I was never secure with myself and who I was. I kept asking everyone else for validation and it gave me a sense of self. I was never taught to appreciate myself and I was often fat shamed at home. 

Once I got back home because of covid I was happy as well as partly scared. I have been passively suicidal since high school and now I started acting on those feelings. I have attempted suicide and practiced self harm but none of it seems to work. 

Sometimes I wonder why did my parents even have me because living is  such a burden right now. I wish I could just disappear right now. I wish I didn't exist anymore."

It'll be a huge thing career wise and the pay is great too. 
Only trouble is I don't have much insight into the IT consultancy sector. What it's actually like to work as an IT architect or consultant.

\- Supplementary letter from my band teacher who taught me for over 5 years and understands all the music programs I'm part of. I also am working as a teacher assistant for my senior year with him :)

Hello everyone! I recently wanted a career change, I am 24 so I’m fairly young and i have a BS in business management. So I have no prior IT background.I had the option to goto a boot camp for cybersecurity at rice university for 15k and get all the certs and knowledge or get my Masters-degree in IT focusing on cyber security. 

I chose to get my master and so far I’m loving it, I’m in the 3rd week of my first class and it’s just an intro to IT. But soon i will get into my specialization classes (cyber security) and will the knowledge i learn in class be enough for me to get an entry level job? One of my professors recommend that the first Cert i should try and get is Security + and then once i get experience i should get CISSP. Do you have any thoughts or recommendations?

Also i have another year and a half before i will be done with my masters so what should be doing right now to prepare my self for a career in IT/ cybersecurity. I currently have a job but i would love to try and find an internship or entry level job in IT so i can get prepared for my career.
Thank you so much !"

I would really use help on the below.

So I have been approached by a startup to work as an ""Social Media Marketing Team leader Intern"" one content creator and one SEO Intern will be working under me. (wonder if this role even exists) but I checked the company and its website and it is totally legit. 
I have an experience of 1 year 10 months in the Digital Marketing field. (1 year fulltime job / 10 months internship)

The problem is the internship is of 6 months contractual basis with stipend of INR 3k to 5k (48 to 68 USD/month). So even if I get a good job opportunity in coming 3 or 4 months I won't be able to leave this because of the contract. 

The stipend is tremendously low and also the contract period is long and what I can't commit to.

But the intern profile and Jd is what I don't want to miss out after all it would be an leadership role.

I am confused af
I would really appreciate your help.

I’m not sure if this has been asked before, but I tried searching and didn’t quite find what I was looking for.

I’m a rising sophomore at CMU, majoring in ECE on the software track (as of right now). I’m hoping to double major in HCI.

I currently have a software engineering internship this summer. However, I really don’t enjoy the work, even though I’ve been allowed to do a variety of different software and software-related tasks.

I’m interested in ux research/design, and also interested in product management, so I would like to try those things out. I would also like to do summer research, to get research experience for grad school. 

However, I worked really hard to get a software engineering internship right after freshman year, and I feel like I’m missing out/throwing away the opportunity to continue down the swe path, since I now have a stronger resume with prior internship experience for next summer’s applications.

I’m very conflicted about what to do. I plan one still applying to all of the different positions so I have more time to decide. I know no one can end up making the decision for me, but does anybody have any insights?

TLDR; conflicted about using my summers to get internships to explore what I really want to do or focus on swe and gain work experience / build up my resume"

TW: SUICIDE (This is my rough draft of when I first wrote this after someone I worked with committed suicide. She was a doctor. A wife. A daughter. She was always so full of life, bouncing around, running around....Until that day.) 


Answering the crows call 


She stood at the doorway of her sanctuary, it was where many came to see her for her services. She was a healer among the people, a shepherd to the sheep. She was still trying to find her path in life. Through the many ups and downs in her short twenty eight years, for a moment she felt a surge of gratefulness and she smiled a smile that quickly faded. She had found a loving husband, her mother would send her treats every month, and she had a group of students that surrounded her both in her sanctuary and outside of it. Some of her students resented her, and some even hated her, but she knew that this was all a part of life. She always told herself that they could get in line behind the rest of the people who hated her. But because of the profession she had chosen, even the ones who hated her she would care for no matter what would happen. 

She sighed as she looked over at the bed where she would see her patients. It had a fresh white sheet over it for the patients comfort. How many people had she seen? It was over the hundreds now. She had only just finished being an intern with children and babies. She was then thrown into the fires of treating and taking care of adults, though she was excited for the challenge. She would be able to take this experience and use it elsewhere in her career as a healer. She looked over now to her desk, a small desk where she often felt like she was being put in a corner but it worked nonetheless.

Here, she was able to write all of her notes for her patients and work on anything else that she needed to at the time. The chair to her desk was pitch black and cold to the touch, a constant reminder that she needed to sit down more often. She looked away and opened the door to the outside of her sanctuary and stepped outside and looked down the hall. To the right of her was another office. It was someone she had a close relationship with and a trusted partner that was also a dedicated healer. She could talk to him about almost anything  and she was always grateful for his support. Although sometimes they didn’t agree and at times they would even argue. But they would always return to the mission at hand for healing the people. 

She went to the left and down another hall and took a right and entered the largest area of the sanctuary. Some of her students were in this room watching an infamous show on a large screen. They all stood up, expecting her to ask what the thought they were doing at eleven at night. But she simply said “Oh no, I’m just making sure you guys are okay.” She promptly left and closed the door and made her way back to her own small sanctuary. She sat in the cold chair as it sent a shiver up her spine. She had told the other healer not too long ago that he needed to get out of the area, that he was doing too much, and that  he needed a break. She had done this to so many others, although she was often the one always running around taking care of her students, and tending to the people. She was always available whenever anyone needed her no matter how minor or major an injury or non injury. 

However, this started to take its toll on her. She often neglected herself in her pursuit to heal the people and tend to the sheep. She would lose sleep, sometimes staying up for days on end and she would forget to eat which had made her lose a significant amount of weight. But she had work to do, she couldn’t stop working. The people needed her…They NEEDED her. At least that’s what she wanted to believe. 

Being a healer had its own complications, much like the hierarchy of the catholic church there was the Pope, the cardinals, the archbishops, the bishops, the priests, the deacons, and the laity. The pope was in charge of the entire area where she worked and beyond. The cardinal was the three headed Cerberus for the pope and he would bring down his iron fist whenever he saw fit, the archbishops were a gathering of people with golden insignias who would stare at her with both adoration and despise. The bishops, they had the insignia of an eagle with three chevrons, there were two of them in her sanctuary, and they always supported her even when they disagreed with her. The priests were some of her students, they were the ones who aspired to be like her one day, they were the ones who wanted to become healers. The deacons were those who were still trying to find their path in life and still trying to decide if they wanted to become healers, but they still looked to her for guidance. And then the laity, the people, the sheep, they were the ones that she cared for on an endless daily basis. 

She could feel a tear fall down her face as she quickly wiped it away. She had been to church not too long ago where she had requested a song to be played about the glory of God and how all those who believe in him would then go to him. She contemplated if she really would. 
As numerous thoughts swirled in her head a feeling of depression sat in her heart, she felt the icy nails of depression scratch and claw its way back up to her. Starting at her ankles and making its way to her heart, and then to her head. She closed her eyes for a moment, how long had she been thinking about it? She thought she could handle it, being the arch healer, the leader of the healers. It was the biggest job of her life. If she could do this, she could do anything. She had put herself through the training to become a healer, how could she tell others to heal themselves when she couldn’t heal herself? 

She felt a cold breeze in front of her face, the air had suddenly fallen flat and heavy. She felt a strong presence in her sanctuary, though she knew that no one else was in her sanctuary but herself. She opened her eyes slowly, and jumped when she saw the figure of a crow in front of her. The crow, its black feathers and beady black eyes stared directly at her. It was perched in the air though there was nothing for it to be perched to. Words caught in her throat before she could speak. But she didn’t have to, the crow spoke first.

“Come with me.” Said the crow. 

“But…My students.” She said. Her voice was small and barley a whisper. 

“Your students will be fine with or without you. Come with me.” The crows voice was monotone yet commanding. 

She looked at the door of her sanctuary, where she had already locked it closed. She looked at the time, it was nearly midnight. Everyone should be gone by now. 

When she looked back at the crow, there were other creatures who had entered her sanctuary with her. She stood up in freight. There was now a serpent, it had green scales and piercing red eyes that seemed to stare into the depth of her soul. “Make your choice.” The serpent said. To the left was a bat, its black wings acting as a cocoon around the bats body as it hanged from nothingness. “Shes already made her choice.” The bat said. There was then a large tarantula that crawled up the wall next to the bat, its eight eyes fixated on her. “You wont be missed.” The spider said as it lifted its fangs, venom seeped from its fangs like honey. To the right and on the bed was a vulture, its naked head was ready to peck at a dead carcass and call it dinner. “The people will move on. They will have another healer. You are disposable. You are replaceable. You WILL be replaced.”

And as she shook in fear her eyes darted to the floor, where a black cat crept out from the corner of the bed. For a moment, the black cat simply stared at her, until it finally jumped up on the bed and sat next to the vulture, its lantern yellow eyes stared at her until it said “Are you really going to leave behind your mother, husband, and students?”

She took a deep breath as the tears fell from her face. She had these thoughts on a daily basis, whenever she laid down, when she was walking around, even when she ran to go tend to the sheep, these thoughts circled her mind. She couldn’t tell anybody. How could she burden the people with her problems? She was the healer, she was supposed to heal people not the other way around. 

The pressure from the pope and the cardinal was becoming too much. The pressure from the rest of the hierarchy weighed so heavily on her heart. There was so much going on in her personal life that she felt like she couldn’t talk about, she shouldn’t bring her personal life into work after all. But these thoughts weighed so heavily on her mind that when she laid in bed at night, she could barley sleep. She couldn’t see the end of it, there was no light at the end of the tunnel. There was only the endless despair that she felt in her heart at every waking moment. 

And there was no cure for this disease. 

She thought about her mother, the one who had cared for her all of these years, the one who would send her those goodies every month. She thought about how devastated her mother would be to find out that she was gone. And then she thought about her husband, the man she had sworn to: Until death do us part. She thought about her students, some of them were more fragile than others. But her students would be fine. Everyone that she had ever known would be fine.

“They’ll be fine.” She said in a shaky voice. “They will all go home without me.” The creatures all started to gather at once until they were mere inches from her face. Their mouths were salivating at the thought of their next meal. At once they disappeared with a hissing noise. She stared at the crow, and as she stared a shadow emerged from the back of the crow. As the shadow grew, it started to take the shape of a human hand that extended itself towards her. 

“All you have to do, is take my hand. And it will all be over.” The crow said.

“It will all be over.” The creatures said in unison though they had already disappeared.

“It will all be over.” She repeated. 

The despair, the sadness, the feelings of worthlessness, of not being enough, of not being able to see the light. The feelings that surrounded her every second, every minute or every hour of every day. They would all be gone.

She whispered her last prayer to Jesus Christ. They would understand. Her mother, her husband, her students, they would understand. If they missed her…But if they didn’t miss her it would all be for the better. Any mourning would come to an end. Any tears fallen would quickly dry. And the mission would continue, it had to. The people needed to be healed. The sheep needed to be tended and herded. The people needed their shepherd to lead them. 

But not by her. 

The sanctuary that she stood in suddenly twisted and turned until darkness enveloped her. She could still see the crow and its shadowy hand outstretched to her, but the crow was getting farther and farther away from her. 
And suddenly, she could feel herself falling forward into the darkness, into the void of her despair. There was nothing to catch her this time.
 
And as she fell into the darkness she heard the voice of the crow one last time.

“Come with me.” The crow commanded.
 
She outstretched her hand, and grasped the shadowy hand of the crow. 

The darkness enveloped her, until she fell to the ground. 
And suddenly, she could no longer feel anything at all.

It was all over.

So you think you don't matter? 

You think you would be better off dead, that the world is just going to keep spinning and spinning until the sun swallows us and the human race is no more. 

Right ? I've had these thoughts for many years too. Even with medication my heart sinks lower and lower. 

Now here is the thing that us with depression and other mental illnesses always hear: 

You do matter. Life does matter and is worth living. 

But you don't believe it right? I mean whaaaat how could it matter? How could you specifically matter? 

It's hard to find a reason to keep living when everyday is a living hell. When everyday is filled with so much pain and sorrow. 

This doctor...she thought the same thing and she succumbed to it. She fell to her despair. Thinking that there was no way out and nobody could help her. And could we have helped her if she let all of us in? Well we'll never know. 

The thing is....

You do matter. 

With her presence you knew you were going to be taken cared of. 

With her running around you knew she was busy but would drop everything to come help someone - even if it was for a paper cut. 

You knew exactly what to do in situations when there was a medical emergency. She would stand up for the people who worked for her. If you were concerned about someone else - she would immediately get ahold of the proper authorities to help this other person. 

We held a memorial on the ship (yes this whole story was onboard a ship on deployment. We were at the end of deployment. We were turning around to come back home. We were all supposed to go home together.) 

And we all cried together. There was 300+ of us out on that flight deck (it was a small ship so 300+ is literally the entire ship.) I saw people break down into hysteria. All of the medical department...we all went out and drank our sorrow. 

One person found her in her office, dead. 

One person carried her off of the ship. I remember going to him and he was smoking a cigarette and he looked at me and said ""Did you know her maiden name was Church? Did you know her middle name was Christine? I've smoked so much my lungs hurt."" 

One of my last conversations I had with her was about tattoos. I was talking about how I wanted to get some more deployment tattoos and she was saying she was thinking about getting another one, but the one that she had she had designed it with the artist. 

I never asked to see the tattoo she had or to describe it. 

I didn't even know her that well. And it's something I will forever regret.

I still grieve for her, it's been two years. 

I still think about her.

I still cry and have breakdowns 

I can't listen to Joyner Lucas's song and video ""I'm sorry"" without having a meltdown. 

You don't know what you are to someone else. 

I wish I had the answers of how to keep shifting through the sh*t of life and all of its sorrows and suffering. I wish I held the key to every prison cell so that we could all make our great escape. 

But I don't have the answer. All I can type out is this: 

You do matter. Life is worth living. 

There is a reason to keep going. Even if it's just to see the sun rise and the sunset. There is a reason no matter how small. 

You do matter. And you matter to someone else too."

My last semester of school, I interned on a Netflix documentary and for Prospect Park as a photography/marketing intern.

After graduation, I had a lead out in LA so I moved, having my heart set on working in film. Didn’t have a car out there and was scraping by. Without the car, the producer told me I wouldn’t be a very useful PA. I decided to move again to a smaller city to live with my friends.

I worked at the performing arts center in the ticketing department, as an artists model at the university, and bartended until Covid hit. 

I had enough savings so I didn’t apply for unemployment benefits. Started freelancing as a copywriter and VA. Got another serving job until this January and quit. 

Tried a door to door sales job (quit bc i felt unsafe during a pandemic and a man followed me on the street), was an assistant for a local entrepreneur who ended up being addicted to meth and couldn’t pay me much because she was so in debt she was $600 behind on her heating bills.

I now work part time with a media start-up shooting events and marketing content. It’s three of us and I love it, but it is farrrrr from paying my bills.

I’ve been lucky enough to live with my boyfriend for the past 5 months rent-free. I’ve been applying for marketing jobs, CSR jobs, Admin jobs (I worked at a vet clinic for three years in college). I finally bit the bullet to apply for a personal banker job. They loved me so much they told me to apply for a job that paid almost 4K more a year. 

I got the job offer, but my credit is tanked bc my father said he would pay for my school and then randomly dipped out after graduation (and took me off his insurance to boot), so I’ve had to navigate that myself while prioritizing paying some hefty medical bills thanks to stress from working 70 hour weeks a few years ago fucking w my hormones. 

So now I have no job offer. And my boyfriend and I are looking to move into our own place sans roommate in September.

I know I could go back to serving tables, and that’s my plan at least for now.

But I’m just feeling so lost. I’m now certified as a Neuro-Linguistic Programming coach, a hypnotherapist, and meditation teacher, have heaps of creative and marketing skills. 

Any advice would be super appreciated"

And the next day I realised he is in the same spot and stopped another car I believe in the same way.

SAT: 1500
EC's: volunteering at 2 well known hospitals, self taught html, CSS, javascript and python, several personal projects like 2D game development on unity, made a website for a local clinic, decor team member for national MUN, some school level poetry, essay and illustration awards, Be my eyes volunteer, internship at counselling buisness, sketching and illustrating.

Other potential ecs: signed up for international math olympiad and local round will be held in august for selection, signed up for Southeast Asian Olympiad to be held online in august, submitted essay competion and results will be available on 31st oct + multiple online essay competition submissions.

Any suggestions on kind of exaggerating ecs? Like i was thinking of saying ""event manager for local events"" instead of ""I set up birthday events for family members and neighbors"". Would this be ok or a little bull-shitty?

Anyways please recommend unis that can give good aid for my budget. Thanks A lot!"

o0o3rv,4,2021-06-15,[Rant + Question] Is the job of a software engineer really as hard as studying CS at university?,particleORwave123,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/o0o3rv/rant_question_is_the_job_of_a_software_engineer/,"**Rant** \-

I'm a computer science major, and I find CS extremely hard. I see most people from other majors chilling out, enjoying the college life, and here we CS majors have multiple assignment/project submission deadlines per week. Each assignment or project might use different technologies which makes things even worse, cause even if we only take like 3 non-theory CS courses a semester, we'll probably have to learn more than 3 technologies (i.e., programming languages, frameworks, databases, other tools) in that semester. The days are spent in classes and evenings are spent trying to figure out stuff by googling, watching numerous youtube tutorials, udemy and coursera courses etc. Don't even get me started about the theory CS courses; they might not involve learning a whole new programming language, but coming up with proofs for those homeworks has never been easy. The assignments in CS are so freaking stressful coz you can't just ""wing it"" like the assignments in other majors - the code either works or it doesn't; there's no middle ground. Forget enjoying college days, we can't even get a peaceful night's rest coz we have to get that code to work to pass all test cases and then type up a report before the freakin' deadline. Academically, I don't think there's anything more stressful than trying to debug your code, thinking of edge cases, sifting between numerous files to find that bug an hour before the deadline of a project that makes up like 30% of your overall grade. And why do things keep changing so much in this industry; I highly doubt that the things we spend so much time learning now will be relevant a decade later. Few core CS courses like algorithms and computer architecture might still be relevant, but that's about it. I feel that we always need to keep learning to stay employed, which is definitely not the case with other industries. Most doctors and lawyers probably make more than most SWE's, maybe more than the SWE's at FAANG too, but I don't think that they have to keep learning all their lives just to keep their jobs. Then there's the interview prep that itself probably takes hundreds of hours. This industry probably has the most stressful interviews too - solving a couple of leetcode medium questions (that you might've never seen before), in about an an hour, in front of someone who's not only judging your approach to the problem, but also your syntax, code readability and even the way you name the variables, is pretty stressful to me + There are also the system design + Behavioural rounds. In the the summer, when others take a vacation, we are expected to do internships or work on personal projects; it's like we can't catch a break!

**Question** \-

Is the job of a software engineer also this stressful? If yes, then are there any other roles in tech that a CS new grad is eligible for, that's not so stressful, pays well and has good future scope as well? I don't dislike coding, but things like getting the code to work within deadlines, constantly learning new technologies, or worse - working on multiple technologies at the same time, does stress me out quite a bit.

**Edit** \-

Not sure how this post seems entitled to some people in the comments. I understand that I would sound entitled with this post if I was already making a lot of money as a software engineer and then complaining about the workload, but I'm only a student and the intention of this post is to ask if being a software engineer is as stressful as being a CS student, and if it is, then what other options does a CS grad have in the tech industry that pays reasonably well."
o0o3uj,0,2021-06-15,Need advice ?,KookyExamination6808,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/o0o3uj/need_advice/,"Kinda long.

A little about myself, I am a recent graduate, it has almost been a year since I graduated.
Recently I decided to leave my job I had been at for 4 years to look into something related to my degree, which is Business management.
I've had no luck, so I picked up a part time job.
And I have been applying to HR positions since that area interest me.
Unfortunately due to covid I wasn't able to intern anywhere through my college. So I have no experience regarding HR, but I would love to learn about that field hands on.

Yesterday , while I was working, I finally received a call from a company I have been interested in working with. So I answered and they asked if I had a few minutes to chat and I said yes, since I didn't want to let go of the opportunity. (And I am new to this interviewing process) 
The HR director asked why I wanted to work there, and why I want to leave my current job. 
I am gave them my answers but I feel like I could have answered better had I not been at work (where there's background noise) and had I been prepared they would ask me these questions the first phone call I received from them. In the end she told me they are doing phone screenings with candidates and will get back to me if they decide to move forward with my application.
 I don't think I did my best, plus I prefer in-person interviews. So I am not too hopeful they will be calling me back.

I would like to know if it is normal or usual for the first phone call you receive from a company to immediately ask you questions on why you want to work there and such?

I personally thought they would give a heads-up and schedule a phone screening or interview.

And if I follow up on the status is it best through phone or email?

If they tell me I wasn't chosen, I was also considering asking the company if they accept internships since I think my lack of experience has led to other applications being rejected.

Any advice would help! Thank you for reading."

o0ql5x,1,2021-06-15,Need advice from my Software Engineer/Developer bros out there,iulian212,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/o0ql5x/need_advice_from_my_software_engineerdeveloper/,"So in my country in highschool you get to choose an ""orientation"" i guess i could call it and i chose maths and computer science and both of these were pretty easy to me in the sense that i never had to study i just understood and knew what they were teaching at the other subjects i just copied of of my friends and at math and cs the copied of of me (you know the drill i help you you help me). To be honest what they teach was pretty simple we did c++ and never went past functions some functionality from the string library and maybe a little of what pointers are along with the usual bubble sort binary sort simple stuff like that and i passed through 4 years of highschool never having to even think ""oh no i have a test in maths or cs"" when they gave us test i was pretty happy that i didn't have to do exercises or listen to the teacher explain stuff.

I was kinda putting all my hope in collage and i am not sure if it was because of covid or it was simply me but i started not going to my online classes i just found them incredebly boring i barely could sit through one of them and i just started cheating on my exams. And this was the year i started my 2nd year of college and i though i would look for internships i found them a lot more exiting.

First chance i recieved was from EA Software Engineer Intern it was in c# i was not familiar with it but i asked my cousin how are the questions for internships and he guided me to the basic OOP stuff : classes, inheritance, interfaces, abstract classes the whole thing i tried to learn everything in about a day or two i was too lazy and i got a pretty good understanding on how everything works but i didn't remembered how everything worked and i think i ended up fucking up some inheritance stuff there.

Second and third chance came from the same company for two different intern positions. One was for backend software engineer for java with the spring framework (i hate java for no reason i just like c++) but i did give it an honest try they asked me to make a hierarchical rest api for some kind of sports location or something like that. I never worked with databases untill then and i never even knew what an rest api was for sure at the time and i never wrote java before i had a week to do the project i turbo searched the internet and watched yt videos to understand how things should work and in the end i got something decent for a first try i would say but the database was not hierarchical and i think that was the biggest problem in the end because imo i managed the rest pretty good i made GET,POST,PUT,UPDATE,DELETE requests for everything i made sure everything was coherent to the best of my abilities and i didn't get it. The second one was for AI and i they gave some MRI(i think) images that had a region circled by a doctor and i had to approximate an organ based on that (they gave separate files for pixel data and pixels selected by the doctors) i tried to think about a solution and the only ok idea i had at the time was to do somekind of edge detection but i was not sure on how to implement it in a good manner and ended up sending nothing (felt like crap for not finding a solution).

At some point while i was doing the previous two projects i got an email from another company and they gave me a set of problems and i was to chose one and send it to them in 7 days , i looked at the problems took one that i was bothered to solve and i solved it in c++(they did not specifiy the language) some time passed and i recieved an email saying that i need to take another test due to the high amount of candidates which brings me to today. I recieved my test opened it and there were two problems and i had 90 mins to solve them both. The first one was called snail sort (you basically go through a 2d array in a spiral path) and i can't remember the second one for some reason but i remember it was pretty easy as well. I couldn't solve them ... started with the snail one i spend about 60 mins thinking of ways of soving it i just sat there going from aproach to aproach not knowing how to implement them or just thinking to myself is this a good aproach is there something better same with the other question with 10 mins left on the clock i just pressed submit with my code not even working i think (both of them got segmentation faults i think ) even if the worked i don't know if the would have solved the problem. I just couldn't stand myself i was so mad at myself if i had a mirror in front of me i wouldn't look in it i was shaking of anger i just though ""am i this dumb am i really not able to solve these ?"".

And i am not sure if it's me choking or really not being good enough i mean even if stopped going to my classes and learing from collage i pushed myself to learn on my own i took project i spent countless hours learning about c++,OOP, pointers, trying to understand the details of c++ i have not become an expert by no means i still consider myself a beginner in all of this but i took projects of my own i made an discord bot with discordpy (it plays some sounds that me and some friends selected, rolls dice if you ask it, shows some memes we selected, pulls reddit posts from a subbreddit that you give it, it even has a database that stores curency for each user and you can use it to roll dice between them and see who gets money, you can play tik tak toe it's just some functions that give these functionalities but it's still something even if it's shit), i made an online pong game with sfml (it opens in a console and you have to enter your friends ip then opens the window with the game it's shit), i made an online thermostat for my father with a raspberry pi with django(the site sucks but i don't really like html) and i learned openGL and remade the pong game with my own ""engine"" this time i referenced the codebase of the hazel project from cherno and sfml where i didn't know how to approach certain abstraction stuff the codebase sucks and some of it is straight copied(the stuff that is copied is mostly abstraction related stuff that gives very little room for change) but i made sure i understand every line of code i write i try to get as low as i can(it took me about 3 weeks to make working from 13 till 16 everyday except weekends but hey i had to debug and learn at the same time).

Yea i am not sure what my problem is i am just scared i guess because this is something that i've been waiting to do for a long time and i feel kinda crushed not succeeding

I'm 23, 8 finals away from graduating with a BSc in Electrical Engineer and 2 subjects away from graduating with a BSc in Computer Science. I'm currently working at a big company, spent 1.5 years as an intern, and just got hired to work full time. The thing is, I'm going to be working long hours (around 10-12 according to my coworkers) and it doesn't leave me enough time to study. I would like to graduate with both degrees by the end of the year, but I also know that quitting my job in a nationwide lockdown (I live in Argentina) isn't the smartest move in the book.

So, should I quit and get both degrees, or should I push forward my graduation date and continue working?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!"
o0rc1f,2,2021-06-15,"Any thoughts, tips or advice on my situation with my job hunt as a newly graduate Mech Eng. with Aerospace concentration?",Tri_Polosski,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/o0rc1f/any_thoughts_tips_or_advice_on_my_situation_with/,"Here is my experience with engineering job market as a new graduate. I'm haven't been in a great mood the past months and feel like sharing this would help me out. If you have any insights, tips or other stuff, I would be happy to hear you out :)

So here we go,

I've completed my Mech Eng. degree a little less than 2 months ago. I also got my first pilot license when I was 17 and was passionate about aviation since a little kid. For my part time job, I work as a flight instructor. (I'm not working now though as we're all grounded due to the pandemic but hopping to restart in September. The pay is small but any penny helps and I like the job). Hence, I'm heavily on the Aerospace side of things and the majority of my experience is aerospace related.

I've had 3 internships at the same aero company and they really loved me, I feel like I was really good, the upper management loved me also and tbh it was a dream job. I even played a major part in saving one of their big clients that was on the fence of signing with someone else. This client told me privately that they would re-sign with my company in part because of the accomplished work (even after my internship ended I was receiving emails from other workers telling me this client was asking about how I was doing and when would I be coming back to the company). I can go on and on on how I believe I was doing an excellent job but you get the point and I think I did enough bragging. But I feel like this is required in the context.

Anyway, management was really happy with me and said that they would rehire me the moment I graduate and I was happy about it and planning to come back. The pay was on the slightly higher side but nothing exceptional unless you rack up the OT time (which I was willing to do). 

Then the pandemic hit and heard they started to lay off a lot of people. But this was more than a year ago and now since it started to calm down, I believed they would start hiring again.

I emailed management saying that I've graduated and would be looking for a job to see if they would be willing to hire me. Management said that unfortunately, they don't have any spots left and wished me luck. Tbh this took me by surprise. This email was literally 2 lines long. I texted some of my friends that worked there and they all told me the same narrative that there's too much work and they're overworked. It felt like a backstab tbh. It's kinda super ironic because I was coming in very early every morning to work and made friends with the cafeteria cook (she knew my morning order and I didn't even need to talk she would just ask me ''same as always?'' and I would say Yes). One day she asked me why I'm always coming this early and I would explain to her that I want to make a good impression to the company and that there's this client and blabla. She would then tell me that I'm working too hard and that eventually, they would lay me off and not care about me, that my work would just not count as they would just hire someone else and that I am disposable. She told me to enjoy life more and not worry too much about work. I kinda laughed it off and said ''Idk management recognizes my work and they really like me and told me that they would be happy to take me back when I graduate''. Guess who's laughing now...

Anyway, after the company told me there's no spots open to me I told to myself that I'm just going to apply to another job where my skills could come handy. My friends (some of whom are Civ eng or Soft eng) told me that for any employer, I would be a dream come true in regards to my skills and past experience. That cemented my confidence of landing a job.

Now 2 months later, after 100+ job applications, I've gotten only 1 interview and it was from a company that had really bad reviews (i.e. saying they were heavily underpaying staff like as low as 18$/hr, no benefits and overall that you go there just to get the experience and leave asap for another job). Another let down was that the vast majority of the job offerings for Entry Level Junior Engineers that I saw were requiring a minimum of between 5 to 10+ years of experience.

On LinkedIn, I've taken a LinkedIn Pro 1 month trial to see what the other applicants looked like and for the jobs that I've applied via LinkedIn (around 30ish), half of them were marked as senior engineers. So there was the reason I wasn't getting calls. My guess is that all the laid off engineers from the pandemic are applying to entry level jobs out of desperation and therefore, new graduates can't get anything.

Oh and also, the company that I talked about previously where I did my internships had 5 openings a month ago but in different departments than the ones I worked for. However, the job and tasks were the same as my internships. I left my old bosses as reference in my CV and unfortunately, I haven't gotten a single call for an interview. Again, I've asked my friends inside the company if maybe they were still acquiring CVs and perhaps haven't started giving interviews but they told me that those positions were recently filled.

So here I am sitting here and writing on reddit. However, I'm not ready to abandon yet, I'll keep looking for jobs and from my calculations, I can last another 4 to 6 months on the excess money I have. I'll keep looking and applying but if I don't have anything after that period, I'll have no choice but to apply for minimum salary jobs in order to survive. Also since I'm a new graduate, I can't apply for my government unemployment insurance (which pays well since Covid)."

o0ro51,0,2021-06-15,"Chance Me: Masters in CS (Stanford, CMU, Berkeley, UIUC…) Fall 2022",DeepM1nD,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/o0ro51/chance_me_masters_in_cs_stanford_cmu_berkeley/,"Hey peeps!

I’m looking to enroll in a Master’s program for the Fall 2022 cycle. I’m hella worried that my application is weak for the top schools and I’d highly appreciate it if y’all can Chance Me for these top schools and also other schools like UIUC, GA Tech, etc.

Here’s a little context about what my application will look like:

**Undergrad University (I’m a rising senior):** An international student majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. Also, I’m studying at a top 100 University in the United States.

**GPA:** 4.0/4.0

**Research Experience:** My research experience is pretty limited (I think). I Will have about 2 semesters of research (both of them are separate projects) by the application deadline. However, one of these was not as useful because it was the first time the research program was being held. For clarification, I have no publications.

**Work Experience:** Currently working as a Software Engineering Intern at a Startup. It’s the only one that counts. I had one freshman year but it was, for lack of a better word, useless.

I’ve also served as an undergrad TA and it was a great experience for me. Got a lot of positive words from the students and the professor I worked with. I Will get the position this Fall again but probably won’t take it up because I’ll be busy with research and grad school apps.

**LORs:** I have one professor who will write me a solid recommendation letter because I’ve known/worked with him for over a year now. I can get another solid recommendation letter from my internship manager, who happens to be the CTO of the startup I’m working at. I have 2 more potential options for professors, one of whom can write me a decent letter (“stellar performance in class…”) and one of them would be my future research advisor and I’m not how that will go so… yea

**Coursework:** I’ve taken pretty hard classes like Systems Programming, Intro to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Intro to Data Science, a bunch of math and stats courses too**.**

**GRE:** I haven’t taken the GRE yet but I know I’m capable of getting a 330+. I took a mock test with zero prep and got a 310. Dunno if that helps tho

**Extracurriculars:** Was on the e-board of the school badminton team, am a member of a ton of CS orgs but nothing special. Took part in a couple of hackathons (pre-COVID) but didn’t win anything cuz I was pretty much going for the fun and learning experience. I dropped out of the Honors College cuz I was being challenged in areas I wasn’t passionate about.

I’ve been a Resident Assistant for 3 years now, worked for the admissions office and also worked as a tour guide. Served as a mentor as a result of one of the CS orgs I was part of.

**Target Schools:** Obviously some of the top schools, Stanford being my dream school. Other schools include Berkeley, UIUC, GA Tech, University of San Francisco (Safety). Still looking for Safety schools, please drop recommendation if you have any, I’ll appreciate it

**My Goal for Grad School:** As of now I’m looking for professional Masters’s programs in Computer Science with an emphasis on Data Science- preferably a non-thesis one because I’m not sure I have a competitive profile for it. I haven’t had any great research experiences yet either but I love projects - hence the non-thesis preference.

Thanks in advance guys! I’d really appreciate your feedback and what else I can do to improve my profile. I hope this gives a good background of my application, do let me know if I missed anything that was important.

Peaceeee"
o0s4ai,3,2021-06-15,Should I ghost my friend that’s ghosting me?,roshippy,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/o0s4ai/should_i_ghost_my_friend_thats_ghosting_me/,"Hi Reddit. I’ve been racking my brain over a predicament I find myself in with my best friend of 15 years, let’s call her Lisa. Also - after typing this out I realized this is v long. If you stick it out, thank you. If you throw in your opinion then thank you even extra. 

Lisa has been my best friend since elementary school; we’re in our late 20s now. In high school she remained one of my closest friends, however, she became very shy and introverted and I dabbled in many different groups of friends; always trying to include her and still keeping her very close though. Looking back, I think that she may have been struggling with some social anxiety and perhaps agoraphobia. One example of a “red flag”: for years she came on my family vacations with me and my parents then one day she started to refuse coming over while my parents were there. She did this with her two friends as well (mutual friends - who will be relevant later on). 

A few years ago I noticed she was getting distant with me. She wouldn’t respond to my messages for days/weeks and would cancel on plans last minute to the point where we were hardly ever seeing each other. This went on for a couple of years. At the time my way of dealing with this was to treat her as she treated me, so I started taking longer to respond to texts and didn’t initiate conversation. This didn’t have the impact I wanted it to. Finally, I asked her what was going on… if she was upset with me, and if she even wanted to be friends anymore. We had a good conversation and I found out that replying to text messages gives her anxiety and she has been doing this with everyone - her friends and family. During this we also vocalized frustration with each other in a really healthy way. She said since high school she felt that I always had other friends that I became close with and she didn’t consistently feel prioritized and important. I could empathize with this, since I moved away for college and university and had many part time jobs and internships and my friend groups did shift based on who I was around most. Lisa, on the other hand, didn’t go to school after high school and maintained one job where she also made some new friends. My philosophy since this conversation has been to text her when I’m thinking of her, share funny things from the day or fun memories, memes, etc. with the understanding that it could take a few days or weeks to hear from her but I wanted to prioritize doing what I could to communicate to her how important she is to me. Since then, she had leaned on me and opened up about mental health concerns, and I would tell her about stress in my life as well. We both mentioned that our relationship was better than ever. It felt that there were equal parts give and take. 

When COVID hit, I started hearing from her less and less. She lost her part-time job and there were some unknowns with a schooling program she recently pursued. I maintained my philosophy and would reach out consistently without expecting a response. This went on a for a couple months, then she ended up messaging me and acknowledging her absence. She let me know her grandma passed away from COVID and she was having a hard time. I was supportive and empathetic. She seemed to reach out a bit more in the summer months when the first wave died down. I had experienced a miscarriage in the summer and she was supportive of me through that. Then she got quiet again, reaching out very infrequently. 

She reached out on November 11th to check in on me, she then acknowledged her absence and apologized for it, then I didn’t hear from her until Christmas when she said “I love you so much. Merry Christmas.” This was a long period to not hear from her but not totally unusual. 

At the time of writing (June 15) Christmas is the last time I’ve heard from her.

I have been sending her messages 1-2 times per week of memes, memories, or just telling her I’m thinking of her and I’ve heard nothing back. I got worried about her and reached out to a few (trusted) mutual friends in the new year who have been experiencing the same from her and were worried. Lisa has been living about 1.5 hours away from us with a boyfriend thats she’s had for a few years but none of us know him very well, so after speaking about it with the friends I agreed to reach out to Lisa’s sister, Sam, after I saw Sam post an Instagram video with Lisa. This was in February.

Sam informed me that behind the scenes Lisa has been very appreciative of my reaching out and has said she’s grateful for my friendship. Sam also told me their mom was diagnosed with cancer around November and was in the hospital throughout Christmas but that she was doing much better now. Their father had also recently moved across the country, which Sam assumed had been hard on Lisa but hadn’t discussed with her. I felt reassured after this and asked permission to pass the information onto our two mutual friends that had also been worried. The mutual friends and I created a bit of a “plan” where we would send Lisa one message a week (careful not to overwhelm but also to let her know we’re here) and would correspond with each other if we hear from her. I do feel guilty about this, as Lisa doesn’t know about it and it feels “sneaky” and done behind her back but myself and the friends are all coming from a very good place. 

Fast forward to present day. I found out that Lisa has blocked me on Instagram from seeing her stories. I found this out because I kept getting notifications from an old linked account with her on it that she was posting videos. I’d go to look on my main account and they wouldn’t be there. I figured it was a glitch for months until I clicked the notification and it took me to my old Instagram page… Sure enough, there it was - her Instagram stories. Once I found this out I would check in on her page through my long (almost) forgotten Instagram account and see her posting at least once a week. Usually pictures of nature, or quotes, or a picture with her boyfriend. I shared this with the two mutual friends and found out they were blocked too. In this, we found out she also blocked our significant others and family members. 

The friends (and myself if I’m being honest) have gotten tired of reaching out without hearing back and wonder why she can share her life with the world through Instagram but can’t message us back after seven months. We’ve shared lots of things in these messages- exciting news, sad news and vulnerable messages to keep her in the loop and we get radio silence. On my end, I shared with her that after a miscarriage and a year of trying, I’m expecting my first child. When I was pregnant and miscarried, she was one of the first people I told - before my husband. This time, I told her at nine weeks, as I wanted to give her time to (hopefully) respond before announcing on social media, which I eventually did a month later. 

I’m now 18 weeks pregnant. I’ve heard nothing from her. After seven months of reaching out, I feel like I’m grieving a friend. I don’t know what to do anymore. Should I stop reaching out?"
o0s4mc,0,2021-06-15,How can I get referrals?,monkieman12,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/o0s4mc/how_can_i_get_referrals/,"What’s the best way to get referrals for tech internships if you aren’t close friends with anyone in your major or don’t have any connections in big tech companies?

Should I just cold email people on LinkedIn working in the companies I’m interested in, because that seems really awkward?"
o0spqn,65,2021-06-15,Anyone else interning for a FAANG company and hating it?,mytruezestyfeels,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/o0spqn/anyone_else_interning_for_a_faang_company_and/,"I don’t know who to talk to this about. I’m interning for my first FAANG company and I feel all over the place about it. 

I am super grateful I got the opportunity, and I know I’m doing extremely impactful work, but overall I feel kinda…… not happy. 

Everyone is extremely overworked. No one has time. Hell, I’m overworked. They don’t let me track my hours and I’m contracted at 40 hours a week. I’ve been working 10 hour days pretty consistently off and on and don’t get paid for them. They gave me a HUGE project for the summer that requires a lot of extra work. 

My manager makes me feel like a burden just for asking for a 1:1 once every week or so. When I do get him on the meeting, he seems upset if I just want to talk about the project and have nothing super in particular to review. He’s kinda dismissive. He literally will be on his personal phone smiling and texting while on our meetings. 

I want to mention, this is actually my third internship. I’ve worked at a different (but non FAANG) well known tech company for a year and loved it. This just seems seriously off. 

Is anyone else experiencing this? I won’t quit but I literally feel hollow some days lol."

I worked on school because it was my only escape from a rough home situation and CPS visits. I worked on my job experience because it was the only tangible thing I could do to envision a more stable life. When college application season started in 2020, I applied to 19 schools and put my everything into all of them. I overdid it, mainly because I wanted to ensure that my hard work would pay off in college options. I applied broadly across in state and out of state, ranging across acceptance rates of 80% to 10%.


Do you know how many I got into and could afford? 0. I had to scramble to reapply to a school I never planned on going to within the state. Most of my dream schools rejected me, and other backups gave out a quarter of the aid that their admissions officers discussed with me.


I wish I could say I was okay with how things turned out. My school is letting me graduate a year earlier because they accepted all of my AP credits. It’s cheap enough for me to walk away with less than $5,000 of debt, if any at all. I know that ultimately I’ll get a good education, but the nagging voice in my head tells me that I’m an idiot for working so hard to go to a school with an average GPA of 3.0.


I was poisoned by every adult in life telling me my hard work would be recognized by prestige—that schools would pay the difference for a student who came from a very difference income bracket than their average student. 


If there’s anything I can tell you A2C, it’s that colleges have a different definition of holistic review than you think. Your work is so valuable, but your income is a much bigger piece in your application than you’re allowed to believe. Remember that college is a business and that your worth is so much more than what admissions officers think after a 10 minute review of what you can pay. 


I worked so hard and sacrificed a lot to get to the “good” outcome my parents could be proud of. I have no idea what went wrong."

I’m seeing Quant Research internships for 2022 at places like SIG, Akuna already open. They have been posting full time roles too, but I am not sure if they expect them to be filled immediately.

The other thing is I expect a couple of publications in the coming few months so my application will be much stronger in say September.

I have a take home technical assessment that I have been working on the last few days and I present friday. The assignment asks me to pull insights from one of their data sets and gives me the option of also applying one machine learning algorithm to the data. I have taken courses in machine learning but I am by no means an expert. 

The dataset is from their sales pipeline, and contains their open sales (not closed) as well as the sales that they were able to close. My thoughts were to create a decision tree that targets the deal closed/open column, and then visualize it so that I could point out the attributes that seem to be the most important to closing a sale. 

I created the model and am done with the technical assessment but I am a little bit weary on the results. 

It’s a long shot, but would anybody on this sub want to volunteer to help out a struggling college kid."

I'm an incoming Grad student pursuing the MS Statistics program starting Fall '21. I've decided that I want to apply for CS / SWE internships for Summer 2022 and had a few questions.

1. Will being a non-CS student make it more difficult for me to land interviews?
2. Will *not* having officially taken a Data Structures / Algorithms course make it difficult to land interviews?
3. What can I do to maximize my chances of landing interviews?

I've self taught myself Data Structures and Algorithms (CTCI, YouTube etc.) and have practiced a fair bit on online platforms such as LeetCode. I've also worked on some side projects (using JavaScript / React) and have built a decent portfolio over time. My only worry is that not having a Computer Science background (I have a BS Math / Stats) will result in me missing out on some pretty good opportunities.

Any feedback will be appreciated.

Thanks!"

Too often I’ll see posts by people saying “oh my ECs are actual trash” and then casually mention they’re nationally ranked in a sport and two multiple internships and run multiple clubs.

I feel like it would be easier if I was bad all around because then I wouldn’t get my hopes up. It feels like I should have a better chance with a 1560, and if I had gotten my ass off the couch more it would have. But alas, it is not to be. 

I’ve seen so many stories of students with bad stats and good ECs get into good schools, but I never really see the reverse, and it’s kinda disheartening ngl. Oh well."

o0xm8c,1,2021-06-16,I just got my first job offer after graduation and I'm feeling a little apprehensive about the situation.,choumicho,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/o0xm8c/i_just_got_my_first_job_offer_after_graduation/,"Hello everyone, just for some background: I recently graduated with an engineering degree at a state school (nothing prestigious) on the east coast and initially had a desire to work in the biotech industry. Due to my lack of experience and admittedly weak resume, I have struggled to find a job after applying to 100+ places, but fortune came my way when a family acquaintance offered me a referral at the biotech startup he works at, which is around 3 hours away from my home, also on the east coast (the company has around 50 people). 

&amp;nbsp;

The interview process happened really quickly over the course of 4 days where I had 4 consecutive interviews with HR, hiring manager, rest of team, etc. After all the discussion, they said they liked me but due to my lack of prior experience in the field, they wanted me to start as an intern for the first 6 months, getting paid $20/hr, with the likelihood of being converted into a full time employee.  They verbally gave me the offer today and plan on sending me all the job-related information via email tomorrow. The thing is, the hiring manager told me that they wanted me to come to work by the end of the week, which really wouldn’t work for me as I haven’t even begun to find a place. After talking with HR, I shared with them my moving situation (again, the office is 3 hours away), and asked how much time they could give me, and they said two weeks. But later in the day, I now got an email from HR saying to expect a call from the hiring manager tomorrow to discuss the start date once more as they want me to start sooner.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, given the situation, I just can’t help but feel kind of scared to commit to a situation like this. I know I haven’t had the call yet, but given the research I’ve done about the company and the interviews I had with the team, along with this situation, what once felt like a perfect way to get my foot into the door is now giving me a really bad gut feeling……

&amp;nbsp;

Overall, I’m really not the type of person who can embrace rapid change and I’m not even sure if the small start-up environment is for me. I’ve never worked in an environment like this and generally I would prefer some time before I start working. Also, every review on glassdoor (intern and full time employee alike) talks about how vigorous and intense the workload is. Long hours, crazy amount of work, results oriented culture, it all is really starting to scare me I guess. Also when I interviewed with the employees there, there were a couple times I tried to ask about work-life balance as respectfully as possible, and every worker talked about how busy they were all the time, and how their boss was “very demanding.” They also mentioned the company's high turnover. And at the end of the day, they want me to work ASAP, and are giving me minimal time to make a decision. Also, the position I applied to opened up because the previous person left, so it makes logical sense that they want me ASAP. The thing is, the person I’m replacing was NOT an intern. It makes me feel like I’m about to get ready for some intense work, but with intern pay.

&amp;nbsp;

Do all these things I’ve explained seem like red flags to you guys? Am I overthinking it? I know my gut is telling me this might not be a good idea, but the thing is with my experience this might be all I can get. The fact that I don’t feel 100% passionate about the industry and my degree and even regret my degree isn’t helping me with this process either… I’m really at a loss and they’re calling me tomorrow and I’m not sure what decision to make. I would appreciate any advice. This was more of a vent than anything else, so I really hope someone reads all this. Also declining the offer would probably be pretty awkward after the amount of discussion I've had with my family friend who works there lol."
o0yep6,1,2021-06-16,Azure AI Engineer Associates Certificate,lawfulpossum,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/o0yep6/azure_ai_engineer_associates_certificate/,"Hi, I’m an incoming first year for CS and I haven’t worked with AI/ML before this year, so any guidance would be helpful. 

I’m wanting to get involved in AI/ML during undergrad and get an internship by junior year. Is getting certified through Azure the first step to that? 

I understand I have to have solid projects and experience with python and ML libraries and other languages/ technologies to actually showcase my understanding. I’m working on those as well atm. I wanted to know if the certificate actually helps ones understanding of the field and/or makes ones resume stand out. 

From what I’ve read in previous posts in this subreddit, the only certificates that are worth it are Azure and AWS. I chose Azure because I’m already working on a project using it so I thought it wouldn’t hurt to get certified as well. I don’t want to waste my time on it though if it’s not necessary. 

Also, is it possible to get an internship in AI/ML during your undergrad? In previous posts in this sub I read that they’re very hard to come by if you’re not a grad student. Please let me know what your experience has been. Thanks!

Edit: a lot of the services I see provided by Azure create “no-code solutions”. Idk how much value that would add to me as a programmer."

I'm a software engineer and have lived in America all my life. My family was originally from Ireland and came here around the beginning of the 1900s. \*Technically\* my mom qualifies for Irish citizenship already and if she had bothered to apply before I was born, I would already have it as well, but unfortunately, I just have US citizenship. The company I work for has an Irish office though it isn't as heavily focused on software so while transferring would be possible, options would be limited within the company (this may change? since there might end up being more flexibility for remote work but it's not guaranteed and I don't know how it would work in my case). 

I've been to Ireland before and I just like it. I like the climate (yes, I know, rain, but I like it), I think it's beautiful and tbh the pandemic had me thinking about what I want in life to be happy and I'd like to try living in Ireland. Worst case scenario, it turns out European living isn't for me and I can move somewhere else. The biggest downside would be being farther from family but I already spent years away from them on the other side of the country, so it's not like it'd be a novel issue.

I'm not really sure how to go about this though? Honestly I wish could hand this off to someone and they'd come back with like ""Here's your new job, I filed all the paperwork, go get on this plane"". The job I'm at is the first one I really ever had besides internships I had in college, so I don't really have that much experience with job hunting, though I have transferred teams once before. If I managed to get a job, would I be able to hand off the rest to someone else? To sort out the papers and the move and my dog? What are some good first steps for me to take? 

Thank you!"

I will be attending university in the fall with my major being Computer Science. 

I know very little programming in Java from Highschool and have learned a little bit of Python on my own, programming has caught my interest and is the reason on why I chose CS. 

I plan to study Machine learning as I find it interesting from what I've read about and watched about on YouTube, along with having an attractive salary. 

[EXPECTATIONS]

This is what I have gathered so far:

Machine learning will require me to be good at
-Calculus
-Discrete Math
-Statistics
-Linear Algebra
-Deep Learning Framework such as Tensorflow


I would like to get more confirmation on this and possibly more things to add onto the list as I continue. I am planning on talking with my counselors, professors, and people in the field to help me throughout my bachelor's degree and foward.

I plan on graduating in 2 to 3 years with a Bachelor's CS. I attended Community College for a year to save some money while I took core curriculum classes. I will be taking courses over the summer to help me graduate faster compared to only taking classes during the fall and spring.

Would like to ask those in the field
Title of position?
Salary?
Experience?
Education?

My expectation are to graduate and land a job with a salary of $85,000+ and as I improve, hopefully have a salary of $140,000+ by my late 20's.

Is it true that a Phd's are what employers usually look for when it comes to Machine learning? 

Would also enjoy hearing your experience with any internships you had while in college. 

Are my expectations realistic?
Any advice would also be appreciated.

I am just looking for some advice on what I can do to get ahead.

**Demographics:**

female

mixed race (white and asian)

first-gen American (idk if that means anything)

competitive-ish public school in Bay Area, California

**Intended Major(s):** Biomedical engineering or neuroscience (not sure) w/ premed route (definitely premed!)

**SAT:** I took a Khan academy practice test and got a 1450

(I definitely need to study more, but I have plenty of time I think. I'm studying for the SAT/PSAT this summer!)

**UW/W GPA and Rank:**

4.0 UW, school doesn't weight GPA, but self calculated 4.14W, including outside courses

school doesn't rank, but valedictorian is 4.0 UW GPA, and this year we had 41/650ish valedictorians

**Coursework:**

Freshman year: no APs offered at school, took Chem Honors outside

This summer: Intro to Java through UC Scout

Sophomore year projected: AP Physics 1, Precalc Honors, AP CS Principles (outside), self-study AP Psych

**Awards:**

Gold Presidential Volunteer Service Award (100+ hours through Red Cross)

Small school level award, equivalent to honor roll basically

I plan to do Chemistry Olympiad next year

I also write songs, so I might submit my songs as poems to try to get some awards. Would this be a good idea?

I definitely need some advice and ideas for awards!!

**Extracurriculars:**

1. **Founder and CEO** of an app development company (not saying the name for privacy purposes)

This is pretty new, and I only started this summer, but it’s an app related to autism. I was inspired to start the app because of my autistic brother.

2. **Founder and President of Chemistry Club at my school**

I started it at the end of my freshman year, so this is also pretty recent.

3. **Public Relations Officer of Red Cross Club**

4. **Webmaster of Science National Honor Society Club**

5. **Activities Director of Spanish Club**

These club positions aren’t very impressive, so once I get higher quality ECs I’ll probably cut them out, but I joined a lot of clubs this year since it was my first year of HS.

6. **University of Michigan Math and Science Scholars Program- Orgo Bootcamp**

This summer

3 week-long program through U of M, learning college-level organic chemistry

7. **Columbia University Precollege- Neuroscience of Psychiatric Disorders**

This summer

Not very impressive, but I’m pretty excited about it anyway!

8. **Red Cross International Humanitarian Law Campaign**

I worked with a group of students to raise awareness about International Humanitarian Law. I led presentations at 10+ schools around the area, and we reached 350+ people in total.

I plan to do this campaign again next year, and possibly apply to present the campaign in Washington DC through Red Cross’s Summit event!

9. **Local Youth Climate Action**

I work with a team of youth to advocate for climate change and environmental measures.

&amp;#x200B;

I plan to cold email to try to get a **research position at Stanford University next year,** possibly in neuroscience or bioengineering. I know friends w/ research internships at Stanford that they got through cold emailing.

**Reach schools:** (I don't have a good sense of what is realistic and what isn't, but a girl can dream lol)

Stanford, Columbia, Caltech, USC, UCLA, UC Berkeley

**What could I possibly do this summer and next year to increase my chances of getting into my reach schools?**"

I would like to skip the internship phase, and jump right into an entry level network engineer position. I have a bit of savings to keep things running, both cars paid off, but obviously would like to find a job fairly quickly. I'm not sure how long I have either, these things can take a couple months to over a year it just depends on the doctors.

Any tips or advice on actions I can take now to set myself up for success? TIA :)"
o13mwe,3,2021-06-16,Cheated on my University Assignments by using Chegg,Secret_Thoughts009,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/o13mwe/cheated_on_my_university_assignments_by_using/,"This is a throwaway account. I will try to tell my story as succinctly as possible.

I graduated from an Australian private school in 2018. Got an above average score and studied Commerce at a decent university that required a high ATAR. I did really well in my first year, but then decided to study IT, so I transferred to a much more prestigious University studying IT.

This was when the pandemic hit and everything just went downhill. I lost motivation in my studies and relationships with my friends deteriorated. I ended up failing 5 out of 8 units and barely passed 3 units. In the end, I decided to go back to my previous course.

But I could not find my motivation to study and felt like I had lost my ability to critically think. I struggled with understanding the content. And in a lapse of judgement I stupidly used Chegg to ask questions about my assignments which I have already gotten back and I have felt guilty and ashamed about it.

There is a small chance that the University can find out about my misconduct, but the guilt is eating me up. I can’t focus on my studies and I can’t sleep. I am constantly thinking of scenarios that can happen.

I feel extremely ashamed and embarrassed about this. I have let my parents down who have worked hard to give me a quality education. I feel like a complete fake in the eyes of everyone around me who think I am smart. In reality I am a lazy piece of shit. My high school classmates are nearly graduating and doing internships at Big 4 companies, while I am barely passing. I have completely lost my way and have been really depressed.

My options are to stay and hope they don’t find out or I can transfer to another University from which I have an offer but it is a less prestigious University and less respectable degree.

If I stay I will always have this guilt, always looking behind my back and thinking about the fact that I don’t deserve this degree. On the other hand, if I leave, my conscience will be free but it would leave me wondering what could have been if I had just tried harder in my studies.

It would be great if you guys could please give me some advice and whether you think if its the right choice to leave. My problem with the new course is that it is less prestigious. Will my overall university transcript have any impact on my future career prospects? Should I be worried about the way people think about me if they know my situation? especially my past high school classmates who are quite elitist.

TL;DR Did well in my first year of Commerce, transferred to IT, flunked it and then transferred back to Commerce. Lost my way and struggled with the coursework and as such used Chegg for help with my assignments. This has caused me a great deal of stress and guilt, leading to suicidal thoughts and feelings of letting everyone around me down. Considering staying, hoping the University does not find out or leave and clean my conscience."

I have some questions to ask, mainly can I still resign before this? Or is there anything I can do to make things better for myself and how can I explain this situation to future employers?

Some background, I am part of company A who outsourced me to company B. So I was working at the site of company B but the staff at company B were unfriendly to me and my mentor was ignoring me when I asked questions. I was here for 2 months I did not complain as I did not want my mentor to get into trouble. However since last week she did not reply my message at all even though I was stuck (working from home) so I decided to tell someone from company A about it.

After telling someone from company A, Then the HR from company A called me and scolded me for not saying sooner as company B is not being managed by them and it is up to me to tell them if company B had issues. I know this is not a excuse but I am 23 years old and this is my first job, I did not even understand that when I joined. I had done one internship before this but the internship was nothing like this.

Nevertheless, the HR from company A now told me that it is my fault now and that company A was already telling them that I was unproductive and they do not want me there. But this was the first time I am hearing of this. She told me that they will give me my 2 weeks notice for termination. I feel sad. I feel its not my fault as the mentor was negligent. I am crafting another email to her right now with screenshots and such to tell her the issues with company B I was facing and how I was being ignored which caused a decline in productivity as well as other actions by them which did the same.

The HR told me that they would try to reallocate me to another job but if not possible then my contract will be terminated and my 2 weeks notice will start and my last day will be on the 30th. And she asked me to acknowledge the email. I don't know how to reply to the email. Would this reflect badly on my future employers? I am heartbroken also did not expect it to come down to this or be blamed for everything. Would sending the email with the screenshots even be helpful now?

Edit: As for the termination, is there any way I can handle it better? How does that work, if I reply to their email and acknowlege it then would they send me a letter of termination? Would I need to tell my future employers that I got terminated?"

I worked a great tax internship over spring semester and really enjoyed where I worked. I like my coworkers, gained a lot of really good experience, and enjoyed the work to an extent. They offered me a full time position post graduation and the opportunity to work there through the remainder of college. Sounds good right? Well here’s the tricky part. I had accepted a different internship for the summer long before spring semester. I let the company I worked for during spring semester know I would love to come back after the summer and they happily agreed to have me back after my other internship. I’m currently working that internship now and not enjoying it. My commute went from 10 to 45+ minutes every morning, my team went from in person to remote and very disorganized, and work is slow so there isn’t a whole lot to do. They rejected my request to work remotely, so now I’m stuck driving to the office where likely only one of the people I actually work with will be working from. I took the internship to boost my resume/experience and try out a different firm, now I’m questioning why I’m here at all.

So here’s the big question, do I stick it out and have a less that ideal summer working situation but get another name on my resume, or do I try to go back to the company I worked for in the spring and start enjoying my job again?"

Job 1 is actually a post-grad internship. Hourly wage is ~12/hr with time and a half for OT. I’d be working about 40 hours a week and the internship lasts 10 months. 

Job 2 is a part time on-call position so I’d be working pretty crazy hours (overnight and early morning), but the hourly wage is ~25/hr, and the first interviewer said it may become a full time position in the future. 

I could see myself at both jobs, but Job 1 does seem much more exciting to me personally and also has more regular working hours and I believe would be less physically and mentally demanding. 

Job 2 has higher pay and I would get benefits and potentially become a full time employee. I know this company also moves people up the ladder fairly quickly, so that could be a benefit. 

I’m interested in both jobs, and I’m torn between taking a higher paying and more secure but also more taxing job vs. a lower paying internship with less security but is also less taxing and has more regular hours. Since it’s an internship I think they’d be less demanding of me, but I’m not sure. 

Should I go with what I think I’d be happier doing even if it pays less and is really only temporary?"

My grades are good, I'm a double major and double minor with strong extra- and co-curriculars, and have been on research teams since my first semester (though no publications. long story but not necessarily damning to me), and am confident I will do well on the GRE and have great letters of rec from my professors and internships.

One of my professors - a highly accomplished individual who has contributed to some of the founding research in my field - said I'd have a shot at PhD programs right out the gate, despite my lack of publications. So, now I'm looking at both masters and PhDs.

My question comes with the niche field aspect - I've looked at easily 50+ schools, and currently have only 5 that would be applicable to my interests and have relevant professors/research labs. Two of those schools have both a master's and a PhD in the field I'm interested in. Should I apply to both MS and PhD? Or would that send some sort of wrong message? I want to send an inquiry email in the fall to the professor(s) I am interested in working with - should I mention this to them?

Also, sort of a bonus question... When the time comes for applications/interviews, if I am asked about where I'm applying should I say that I'm applying to both masters and PhD? I think my reasoning is sound - it's a niche field with limited academic opportunities, and I am prioritizing finding programs that speak to my research interests over the exact nature of the degree, on my way to the end goal of a PhD. Or, would that send mixed signals about my ambitions?

o1erpk,434,2021-06-16,So you wanna CyberSec?,Mean-Resolution4294,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/o1erpk/so_you_wanna_cybersec/,"  

I see a lot of requests for info on how to get into Cyber Sec. This is my response. 

I am a security architect with experience in Oil and Gas, Higher Education, DoD, Hospitality, Banking, and Advertising. I have been practicing security for 18 years. 

There are 2 major routes in Cyber Security. 

Auditing and Engineering. 

Security Engineers are responsible for engineering Security Solution implementation. These implementations include Patch Management, Configuration Management, Log Flow, Firewalls, Threat Intelligence, Incident Response, Disaster Recovery Engineering, and most Security software integrations. The best security engineers are hackers. This is not always a process oriented path. 

Security Auditors are responsible for checking the effectiveness of Security Solutions. Activities include Threat Assessment, Compliance and Vulnerability Scanning, Application Security Testing, Auditing of Infrastructure, and administrative tasks such as reviews of Application requests. This is a process oriented path. 

After you have been in the industry for a while you can become a Security Architect.

The Security Architect would implement Security frameworks and ensure a risk-based approach is taken for each project. A Security Architect would design Policy and implementation for the Security Operation Center, Data Loss Prevention and Data Protection, Architectural Engineering, Configuration Management and Guidance, Application Security Development and Secure Software Development Lifecycle, Network Security Design and Risk Assessment processes. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Concepts to know when entering the field and samples of work needing to be done. 

## Forensic Viability

Forensic viability is critical for you to respond to and investigate threats. If the logs are not there. That is the end of the investigation. This normally represents a significant investment into a SIEM. Practice on events like newly installed software. Where did it come from, where was it installed from? Forensic viability is when you are able to investigate events and come out with satisfactory results. If the SIEM was setup to log HTTP requests, an alert could easily be made to look for “OpenVas” in the header. More difficult but doable alert is to look at traffic from a pen/vuln scan and alert on the behaviors or types of malformed URLs. Sites like “Shodan.io” and “BitSight” are scanning you with free tools and publishing the data with out your consent. This traffic should be detected and blocked. 

## Passwords

Even with a great password policy and great implementation, passwords fail as a technology. Primarily, because “something you know” is often easily stolen from the user at no fault to the user. Another reason is that passwords over time can be leaked and that then presents a perpetual threat. Humans reuse passwords. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) comes in the forms of “something you know”, “something you are” and “something you have”. Most multi-factor systems will include a device as “something you have”. Using “something you have” and “something you know” is still weak to information being stolen from the user. Most MFA systems rely on the user to input data for the “something you have” like a 6 digit code. These are considered minimum security for modern systems. There are solutions that promote a password-less environment. Their systems are “something you are” (mobile bio metrics) and something you have(mobile device). In addition to providing a password-less environment the passwords to user accounts can be set to random and very complex passwords. These systems are much harder to hack. 

## “Social and Public Data monitoring” 

Public data research finds leaked passwords and potential company information on 3rd party sites like GitHub. I recommend checking for public information monthly. This would include getting data from password leaks, google hacking, and domain reconnaissance. Colonial Pipeline was hacked via publicly exposed information. 

## “Continuous Vulnerability Management” 

Scanning for vulnerabilities should be a daily task. New vulnerabilities that are critical need to be addressed with in a timeline set by policy. My recommendation is scanning every 24 hours and have a Plan of Action and milestones within 48 hours. The logic is that new vulnerabilities are often weaponized within 48 hours of publication. The hostile scanners often start mass scanning of newly published vulnerabilities within hours. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This is obscenely over generalizing as the depth of the fields specialties is “a mile wide and a mile deep”. 

Take it one step at a time. There are lots of jobs out there on Dice.com and LinkedIn. Look at job descriptions and find one that interests you. The requirements are often overbearing, but it does become a list of things to study. Wanna know what to study? Look at job descriptions. 

Certifications are valuable. 

Degrees are nice but I would take 4 years XP over a 4 year degree any day. Internships are a viable process to get in the industry."

I am working on a machine learning project for my summer internship and was hoping someone could help. I am new to the field of ML and am still learning so please bear with my attempt for an explanation.

I am given input (x value) continous numerical data for multiple bioreactors (20), which include PH, agitation rate, glucose level, etc. Data from each bioreactor is in intervals of 30 minutes and collected for 11 days. This yields about 500-600 rows of data per bioreactor. Each bioreactor has only one corresponding output (y value) that represents the product quality (final titer). So only one row as an out put per bioreactor.

How do I train a ML model with an input and output relationship being many to one? In other words, how can I train my model with the 11 day continuos data for each bioreactor to predict the singular output product qualties? Any resources relating to this would be really helpful!

I am hoping to grab something more coding-oriented. I am a beginner when it comes to coding but would love to work with someone in an internship to learn more. Where I am now, there aren't many options as far as in-person internships (I'm in the rural south....).

Any advice? Are remote internships even a thing?"

What have I got going for me?

* Had a A- average last year
* Made a Twitter clone with React, Node.js, Redis and PostgreSQL (This is my best personal project, everything is documented and on GitHub, as well as a link to an online demo in my CV)
* Basic multithreaded trading bot in C++
* Doing almost every undergrade CS course at my university
* Last year I did a course that was a intro to computer systems &amp; embedded systems  
This year I'm doing the course following that which goes into operating systems
* Ray tracing project from a computer graphics course I just completed
* A few other uni assignments that aren't worth mentioning (networking in Python, Vue.js &amp; Node.js)

My worries

* Haven't done an internship (almost got one too but they told me they started hiring too late in an email after the interview..)
* I did two group projects last year, one of them is embedded development in C. (the other one is not really worth mentioning as its in Java and hardly implements any design patterns)
* I'm not doing any final year 'massive' group project.  
My uni does offer one but its so intense and requires 15 hours a week of logged activity as well as being a year long course. So I didn't want to risk failing and changed courses to ensure I graduate. 

The thing is, I've been applying to grad jobs and almost everyone has a one-way interview and I just don't know anymore if I'm a complete failure that will not find a job after I graduate.

My current on-going personal project is a basic HTTP server in C++.

There is one company that I will be trying to get into (the internship I almost got), so I'm trying to make a lot of projects in C++ to  make me standout when they start hiring next but I just feel like all my progress is so insignificant.

TLDR: Doing every undergrade CS course + two CE courses, no final year group project, no internship, a few personal projects and I feel like I'll struggle with the job market as I'll be competing with chad software eng majors who have way more group experience and an internship.

Note: I'm studying in Australia and my BSC is a three year degree."

&amp;#x200B;

I did help desk at my university for two-years, had a few internships in IT here and there that equaled a year or so of experience, then got a full-time position working for the DoD doing Field Service IT work out of college. Did that job for 10 months, then was offered a position as a Systems Administrator for a small company (80+ people) in my town. I got a Bachelor's in MIS and currently getting my Master's in Cyber Security. Throughout my time working for the government I attained my Sec+, Net+, CEH and CHFI during my downtime when I was able to catch up on studying.

&amp;#x200B;

Flash-forward to now, I put in my two-weeks at my government job and was offered a position as a Systems Admin with a 12% salary increase. Now, going from traditional help desk/field service IT work to Systems Administration seems a tad intimidating to me. I've done some stuff with Hyper-V, played around with VMs, including Windows Server and whatnot, but I'm honestly a little terrified but also looking forward to this. My employer said that they didn't mind that I was still learning things in regards to servers, switches and virtualization, since I was very forthcoming on my schooling and all of my accomplishments on the job and during school. I would be working the help desk, since it's just me and the systems engineer who is working IT, and would be doing Admin work when the help desk slows down. On paper my job title is: Systems Administrator, but the description is more in-line with a Junior Sys Admin with the pay to match.

o1hvoi,2,2021-06-16,I've been given an opportunity for a 6 month internship at a start up and I can't tell if I'm being paranoid or not.,choumicho,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/o1hvoi/ive_been_given_an_opportunity_for_a_6_month/,"Hey guys, so I graduated 1 month ago from a pretty well known university but not the greatest experience (definitely not 0, but its not all ""engineering"" related per say). I got a referral from a friend that works at a startup in the industry that I'm decently interested in. After interviewing however, they told me that due to my lack of experience they rather start me off with a 6 month internship, being paid 20$/hr.

&amp;nbsp;

This seems fine and all just for the sake of getting some experience/getting my foot into the door but after knowing that I was given the offer, there were a few things that turned me off from the opportunity.

Firstly, the environment is apparently very tough and rigorous. Every review of the company on glassdoor (even the good ones) talk about getting worked harder than you've ever been worked before, long hours, etc. Knowing who I am, I'm just not too sure if I'm the type of person to enjoy this type of environment. 

&amp;nbsp;

On top of this, when I interviewed with the team, one of members who's been there for about 1.5 years talked about how he's been given a lot of responsibility since working there (and he said this NOT in a good way). He talked about how demanding his boss was, and the admittedly poor work-life balance. Now to clarify, he didn't say that last part outright, but basically implied it after I asked about how work-life balance was as respectfully as possible. He mentioned the high turnover rate of the company as a cause for all the work.

&amp;nbsp;

The final thing that got me worried was my start date. HR originally told me they would be flexible and give me time to find a place, since the company is around 3 hours away from me but I don't have a car so I'll need to find a place that is connected to the company via public transportation. However, HR updated me saying the hiring manager wanted me in ASAP. They updated me yesterday that I need to come in by the end of the week, which I thought was a bit ridiculous to expect. After vocalizing my concerns about moving, they then adjusted to wanting me there by next Tuesday/Wednesday at the latest, and if I couldn't do that then my offer would be rescinded. Again, I told them I could try my best but it might be very difficult to find housing. HR then told me that they're communicating with management to figure something out and they'll update me soon.


&amp;nbsp;
This entire situation has just got me worried a lot. Also, its in the bay, and while my parents said they can help me in certain areas financially, I'm not sure if the rate they're giving me is going to be okay for me.
Are the things I'm discussing in the post usually seen as legitimate ""red flags""? Am I being paranoid? My gut is telling me to not consider this unless they can be more flexible. My parents (who I live with) feel I should decline the offer because I'm not in a desperate position and they rather see me look for a full time job. I guess I'm also a bit worried this might be the only opportunity I have, but at the same time if I except this I'm pretty sure it will make looking for another job very difficult. I'd appreciate others input on my situation!"

My interests are Graphic Design, Web Dev (UI/UX design) right now. I'm currently doing a graphic design internship. 

In my college it is mandate for us to do a core internship in my third year, for which the companies visit in August, but without a project, my chances for getting an internship are skim, although there is a 12 week long online course that I can complete in a month, so I could some project experience from there. 
But, I want to do a webdev internship instead, so that I can further myself in that direction (I do have projects in this field though), but for that I'll have to do a ton of CP. 

So basically the problem is:
Do I give up on coding internships and commit myself to the ChemE route to secure an internship in core for the summer
OR
Do I pursue the webdev path and try to sit for tech companies for internships

Major problem in deciding is, if I miss out on college provided internships, how much difference will it make? 

Now there is a solution I thought of, that in my winter break, I could do the webdev internship by finding opportunities not provided by my college, and for summer I could do a core internship, or vice versa. But the problem is studying, I can only focus on either core or tech to prepare for the internship exams.

I do not possess any relevant/distinguished internships and all the projects I have done were something that I am not quite too confident about.

Now I have been actively applying/studying (with a mediocre resume I feel like) in order to get a SWE role but haven't had much response besides a QA role from ""Charter communications"" in St.Louis which I am not very enthused about. I have even thought about doing a coding boot camp to stamp out some projects. Reality has hit me quite hard this past few days and I don't know if I should take the QA role for a year and prepare for the dev role or turn it down and just do personal projects (what do you suggest are some of the projects that may help my resume) until I get a dev role."

All in all, I think my essays were above-average. I spent a lot of time working on each one, however, given that I am not a naturally amazing writer, they were nothing special in the grand scheme of things.

The trickiest thing is that once this internship ends, 99.99% chance that I receive an offer within a month or two from big oil for the next Summer on, which is obviously before any other recruiting happens.

o1ozz5,2,2021-06-17,chances? (transfer),johnshook,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/o1ozz5/chances_transfer/,"Hello,

I was wondering if someone could provide me with some feedback regarding my chances of getting into university. I am currently at a community college, and going into my third year.

Background:

In high school I was mainly into playing sports, and as expected I slacked in school and did not study. My GPA was roughly a 3.4, SAT was a 1310 (one attempt), no ACT. I did make the honor roll at my high school school a few times, and was on the athletic leadership counsel as a two sport varsity captain. All that's to say that I do have some achievements from high school, although nothing too impressive. In high school I applied for some California state schools and got into Sacramento, Humboldt, San Jose and Fresno, but decided to attend junior college to play football. After my first semester of college, my GPA was a 2.3 because I was not trying at all. I decided to quit football and devote all of my focus and energy to academic pursuits. I eventually decided to dual major in Mathematics &amp; Physics. Ever since I made this decision, my GPA has been a 4.0, bumping my cumulative GPA to a 3.73. I became a peer tutor/teaching assistant in mathematics for my school, got an internship for junior college students through NASA, (National Community College Aerospace Scholars) and did well enough to move on to the second phase. As it turns out I actually have a decent aptitude for mathematics and enjoy the subject a great deal, studying in my free time and trying to gain as much knowledge as possible (got my hands on some upper division textbooks). I have also taken it upon myself to learn computer programming because I know I will need it at some point. I also have work experience.

Based on this, I was wondering what my chances of getting into universities are? My top schools are; UC Davis, UC Irvine, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and my dream school is Stanford. I understand that Stanford is extremely competitive, but they claim they look at applications holistically, and I feel my situation proves that I am well-rounded and if I set my mind to something I achieve it.

If anyone has any knowledge they can share with me on my chances, or how I can strengthen my future application, I would really appreciate it.

Best wishes,

o1qadp,2,2021-06-17,How to properly tell a company that I need some time to consider their offer?,KevinAlc0r,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/o1qadp/how_to_properly_tell_a_company_that_i_need_some/,"Hi all,

TL;DR I did an interview with company A and B, In the past, I did an internship with company A and will really love to work with them again, right now I am in the middle of a series of interview process with company A. However, company B sent me a contract to sign even though I only did one interview with them yesterday, which is very surprising (they seem very eager to hire me) and there is no guarantee that I will get a job with company A because I am still in the middle of an interview. But deep inside I want to work for company A because I like their working environment, company culture, role, etc. How do I tell company B that I need some time to think this through and have some time to finish my interview with company A.

Full Version:

I need help with making a career decision. So a little bit about myself, I am an International graduate student studying Civil Engineering in Taiwan. My nationality is actually not Taiwanese. Recently I have been looking for job opportunities since I am going to graduate soon. Last year, I did an internship working as a BIM engineer with a large engineering company (let's call it company A), I did quite a good job and got noticed by my supervisor for my proactive working approach and my problem solving skills. Back to the present day, I saw online through a Taiwanese job-seeking website (you may say it is Taiwan's LinkedIn-equivalent) that company A is opening a job position in the same department that I interned before. So without hesitating I applied for the job and emailed my past supervisor expressing my interest to work with them again. My past supervisor emailed me back saying that I would be a great candidate for the position.

Long story short, I did an interview with them two days ago, my past supervisor just explained to me in more detail about the job position and the HR discussed some welfare system and salary system that the company uses in hiring an expat (I am considered an expat since I am a foreigner seeking a job in Taiwan). However, I need to do two more interviews with them, one is a technical interview where they want to see my skills (although I have no worries about this), and one last interview with the vice president. I agreed to do all of the subsequent interviews, they should be scheduled next week

As with any other job seeker, I did apply for other job postings and didn't want to limit my possibility. Another company (let's call it company B) invited me to come to their office for an interview. So I did an interview with company B as well yesterday. However, they seem very eager to immediately hire me and sent me a contract to sign this morning, even though I just did an interview with them yesterday. This is very surprising and not something that I expect at all. The thing is, company B is smaller than company A (which I don't actually think is bad at all), and they offer me a position as a Structural Engineer, the salary and welfare offered by both company A and B are pretty similar so they are not an issue here. How do I properly tell company B that I need some time to think things through? considering that I am still in the interview process with company A?

This may sound selfish, but deep inside, I really want to work for company A, I love their working environment (They are actually a subsidiary of an American company so their working environment is more liberal and less strict compared to other Taiwanese companies), I love working with my past supervisor, he is a great guy; and more importantly, I really love working as a BIM Engineer more than a Structural Engineer. However, there is no guarantee that I will be accepted to work for Company A (I know this might seem strange since I did an internship with them, but I am an expat and anything can change their mind). Company B already offers me a contract and in this time and age, finding a job is no easy feat. This sounds like a first world problem, but I really want your guys' opinion about this. How do I properly say that I need some time to think over their contract and to let me explore some other options?

Thanks in advance guys!"

Company has a summer internship for high schoolers. They each get an old desktop and access to one folder on the company drive. Kid can’t find his folder. It happens sometimes with how this org was modified fir covid that our server gets disconnected and users have to restart. I tell them to restart and call me back. They must have hit shutdown because 5 minutes later I get a call back it’s not starting up. .. long story short after a few minutes of trying to walk them through it over the phone I walk down and find he’s been thinking his monitor is the computer. I plug in the vga cord (he thought was power) and push the power button. 


Still can’t find the folder…. He’s looking on the desktop. I open file explorer. I CAN SEE THE FOLDER. User “I don’t see it.” I click the folder. User “ok now I see the folder.” I create a shortcut on his desktop. I ask the user what he uses at home…. an iPad. What do you use in school? iPads.

**Demographics:** female, southeast asian (fil-am &amp;amp;lt;3), new jersey. my area is definitely really competitive, but my high school is in the bottom half of county rankings. we almost never send students to ivies if it's not w an athletic scholarship. no hooks atm, but additional note below ""schools"" section.

**Intended Major(s)**: comparative literature, english, political science

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:** 1530 SAT (740R/790M)

**Essays/LORs/Other:**

- writing personal essays is literally my life, i hope they're unique and notable when i finish them!
- i predict my LOR's to be slightly above average because i'm fairly close with my guidance counselor and very close with the teachers i'm asking.
- i plan to send an additional LOR from my piano teacher to whatever school will accept it. he wrote a high school app LOR for me a few years ago and i cried at the things he told me he wrote. imagine your best friend, who always sees the best in you even when you can't see it, writing an LOR for you :’).

**Schools:**

i realize that i'm asking for a reverse chance me but just for reference, i'm currently looking at rutgers, boston university, and barnard college. please recommend some schools you think i should look into! my only criteria for now is strong humanities programs, a separate music/performing arts school, and in the northeast region + virginia + dc. thanks in advance!



***NOTE:*** recently, i began the process of recruitment for an ivy league school through an academic department. the connections i'm building at the moment are with recruiting directors and they compared my situation to recruiting for athletic programs. however, i've never heard of anything like this before so i'm not sure how to explain it w/o revealing too much—but it includes visiting the school, meeting dept. heads, and submitting extra materials w my application. **if u have knowledge on ""admissions advocacy"" and recruitment at schools OUTSIDE of athletic recruitment PLEASE pm me.**

o1ryl7,4,2021-06-17,I'm finding it impossible to handle college in this environment.,[deleted],india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/o1ryl7/im_finding_it_impossible_to_handle_college_in/,"I am a first year btech student and knew that college would be a lot of work but this year has been unbearable.

During our orientation, the principle promised that no class would go on for more than 45 minutes so we can get a break. This was broken on the first day. Classes go on for longer than an hour just to be immediately followed by the next. This one teacher kept in for 45 minutes but stopped the day he realized no other teacher was following the rule. Once a week we have classes till 5:15 PM. No different from school, teachers are head on on finishing the syllabus and so have been taking extra classes on weekends or before our classes start in the morning. Even if we don't attend the classes we have 5+ lab assignments which we have to complete solely based on simulations or videos. I wouldn't have minded the assignments if they weren't of subjects irrelevant to the course I had taken. I'm a Computer student and had to do 40+ assignments in subjects like physics, chemistry, engineering drawing etc. We were given just 1 week off after our first semester and close to no holidays for Diwali and year end. It feels like the college thinks that since we are at home they can take as much of our time as they want. We were to have these workshop classes based on physical activities like carpentry. These being impossible to simulate, they gave us 6 multiple essay-long questions assignments for these subjects to be completed in under two weeks. When we asked for a session to clear our doubts, they refused. The end-sem exams getting over this week was supposed to be a sign of relief but they've given us more workshop assignments to solve in our break. We were given no break between classes and vivas where teachers asked us questions on experiments they didn't teach because there were no good simulations available. We're paying 2.8L of fees with no intention to reduce it from their side. I'm really paying for being too dumb for JEE and CET. I feel really guilty for having my parents pay for this. I can't work in this environment and I am learning nothing. I am doing two internships but both are unpaid.

It feels like the college has no empathy towards us, they ignored our letter of request to reduce workload. I get told to respect their efforts in this limiting environment while they continue to ignore our lack of resources and environment to study in, in fact they get mad at us for not interacting in the class, which I understand is annoying but it's really difficult.  My only way for learning things of my interest is to lose sleep and my physical and mental health has been in a constant decline. The lack of understanding from the college and parents makes me feel like I am incapable of higher education but I know I could've done all of this work, heck I have in 11th and 12th grade, if only this were offline. Since that is not an option, I could really do with just a little relaxation from the college's side. I'm really sorry for those who read this just to realize it's a privilege fueled rant while people have much bigger problems."
o1rzkw,2,2021-06-17,Would this be petty of me? A hypothetical situation that may not occur,ChickenDinnerGuy,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/o1rzkw/would_this_be_petty_of_me_a_hypothetical/,"I was a shy boy in 5th grade but I liked this girl in my class. Lets call her Samantha. I told my buddies and they told her. To my surprise she liked me too according to her friends. I was a kid so I didn't know what to do. She didn't attend this school after 5th grade.

Forward to high school. I was still shy. To my surprise again I find out Samantha attended the same school and in some of my classes. All I was able to do during the first year was to pretend she didn't exist. She was nice though because she made the effort to speak to me. I eventually talked to her and we developed a nice friendship if you will. She was somewhat popular and had a popular boyfriend. I was always shy. On a Valentine's Day I walked with her and gave her a stuffed animal as a way to show her that I was into her. Nothing came of it.

After graduating high school we were enrolled in an internship for the summer. A few of Samantha's close friends were in it too and I was cool with them. At this point I improved my look but I was still shy and quiet. I don't know if Samantha was still dating her friend however. We saw each other every day during the internship and even hung around a few times.

A few of her friends took advantage of me when I bought lunch at a fast food place to the new internship girl, who was very attractive by the way. I bought her lunch because it was her first day, we had all asked her to join us and she did not bring money because she brought her own lunch. Samantha's friends took advantage and got in line when I was ordering food. Sam didn't do that. But I think she kindly asked me to get her lunch sometime and said just her because I had treated the other girls. I was excited so I agreed.

The new girl was paired up with me at the internship so I was able to spend a lot of time with her and I ended up liking her. She had a boyfriend however. One time Sam called me and asked me where I was. I told her I was at my building and she said she was on her way. I was actually on my way to my building because I tagged along with the new girl who went to get starbucks. Sam arrived at my building before me and think she saw me with the new girl and got mad. She thought I lied to her. She decided to cancel our lunch too.

Still in the internship, I was with Sam's friends and they told me Sam liked me. It wasn't the first time they teased something like this. They had done it before. But I was very shy and had no experience. Besides I was a bit angry at Sam because one day she said I was like a brother to her. I can't remember the whole conversation but I was with Sam, her friends, and a guy from the internship. I don't recall the conversation either but boy did her comment hurt.

After the internship we didn't see each other. A few years later we talked a little bit on Facebook. That was it and at some point I deleted my account just because I didn't want to be on it. Today I was reminiscing about people I met and thought of her and was wondering WHAT IF we bumped into each other again. And if we did, would she still feel something for me? It's a hypothetical scenario but I don't know what I would do if that happened. Part of me is still pissed she said I was like a brother to her and maybe she never wanted to date me because I wasn't popular. I never asked her out though. The other part of me would like to bump into Sam again and see if it leads to something. I am very different than what I was like in High School. Over 10 years have passed since then so she'd be different too.

It wouldn't be hard to locate her. There's always facebook. I could activate my account again and maybe I'd still be on her friends list. Or I could ask a relative of hers. This is just wishful thinking. It's cute to me that she apparently liked me in 4th grade, and then again around high school. Maybe now as adults things could be different."

Masters in Data Science.

The US is mainly portraited as the place to be for the area in which I want to grow, resulting in me wanted to go there. I solved over 1k+ leetcodes but just can't seem to get invited for interviews.

I want to make the jump to the US but can't seem to make it happen and I need some help, is there anything I can do to make the chance of an interview substantially higher? I am confident in the interviews themselves.

My personal projects:

● Football predictions: Created a football (soccer) predictions website showing the predictions made versus the actual score. It updates automatically every monday through my Raspberry Pi.

● Coaching-app: I took 6 days to learn react/firebase and create an app which I could use to monitor and test the knowledge of my athletes.

Education: Bachelor's degree, computer science
Relevant experience: Did 2 internships with the very company that has me worried

I was amazed when I got a job offer in February. It was a written job offer. I signed it happily. I had interned for this company twice, and was going to gain a spot with the same team I interned with. I felt all set in terms of my job search (which may have been a mistake at the time) so I didn't apply to other places after signing on the offer. I got a reply email in March that I should expect to receive emails with more details and virtual trainings in the coming weeks.

Those emails have never came. I have emailed multiple times, starting from when I was closer to graduating for the semester. None of my emails ever received replies. I have been successfully able to reach them by phone and was told I would need to sign a new offer letter. They said everything was delayed by a new process. A person within the company told me that they were re-structuring job requirements at the moment. I've reached out multiple times, still no real progress on getting my job to start. I signed this offer in February, but still had more schooling left to do. The offer required that I graduate so I wasn't as concerned with the initial lack of communication, but I'm about a month out of school since graduating. I'm glad to have a little break, but I'm getting impatient, maybe? The offer letter I was given didn't have a start date written, just job title and salary along with requirements (graduation, drug test, etc). This company has already gotten their summer interns hired and started in their positions, although interns probably wouldn't be affected.

I'm trying to learn android app development in my freetime to have more skills so this isn't too much of a waste. (I am also making sure to try to enjoy my little vacation by seeing my friends.)

I absolutely LOVE learning about and working on everything I’m learning. I love getting a good flow going because I can just keep going for hours and not even realize it. But, that’s not the point. Here’s why I’m in a weird spot: because I went to a different university first, most of my gen Ed courses had already been completed. There were a couple I had to take this past year, but not many. This has also turned what would be a 4 year degree into a 3 year degree. Anyways, fast forward to now. I’ve only taken a few CS courses as they are pre reqs for everything else, those being courses on basic computing, learned a few languages, OOP, basic version control, discrete math, and little tastes of data structures but not too in depth as that’s it’s own class. As you can see, I haven’t learned a lot up to this point. However, due to degree requirements, I need to apply to internships THIS fall. I’m worried that I may not even receive interviews as I don’t have much experience or work to show as I haven’t been doing this long. However, by the end of the year (going into summer where I should have an internship) I will have a total of 30 more degree credit hours in the CS field, meaning a ton more experience. This is a pretty large gap in knowledge that will be filled, but I’m not sure how to show this. I’m sure it’s something I could explain in an interview if I get one, but that’s if I get one.

o1zuf4,7,2021-06-17,MBA Program Research – A Complete Guide,MBAPrepCoachcom,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/o1zuf4/mba_program_research_a_complete_guide/,"Likely you’re at the beginning of this research process. There’s time before Round 1 deadlines, but you really need to use it wisely. I’ve laid out a guide below that will help you get your ducks in a row as you begin.

**Have A Plan**

Get focused. Don’t just walk into this process waiting for something to jump out at you. That is a bit like going into the grocery store without a list. You forget what you went in there for and walk out with everything that seemed cool and interesting at the time. Yet you still have nothing to make for dinner.

**You Now + MBA = Goal**

Think about what needs to happen in business school for you to become a viable candidate for your post-MBA career goal. Read that again and let it sink in. **You now + MBA transformation = You + post-MBA job.** What do you need to accomplish? That might mean learning a second language, mastering a specific industry, or getting leadership experience under your belt.

**The Fit Factor**

Once you have done the networking and research on your career goal, and evaluated what you need to get out of b-school to get there – think about what you need out of business school (which is not the same as what needs to happen above). **FIT is paramount**. Yes, fit means finding the recruiters you want to talk with at the school, but applicants grossly underestimate the importance of fit in other ways. Six years after obtaining my MBA I went to work for corporate marketing and everyone thought it was such a great job. I left a job where I was happy leading a large team for more money and the illusion that I would be happier working for a hot, elite company. However, this was against my own inner guidance and the advice of a recruiter who had thought the company culture would be too uptight and stifling for me.

**“Brand” Won’t Make You Happy**

Continuing with my own example, the company I was with recycles a very regimented, lockstep marketing calendar year after year. This was totally counter to my high need for individual expression. I had to tiptoe around corporate leadership – and was asked to cater to them as if I was an inferior being. The job was more about rules than creativity, and when I explored other jobs within the company, it was more of the same. To sum it up: I was miserable. And the only person who dressed up for Halloween.

My point here is that school rankings are nothing more than journalistic fodder. Review employment stats and alumni placements. Take a close look at instruction type. What works best for you? What is the feeling you get when you’re on campus? Or when you watch student-created YouTube videos? Pay attention to that. Do you feel a sense of expansion or contraction? What commonalities do you notice among alumni that you speak with? Do they all seem serious, playful, creative, or formal? Spend time learning about your values and **choose in accordance with those that will make sure you are happy and successful** in b-school.

**The “How”**

Getting down to the nuts and bolts. I personally find it unimaginable to pick a b-school sight unseen – that is like getting married at first sight (and if you have seen the TV show you know how badly that can turn out). This is a lifetime affiliation. No divorce allowed. I urge you to make the campus visits happen. However, if you are living in the middle of Zambia, like one of my clients, or Covid restrictions are still making that difficult, it might not be an option. I would encourage you to take full advantage of social media, YouTube in particular. Locate the student videos that give you a snapshot of what it feels like to be there. School culture varies widely. Most student-run organizations have a Facebook presence; reach out, take an interest. Set up a “school research” email and sign up for everything.

Connect with alums on LinkedIn – this is a very underestimated resource. Find out what you need to learn to position yourself for that ideal job. Some schools actually have formal networking opportunities. For example, in the summertime, you can reach out to speak with Haas MBA students who are completing their summer internships. Which brings me to an important point – sign up for online admissions events as much as possible, and any in-person events in the city where you currently live. So, in a nutshell: Admissions events, in person and online. Alumni interviewing. YouTube. Facebook. School newsletters. LinkedIn. Campus visits if at all possible.

**Using What You’ve Gathered**

Now, what to do with this research? Well, once you’ve shortlisted schools, look for activities that will help you become a strong, viable candidate for your post-MBA goal. Strategically identify the activities best suited to bring about the +MBA transformation for you. As for the applications, go deep rather than wide. Spend words discussing a few things in depth, as opposed to packing in random crap. I’ve read hundreds of essays and believe me, writing a 500-word essay about a dozen clubs you plan to start on campus makes you look like an unrealistic idiot. You will have to spread your time between classes, recruitment, networking, clubs, externships, mentorship, speaking events, the list goes on. 

Take note of the fact that nothing irritates the adcom more than having to read essay after essay that simply regurgitated the course catalog or a list of student organizations. They know. They are aware. You want to mention these, but only after giving them **context** – meaning – your **goal**. Please remain steadfast in your awareness that they are **reading the application to learn about you**. Not learn about the school or its offerings. Good essays are personal and specific. 

**Your App Is A Pitch**

My advice would be for you to research schools the way you would research a business plan, because it’s really quite the same! The business of YOU is in full-swing, which assets do you need to build? Remember that the schools are investing dollars in you, so your goal is to look like an investible opportunity. It’s Shark Tank, only the product you are pitching is you. Showing that you’ve done your homework will help you develop a consistent, solid plan to present. The goal is to inspire adcom to give you a seat, because you would leverage the opportunity and make good use of their money. You would be a great addition to their community and reflect well on the program."

For context: I'm an incoming CS freshman (from the US); will apply to as many Big Tech (and small company) internships as possible.   


* Are high school grades or any aspect of an applicant's high school career asked for in the application process?

&amp;#x200B;

* For those that have been accepted into Big Tech internships as a freshman, what aspects of your college career were asked for in your application? 

&amp;#x200B;

* Other than completing personal projects using languages that are asked for in the qualifications section of each internship and connecting on LinkedIn, what else should I do during this summer to boost my application for these internships?  

&amp;#x200B;

* Here are all the Big Tech internships that I know of as of right now. I did not include URM internships because I am Asian. If you know of any more, even Medium Tech if that's a term, please comment! 
   * Explore Microsoft Internship
   * Facebook University
   * Google STEP
   * Two Sigma Freshman Software Engineering Internship

&amp;#x200B;

* When do these internships start accepting applications? 

&amp;#x200B;

* Anything else I should know about applying? Maybe company-specific tips that may distinguish me from the application pool? 

&amp;#x200B;

* For those that took on internships from startups as a freshman/sophomore, how much programming experience was required? 

&amp;#x200B;

* How would one go about finding a startup to apply to? Once a startup is found, would you simply ask someone in the company?"

My first ticket involves using an internally built tool (ssis) (by another team) to archive unused db tables to cloud and then create a script to delete the tables. The ticket is due in five days after I was assigned to it four days ago even though I still don't have access to the last database I need. What questions should I be asking? I'm okay with getting poached it's whatevers but it's really getting to me not being able to even know where to start. I'm also okay with being a nuisance and asking dumb questions but I don't even know what dumb questions to ask. The manager said that they treat interns like regular devs, this is my first ever internship. Let me know if anyone has any suggestions for questions I can ask. For now I'm reading the documentation for the tool and learning sql and Microsoft sever tools."

We were opposites: I grew up in a bad home, moved out at 18, and worked 3 jobs until I finished my bachelor's. I went back, got my master's, and graduated last month with a great job lined up.

Dave grew up with parents who let him spend ages 18-28 playing videogames. Around 30 Dave wanted to get serious about school and work toward a bachelor's in CS. Fast forward to 35 and he is still taking 1-2 classes per semester at community college. His parents pay for his new car, put money on his Starbucks card every week, etc. He complained about living at home, but when I offered to help him find a part time job, he would laugh and say he couldn't work with his demanding course load.

My last year of grad school, I got an internship with a major tech company, and Dave started saying increasingly nasty things, I.E. he doesn't work while he's in school because he's a ""true academic"", he cares about his studies and doesn't want to lie and cheat his way through like ""other people"", he thinks its gross that I had to live with roommates, work so much, etc.

Dave and I went our separate ways last year, but the other day I bumped into him at the farmer's market. We chatted for a bit, I asked him about his projects and what he was doing with his time. He is still so busy with his 2 classes at community college, the hiking club, going to Starbucks every day and studying beekeeping, and so on.

When Dave asked what I had been up to, I was honest and told him how I had finished my master's, started working at my new job, and just finished setting up my office. I told him I was getting ready to buy a house, and thinking of travelling later this year. I noticed Dave was getting increasingly agitated, huffing and shuffling his feet, rolling his eyes, etc.

When I asked Dave if I had said something that upset him, he snapped that I don't know how hard he has it, that I don't care about computer science the way he does, and that I don't have any actual skills. I shrugged, and simply told him ""my choices have gotten me where I am, and your choices have gotten you where you are."" He screamed at me that I was an a\*\*hole and stormed off.

Was this the wrong thing to say? Where is the line between holding someone accountable, and kicking someone when they're down?

Tl;dr: Bumped into a former friend, bragged a little about how my life is going, and told him he got himself where he is with his choices, when he got upset with me."

After 2021 elections it's very likely that a left party president will take over and is pretty much going with the same ideas Hugo Chavez had with Venezuela. It's very scary and it doesn't help hearing a lot of people wanting out and making their ""escape"" plans. I however don't have any contacts abroad and if I did I wouldn't wish to bother them. I always wanted to live somewhere better abroad and am scared of not being able to do so if I take too long.

I don't think I'll be ready to leave within the next year or so since it sounds pretty difficult. It would be helpful to know what can I do in the meantime in order to be able to leave to Canada/England (pretty much any english speaking country, preferably those). Any information on scholarships or programs I could affordably do online/online internship jobs. I said I'm mediocre but it's because I don't believe my skills and knowledge have an ""abroad standard"". I'm open to learning I just really don't know how or where to start.

When I was 16 and I applied for jobs it was always so effing easy to get them. Employers were actually welcoming and had a positive attitude towards new employees.

17 years, a Bachelors and a Masters degree later: I don’t even get a real reply from an actual person for an internship that doesn’t even pay money. 
I don’t think that my education wasn’t worth it but rather that I don’t even want to work with companies who developed such a narcissistic attitude.

When I now ask people how they got their job they will tell me that they lied on their application letter. I’m shocked because people actively get encouraged to show sociopathic behavior.

The worst part is that I fear that people might assume that getting rejected by a standardized email means that the company is of high value, simply because they didn’t experience the downfall of the recent years and are new to the job market. Hell no! 

Keep your sanity people and protect your mental health. By all means do what’s necessary to make a living but never forget that there’s craziness at play in the current job application processes and we don’t need to normalize it. Let’s just survive this and strive to make the system better instead of complying to it!

I have a few questions and I would really appreciate any responses/advice.

I don't  really have a great profile yet but I wish to work on making it better.

here are my questions:

\&gt; My exams for this semester are indefinitely postponed, do I have to intern somewhere? (Im sure my uni would make me wake up to a notification for the exams on a random day)

\&gt; If I should focus on making projects, what domains do I work on? ( I know the fundamentals of web development, and have made a simple mern app before, I also have worked on deep learning models and have played around with the docs for PyTorch) ( I also look forward to explore other domains, if you'd like to suggest any)

\&gt; It turns out Im not really great at leetcode, I am solving a problem everyday, but I resort to looking at the solutions a lot. I feel terrible understanding that the solution is simple. How do I improve at this?( I struggle with medium-hard questions)

\&gt; Hardware(computer architecture) interests me, But I have not a clue on how/what to start, and not a clue if I should start on it (considering demand for hardware engineers).

(Apologies if I sound like an annoying noob, I just need some path advice)

Thanks a lot. This time is a really confusing one for me."

I graduated last December and had struggled finding a job. My daily life consisted of endless applications, interviews that led no where and ultimately a lot of feeling like a failure and as if my hard work and degree meant nothing. Although it is a numbers game, and some employers might see your potential but hesitate to take the risk on a fresh out of college prospect—your time will come. That’s what everyone has told me through this process but it was really hard for me to accept that after constantly getting the door shut in my face. I had almost thought that maybe I would never do anything with the degree I had worked so hard for. I’m posting this in solidarity with recent grads who may be struggling through the same process. I really spiraled into a depression on top of post-grad depression and lost my sense of self worth. I’m grateful to say that I finally found somewhere to get my foot in the door and it is a better opportunity than anything I ever anticipated to start. Unless you start looking early on pre-grad, it can be such a struggle. I had no time in school between classes, working part-time and taking internships to start early applications and ultimately thought I’d screwed myself by having a work gap. So if anyone else is struggling like I did, I know how hard it can affect you mentally but just remember that good things do come to those who wait and keep pushing through! You’re not the only one in your boat and you’re anything but a failure! The only thing that really helped my mental and emotional was hearing it from others who had the same experience that I did and knowing that this is just the process, you’ll get there when the times right."

For the first time ever an FAANG recruiter (from AWS) contacted me instead of the opposite. He was looking for candidates regarding a position as SDE II.

Up to now I always looked for internships or new grad positions, but I got a decent amount of experience under my belt totaling around 2+ years in the sector.

I was expecting to be ""worth"" for a SDE I-like position, so that made me question which are the main differences in responsibility, tasks complexity, autonomy and experience between SDE I, SDE II and SDE III?

Moreover how interviews differ between all of these levels?

A part from the interviews difference, I think this could be extremely useful in order to understand how to plan my career objectives and which are the results I should show while growing in the medium-long term, regardless of landing in AWS or not.

Thanks in advance!"

I had some family emergencies that got in the way of my job-search process and I didn't really fully commit to looking for full-time employment until early April. 

Almost 3 months later I still haven't gotten a job and it seems like less and less employers are looking for new grads with no full-time experience at the moment.. I'm hoping that employers will be a bit more understanding of my employment gap given the Covid-19 situation, but I'm still worried that employers will overlook me because of it.

How prohibitive will this gap be for me going forward? Should I just go back to grad school so I can start fresh?"

Through research and experience, it seems that is a tough field to get into fresh out of college and not necessarily an entry level role. Since graduating in December, I have had a couple of interviews but no luck landing a job as of yet. 

The last month or so I have shifted to studying for my Sec+ cert to start acquiring those in hopes of opening more doors. I am also someone willing to relocate to almost anywhere in the US. My biggest drawback is my lack of IT experience. I worked as a fleet manager for a trucking company for awhile before getting burned out and wanting a change. My only experience so far is both my coursework and the 4 month internship I had, though it was not the best overall experience. And I don't necessarily think my age is holding me back as I am only 30. I know I have plenty to learn still. 

I was just looking for any general advice as to how to advance my career now with my degree, potential career paths, and any other advice anyone may have. Are help desk roles something I should be looking at to gain some more experience, mastering my work there while being exposed to new information, and then continuing to progress? I have also heard sometimes people can get stuck in that role, though I am not the complacent type and wouldn't want to settle at that point.

I am looking for advice on what my future may look like if I stay with this team in terms of work, hours, and opportunities to work outside Big4. I have seen a lot of negative comments about IT audit, but I am not sure if that was mainly left in the assurance portion of the Risk Assurance split.

I also hold interest in FDD and Deals M&amp;A, was wondering what to learn and steps to take during my internship in order to have a shot at making the switch if I find ERC to not be for me. I know someone who a few months ago moved to Deals M&amp;A as an experienced associate, was thinking about reaching out to them for advice but wanted to do more DD on all these options before committing to a switch.

o29kv3,0,2021-06-17,Am I allowed to sue under Malpractice for this particular thing that happened to me or no?,AriStarlight,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/o29kv3/am_i_allowed_to_sue_under_malpractice_for_this/,"I'm using the ""Medicine &amp; Malpractice"" flair because it looks the closest to what my situation has been described as. I'm still not for certain if this is possible or not, since my mom, who knows everything about what happened, says it's ""too late"" to act as this all happened in 2016. But I'll explain.

In the beginning of February, I was 15 and suffering from suicidal thoughts after a bad reaction to the Depo Shot(Estrogen Injection), and admitted to *that hospital* to be hospitalized for my issues. My current Psychologist identified that the doctors who talked to me one on one before admitting me pretty much took advantage of how intimidating they were to me, making me say things that would leave them with no choice to admit me into their hospital, like ""I'm suicidal all the time, even when around loved ones.""

The night I was admitted was relatively tame besides me waking up in the middle of the night and needing to call my mom for comfort. That was the one positive thing they did during my stay, giving me a small dose of sleep medication to help me get sleepy and letting me call my mom for about 10 minutes. Others may think it's weird I was close to my mom, even the hospital staff judged us, but I digress..

The real issue started the morning after, where I had the worst panic attack I ever had upon entering the common room for all the teen patients to be watched over inside of. For context for my emotions, atm, this was the very first time I was to be away from any family, as I was very dependent on them for my age and the thought of being alone in this place horrified me. So I understandably began having a mental meltdown, shouting and bawling my eyes out, which I feel is any reasonable response a confused teen with emotions tampered by Estrogen would feel in a scary and intimidating place like a hospital. The doctors who got to me first, who my Psychologist suspects were under qualified interns, basically took a hold of me and shoved me into a tiny room with a single hospital bed in it. Without discussing anything to me like why I had that breakdown or why I was so upset, just gave me a small box of tissues and just said ""stay in her and don't come out until you're done crying"" and shut the door in my face.

I did as they said, terrified they would add more days to my stay if I acted out. I curled up on that hospital bed, terrified and bawling my eyes out over the thought of being kept away from my mother in particular. I remember wanting to hurt myself so badly in that moment, as being alone to deal with my demons scared me more than anything. But instantly I grew even more terrified when I saw the security camera, watching me and making me too terrified to move, cry, or even breathe. But somehow, amongst all those horrible emotions and thoughts I was having, I managed to pull through and decided I'd just have to bottle up all my misery and any emotions that the doctors would find unsatisfactory until I got out.

Then on, I felt completely unsafe in my surroundings, pretending to be completely fine the whole way through as I was understandably terrified over the thought of staying there any longer. The scary thing was, even when my mom came to visit each day, I never dared speak about my experience on the first day, or how uncomfortable and upset this place made me feel since I was afraid of any possibility of me staying longer because of it.

Eventually, my 3rd and final day came, and they decided to let me go, and everything resumed semi-normally after that.. Well, besides all the hospital related nightmares and intense phobias that came from it, even now I'm still affected to this day; 5 years later..

I've had many mental health issues and of PTSD symptoms pop up in the span of these years that I can but won't get into to make this post shorter."

As of right now for the last couple of months I've been doing internship work in Ruby on Rails for a local startup. Its not something that will develop into a full time job just because they don't really have a need for too much work given where they're at. So I've been full time on the job hunt.   


Most of my experience is in Java and Spring Boot, I know some HTML, CSS, JS, but if you told me to make a pretty front-end on the spot I probably would have some troubles. I've been going over a Spring tutorial to re-design an application my team and I built for our capstone which was originally made as a Spring Boot MVC app and we want to go the API based route instead. So that's giving me something to work on.   


Point of this post is I'm just feeling a bit lost and I don't really know what I should be doing while I wait to here back from employers. I haven't had really many interviews or people reach back to me so I'm starting to feel like I'm wasting time.

My senior, who was a chill dude was the one that kept me company during my stay and he was the one who I picked up most of my skills from. We'll call him ""Jay"". 

Now, one day we had this one request that came in from one of the officers in another department, who we'll call ""Max"". So Max complained that his Desktop PC (an Intel Pentium 4) would not turn on. Jay and I went to his office to check it out. The computer wouldn't turn on. We tried all the standard troubleshooting stuff from changing the PSU, reseating the RAM, CPU and video card, but nothing worked. Finally, Jay told me to grab the test motherboard of the same brand and model (It was an Asus board from what I can remember) we had from storage and so I brought it to him. We swapped out the motherboard and lo and behold, the PC turned on and started to work

So Jay went over to Max and told them he had a faulty mother board. Max asked further what could have caused the board to fail. Jay said, he wouldn't know unless more testing was done, but he said it could be anything from a bad chip, blown capacitor or a factory defect of some sort. Now, Max was an Electrical Engineer by trade, so he thought it could be easily fixed by resoldering some parts. He had a tester so he can figure out which chips, capacitors or whatever was blown and just simply replace it by resoldering a new part onto it. Jay explained that it wasn't as simple as that but Max said he can probably fix the motherboard on his own. Jay did try to dissuade him to no avail. In the end, Max asked us to hand over the defective board so that he could ""fix"" it himself and save the company a few extra bucks. 

A few days later one of my co-interns brought in Max's PC and there was a label on it that said ""for repair"". I was curious as to what had happened. Jay came in later and when he saw Max's PC in our work desk, he just rolled his eyes. When we opened the PC we saw some solder blobs on some capacitors near the video card and there was a faint burnt smell coming off it. I never got to work on it, but I heard from my co-intern that Jay tested it later in the day and found out that the CPU was dead and the RAM had become faulty causing Windows XP to crash to a blue screen almost every time when he tested them on another motherboard.

Our head IT boss never re-issued a new desktop computer to Max ever since and gave him a used Laptop instead. From time to time when me and Jay would pass by Max, he would just give us a blank look and ignore us completely."

After a 7 week search I have landed a position of Manager, Strategy for a mid sized bank in Chicago. Prior to this I was a senior strategy analyst for a large Canadian bank in their wealth management group.  While I am delighted and eager to start, I cant help but feel very nervous. The two reasons are as follows:

1) This is my first job with a manager title. While there is no immediate person reporting to me, the person who hired me said they are looking to hire some analysts down the line and I will be expected to manage them. This makes me a little bit nervous. I have managed interns before but this is of course a whole different kettle of fish. 

2) I have been in the field of strategy and operations for only 2.5 years and I def do not think I learnt everything there is to be a senior analyst in my previous role. While I was significantly improving my skills in deck building, data analysis and financial modeling I know for sure that I still had a way to go yet before I could make the leap into a manger role. I have always felt the imposter syndrome at work and I sort of feel it now. 

For context, in order to land this job I had to go through three rounds of interviews (hiring manager, team colleague, managing director) and also provide a financial take home case study which i had 2 days to complete. The hiring manager said my case went above and beyond what he wanted and was the best by far, but he did say i did lack in some areas of the job (long term project management, statistical applications). 

Is this normal? Any advice on how to overcome this and succeed?

I like the idea of implementing supervised learning to help detect tumors, or reinforcement learning in robotics. However, I'm naive to the day-to-day work of a machine learning engineer. Also, I believe I would also have to pursue a master's degree to be a competitive hire, at least as an intern. I've found some universities that offer 1-year Master's programs. Would it be worth it to pursue this route?

I'm also wondering if my skills are a better fit elsewhere.

Pros to this are saving more money. When I do move, I get a large pay bump being that I'll be higher than entry level software engineer. 

Cons are my social life is not so great and this will not help me. This is the delayed enjoyment option certainly. But I don't hate my parents either and have some friends here. It's just meh. 

2) get a first job in my home city, move out, find an apartment lease for one year. 

Pros are I get experience living on my own as an adult out of college (but I had an apartment in school on my own, so replace school with work). 

Cons. Lose money, almost feels pointless to find friends? because I want to GTFO of here in a year anyways? My least favorite idea. 

3) just look for a job in my researched city, scope it out - leave now. 

Pros: no delay, just go wing it.

Cons. I'll have a bit less money, seems risky without a bit of work experience. A bit rushed over working here and scoping it out the next year. Not sure if I'm ready.

I feel like 1 would make the most sense but 3 is the riskiest option. 2 seems stupid."

The cost of our products that we purchase change on a weekly basis, and we need to be able to track the history of these changes in cost for each individual item.

Is there any way to generate a list of the cost history for each product as they are updated?

I tried using the track changes feature, but it will only return the cell that changes in my ""cost"" column (ie. $B$3) and will not reference the text in my ""product name"" column (ie. Apples). This makes the data impossible to read without having to go back and manually reference each cell that changes.

Asking this for a friend! 

So my friend recently had an interview with the CEO of a startup company who owns more than 4 companies and also invests in other startups. Basically, he is a shark hahaha. So ayun andaming red flags na napansin ng friend ko kaso he is not really sure if red flag ba talaga sila 😬

 ⁃ The CEO was so proud that his company is “built on interns blood.” Meaning na never siya naghire ng anyone and lahat ng manpower nila nakaasa sa interns lang. Kwinento pa ng CEO na he closes multi-million deals dahil sa interns niya kaso ni isang centavo wala siyang binigay na any renumeration sa kanila. My friend straight up told him na ang interns they deserve to be paid at least for their time and effort. Then, his answer was why would he pay for people na wala naman credentials and experience. Sabi niya if he will pay daw, magbabayad lang siya sa experts KASOOOO he doesn’t even want to hire. 
 ⁃ He was so boastful na andaming maga-gain ng interns from his company LIKE LEARNING AND NETWORK. Sinabi pa niya na nung time raw niya, sila raw ang nagbabayad sa companies to take them in. My friend even subtlety said na yung ginagawa is lowkey exploitation tapos super defensive na agad niya. 
 ⁃ He doesn’t like getting interns na need yung internship as school requirement kasi they perform poorly and don’t deliver the needed outputs. 
 ⁃ He asks his interns to read one chapter a day of his favorite book. Then the following day, he will ask them questions about the chapter and say their main takeaways. 
 ⁃ He gave less than 24 hours for you to think about the internship offer. 

In the end my friend did not accept this internship, was he right for doing it or sayang ba opportunity kasi sensitive lang siya?

Would love to hear your thoughts about this. Thanks!"

I'm currently a university student on internship, so I'm currently receiving my first ever substantial salary this year (\*yay\*). I'm also currently learning how to be financially literate as much as I can before I enter the full-time working industry in the next 2 years.

I recently found out that I can use my tuition as a non-refundable tax credit (and it's quite an amount to me). However, in my notice of assessment, my total payable is always 0 (line 43500). I'm assuming that it's because, for most paycheques, income tax is automatically deducted.

My question is: **How is my non-refundable tax credit deducted from my tax payable when income tax is automatically deducted from my paycheques.**

Follow up: **For tuition tax credit that I was not able to use (because I did not know tuition tax credit was a thing), am I able to claim it for this year's tax season?** I tried researching how tuition tax credit can be carried forward but I can't seem to understand if it's possible or not.

I've never worked with DevOps stuff before, but started my internship recently.

The problem is that my boss isn't very responsive and helpful, and I have no clue how to begin. The entirety of my first week went into learning the basics, and by the end of it I was able to Dockerize a basic Flask app, deploy it on Kubernetes, and integrate it with Argo but that's pretty much all I know.

What should my first step in this? Should I create a normal CRUD app in Spring first and then try to figure things out from there or something and then ask my boss what to do next? Or something else? It's just a lot of information for me to deal with at the same time in a very short period of time."

What he explained to me that since Actuaries and similar jobs deal a lot with numbers, statistics, probability, data, etc. It would be very beneficial if I picked up a minor in computer science or even a major if I thought I could handle it (honestly not sure if I can but hopefully I'll get there).

Being the wise guy I am, I checked for answers online since it seemed to be a pretty cliche question in job interviews! But, the answer google gave me sound somewhat phoney (I don't have the right word, the answers were like what the employers wanted to hear, not the one I should give for myself)! I actually asked myself, 'where do I want to see myself in the next 10 years, in 2030 (if I am lucky enough to live that long)? That was the point when it all began and I started analyzing my options as thoroughly as possible, in the context of the existing job market! Now, let me explain beforehand, **I might sound a little pessimistic or sceptical** here but this just might be the influence of post-modernist philosophy that I read and enjoyed during my PG course! And, I am also looking for an option that seems viable 10 years into the future as well!

Let me tell you guys about a few chance-by-luck work experiences I had in the past. One of my friend from college is a (wedding) photographer. He started photography in 2013 during his graduation with a borrowed camera, in small-payment jobs for the departmental seminars, freshers, farewells in the University as well as small B'day parties in teachers' and staff's family. And, today he has a full setup of photography and editing including Canon 5D mark iV in his own flat in Delhi. He is a skilled guy, no doubt about him! Inspired by him I tagged along to learn like an intern a couple of years back. What I learned is the fact that half of his success can be attributed to photography and another half must go to his social skill. I mean the guy would become the official wedding photographer as soon as you announce that you are getting married... and, before you know it, you are having a pre-wed photoshoot and paying ₹25,000 for a video on some romantic mash-up (after a friends-only discount)! Meaning, he could have succeeded in the market whatever profession he had chosen, he got good marketing skills naturally. I got no skills like that, I cannot sell a thing unless you need it and come yourself to me... I hate this unpractical sense of morality that keeps haunting me everywhere! Recently, however, the wedding industry collapsed in the last year or so due to corona and photographers like him are looking for petty jobs meanwhile.

That brings me to another observation that due to technological evolution and popularity of social media platforms like FB, Insta, TikTok, Snap chat, even YouTube among others has made people better in both the places -the front and back of the camera! There aren't petty photography jobs available as they were till the early 2010s. It is more visibly apparent through the fact that the peddling photographers around tourist spots like Qutub Minar, India gate and Lal Qila in Delhi and Laxman Jhula in Rishikesh have been reduced to almost zero! I am giving their example because I had been trying to learn Spanish in the hope of earning some money in the tourism sector as a guide or something, till I land something more sustainable... but then, this COVID thing happened and the situation is not getting back to normal in tourism industry anytime soon, as far as the international tourism is concerned. As I said, don't think of it as an excuse or pessimism from my side, I just also want to consider the worst that could happen in an industry... at least this much, I learned in past one year or so!

I also want to mention a bunch of articles I came across in financial news that how the arrival of robotics and automation could affect the 'generalise roles' that are available in the market right now, in the next 10 years. And, considering how I have fixed DD antennas on the terrace, sent greeting cards through the post, waited in the queue to get song recorded/dubbed in my cassettes, clicked photos from reel camera, seen the era of pirated CDs and so on since my childhood hood, all these 'supposed revolutions of their time' have disappeared with time... so, I just cannot deny the possibility there. Amazon has already automated the sorting process in their warehouses within India, on a small scale though.

Lastly, I have a few reports speculating the future of the BPO industry. There, I learnt that the **IT sector and IT-based service sector should be considered two different industries.** While with the growing digital space, the former still has a somewhat stable job market (number of seekers also increasing rapidly though) the latter has been affected by the same digital expansion (alongside robotics and automation)! And, as we know, the BPO industry mostly falls within the second category i.e. IT-based service sector! One such speculation I remember clearly is for the BPOs that manage the backend support for banking clients. There, they have shown through the data that how the number of employees in a few BPOs managing a particular bank's clients have fallen drastically since the bank's mobile banking app turned out to a huge success! Sadly, digitalization has positive as well as negative effects!

Ten years into the future, you see! And, this is how it all began. Pardon me, if you think that I am overthinking, but I want to make a few conscious choices for once in my life, and hence, all this confusion! This is why I put my situation in front of fellow Redditors, so I'd be benefitted from their wisdom. I am already grateful to all of you for your patience to read this long text till the very end! &lt;3"

That's for taking the time to read my post :) I'll start off with some info about me:

I graduated with a 3.0 GPA from a top 20 school with 2 degrees (a B.S. in CS and a B.A. in Electrical Engineering). Now I'm in finishing up my Masters in Electrical Engineering from a top 5 school with a 3.5 GPA. My Masters classes have been about Statistics, Optimization, Pattern Recognition and Scalable Inference Algorithms. I've had one internship working on Computer Vision at a small company in the mid west. I've spent the rest of the summers as a Research Assistant in various labs.

The questions I have are:

1. I'm pretty embarrassed about my undergraduate GPA and I'm wondering if I should include it on my resume? Do companies ask for undergraduate transcripts if i have a Master's degree?

2. I have the option of delaying my graduation by a semester and taking an internship or I can graduate on time and apply for full time positions. Since i haven't had much internship experience, i was wondering if that's something worth thinking about.

3. I don't have much of a portfolio. I have 1 project where i do lane line tracking, and video segmentation for self driving cars. I also have written a tutorial on a paper i really liked. I'm wondering if that's enough or whether I should focus on doing more instead of working on Leetcode problems? Additionally i really enjoyed writing my tutorial. If I were to add to my portfolio, is writing additional paper reviews instead of coding things ok?

4. I'm diagnosed with ADHD. I'm not sure if i should be open about that during the hiring process. It's one of the contributing factors to my low undergraduate GPA and I've worked to overcome it in graduate school. 


I appreciate any help you can offer and i hope you have a great day!"

After graduation last year I found a relevant(ish) job straight away, which is good, during a pandemic, but the pay is really low, I can barely afford to live after paying rent. I don't get to use my skills much in my current job and I don't see myself progressing in any way with this company, it's a really small team with just enough workload to keep the company alive meaning that my boss can do all the job and I can just do the small tasks in the office.

I have been trying to find other jobs in the industry, but the offer is minimal at the moment and the few applications I've sent just didn't get me far.

I'm so sick of being broke, can't make any long term plans, or any plans at all, I'm in a huge amount of debt because I cannot even afford to buy food or go on holiday to visit my family, after almost 2 years because of covid. I can't even afford a therapist which is something I've been needing for a while.

I would be happy to explore other careers options, something that would get me going and opens up jobs opportunities with a relatively high salary as an entry level position, like IT or something and  maybe do a course, or learn skills on the internet, I just really don't know how to go about it, who to talk to, even considering I have no money to invest in a paid course.

Another option would be offer my freelance service using my current set of skills, but that wouldn't guarantee I'll be making money any time soon, or ever, cos I'd have to make myself known, find clients, and I could just end up spending more time trying to find work than actually working."

I've clarified with the employer about the role, and they said it was between a junior and mid weight role, which left me rather confused. 

It was such a lack of common sense on my end, and I'm honestly drowning in deep self hatred rn bc of this. I'm not really sure what to do now as if I were to reject this offer, I'll still be without another job to rely on. But at the same time the role seems to be way bigger than what I can fit into. 

I would really like to ask for advice and I need help with looking at different angles &gt;&lt;"

I recently completed an internship and received a well paying job offer from a large Big4 accounting firm.

I should be ecstatic, but I’m not.

I feel like I have made the biggest mistake of my life. 

I went into accounting after beginning my college career in engineering and found it wasn’t right for me. I’m unsure exactly why I chose accounting, but went for it anyway. I have worked hard through my classes while also working 40hour weeks to help fund my education. Now that I am at the end though, I feel I may have been so wrapped up in the competitive rush of blowing my way through classes that I never sat back and asked if this was something for me. Sitting in my internship I gladly sat in my room (remote work) computing numbers and running the same forms over and over for different engagements. However, the dark reality of doing that every single day of my life and draining my soul to file tax forms for a corporation has set in. I didn’t know what I was getting myself in to. This is not what I think I was meant to do. 

My whole life I have been extremely passionate about women’s health care. I dreamed of delivering children and assisting pregnant women in educating and advocating for them. I dreamt of being a midwife but was scared away after completing a premed class in highschool. I have severe OCD and thought I would be incapable of completing nursing school at the time because it would require me seeing live surgery - a huge trigger of mine. It was something I didn’t think I could overcome at the time, but after taking control of my OCD through therapy I see I may have given up my dream to cater to my disorder. 

After a long day of work yesterday with a midterm to complete it all, I sat at my desk sobbing. I don’t know what to do, part of me is telling me to just go for it and follow the path to become a midwife, the other part of me is just afraid of completely restarting my career at this point, and another part of me is just thinking I need to just suck it up and keep where I’m at. Any advice?"

I just don't know if I should live at home for another year, find a job in this city, or try to get a job elsewhere now and leave.

Sticking it out for another year seems to be the best chance for making it work. I can save money, focus on my first job, and thoroughly research areas I want to move. It can give me time and money to visit places too. The problem is I'm still not sure exactly where I want to be. I feel like it could be costly if I make a mistake moving to the wrong place. 

On the other hand, I guess I'm delaying life a bit? I do feel that way a bit.

I think if I were staying locally it would make sense to move out right away. But given I will go to a whole new state, does it make more sense to give myself some time to figure out?

I could move out around here then leave within a year of getting my first job but it seems pointless. Also, I've already lived on my own at school, so replace school with work and I've experienced household responsibilities."

I'm really torn between the two options. While I think I'd prefer the ML Ops position, I feel like I could always return to this company in the future and so it would be better for my career to get exposure at another company to widen my options.

I've been working electronics retail repair (think Geek Squad and Apple Genius) this whole time to put myself through school. All this time, I thought because I already have tech experience and an IT degree, I should be able to go for something that's not customer facing after graduation.

That is until recently, I've been reading posts and comments on here that makes me extremely anxious. I keep hearing stuff like repair experience doesn't really count, and that help desk is inevitable unless I do internships. Even worse, there is a worrying-amount of posts about those fresh out of college (even with a masters!) who still has to start at help desk anyway. Now the whole reason I went back to school for a degree is so I can get away from that customer service shit. I have almost a decade of experience in that, and I'm sick to high hell of it. And from what I've read about help desk, it's just another level of customer service hell.

Someone please tell me that there's still hope??! Since I was 25 when I went back and needed money, I couldn't just do unpaid internships (at least I thought they were until I found out tech ones are paid). My college never really talked about them either. But it's too late for them since I'm about to graduate very soon. I REALLY can't stand another minute of customer service work. Like why do help desk jobs exist when they're so terrible?! I legit didn't spend all this time and money in school just to end up there. Has anyone else skipped those roles with just a degree and no internship experience? Please, I'm desperate for some advice on this.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: To clarify, I don't want to be in a position where I'm the front lines dealing with the general public. I just want to work ""with"" people and not ""for"" them. Anyone in the front lines of anything knows how the people they support think they can treat you like shit and still get what they want. Help desk is just that type of ""working for"" relationship. Working with others as their equals is less likely for that to happen (at least in my mind). Those of you who's escaped help desk or anything customer-facing-heavy should know what I mean."

|store\_id|address|city|date|item|quantity|type|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|3|addr|city|01-01-2021|A|2|Delivered|

|4|addr|city|01-01-2021|B|5|Delivered|
|5|addr|city|01-01-2021|C|4|Sold|

Items listed here are food boxes, which are distributed to local stores. This means that a store either sells them all, or some of them are discarded as unedible after a certain amount of time. For each unsold item, there is a penalty for both the store and the producer as the former will receive less supply in the future and the producer loses a small amount of money.

As my internship, I am asked to find the ""sweet spot"": the ideal amount of delivered items to each store so that the unsold items are minimized. 

Is there a specific methodology to tackle this problem? I am kind of lost here.

I keep imagining ""what if"" scenarios about things that have passed and it makes me incredibly anxious and uncomfortable that I genuinely feel like I can't be conscious (and sometimes even alive) right now.



I have many different examples that range from mild to extreme, but they pretty much all cause the same effect, but the most recent one has been me thinking ""what if I accidentally ripped the blood bag while trying to perform a blood transfusion?""
And not only that, my mind starts carrying that thought and running away with it. ""All the doctors are going to come and ask who did this?"" ""You're going to get in trouble and everyone is going to talk about that stupid intern who ripped a whole bag of blood when a patient needed it and we didn't have another one""



This one is a bit more serious than the ones I usually get, but it's the most recent which is why I mentioned it.
Sometimes it's just something like ""what if you fell when you were walking out of the office that day?"" Or ""what if your dress was up/ripped from the back and you didn't know, but walked around all day like that?""



It's so annoying and bothersome and I don't know why I keep thinking that AFTER things have passed. Like I would somewhat understand if it happened before, bc I'd be nervous, but wtf is this and how do I make it stop?"

College has been posting a lot of things about internships, workshops etc, haven't done anything of that sort so far, was about to get into something last year then covid hit.

So, backlogs in all semesters with really bad CGPA so far.

My question is, will I be eligible to get into a good company even if I have had a lot of backlogs?

I'm good at Mobile development. Started learning Flutter last year and have gotten really good at it, also got into native Android development this year since we have to present a project based on it this sem.

Had a idea last year for a startup last year, so built a app around it and it's currently up and running in my native village, people love it but don't have enough investment to get into other towns.

So, have an app under my belt which is currently in service, will that give me a edge in landing a job? I mean even if there's no hope for me for campus selection, will I get a decent job externally?

Also is it strictly required for me to have an experience as an internship in any IT companies for me to get a job?

I don’t really have much IT skills.
Although, I noticed that in those 3 jobs I had , my bosses required a high knowledge of IT skills, such as programming, management of company servers, database, cad programs installation etc.

I know that a GIS worker, obviously depending on the specialization, would need to strong IT skills (if he is a database manager, gis developer etc). 

But for a GIS analyst is that normal that they require, for example, an intern to create high level Python scripts? That was my situation and I was graduated in Geology! I don’t have a background in IT.

My current company hired me as GIS analyst and my tasks are now giving support to the help desk (I am the help desk customer) for software installations!!! In other words I basically find myself supporting my own support. 

Does that make sense? 

I wanted to work with cartography, Gis analysis. I’m more than happy to work with sql, automatization and other basic IT skills that a GIS analyst has to know.

Late for summer internships.,iZaxer,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/o2xw29/play_it_safe_for_the_work_experience_or_bet_on/,"Tl;dr I was offered an internship for this summer in a department I have no real interest in (internal audit) and asked for today as my decision date. Still interviewing with other 2 other companies though, and one especially for a position that aligns perfectly with my career goals, but due to delay won't hear back til next week. Debating whether to accept today, ask for another extension from the first company, or decline the first offer in hopes of landing any other role.

So I realize its extremely late in the hiring process for internships this summer, and I definitly have a history of missing the boat. I am a rising senior at a fairly good US university studying business analytics. I recently changed majors after gaining some experience in marketing last year and disliking some of the work, so I had a difficult time finding work this summer without the relevant work experience. 

In the last couple of weeks though, I've been interviewing for four companies with varying levels of interest, and am still in talks with 3. The first position, which I already have an offer for and agreed to decide by today for, is with internal audit--which isn't exactly looked upon highly by many employers in my field--and is my last choice of the 3 openings. The second and third have confirmed they'll be getting back to me early next week about next steps, but the offers aren't a sure thing by any means. My top choice role aligns perfectly with my career goals, and I feel somewhat confident that I would make it through the final hiring stage, but it definitely can't be guaranteed. I feel like anything besides the audit position would actually help my career, while accepting that offer would be a lateral move at best until next summer. 

Of course, there's a lot to be said for working anywhere in general, I certainly don't want to be left out to dry again with no options by turning down the audit role, but nothing would make me happier than taking my top choice position. As of now, I've only got an hour or so to call the audit department about my offer or to send over the signed copy, and I'm really just struggling to decide any way or the other. I'd feel so horrible if I missed a chance on my dream job because I didn't believe in myself, but getting no experience this summer at all would be even worse. I can't go back on the offer once I accept. 

What do y'all think would be the best way to play this scenario? Should I just call the audit department and explain honestly that I'll need another week to make a decision, risking them revoking the offer altogether? Or should I just play it safe given the late timing, and just hope next summer I can find something more valuable. I know I need to decide this ultimately, but I just could use any kind of input to make sure I'm not sabotaging my goals long-term. Thank you so much for any help possible."

I am a third year econ student and I have 42 credits remaining. As with most programs, I am required to be in specialization if I am in coop. This means that if I stay in coop all three of my remaining semesters will be really tough with the majority of classes being core ones. If I leave coop I will only have to complete 4 400 level econ electives and the rest will be gen ed electives which are much easier and take less time, meaning I can have more of a life or work more.

I was on the internship hunt all of last semester and although the coop staff was great I ended up finding my own internship with an amazing company. It is 8 months long, pays well, will have great references etc. I am confident that I can find another internship if I want, or simply graduate and be hired full time. 

What would be the motivation for being in coop considering I have made it this far totally on my own? I get the sense that once you have experiences (I am a financial and operations analyst) coop kind of becomes unnecessary because that is the whole point of coop in the first place.

I came clean to talk to them about it but instead they just said how i am a drama queen, my problems are fake and just used me as a circus to be funny around their friends.

I somehow managed to get an internship for this summer to work in a plant lab but every other day, they complain how ""my choices are ruining their lives since I am not home and they have to drive me there, cuz they don't want to give me insurance"". You might ask? well, find a job. They also forbade me that and also because online classes took so much of my time, every zoom interview with different places would say how my 10-15 hours is not enough.

I was gona go transfer to a CSU this semester but I declined because my mental health is 3 steps away from me getting into a mental hospital or worse. 

They recently told me that they will be giving my sister (13F) 300$ a month so she can go to college for free or buy a car, all while they complain for me going to college is ruining my life cuz ""i need to clean the house""

I am kinda growing resentful of this and plan to reapply for next fall to go do my last 2 years to get my bachelors degree, but I think I should move out within this year.

The question is how because the job market is shit and I don't know if I will find a good paying job to at least rent a studio as well as not be far away from the college I am transferring to. 

I also am worried about job stability and being able to afford school while working and living on my own.

any advice to start planning my final escape?"

o32hho,208,2021-06-18,Guerrilla IT,LowWind7998,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/o32hho/guerrilla_it/,"Just started my first job today as a “VMware Intern” . To start my day . I realize this “growing company” has 6 people , so we attend a board meeting . We’re talking to the head of a multi million dollar company proposing them cloud / virtualization solution.  CEO stops the meeting and introduces me as the new member of the team as our cyber security solutions expert (my degree is in cyber security) but I am by no means an expert. I mean he really sells me as one to everyone . Fast forward, meeting ends , everyone jumps on their machines and starts working on all these complex problems from this chaotic help desk . I couldn’t even understand the tickets as they relate to phones and databases and not networking and computers . Mid day, Server goes down offsite , whole team sent out to data center to fix the problem. I’m given my own section with no guidance . No knowledge of what I should be doing . I start pinging IPS looking for a loss or something so I don’t look stupid . CEO then tells me I’ll be with him next week selling ( he’s the only one that currently sells on the team) . So to sum it up, my VMware intern job seems to be guerrilla IT x 100 . It’s all in one . I’m scared . Imposter syndrome isn’t the issue , it’s applying for an internship and being tossed in the flames ."

Essays/LORs/Other: I’m a decent writer, so I’m not too worried about essays. Not sure about a personal statement. I should also be good for LORs; I should be able to get good ones from my band director and bio teacher.

Schools: This list is not well-thought-out and needs research and work. Figured I’d put it anyway. I’m also interested in the Ivies.

* Ohio University
* Northwestern
* WashU
* UMich Ann Arbor
* College of Wooster
* Oberlin
* Miami University, Ohio

I feel like my application needs more work on awards. I also feel like I need more science-related ECs if I decide to major in STEM. I need something that stands out. Maybe research under a professor at a university? However, there isn’t a college close enough to go up to more than once a week. What are your thoughts?"

I have had many occasions where I simply could not study for things like i should have and it definitely affected my test scores and gpa (about a 3.0). If you look at just engineering classes its like a 2.5. I have dropped the sports because it has become unrealistic to do both. My question is, how bad off am i with my gpa?

I’ve just completed an internship and not been offered to come back after having completed a coding boot camp. They told me before hand they weren’t going to hire us afterwards and I looked at it as a great opportunity for experience, but now I’m struggling to find the next thing. I’ve been applying for jobs like crazy and I never seem to get past the 1st interview stage or get even get an interview. For context I’m a former teacher with a degree in history and I’m 31 years old trying to become a software engineer / front end developer. Could anybody provide their two cents on if I should go back to school to get a degree in computer science? It’s so expensive and it’ll take a long time but I’m starting to think I need it to get in the door. I’d love to provide my portfolio for further criticism but I’m not sure if it’s okay to do on here."

As the title states, I’m starting my new job on Monday as a software engineer. I’m fresh out of college with a CS degree and haven’t had any programming internships yet (just “business analytics” ones), so I haven’t had any workplace experience as a programmer.

I did ok in school, but I wasn’t the best. Does this not bode well for the future? I’m excited to get to work with new people, but I’m just worried about not meeting their expectations. Are these normal butterflies? Should I be worried? 

I’m worried about not being good at my job, or not being able to keep up with the other new hire, etc. Any words of advice or wisdom would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks so much :)"

o39a8m,1,2021-06-19,"What jobs could I pursue when limited by social anxiety/depression/poor people skills but want to change and want meaningful, engaging work that helps others?",SimplyUnhinged,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/o39a8m/what_jobs_could_i_pursue_when_limited_by_social/,"Hi all! I'm in a huge rut and have no idea what to do with my life. Ideally, I need to start working towards a career (23, 6 months post-graduating college) or at least get work experience, but I'm really struggling to see where I would fit into the world. I feel like I have no clue of what I have to offer/what I'm good at.

I've also been struggling with social anxiety and depression that has gradually worsened. Unfortunately, it has largely changed my outlook on my career and what jobs I could be good at aka I have been accommodating my life around my fucked up brain --&gt; which is why nothing works. My consistent failures to perform well took double blows to my self esteem because of how depressed I was and now I have no sense of my worth or ability in the workplace.

The result is unfortunately that I have no cohesive experience on my resume and nothing long term (I'm a chronic flee-er when things get tough). I've consistently gravitated towards working with non-profits I care about, but I've been wondering more and more if it's a bad fit for me - I don't know if I could stick to a job where I work in an office and need to always work without seeing the cumulative and real impact my work has on people.

What could be a good job for someone like me? Some clarifying bits about me are:

1. I burnout very easily, part of that is because of how exhausted I become from the anxiety/depression. I've fled every job/internships I've ever had because I buckled under my social anxiety. When given an escape, *I take it*. I've never had a job where I didn't eventually start to intentionally fail because I desperately wanted to quit, even if I liked it. It's shameful and honestly fills me with great pain. I'm working to stop doing this with my therapist, but... nothing has changed yet.
2. I love being engaged meaningfully! I enjoy work that involves helping people or helping communities, but I tend to become bored and lose motivation quickly because I can't see it's affect big picture.
3. Social anxiety is an unfortunate but real block for me. Thus... where the problem comes in. I'm not good at working with people. It's prevented me from pursuing work I want. In theory, I want to work in mental health, but that involves one-on-one, and I'm no good at that. I think I'm caring, but I'm not assertive. I avoid conflict like the plague and flounder when put in tough situations. I have no confidence I could meaningfully help another person without projecting my issues onto them.
4. My ideal job is one where I am consistently surrounded by a caring work environment and good support structure. The work I've enjoyed the most were the one's that finally gave me the sense of ""belonging"" and gave me a sense that I somehow mattered to the structure of the organization. I had an internship that gave me that, and the moment that changed, I lost motivation and bombed it.
5. I. Need. Accountability. And structure. So no working from home. Right now, I'm in a place in life where I can only work under pressure, usually from interpersonal relationships. Abstract consequences don't do anything to my brain. I almost failed a lot of classes because \~ I relied on panic to move me. The fear of failing did nothing. Ideally, I favor a job that has consistent beginnings and ends over something with no end in sight, and therefore, loss of pressure.

TLDR

\- I want to work with people and within a strong community --&gt; the one thing I want most in a work environment

\- I prefer work that helps people, on a person to person basis or on a community level

\- It would ideally be flexible (a mix of boring paper work things and real person-to-person engagement to stay motivated)

\-I work almost exclusively under pressure but burn out very easily

\- I think I prefer work that moves in cycles (beginnings and ends) than consistent work that never changes

\-It will need to work with my likely life-long struggles with depression and anxiety :(( which unfortunately limit my endurance and people skills. I also struggle hugely with low motivation and poor focus, which might be obvious from the above.

Can I find any magical careers that fit that description?!?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much if you read all of this. I appreciate it endlessly and any advice would be doing me a huge favor.

Also if this reads like insane entitled ramblings, I'm sorry. I'm aware that the way I think about work and what work means in a person's life is really binary and limiting. I don't know much about work or how people find work or how you're even supposed to talk to people at work because --&gt; I've been privileged in my mom's financially security and living with her has given me the gift of not having to work. It's also made it much easier for me to even develop this habit of running from my jobs while I cower in the face of and avoid my future."

I'm in my early twenties and Graduated from an Australian University in November last year with a double bachelor's degree in Business and Information Technology. 
At the time I had a contract for a call centre but was not renewed at the start of the new year. For the last 6 months I've been looking for full time or part time employment in or around my expertise. I've been working casually in hospitality for the mean time to get by. 2 months into my search I decided to up-skill, taking up an Online Certificate IV in Cyber Security (from TAFE, equivalent to community college in the US) which I have been quickly completing. This has helped me get more eyes on my applications, but hasn't yet helped me get a job. 

Over the last 6 months I've applied for hundreds of positions, had over a dozen in person interviews and many more phone or video interviews. I apply to very entry level positions all across the field of business, government and IT. I would be more than happy for a low paying position but none seem to be offered below 55K AUD, internships are also not available in Australia. I have a good resume and cover letter that I tailor well to each employer. I started off quite shaky in my interviews but worked on them and now leave every interview with a good impression. Unfortunately when I hear back from employers (if I hear back) it's the same criticism ""unfortunately you don't have the necessary experience for this position"". These are from entry level roles. I even had a second interview with a company for a second entry level job they said I would be great for, then got ghosted. 

I'm typically a positive person, but this is truly demoralizing and I just don't know what my options are. I've been thinking of doing my Masters part time online after I finish this Certificate so then I'd look at least more desirable. Although I don't know if this is my best option. 

How can I make myself more desirable and earn more experience in a field that clearly doesn't want to offer experience and will only take those with the most experience? How do I get more experience if I can't get a job to gain that experience? All entry level jobs seem viciously competitive to the point where I feel like I only get interviewed to fill quotas. 

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!"

I can't even start,beacheytunez_,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/o3bygy/how_do_i_get_around_my_job_hunt_anxiety_i_cant/,"Hey again, so I'm one semester from graduating, and now it's time for me to go looking for jobs, and frankly it scares me shitless. My university has practical work hour requirements, ie complete 800 hours of internship work. Throughout my time at uni I have looked and applied as much as my peers around me, but I never seemed to land any interviews, and hence have no real formal internship experience. I got some casual contracted work where I soldered antennas onto 1000 circuit boards for a friends business, and a research assistant position, but the university goes to pains to remind us that ""general"" and ""research"" hours are seriously second-rate to ""sub professional"".

I think this is because although things are running, I'm so critical of myself that I blame myself for almost everything that goes wrong or gets delayed or if I don't know how to do something, etc. I had an interview last year which I could describe as the most embarrassing 1 hour of my life. I had the serious personal connections, loads of strings pulled, and then they hit me with an entrance exam and I flunked it, no clue. My GPA is okay, not great, I work really really hard outside of the university to pay my way through it, and I've had a very rough last couple of years mentally. All good, I've addressed that before on this subreddit, I got involved in engineering clubs (CubeSat design woo!), got work as a research assistant in bioengineering, but I still feel so inadequate. And I am so burned out.

I guess I just can't bring myself to start applying, even though I need to. I have honours projects, CubeSat projects, exams at the end of this week, bioeng research supposed to be finished, and now I have to think about fucking up applications again. It takes so much brainpower and I read 10's of different tutorials on how to smash cover letters and CV's and stuff but to no avail. I'm not even sure if I want to stay in my country, but I'm such a boring person at this point I just don't know if I can do it. 7 day weeks for the last 5 months, man, and 70% of that time is just spent freaking out paralysed by all that I have to do.

If I ever take a day off doing anything, I'll always for something engineering-related and stress again, because I don't know what to do with myself when I have free time. Sure I'd love to travel and go out and engage in all that stuff, but I'm doing my best to pay my way through uni and that's my primary goal for this year. Leave it with no debts.

TLDR: sorry this is a rant, I'm just tired and not in a good place right now. Everyone just expects it of me and gets pissy when I'm not onto it. It really kinda hurts. It might be tough love, but I don't feel any of the love. What do you guys think of to get around the face anxiety of job hunting?"
o3c9km,0,2021-06-19,"Got rejected from Java Intern position, I can't understand why, can you guys give me some clarification?",DiskoverOfficial,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/o3c9km/got_rejected_from_java_intern_position_i_cant/,"Hello, it's been a few days already, but I still feel like utter garbage, maybe you guys can ease my mind a little bit.

Basically I'v been studying programming for 8 months already, working my ass off and 2 months ago I decided that I was somewhat qualified to get my first internship, I started applying literally anywhere I thought I was somewhat qualified for, first few interviews were total failures, I was too inexperienced and nervous, but last one went perfectly, at one of the best companies in my country none the less. 

At technical interview I was asked basic Java questions, like what is OOP and its principles, what data structures I know, what personal projects I'v done and so on, it lasted about 20 minutes and I'd like to think it went perfectly, after that they invited me to the coding interview, and this is where my confusion begins.

I was given 5 questions and 30 minutes to solve, answers needed to be as optimal as possible.

1) Printing duplicate characters from a string. 

2)Check for Balanced Brackets in an expression.
e.g 
Input: exp = “[()]{}{[()()]()}” 
Output: Balanced
Input: exp = “[(])” 
Output: Not Balanced 

3) Find out if linked list has a loop.

4) Sum of two in sorted array.

5) Sorting a stack by using another stack.

my answers:
1) I initialize an empty set, then I iterate over a string and for each characters I check if its in the set, if it is I print it, if its not I add it, works in o(N), memory is o(N), as well.

2)I did it with stack, o(N) time and o(N) memory, then I was asked if I could do it with O(1) memory if only ""("" and "")"" braces were present, I answered that I could do with INT, basically each time ""("" comes in I increase value by 1, if "")"" I decrease, if it goes beyond 0 return false, and if at the end INT == 0 return true.

3)I iterate over a linked list and save pointers in a set, if a pointer already exists, it means its a loop. o(N) complexity but o(N) memory as well, then I was asked if I could do it with o(1) memory with two pointers (Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm), I was having a hard time then they gave me a hint to imagine a race, then I figured it out but I guess it was a little bit too late.


4) This question was hardest for me, I was running out of time and I had to come up with a solution fast, so I just run over an array for each int, o(N^2)... we tried to discuss a better algorithm but my brain decided to shut down.

5) No need to explain this one I believe, Did it with another stack and they pretty much said that yeah this is the answer.

This was it basically, I left the building happy and proud of myself, but turns out I was wrong... Maybe I'm just too inexperienced still and that's why I think that I'v done fairly well, what do you think? Sorry this post came out a little bit lengthy, but I don't know many programmer guys to talk about it with."

o3igsk,85,2021-06-19,TIFU by clogging the bathroom of the place in which I'm doing my internships,snipercat94,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/o3igsk/tifu_by_clogging_the_bathroom_of_the_place_in/," 

A bit long, so there's a TLDR at the bottom.

So,  backstory time: I'm studying pharmacy, and am about to graduate (just 2  weeks away actually!). In order to graduate, I have to work 300 hours  in either, an hospital or communal pharmacy (communal being the term in  my country for your everyday pharmacy you find in any street). I chose  to work at a communal pharmacy, where we are 4 people working. Because  the pharmacy is relatively small, we have only one of everything: 1  kitchen, 1 small ""lab"" area, and of course, 1 bathroom. Also, we are  only 4 people working in there: My boss, her husband, one employee, and  me, the intern. I go to work from 9 a.m to 12:30 p.m, and then I get out  for start again and work from 4:30 p.m to 8 p.m.

Now, to the TIFU that happened 3 days ago actually:

I went to work on my morning shift, and everything was well... that was until 10 a.m though, when I suddenly had a the **URGE**  to take a shit. Of course, like any other sensible person, I have the  irrational fear of using a bathroom that's not my house's for take a  shit, in case something goes wrong. So of course, I did the sensible  thing, and held it in.

One hour  passes... still holding it, no problem... Half an hour more passes...  Okay this might not be as easy as I thought, but I'm still holding...  Finally, it becomes almost 12 p.m, still 30 minutes to go home, and I  realize with horror: I'm **NOT** lasting that long.

So, clenching my butt cheeks with ferocity, I think about my options:

1. I  put in a bullshit excuse, and ask my boss to leave 30 minutes early. My  boss is one of the chillest women you will ever meet, and there wasn't  much work for me that day, so this was completely feasible.
2. I have perfume in my backpack. I can go into the bathroom, take a quick shit, spread perfume for hide the smell, and done!

So,  option one sounds like the wisest option, right? But well, because I'm  stubborn, and because I thought to myself ""I will have to work 30 extra  minutes other day for compensate"", I decided that option 1 was not good  enough. So, arming myself with courage, I opted for option 2!

So,  I wait for my boss to get out the bathroom (She's pregnant, and goes to  the bathroom to pee every 20 minutes. This is important later). And as  soon as she gets out, I go in, **with her seeing me go in after her**. (Important later)

So,  as soon as I'm in, I drop my pants, and take the fastest and most  violent shit you could imagine. Like seriously, if I were home, I would  had taken out my shirt for take it and all. But, keeping up speed, I  managed to get it all out in like 3 minutes at most.

So, feeling relieved, I pull the cord. Water goes down a bit, so far so good... Then it stops going down... uh-oh... Then *it starts going up...* ***OH NO***... And finally, it starts going up, all the way up to the border of the toilette, making me go ***livid***

Now,  this is the part where I would love to be able to say ""The toilette  always worked iffy"", or ""I used too much toilette paper""... But no. The  toilette worked perfectly (my boss had even used it seconds before I got  in), and I didn't use too much toilette paper in order to reduce odds  of clogging it. So yes, dear readers. **The turd I dropped was so big and nasty, that it outright clogged the toilette of the place I'm doing my internships.**

Of course, as soon as that happened, I looked around in panic to check if there was something, *anything*  I could use to fix it before someone came in and saw a bowl full of  shitty water (because of course, not all of my turd had gone down, and  it was still floating in the water)... but there was nothing. We had  nothing in the pharmacy for deal with a clogged toillette.

So  I thought of the next option: as soon as you exit the toilette, there's  a small kitchen. Maybe I can grab a knife there, end my life, and end  my shame right there and then. But I discarded the idea quickly, because  I would probably have to write a letter, and that would take too much  time and everything would be discovered.

So,  red of shame and with no other option, I use the last resource:  ""Boss?..."" I call out, having no option but to notify this. After all,  she saw me go into the bathroom, so she would KNOW it was me who clogged  it, and because she is pregnant and goes to the bathroom often, there  was no way I could pretend everything was normal for half an hour. So  there was no way to even escape the blame. Notifying it was the only  thing I could do.

So I explain the  problem to her... ""Did you use too much toilette paper?"" she asks...  ""No boss... It was not the paper..."" I say, getting redder and redder.  Luckily though, my boss is a discrete woman, and has the decency to hold  back her laughter and hide her smile under her chinstrap, trying to not  make me feel worse than I already did. ""IT's okay Snipercat94! This are  things that happen..."" She says, trying to comfort me while hiding the  inner laughter that I can see in her eyes. ""This is perfectly normal,  and it could happen to anyone... But, I'm going to need that bathroom in  like, 10 minutes, so your new task is to unclog it""

""Yes  ma'am..."" I say, still red, and get down to that. I ask her if we have  anything for unclog it, since I saw nothing in the pharmacy. ""Not that I  know, no. So you will have to get creative!"" she said.

And  so, I started to work on the problem. I looked around until I found a  possible solution: A plastic flower. The plastic flower had a long stalk  that it turned to be made of thin iron cable that could be bent around,  and so I thought: If I can reach the source of the clog with this, AKA  my turd, and break it down with the wire, maybe I can unclog this  bitch!""

And so, arming myself with  a plastic flower and a pair of latex gloves, I get my hands into the  shitty watter, and valiantly start fighting the stuck turd with it in  order to free the toilette of it's evil influence. The result? Before,  the water was going down *veeeeeeery*  slowly; now? It didn't went down at all. After all my efforts, somehow I  made things worse, and not only that, but some shitty water slipped  into my gloves, making my whole hand wet.

So,  after 3 minutes of thoroughly washing my hand, I started thinking in  plan B... Which me remember: ""Wait... we have a DIY shop in front of  us... And they sell those suction cups for unclogging toilettes in  them!"". So, running to the front, I tell my boss ""Wait 5 minutes, I'll  be right back with the solution!"", and then proceed to rush to the shop.  I kick the shop's door open (not really), slam my hands on the counter  (not really), and tell the person attending: ""Give me the **biggest** suction cup you have"".

The attendee does as requested, I pay the money for it (a bit expensive, but I'm **NOT**  leaving the pharmacy without fixing this, so he could have charged me  double and I would have still paid), and then heroically return to the  pharmacy with my new weapon in hand.

I  rush past the front customers, past my boss, and putting on a new pair  of latex gloves, I start going at it. And after a minute of vigorous  pumping, lo and behold, ***it worked***. Water went down normally. I pulled the cord again, and it worked normally again, so it was fixed.

And  so, my odyssey ended. I fixed the problem, but sadly, by that time  everyone in the pharmacy got to know what happened, which made everyone  laugh. The employee and my boss were very discrete, but my boss's  husband was much less discrete, hauling with laughter when he heard  about it. Luckily though I know how to laugh of myself, so I cracked  some jobs about it all, saying that ""This was literally and  figuratively, my shittiest day of my internships"", and then my shift  came to it's end and I went home, carrying my newly acquired suction cup  with me, which will likely tag along with me for the rest of my life,  as a reminder of this moment.

**TLDR:**  I shat so hard I clogged the bathroom of the pharmacy I make my  internships in, and had no option but to tell my boss. She laughed  (discretely), and told me to fix it. I made it worst at first when I  tried to use a wire for unclog the thing, but then fixed it with a  suction cup. By then, everyone found out, and my co-worker laughed  (discretely), and my boss's husband laughed (not discretely at all). Now  I have a new suction cup at my house as reminder of this all."
o3izrd,0,2021-06-19,C.S. PhD programs in the U.S./Canada with only two papers?,3raxftw,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/o3izrd/cs_phd_programs_in_the_uscanada_with_only_two/,"Hello, I'm thinking about PhD. programs for computer science when I graduate, but I don't think I'm very competitive. I've only published two C.S. papers, and they aren't related to the specific area of computer science that I want to do research in. Same with my research experience, I have two years of research and TA experience, both over the summer and during the school year, but not related to algorithmic game theory or the applications of the stable matching problem which is what I want to do research on. My capstone thesis is specifically on AGT/stable matching, but it's honestly way too early for me to tell whether or not that project will result in a publication at a peer-reviewed journal, and if it does it won't be in time to go on my C.V. for applications. My GPA is meh, only 3.4, and my practice GREs have not been very good, just in the low-mid 160s (taking it for real soon). I also didn't do an REU, I just did two summers at my college and an internship this summer. 

With all that info, should I even bother applying to PhD programs? I really find the applications of the stable matching problem to be one of the most fascinating areas of computer science, and it's one of the applications of both C.S. and economics that helps people the most, but it's been really hard to get economists at my school to work with me as an undergrad getting a C.S. degree. That's made it really hard to get any meaningful research on algorithmic game theory done at my school, because the C.S. faculty here doesn't do anything with game theory; I know more about the game theory side of my thesis than my advisor does. I would love to continue work in this field, especially since it's going in such a fascinating direction with the concept of obvious strategy proofness and a greater focus on comprehensible algorithms over mathematically sound ones. But I know I don't compare to the people coming with 4.0s from Stanford or Harvard, so I am just wondering if I should even bother applying to places like University of British Columbia, Stanford, Penn, or U.T. Austin. I have other places I'm considering but those are the main ones. Any advice is appreciated, thank you."

o3my1k,1,2021-06-19,Dealing with self-doubt,_silenceinthelibrary,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/o3my1k/dealing_with_selfdoubt/,"**TL;DR: I am graduating college next year and am likely to continue work as a research intern at a small company after I graduate. I have recently been able to appreciate how difficult the process of doing research in this area is, and this has resulted in constant thoughts of self-doubt about whether I can actually work in this area. Despite my boss believing that I am capable, I often don’t feel that way, and I have been struggling with motivation a lot. I am questioning whether it is a good decision to continue in this area (despite a lack of better options) and more broadly I’m looking for advice on the topics of self-doubt, self-sabotage, impostor phenomenon, and career-related anxiety. Apologies in advance for the lengthy post and thank you to anyone who is able to give advice.**

I’m a soon-to-be college senior and I currently work at a small company as a research intern/developer. We create software to aid various scientific data processing. I was hired on as an intern last year, and despite the challenges of the work, I have really enjoyed it. I am returning to school in the fall to complete my last year of college, and then I will graduate in the spring of next year. Over the past few months, the subject of my post-graduation plans have came up and I expressed general interest in returning to the company after graduating. My boss was very receptive and told me that they would love to have me return to the team. I reflected on it more, and I recently re-affirmed my interest in returning, after considering what my other options actually were. Nothing is formal yet but I’m starting to second guess my ability to actually do work in this area, which is made worse by feelings of self-doubt and anxiety.

I’m afraid of what comes after I graduate. Even after being an intern for over a YEAR, I struggled to get to the point where I could even *understand* the literature being written in the field. And now that I can barely understand the literature, it’s making me realize how fucking difficult it is to actually do original research. Every time I read a paper (*if* I can actually follow it), I simply cannot imagine ever coming up with the ideas behind it. Even if I convince myself that I could, I then couldn’t imagine having the persistence/grit required to work through a bunch of ideas and find the one that works, or is useful. I understand that in many fields a negative result is still a result, but the problem is that my goal as an employee isn’t just to do research, it’s to actively *improve* on a data processing workflow so that our clients can get better results with our software. In light of that, I get no fulfillment or satisfaction from a negative result, and I doubt my boss does either.

I wonder if I’m feeling this way because I’m not really prepared for the role I’ve taken on. But I realize that a lot of early-stage grad students are probably in a similar situation to me, and are of similar age/experience, so in reality I feel like I should be just as prepared as someone entering grad school. Surely many grad students get similar amounts of guidance than I do, and have a similar level of independence as me. Maybe I’m just not ready for doing research at all? I also asked my boss for feedback overall, and they told me that I have a good experimental mindset, solid fundamentals, am eager to read literature in the field, etc., and thought that I was overall doing a great job. Maybe some of that was true earlier on in my internship, but ever since March/April, I’ve been in such a bad funk that literally I hardly accomplish anything everyday. Aside from suggesting I look into certain areas to broaden my skillset, they didn’t give me any other constructive criticism, and I wonder if that would have been different if they knew how much I’m mentally struggling.

It’s also hard to tell if research is really for me (and I should continue doing it), or if I should just try something else. And as long as I’m at the company, the “something else” would probably be leaving the research side and moving into a software engineering role. Unfortunately there’s a lot about software engineering that I don’t know, and from meetings over the past year, I’ve realized that I just don’t understand enough to be able to successfully transition to such a role right now. My major is not in CS or software engineering and all things considered I am still a fairly novice programmer. I would have to either seek mentorship from one of the software engineers on the team (the thought of which stresses me out), or I would have to put a lot of time outside work to learning a bunch of technologies, frameworks, etc. that I have 0 understanding of right now. And honestly I just feel like I’m not in the right mindset to do that.

I should elaborate more on my decision to stay at this company. Despite how hard I find the day-to-day process of research, I ultimately do find the work interesting. It's really exciting to be working in a scientific area especially so early on in my career. I’ve always been interested in math and physics, and this is one of the rare fields where knowledge of physics is *actually* quite relevant. A lot of the computational/mathematical details about the software we write are also just generally interesting to me, because they use a lot of concepts that I never thought I would work with in real life. In science/engineering degrees, you learn a bunch of math and physics, but it’s such a common thing for alumni to tell us how NONE of that matters at their job working at an engineering firm, tech company, you name it. I had been mentally preparing myself for the reality of finding work in an area where none of that knowledge was used, and the idea made me sad because the part of me that enjoys learning about these things would not be fulfilled. Plus I would have to find something else to carry me through the day — if I didn’t have genuine interest in the work, how would I survive working at a bank or tech company? I would have to find a different source of motivation, and that in itself would probably be an angst-ridden process. 

Even disregarding concerns over interest, I found myself repeatedly coming to the conclusion that I would not be capable of doing any of the jobs that are typically pursued by graduates of my degree, without investing significantly in re-training myself. Many of my peers describe their jobs to me, both the day-to-day and the actual work, and it often involves a lot of skills I would have to learn on my own. So in that sense, the conclusion I’ve come to is that staying at the company would require just as much (continual) self-learning as it would for me to go do anything else. I don’t really feel like I have an “easy” other option, other than my silly fantasy of moving out to the desert and working at a cafe or something. And doing a PhD/grad school would probably look a lot like what I’m doing now anyway, but with the additional crushing stress of knowing that you’re basically locked in it for the next 5 years. Staying where I am right now wouldn’t have that problem as I could move to a different job after a year or two without it being considered a failure.

So those were the main reasons behind why I want to stay. In addition, the team has generally been very supportive and great people to work with. And NONE of the typical issues you hear small companies suffering from (poor work life balance, being mistreated by superiors, uncertainty over the company’s stability) have been the case for me. So it really feels like I would be foolish to give up an apparent gem of a job, given all of the above. Regardless, the parts of it that I struggle with are making it so mentally difficult for me. And really, I just can't imagine what else I could or want to do after graduating, aside from maybe taking some time off to do more self-discovery (whatever that means)? 

Aside from these struggles I’m facing, my life should be easy. I’m extremely privileged both in where I grew up and my family situation. I have a great relationship with my family, who would be able to support me financially if it came to that. I have a few good friends that I regularly talk to, and healthy relationships with all of them. All this makes it feel insensitive to be complaining so much about my struggles, and yet I don't know what else to do. I suppose there are other things that may be relevant. I don’t exercise as much as I should, and I spend too much time sleeping. I’m also prone to anxiety and I understand that I have certain negative thought patterns that cloud my judgment from time to time. Those thought patterns have led me to self-sabotage a few times before. In all cases, self-sabotaging involved me backing out of something (either a commitment or a life decision I made) driven by the fear of failure or the worry that I would not be able to handle it. So maybe this explains my worry that down the line I'll once again make this into a negative experience by giving up on it. In my ideal life I would never have to take any risks, and I would never get involved with anything until I was 100% certain about what it would demand of me (obviously this is impossible in reality). I don’t know if any of this is associated with a specific mental illness, but could therapy still help with working through such things?

I would really appreciate any advice anyone has to offer. I think it would help to have a broader perspective on things, which really anyone could help with, so please don’t hesitate to drop a few thoughts even if only a few sentences. Thanks everyone and I hope you are all taking care &lt;3"

I barely do well in my classes, I have to stay up and lose all of my teenage life to even have a chance at doing well in my classes.

My friends get 1500+ on their SAT and barely scarping with 1350.

I lost every single fucking competition I have ever entered. (Science fair, History Day, Essay contests, Trivia, Debate, Robotics, Etc.) Meanwhile, my friends are internationally recognized winners and all that. WHY THE FUCK AM I SO DUMB?!?!

I applied to so many internships (Ericcson, Boeing, NASA, etc.) and the only one I got was with the one Daddy's connections got me. Meanwhile, my friends are all self-made and stuff.

It's not that I don't work hard, I think I do so my thoughts are maybe I'm just stupid?

I don't know what I'm doing wrong, I don't know what's missing, because I am a hard worker.

I'm completely fine with the fact that I might just be stupid and being smart isn't cut out for me.

I understand I cant win everything, but why am I failing at every single fucking thing.

What am I doing wrong, why are all the people I surround myself with doing so much better than me?"
o3oq2b,2,2021-06-19,Can i land a game dev job at a startup ?,MrRealWhiteWolf,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/o3oq2b/can_i_land_a_game_dev_job_at_a_startup/,"Hello everyone,

As i enter my senior year of software engineering am really considering looking for a job in the gaming industry so far i made two projects in that category .

One of them i made during an internship it's an immersive VR historic experience where the player will get to relive in the Neapolis era in Nabeul, Tunisia and he have the chance to perform certain actions and interact with the redesigned world of that era.

The second one is still in progress it's a personal project called ""AGRO"". AGRO is a 3D spcae shooter arcade game with a scoreboard and open levels where you compete against your friends to be the greatest hero and have the highest score, it offers a great variety and ways to achieve the highest possible score in each level, you can use multiple ways to defeate your enemies and each way will grant you a specific amount of points but dying in any level will erase all of your previous points, AGRO is fun and challenging to it's core , so far i ve made a prototype level and am still working on the first level adding explosive barrels and turrets and i have a couple of other ideas that i will be implementing in the future...

The point is that AGRO is my baby and it will be long from a finished project i will always be working on it in my spare time

Here is a video abt that first level ""Ancient Forest"" of AGRO:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8o\_hIcj8yw&amp;t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8o_hIcj8yw&amp;t=1s)

I also have another game idea in mind i might start working on it this summer.

Other than that i've made so many other projects in web dev , mobile dev and am still working on a lot of new ones too, am planning on creating a game engine then turning it into an OS itself i don't how to do that yet hahaha , but i really want to do it, i think it will be awesome to have an OS built in the skin of a game engine to be only used for game dev.

I had 2 other internships in web dev in the past and i had a one year work experience before in Sopra HR.

here is my github : it contains all of my last projects : [https://github.com/KhaledAchech](https://github.com/KhaledAchech)

And now i ve got into a new summer internship developing a mern application.

Basicaly what am trying to say after listing all of this, do i have a good profil to be a game developer, do you think i can land a job in the gaming industry even tho my profile is a bit mixed between game dev and web dev and i only have 2 games projects ?

My dream is to live abroad in Ireland and get a first job for now in a game dev startup because i feel like that's where i can learn the most by working in a start up after graduation looking into the things i ve listed here is it possible for me to do that ?

And thank you in advance for answering."

I  wanted to get into OMSCS for quite some time now. I am a digital marketing professional trying to get into an SE career, from Ireland. Further, I will write down about my journey so far in form of the pros and cons of my profile. Please advise on my questions:  
\- Is that the right time to apply?  
\- What do you think my chances to get into the programme, [Computing Systems](https://omscs.gatech.edu/specialization-computing-systems) specialisation with my profile?

For extra clarity, the way I formulated my goals below:  
\- Get a job FAANG level of the company as SE (internship, junior, does not matter) in a course of a year  
\- Being able to potentially get a job in the US as a SE in the future (i.e. pass qualification requirements from Government, etc.)  


Pros:  
1) I already have BSc and MSc, evaluated by WES, but both in business  
2) I am currently enrolled in a conversion MSc in Computer Science (University of York, UK). I have already finished 1/3 of my degree, which already qualifies me for a Postgraduate Certificate. The courses I have finished are:   
\- Algorithms and Data Structures (includes refresher on Java)  
\- Software Engineering  
\- AI and ML  
\- Big Data Analytics  
3) I have finished several BSc in CS courses from the University of the People (I know they are not as validated due to national accreditation, but still):  
\- Programming Fundamentals (Python)  
\- Programming 1 (Java)  
\- Programming 2 (Java)  
\- Relational Databases 1  
\- Introduction to Statistics  


Cons:   
\- Not having finished BSc or MSc in CS or engineering/math  
\- Did not do OS, computer architecture or networking courses (can do them now, but trying to make a decision between practical portfolio work + leetcode OR university courses, hard to do both with job)  
\- Not having relevant work experience and portfolio (we barely do portfolio projects in my UK university, but I will work on it in my free time)  
\- I did not take calculus/discrete math at this point. I was able to work through it in Algorithms, AI and Big Data Modules though, but still, it is probably a concern. In my BSc, I took ""Mathematical and Financial Calculations"", ""Mathematics in Economics"". Not sure how they would compare to full-on calculus, also it has been a while."

Would emailing him on his Gmail a good place to introduce myself rather than messaging on LinkedIn?There's a reason why he posted his Gmail publicly but not sure if it would look bad on my side to email him on there.

I am a grad STEM student in their last semester. However, over the Spring semester, I took a course I was no way prepared for and needed to withdraw to avoid failing it. Because of this, I am being denied a student refund request for the Summer and my last semester. I have full maxed out credit cards and ran out of money in the first of 2 years when I left my job at the time of the pandemic (being a supervisor in a pharmacy became grueling and high hours during the pandemic).

I have no money for groceries, rent, etc. and already took out a small loan to cover June as they denied my student refund request for not having enough credits at the time (was trying to do part-time as I also have an unpaid internship).

My parents can't help as my father is having his leg amputated due to an old war injury that wouldn't heal and my mother is filing chapter 7 bankruptcy. In essence, I am on my own. I would find part-time work but need internship experience badly which is why I took the unpaid internship. Despite being of lower class and having been homeless multiple times from youth to current, I have also been denied several ""aid scholarships"" as I am caucasian.

Honestly, on the verge of tears of having everything ripped away that I have been fighting so hard for due to an unfair system. What can I do besides find my nearest train tracks?"

(is unlimited pto a scam?),s3ndk1tt1es,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/o3s702/sanity_check_is_this_a_toxic_tech_work/,"This is not meant to be a rant in any way, but this is my first job in CS out of college. I never had an internship, and besides friends my age, I don’t have any mentors I feel comfortable discussing this with because I don’t want to make my company look bad

I work at a small startup and I was employee number 10. For context, I’ve been around for 2 years, and have “unlimited PTO” with a 14 day minimum. Also 4 other software devs have burnt out in the past 10 months—with a max software team of 3 people.

In the past year, I have taken 13 days of PTO, and my boss is treating me like I have reached my limit for the year and is now expecting I work through Thanksgiving and Christmas. The most PTO I have taken at once was 2 weeks the first September I had the job. Then I worked through Thanksgiving. since then I’ve taken off a week at a time 2x and that was for New Years. I worked remote through Christmas and even after getting it okayed by my boss beforehand, he counted it as PTO even though I was working and met multiple deadlines early.

When I request PTO, I give 4+ weeks notice and have cancelled a Thursday-Friday trip to Hawaii and week long trip to Vegas because I was asked to—even after it had been previously approved. 

The current setup has been frustrating because I feel like I cannot plan ahead without worrying that I’m going to lose a significant amount of money on what I schedule. Is this normal with unlimited PTO? My startup is small but I always make sure it’s not near important deadlines. 

I recently asked for a Friday off in September and he said “I need to consider the effect my absence has on my team”. I escalated to the CEO which is fairly normal for my company. When I spoke with my CEO he claimed that he doesn’t know a workplace where you could request a week of PTO and get it approved and says I should feel lucky. I feel a bit gaslit. Am I just asking for too much? How do other people navigate unlimited PTO?

I'm unsure of what to say when it comes to salary negotiation though. 

I just recently graduated from college (UI/UX design) and I've only known full-stack web development for about 1 year. My work experience is limited to graphic design and internships (both part-time) and my web dev projects are all school-related/independent practice.

**Given my lack of experience, the location (CA), and the company being a startup (20-25 employees, series A funding), what would be a fair salary range to ask for?** Should I ask them what they think this position is worth first and then counter?

o3u0zg,3,2021-06-19,My odds are objectively bad,TemperatureMobile,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/o3u0zg/my_odds_are_objectively_bad/,"This is all just becoming too much. TLDR is at the bottom- schizophrenia, long COVID, and ""the wall"" at 24. I've been in a downward spiral for about 5 years ever since my schizophrenia genes turned on in my late teens. I developed the negative symptoms of schizophrenia without delusions or hallucinations. But before this year, through screwup after screwup, I had my kernel, and although I didn't always understand what was happening to me, that was actually enough. I had a relationship with myself. I'd accepted that things would continue to be lost and had veered towards the passive observation of Sisyphusian or Sartrean absurdism until the erosion of my life came for my body. Through everything I bungled and let slip in various domains of life without knowing how to reverse, I was there. I was lucid. Real- perhaps even moreso than before, as with the detachment that the changes brought I started turning towards my experience itself rather than the objects of experience in the external world, which became less accessible to me given that my mental illness separated me from it. Like a blind person who develops better hearing, I developed heightened perception in terms of being pushed towards certain modes of consciousness that neurotypical people may not go into, at least by default. And that was actually interesting. Without the practical consequences, it wouldn't have even been necessarily bad. 

I always had the ability to speak for myself. I looked alright and had moderately high IQ- around 120. But I also had a specialized talent, so when I stayed in my area I could seem much smarter. I got into a good college before the switch flipped, which gave me a buffer. I also got a good internship junior year by meeting the right person on an errand. Although I knew my problems would never go away, I really used to think that somehow I'd end up being alright. Every time I lost something, I'd get something else. And even though I was always screwing myself, people really liked to talk to me. They saw something in me. I was attractive. Fraught and sure to make myself suffer throughout the rest of my life, but still with prospects. 

A year and a half ago, I started to go away. I tried CBD oil for a few months in attempts to hold a job as I had a sleep disorder and attention problems. I had smoked weed before and never had issues, so I thought it'd be alright. But in all honesty, I felt like I couldn't cope with adult life after graduation and needed a crutch. I started to get depersonalization and not feel myself, so I went off of it. But even afterwards, I didn't go back to the way I was before. I lost most of my memories and the capacity to feel. Then, a month later, I started seeing flashes of light. It went away after a few times, but I still had the memory loss. 

3 months later, coronavirus came. I was surprisingly resilient and adapted well. I started wearing N95 masks in February and a self-imposed lockdown in March with once weekly walks outside, and researched the etiology of the disease to create a stack of prophylactic supplements. I would've been okay. I wouldn't have had my body go on top of everything else, signaling the end. I would've never gotten the virus, and if I did, I would've had top medical care and had a decent outcome. But next we had George Floyd. The stress became too much for me to handle. I started seeing floating and swirling dots. By adjusting supplements and starting to take more frequent walks, it went away. But I still was having paranoia about the police and the far-right. I was black and staying with my dad in a red area. Reading Trump's tweets and what people on the right said on anonymous forums made me feel unsafe. I stopped being able to sleep and constantly thought about being wrongfully arrested, attacked, or shot. 

Against my parents' wishes, I decided to move overseas until the end of his term. But I wasn't equipped to go on my own and it was a stupid idea from the very beginning, although at first I was happier there. I spent 7 months overseas. Throughout the summer, I recovered some memory and sense of self, although I still had a mental block because of the stress of the pandemic. It seems it just needed time and abstention from CBD. But then in September I got a severe concussion from an accidental fall. I should've left at that point, but once I'd gone abroad I wanted to try to make it work and see if I could stay. I was in no hurry to return and continue suffering from anxiety with everything going on when there were new possibilities across the Atlantic. I was networking and looking for collaborations, which I actually got here and there. Throughout the majority of the pandemic, I was spared. But in January, I got the coronavirus. 

At the time, I didn't know it, as I tested negative, but it was subsequently diagnosed months later. I'd discussed returning earlier that month and felt a great apprehension about staying for the winter. But immediately beforehand, travel restrictions had gone up that made it very difficult to come back, and Trump was still contesting the election. It was all too easy to sit it out. I also didn't want to risk exposure by flying, so decided to stay until spring or perhaps even stay permanently, as I'd found a course to enroll in and a way to extend my visa. On some unknowable day in late January, I was hit. My test was negative and my oxygen was 100%, so things were ambiguous. Too tired to seek care, I slept for 2 weeks straight. When I woke up, I had loud tinnitus and a bunch of new food allergies. My brain had been wiped. I could barely speak in a complete sentence and had to quit my course. But, I was granted a visa extension, which I saw as a springboard to emigrate. As doctors told me it probably wasn't serious and wasn't coronavirus, I stayed for another month hoping it would go away. But instead, I developed long COVID. I came back in March and went to the hospital 3 times, but they wouldn't give me late treatment for COVID. I also got a bunch of work-ups, all normal, except the neuropsych exam which showed a bunch of functional brain damage. I was gone- unable to speak to my friends, work, or even write in my journal. My mind was blank and most of its contents completely blocked- long and short term memories, feelings, thoughts, images, all of it. 95% of what was previously in my brain had disappeared. I spent every day in a dementia-like state, barely conscious or sentient. I no longer could even contextualize the situation by reflecting and coming to a conclusion. I became a passenger in my own mind. For the most part, this is how I still am. The vaccines made things worse. My IQ dropped to 95. I saw the best infectious disease doctor in my city begging for treatment, as well as a neurologist and immunologist. But to this day, no one will help. No one will do anything. They're just going to let me stay like this, even though I could have the virus in my brain as we speak or leftover spike protein everywhere, causing inflammation that gives me brain damage. If I have to be stuck in this dull state, I'm not sure I even want to live. I know what I had before, and even though my external life was difficult to maintain, what I had was good.

I've aged maybe a decade in just six months. Studies show the virus is supposed to biologically age you by about 11 years, and that's when you don't have long COVID. With long COVID, the problem never resolves, so maybe you just keep deteriorating at the cellular level daily. I don't see my friends anymore, because I'm not quick- not entertaining. I can't think of things to say. I barely write and can't bring myself to cry. I can't perceive, imagine, or feel what I did. I'm a lower-order being. A braindead catatonic vegetable. And when I look at my face, I see someone who's had it a bit too rough. My face is sagging, my skin looks puffy and unhealthy, and the spaces under my eyes are hollow. I look like a chain smoker or one of those Hollywood burnouts who used to be pretty but fell into drugs a little too early and for a little bit too long. I'm already washed up. I don't have anything going for me anymore, and I don't have what would otherwise allow me to detach from that. No one is here. I can no longer make a representative statement or mourn as the situation warrants because my mind is gone. Despite everything that happened before, it's only now that I don't see a future. A woman's future seems to end when she's no longer pretty, although it shouldn't be that way. A person's future ends when they can no longer speak for themselves.

**TLDR:** I no longer see a way for myself. I developed prodromal schizophrenia in my late teens and in the past year it seems to have been going active. I got the coronavirus 6 months ago with no medical care and now I have long COVID. I'm being refused treatment for the virus that could still be there, and may stay indefinitely so that I can't heal. I've lost 25 IQ points and look old even though I'm only in my early 20s. In December, I was decent looking and smart. Now, I'm brain-damaged and have lost my looks 15 years earlier than I had to. So what am I supposed to do with myself? I've squandered the things that could've kept people invested in me, and now, I don't even have myself. I truly have nothing to look forward to. In fact, it's just as likely to get worse as it is to stay the same. I no longer think there's anything to get- anything in this world for me. "

I (21 F) am finishing up my undergrad this year and I've come to the realization that while I enjoyed learning about my field in uni, the industry itself and actual jobs available don't suite me well at all. I'm considering pivoting into some kind of software engineering or software development.

For reference, I majored in Geological Engineering at a decent Canadian university (no student loans) and I've done 3 internships. I have seen a lot of my current industry and I can pretty safely say that it isn't the right career path for me.

A large part of it is that I can't stomach the remote field work.  Since the beginning of the pandemic my mental health has taken a nose dive and I cant see myself working for extended periods of time in remote conditions, being away from my support system, or working 12-16 hour days for a month+ straight. I didn't hate the idea of fieldwork when I started the degree but I'm not sure I really understood what I was getting myself into. My university really sold the idea that fieldwork was some kind of escape from the dreary jailhouse 9-5 office environment. Spoiler alert: its not really like that.

Its a hard pill to swallow that I've done an entire degree in a field that doesnt work for me and I wish I had known myself better at the time I chose the degree, but I'm not going to cry over spilt milk. 

In summary, my current career trajectory isn't going to fly and I want to start re-thinking my plan. I know I'm still young and there are lots of options out there but I'm having a hard time figuring out what is feasible, what employers are looking for, and generally what the smartest path forward would be. To me, the most obvious path forward would be to try to get my foot in the door at a company that develops geoscience related software. I would really appreciate any feedback or general advice as to how I would actually go about doing that. Here are some of the options I'm considering:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Second bachelors degree in CS
2. Masters in CS
3. Bootcamp or other entry level programs (codeacademy, the odin project, etc)

&amp;#x200B;

Again for reference, I have over a year of experience working for geotech and mining consultants. My overall GPA is ok (\~3.7), but I've had straight A's for the past three years and my major GPA is a 4.0 (I really bombed my first year of my undergrad lets not talk about it).  I've been told most employers and grad schools look at the final two years or your major GPA and hopefully that's true. Based on that, I'm pretty confident I could get into a grad scheme or a second undergrad if I decided to go down that road. 

I've taken a few beginner level CS classes in uni (Python and C++), several short courses on my own time to learn Python and SQL, and I worked on a couple projects during my internships that involved using Python for data analysis and visualization.

I know this is not a lot of experience and I definitely cant get myself in the door for an actual software engineering gig with this alone. At this point I don't think I could pass any kind of technical interview. I'm willing to put in the work to change my career path I just don't know where to start. Any advice or experience anyone can share would be massively appreciated."

Do I need to be born with EC's in my CV?

And most people who volunteer and get into good colleges won't even prolly volunteer if not for schools. not saying that most people are bad, they may be good people but they prolly won't go out of their way to help people.

I get it if they want internships and your awards(which I have none, lol) cuz they wanna see you getting into the workforce and how much you like something and stuff but most of the requirements are overboard, people say that these EC's make you stand out and how much you have done but what bout resources?I get if you wanna say that many people get further without resources too,i am learning some programming and physics from another curriculum such as A-level too but Average people with the desire to learn and stuff cant get there.I have accepted it and so have my friends and families."

o41ndg,4,2021-06-20,Questions about career path recommendations for incoming university senior already working in a full time technical position,_UserAlreadyTaken,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/o41ndg/questions_about_career_path_recommendations_for/,"TL;DR: Looking for career advice once I graduate w/ bachelors. Should I stay with my current company and get my master's if they pay for most of it? Advice on education path if I want to grow out of a technical position and move into a managerial position. Also last few questions of my post. 

I started as a help desk intern in my current company. I recently moved over to our data center as a full-time operator with a salary, and I'm still in school working on my degree in IT. We are a large utility. I'm very young (just turned 21) so as far as experience goes in the field, this is it (aside from regular desktop support to family and very few clients). 

When we chose IT for our degree, we had to choose a primary and secondary focus area (I went into networking for primary, and security for secondary). In addition, we still had to take pre-req's that briefly cover just about every area of IT. I've learned a lot about the corporate environment and the different systems and applications in most large companies in both my job, and with school. 

But now I'm stuck and can't really decide what to do next. This company is really great and will even pay for the majority of my masters if I go that route (req. 2yrs after graduation), and that doesn't seem bad at all. All of the different groups within IT here are staffed with very friendly and knowledgeable people (aside from a few bad apples) but that's to be expected in a large company. The joke within the IT area here is that once people get into positions, they don't ever leave. 

I don't know if I want to be in a technical role here forever either. The pay is above average compared to other utilities and companies in general around me. But I also don't know if I want to stay in the same location where I currently live forever. I also don't know if I want to focus on networking or security when I graduate anymore. Other IT areas still appeal to me, though. 

The next step for me seems to be what I want to do with school. I can do a 4+1 to get my masters in IT but I'm not sure how this would compare to just my bachelors or if it would help at all. I've also considered getting my MBA to be in a managerial or director role eventually. 

I guess my questions to all of you would be:

\- How would a Master's in IT look compared to a Bachelor's in IT combined with an MBA

\- If I don't want to remain in a technical role forever, what are my options if I still want to grow in a company past there, but I only have a master's in IT? 

\- Should I stay with my current company until I at least complete my masters, or do a lot of other companies offer similar opportunities?"

Surprise, Surprise.... They weren't. Both myself and the intern wrote about two pages of very direct and to the point notes about what this other co-worker had spent her time on. Needles to say, it all boils down to a major time management issue (Being on Tic Tok is more important)

Emails were sent to our director explaining what we had seen and what was told to us was ""Both stories match up"" and that they would be in discussion with the co-worker and that it appeared they needed to start Micromanaging her. 

Fast forward to yesterday... The co-worker who is now being watched found the email that I had sent my director with dates and times of what she had been doing that weekend. She ""Blew up!"" printed out a copy and immediately called our director. 

This is the part I'm worried about. She's known to ""Lie"" in the office and/or ""make things up"" if she doesn't know the answer and told me yesterday after coming back into the office in a very snarky tone ""I'm going to tell them you sent me photos of your partner"" (Which I never have and have proof)

She's already harassed the summer intern about their college education, girlfriend, and calling him ""Eye Candy"" during his first few days there. He no longer wants to work with her or be in the office. 

I'm generally afraid of what she's going to put in her report but at the same time I'm one foot out the door with the company. 

How do I protect myself in a situation like this? Is there anything I should/shouldn't do? She has told both myself and my direct management that if she were to get fire, she would ""Take the office with her""

o4a3ww,1,2021-06-20,Should I do grad school?,ElectronicSandwich8,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/o4a3ww/should_i_do_grad_school/,"I'm a UBC undergrad student living in Metro Vancouver with my parents, and planning to finish my computer engineering degree in May 2022.  

I have considered grad school for a while since I thought it could be useful for opening opportunities, but I wasn't sure if it was something I should do. If I go ahead with grad school, I intend to use the master's degree as a ticket for higher starting wages in software development roles in industry.  

So far, I haven't developed particularly close relationships with any of my previous instructors or other potential referees. Further, I have no research experience and my sessional average over the past year and the year before that are both below A-. As a result, I'm likely ineligible for registration in directed studies courses. These factors don't seem to be working in my favour, since I will probably have to apply relatively soon if I decide to enroll in grad school in September 2022. I might not have enough time to gain the references/research experience needed or have my grades from my upcoming 4th year classes appear on the transcript I end up sending out.  

I did a software internship last summer and I'm currently doing another one this summer. Both were at FAANG companies. Because of my current work experience, I suspect getting a new grad software development role right out of undergrad would not be too hard for me as long as I keep up with leetcode medium/hard and polish my resume.  

On the other hand, if I do grad school, I could potentially enter the workforce at a higher pay grade in 2023/2024 but could possibly forfeit a year or more of up to six figures worth of income annually.  

In both cases, if my job after grad or my selected grad school is in the Metro Vancouver area, I'll be able to live with my parents. Further, if I choose grad school, I will be able to have my parents fund my tuition.  

Does the job market for software development assign significantly more value to candidates with a graduate degree in computer engineering or related areas? If so, is the difference in market value more than salary bumps that the typical promotion processes would provide, i.e. is the ROI of grad school worth chasing?"
o4aivy,1,2021-06-20,"[MI] Internship went completely wrong, looking for help to reflect.",Ashley_123018,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/o4aivy/mi_internship_went_completely_wrong_looking_for/," I had an internship for 5 weeks at a major food production company, but it went terribly wrong. I ended up resigning on Friday last week, but I want to reflect on the experience so the same thing doesn't follow me in the future. I'm bothered that it went this badly.

I study a lot of topics in school ranging from food chemistry to microbial physiology- for simplification purposes I am a molecular biology student going into my senior year. Going into the internship, I was extremely nervous because it was an engineering and business geared role, areas which I have 0 experience or education in. I felt like everyone was against me there and since this was a very social role, I crashed and burned immediately.

1. On the second day, I was in the locker room and a crew leader was leaving at the same time as me. She looked at me and said, ""How do you like it here?"" I said ""This has been an eye-opening experience so far!"" She said, 'You don't have to lie to me and tell me you like it here"".
2. I am a woman (21F), the other 3 interns were guys. I got there on the first day before they all did because I am from the area and they were out of state. My manager had not arrived yet since she worked 2nd shift, but the manager I met refused to shake my hand. He pointed me to the room and told me to just sit down and go on my laptop. When he came back, my laptop wasn't working. He wouldn't answer me back. I asked him 3 times what was going on and he said, ""Not my problem, someone else will help you later."" When the other male interns arrived, he was asking them what universities they were from, telling them about our state, and asking them tons of questions. He left me out of this whole talk.
3. I have no experience with machinery. I've never handled a wrench in my life. One of my projects involved oil lubrification, so when I heard my project contact say something about drips of oil I asked what that was. She told me that was a dumb question.
4. When I expressed concerns about being underqualified, I was told ""You're a biochemist! I could never imagine being a biochemist. If you're smart enough to figure that out, you don't need our help. You can rise to the challenge alone."" Umm, I would not have gotten to where I am today without the support of many advisors, friends, and professors.
5. I had an immense amount of stress in my personal life and medical stuff to handle. Since this was a day oriented job primarily, I had to take a ton of phone calls and inform my family of possible diagnoses. Admittingly, I did not spend as much time on the factory floor as I should have been. I found out from another intern, that the supervisors went to him and told him that I would be getting a poor performance review and they asked him if he knew why I was behaving the way I was. They shared details of my review with him and he told me I would not be getting an offer. No one came and spoke to me once. I informed them of the personal struggles and eventually they laid off me for taking time off the floor, but the damage seemed to already be done. 
6. When I got my performance review, I was told I needed to be more emotionally expressive so that people would find me more engaging? I said, ""this isn't anything personal, I am just an introverted person."" When I asked for suggestions, I was given none.
7. I was placed in a room with large amounts of chili powder. At the 45 minute mark, I was hacking my lungs out with watery eyes. I ran back to the supervisors office and grabbed my headphones. They had popsicles upstairs and I was going go and eat one and listen to music. I found out another supervisor saw me crying and told everybody I hated it there after that. No one tried talking to me about what happened to see that I had chili powder in my eyes/lungs/nose.
8. On my last day, a supervisor asked me to go home early several times."

I know this sub gets a lot of posts like the one that's gonna follow. But I could really use some opinions right now. 
I'm an international rising junior at Penn State main campus who got accepted to join GT for CS. Now, I know GT is one of the best schools in the country for CS but what's making my decision very tough is that I'll be losing 23 credits if I transfer to GT and my GPA resets asw whereas I have a 4.0 at Penn State and I'm on course to complete a double major in CS and Econ and a minor in Maths in 4 years there. The topics that have been provoking my thoughts the most are:
1) Would it be easy to fit in at GT as a transfer student in my junior year ?
2) Is it worth taking a hit to my GPA considering I'll be taking mostly upper classmen CS courses and GT being a very competitive school ?
3) Does GT give an edge to its CS international students in terms of getting an internship or gaining employment as compared to other universities ?
4) Is GT worth it to pay for an additional semester since I won't be able to complete in 4 years because of my lost credits.

Also, I believe what matters most to Tech Firms employing college kids are the individual projects and research, not the university rankings. I might be wrong. 

If you've made it till here, do you think it's worth transferring to GT given my conditions. 

Any help is appreciated. Never been so conflicted in my life."
o4calu,1,2021-06-20,"Been out of school (college) for 2 years due to a mistake, 100k in debt with 90 credits at a 2.0 GPA",Shoffless,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/o4calu/been_out_of_school_college_for_2_years_due_to_a/,"Hi all,

I feel like  ive been at a crossroad in my life for sometime now and I don’t know how to go about it.

For some context I am 24 y/o and stopped attending school when I had a drinking accident that caused me to miss the second half of my junior year semester. Prior to that I was averaging a 2.0 GPA with my degree requiring just that to finish (Information Science degree). Have never been good with school, just could never sit down and focus on the schoolwork that needed to be done. The summer following my accident I was unable to obtain an internship anywhere and my uncle was able to get me one at a small company he worked at, where 2 months in I was offered a full time job due to my work ethic and skills. My current position I make 40 an hour plus 1.5x overtime as a programmer in the industrial automation industry. Through working at this company, which I do like my job, I have discovered a passion for engineering which to some extent my problems require creative solutions everyday using math and science. 

My crossroads is this: Unless I finish school I feel like I will be stuck where I am and will have no opportunity to be able to explore additional opportunities or different locations due to my lack of degree, but feel like finishing my current degree path is almost useless to the field I am in now. Having grown and matured I feel like I could start school again slowly taking night classes and pursue an engineering degree to give me that freedom I think im looking for, but understanding I am 100k in debt already as it is and close to finishing a degree on a different path.

In the grand scheme of things I know my problem isn’t that bad, and very much self induced, and I am very fortunate to be where I am at. Just looking for some opinions and maybe someone who has been in a similar situation, what path did you choose and where are you now? 

Thanks for your time all, appreciate it much."

o4cw4b,48,2021-06-20,Gap Year + GRE?,wafaffle,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/o4cw4b/gap_year_gre/,"I'm a rising senior and I'm very interested in going to a good grad school for a Master's in Electrical Engineering. However, I have to get a massive medical procedure done which would require roughly 4ish months to recover fully. I really would not like to enter grad school while recovering, so I'm pretty sure I'd need to take a gap year. Right now I'm not really sure whether I want to go to grad school right after or to work first. I've never heard of people taking a gap year between undergrad and grad/work, but I'm imagining a few options:

1. Take a gap year after graduating, take the GRE during this time, go to grad school full-time, then work

2. Take a gap year, work, take the GRE, then go to grad school part-time

3. Take the GRE right now which leaves the most options open

I'm super busy with my internship and will be pretty busy during senior year with research + senior design, so I don't really know if I'll be able to study enough for the GRE now to do as well as I possibly could given I'd need to take it in just a couple months if I wanted to take it now. Plus, I'm not sure how companies would react to me taking a whole gap year (I'd ideally continue doing research with my university lab group + independent projects before/after the procedure). Is interviewing for grad school or jobs during senior year and then trying to defer for a year ideal, or should I just essentially go off the radar and then pop back up during the end of my gap/recovery year to restart all the job hunting/grad school application stuff?"

o4gf7x,141,2021-06-20,Holistic Review is Bullshit,ADMISSIONSMADNESS,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/o4gf7x/holistic_review_is_bullshit/,"The biggest lie that admissions offices tell the public is that their holistic review process is consistent and fair. It isn’t. 

Most applications are skimmed in less than ten minutes. Universities create elaborate scoring and review systems to evaluate candidates’ academics, leadership potential, creativity, adversity, and so on. They grade on one to five scales, offer a single score, assign plusses and minuses, soft or firm recommendations for admission. 

**Putting numbers on something doesn’t make it science.** 

And it’s all bullshit. Holistic review is bullshit.

College admissions is essentially a human resources problem. How do you find the best fit among many qualified applicants for a few number of spaces? 

Google, Goldman Sachs, and McKinsey still haven’t perfected their hiring and human resources. And they have nearly infinite amounts of data and metrics to assess who succeeds in their organizations. Google has experimented with a number of strategies including brain teasers, conducting a battery of twenty-five interviews, or having prospective employees submit responses to three-hundred questions. If Google can’t figure out how to hire well, nobody can, including college admissions.

Reliably selecting for talent is impossible. NFL talent scouts routinely miss on undrafted free agents who eventually become stars, or their draft top picks never amount to anything. 

**Holistic review is inconsistent, imperfect, and prone to error and bias.**

It isn’t a very effective tool for universities to “find the right fit.” Universities give the impression that their review process is “rigorous” and that they take “substantial time” to get to know their applicants. That’s misleading.

Two fundamental issues with holistic review everywhere are *calibration* and *consistency.* 

When I scored applications for UT-Austin, all of us reviewers received office-wide training. We read sample files. Each counselor voted on what they thought the essay score was on a scale of 1 to 6. There was almost never a universal agreement. Some people scored the same essay as low as three with others awarding the highest score of six. The trainer had his own opinions that often disagreed with the audience. That means some reviewers tended to be strict and others more lenient. The review process can never be calibrated. You might get a strict reviewer and never know it.

Holistic review scoring is always inconsistent. In the findings of Daniel Kahneman and his co-authors recent book, holistic review contains a substantial amount of *Noise.* So many unknown and unknowable variables influence human decision-making, and without transparency or oversight of holistic review processes, systematic error-making will go unacknowledged. 

Not all reviewers are even admissions counselors. Universities hire outside readers and are paid $15-20 an hour. Most applications are read in eight to ten minutes. Reading 20 or 30 or more applications every day makes it difficult to maintain an even distribution of scores. Reviewers experience fatigue, especially since most applications look the same. 

There is also bias and error. Reviewers tend to score more favorably the applicants who have similar interests or backgrounds to themselves. Your score might depend on the reviewer’s mood, how much sleep they’ve gotten, how strong the applications were just before yours, or whether they’ve been drinking a glass of wine. Even multiple rounds of review or review by committee doesn’t correct problems of consistency and calibration.

Towards the end of the review cycle, universities assess borderline applicants for admission, waitlist, deferral, or denial. This process to separate borderline applicants is called “shaping.” 

Yale professor William Deresiewicz wrote the book Excellent Sheep. He observed Yale’s shaping process and says, “In six hours of committee work, we disposed of somewhere between 100 and 125 cases or about three or four minutes per applicant.” 

Journalist Jeffrey Selingo who wrote Who Gets in and Why observed the same thing. There simply isn’t enough time in the day or staff to sift through record numbers of applications year after year. Since all applicants receive uniform acceptance and rejection letters, you never know how close or far you were from admission.

Holistic review privileges students who know how to play the admissions game. Some prepare for the college admissions arms race as early as pre-K or elementary school. Students who attend high schools with advanced courses know that they’re necessary as early as freshmen year. Clever students from wealthy families pad their resumes, attend expensive summer camps, and work internships at daddy’s real estate office. 

Jeffrey Selingo shared an entertaining anecdote from Davidson University’s admissions review committee. A girl who was in the deny pile got pushed into the acceptance pile when the shaping committee applauded her volunteering as a “mahout,” which evidently is someone who cleans and trains elephants in Thailand. 

Students feel pressure to find ever more obscure and niche activities to stand out in a crowded field. 

Most people don’t reach their peak at age sixteen or seventeen. Students who are undecided on their major are also penalized. Universities miss out on late bloomers or students who take less traditional paths. Elite universities admit very few transfer students, especially from community college, so if you don’t play the game from your birth, you’re unlikely to gain admission. 

Holistic review creates a perverse set of incentives that exclude middle class and poor students and it distorts the values of wealthy families. College admissions corrupts high school environments and their students and by pressuring them to pursue activities that don’t interest them, burn out by taking too many AP classes, and it takes away free time. 

Admissions outcomes are more of a reflection of wealth and privilege than anything specific to the applicant. More students enroll in the Ivy League, Stanford, MIT, and other elite universities from the top 1% of society than the entire bottom half. 72% of students at elite colleges come from the top quarter economically and only 3% from the bottom quarter.

Oxford and Cambridge, traditional strongholds of British aristocracy, enroll more socioeconomically diverse student bodies than elite liberal American universities. These elite universities birthed identity politics and social justice yet they themselves lack diversity. They’re inaccessible for most students. 

Despite advances in technology and Zoom university during the pandemic, Ivy League universities enroll the same number of freshmen each year as a century ago. Elite universities are partially responsible for increasing inequality in the United States, not inclusion and access like they claim. They are hypocrites.

Universities refuse to listen to messages like this because they’re convinced they’re helping society. But they refuse to see the role they play in squeezing out the middle class and keeping families in poverty. 

I’m here to tell you that holistic review is bullshit. It’s madness. 

**Elite universities do not care about you.**

Understanding this fact will help you see your applications and the admissions process more clearly.

o4gpuc,1,2021-06-20,Good book/playlist/blog/video to teach beginners how to think like a programmer or software engineer?,negativevotes-,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/o4gpuc/good_bookplaylistblogvideo_to_teach_beginners_how/,"I am used to being exposed to programming languages and have worked as a developer intern, but the **programmatic thinking** is still a struggle for me, and I would like to learn how to think analytically. I am in my last year of Electronics engineering. In my first year, I failed programming intro 2 times before passing it *barely* the 3rd time - and it wasn't Python - it was C. Ya know, the language that everyone says don't learn on your first rodeo. The semester after that, among all those hard-ass Telecommunications, electronics, digital systems, and signals and controls courses, we had Data Structures and Algorithms and if it wasn't for an assignment, I would have failed that in the first run. After that, we got into Computer architecture, Data communications, Operating Systems and Embedded Software.....yeah....pain.

I started self-learning Python because it was easy and with that background, I got into 2 internships that did mostly Python work. But you see...the concept of how to approach the problem never settled down into my head. I always wanted someone to teach me how to think like a programmer before teaching me C or Python, so that when I know that I have to check whether a number is a prime or not in C, how I must write it down to understand how to programmatically approach the problem, because in my head, things are assumed, things are always defined. But then I look at pseudo code and some things (not all, but mostly) either make me go ""oh, of course! I must define it first!"" or completely ""ok, why did they do this ?"" 

I am looking for a book/article/blog/video/course/bootcamp/article series that would help me with the programmatic thinking, preferrably at a beginner's/dumbass/stupid level so I can understand it easily. I have heard about Computer Science Distilled, but the reviews are mixed.

Hello Everyone, 

I'm about to graduate in Summer 2021 from Florida Atlantic University and I'm majoring in Finance and minoring in CS. I have a 3.7 GPA and have gotten A- or above in all my engineering classes so far. I've had a change of heart career-wise and want to pursue software engineering and not finance anymore. The dilemma I have is whether I should continue my education at FAU or should I pursue my second BS in CS at University Florida. 

UF requires me to take Calc 1, Calc 2, and Physics 1 before applying. I'm currently taking Calc 1 right now and will be able to take Calc 2 and Physics 1 in the Fall. Therefore for UF, I will only be able to apply to the Summer 2022 semester which means I wouldn't be taking any classes in the Spring. But I was looking at this opportunity to work on projects, internships, and learn other languages as I wait to begin the Summer semester. Whereas if I were to continue my education at FAU I will be able to go right into finishing my second BS in the Fall and perhaps be done within a year. I'm just wondering if it's worth waiting almost a year to start the CS degree at UF? I believe UF has a much higher reputation for CS than FAU does and perhaps could open more doors for me when it comes to employment. I understand that where you went to school isn't everything and employers want to see quality projects and actual work experience but I feel like having a UF degree in CS would stand out more than an FAU CS degree. 

My career goal would be to work at startups or mid-size tech companies. Companies where there is a lot of room to grow and where I can wear several hats and truly help the company get to the next level with my skills. Companies such as Signal, DuckDuckGo, Brave, Soundcloud, Spotify, just to name some.

I've been lurking this sub for months during my entire job searching process and its been so incredibly helpful not only for searching for positions online, but through the whole interview and negotiation phases.

This is my first ""real"" job as I graduated in December, and facing this job market, especially during/in the era of COVID has been intimidating to say the least. I also was finishing an internship where I thought I would get an offer to convert to full time, but they ultimately didn't have a position for me, so it was stressful to say the least. 

But after some networking calls, 68 applications, 18 interviews (this is not a flex it's like 4-5 interviews for 4 companies because the process is some bullshit these days) I finally landed the job!! I'm so happy about it especially since I went through the whole process with 2 other companies and got to the final round, only to be ghosted, but it's pretty much to be expected these days.

The job is in the field that I want, related to my degree, in the city I want to move to with hybrid work schedule, good starting salary/benefits, and the team seemed very nice and they emphasized that they want to support and mentor junior team members.

If you're job searching right now, the right job/team will come, I’m rooting for you and everything will fall into place!!

Like  seriously, what the fuck is wrong with these types of clout chasers? Do  these mindless corporate loving imbeciles talking about anything other  than coding interviews or possible internships at a Big N??

It  is ridiculously cringe hearing some people worship big tech constantly  and dedicate their lives to working there while putting down those who  don't. These people make it their personality.

I get it they pay well and you're trying to work at a top tier tech company, but **shut the fuck up**.

For  those wondering that I am just jealous or envious of those who work at  Big N, I am not. I will be happy to hear someone that got into those  companies, but once or twice is enough. Dedicating your life and  personality to it is just over the top cringe.

These  people have no self-awareness and it is ridiculous how this recent  culture of brain dead big tech worship has taken over the CS scene in  most colleges. Every time I get this vibe from a person I want to puke.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR : Big tech worshipers in CS are ridiculous and have no personality aside from being a corporate lover. These people are either not self-aware or can't understand not everyone wants to work for big tech but they will shove it down your throat regardless."

 Currently a rising sophomore here. I'm a cloud enthusiast and looking forward to applying to Cloud/DevOps-related Internships for the summer in the States (I'm an international student studying here). Even though I acknowledge that doing personal projects &amp; learning courses are crucial, I am still confused about how to get myself prepared over the summer.

 I am learning &amp; working with Kubernetes, Docker, Ansible, and some other Cloud-related tools in my Internship (in my home country). In terms of SWE, I can do Python, Java, Javascript, SQL, and some common Frameworks like Express, Flask.  I have tried to write documentation, doing toy projects. I am planning to explore more topics on System Engineering (Networking, OS), AWS, Go-lang. Writing blogs on some simple topics is an idea that I am considering as well.

 I have my Resume but I am not really confident about it. I feel that it is not one that showing me as a stand-out candidate.

 What should I learn/work on this summer to prepare for applying period? Do you guys recommend some project/blog ideas that I can do?

 I have been researching what I can work on and get a bit overwhelmed about what I should do next. I am quite uncertain about how to demonstrate my personal skills &amp; make recruiters recognize that I am capable of doing the job in the States. What should I do more to show that I am competent enough for the roles? There are too many things to learn and I always afraid that my proficiency will never reach recruiters' requirements.

 Please pardon my silly questions. This is my very first post here. I just started doing programming in College and began to explore Cloud for a few months recently too. `csMajors` is an amazing community &amp; I have learned a lot from you guys.

Thank you in advance for all the cool suggestions. Have a productive working week guys :D"

I know how frustrating it has been, from either school, a loss of a loved one, and/or getting rejection letters daily for jobs you really want to start your future.

Personally, I was a wreck. Going into Spring 2020, I had an awesome internship and was graduating with honors, I thought my life would be set. Then everything went downhill so fast. I didn’t get to say goodbye to my college friends, was forced to be alone, and when my internship ended I had no job offers in place. After the first 2 months of applying, I became extremely depressed. Seeing rejection after rejection on a weekly basis questioning what we’re the last 4 years even worth? I fell into some deep alcoholism to try and cope. At that time, in my mind, it was the only way I could get through the day and I had hit my lowest point. I still applied through this and kept getting the same results. Rutgers wasn’t helping me in any sort except to ask for donations monthly. After about 6 months, I made sure I stopped getting drunk everyday because I knew I couldn’t quit on myself. And still months of negative emails came in, until one day.

That day, about 2 months ago, I got a call if I wanted to accept my dream job. Without hesitation I did, and ever since starting magically this burden went away. While I would’ve preferred not to go through everything I did, I felt all the time this took really made me evaluate myself and to become the person I want to be.

This isn’t about me. This is about me sharing my struggles that I know many other Rutgers alum are going through right now. And I just want to say no matter how much it sucks, you can and will do it! It might not be today, or tomorrow, or next week (I know it sucks) but YOU CAN DO IT! 

Take this time not only to look at the future, but to look at the now. Appreciate the things you do have and appreciate yourself, you are worth something to many people. And most of all, become that person that you want to be amongst all this, because that’s who you’ll have to look at in the mirror every day.

If anyone every needs to chat or get some support, you are welcomed to reach out! I wish you all the best of luck and whatever comes next for whoever takes the time to read this, kick some ass!"

Due to prereqs. this is all I can take, and I only plan on one semester.

But I always hear that school is rarely useful in industry, and I wonder if that is the case for me as well. My internship project will essentially focus on optimizing a small subsystem of the company's code (in Java), and while the knowledge I would learn through those classes may not help me here, I wonder if they would help in the near future for a full-time career, where I would probably be expected to do more than that. Is it worth it, do i really even need this, are the courses too basic to help me?

I was wondering how should I approach working on my skills and my resume for this purpose and if anyone had any suggestions on any projects that would serve to show my interest in the bridge between the two fields or to show my interest in either field it would be much appreciated.

2. Considering that I'm going to a ""t5 CS school"", should I get a CS minor/ additional major along with ECE? Based on what I've heard, it's redundant and not worth the effort... but am I missing out on anything by not doing a CS minor/additional major as an ECE major at CMU?
3. CMU also has a lot of other minors like Machine Learning, Language Technologies, Security, HCI etc. How much impact do these minors have on employability? Does it help with grad school admissions?
4. Are there any companies that heavily recruit from CMU \[excluding FAANG\]? 
5. I'm interested in quant internships/jobs. How can I maximize my chances of getting a quant internship? Do I take ML courses? Should I do a minor in Computational Finance? I'm clueless, please give me all your advice!

I don’t have any experience in that area and I see the LinkedIn profiles of their investment analyst members stacked with analyst roles from banks, etc.

I’m just an incoming freshman at this point but should I give it a shot signing up for that role? I don’t mind doing marketing in that club, but I don’t want to be boxed in by marketing anymore.

I know I might not stand a chance but a part of me hopes that I’ll be able to learn more about finance and VC through this club from seniors.

But it's going in the wrong direction and not only that, it's forced. I know and speak more English than my own native tongue, and used to daydream about moving to the States. But mom, being in control of everything in my life, decided to push me into a university in Italy. I've tried to resist, but I guess it wasn't enough. It gets worse. From a young age, I've always been interested in IT stuff. Anything computer-related, I wouldn't hesitate to give it a try. I also have experience with content making, such as making advertisements (posters, video, photoshop, etc) and managing the social media page. I've done exactly that with 2 different events, one of which was the biggest MUN event in the country so far. But again, mom completely disregards these, and instead pushed me into ""Business"" stuff like finance, economics, law, statistics, and so on. I have no interest in these whatsoever. Infact, I've been actively making an effort to stay away from such things ever since middle school when business class was first introduced, and math in general. And oh man, there's a lot of math. EVERYTHING is math, math, math in this major. Friends have told me to ""simply change majors"" but I don't see that as a possibility, seeing how the university does not offer the things I'm interested in. I've been failing exams and trying my damn best to hide it from mom. But secrets like this won't last forever. It's been the main reason for my recent depression surges, suicidal thoughts, and brief breakdowns. So far, only half of my first semester has passed, and I'm at my breaking point already. Come September, I am gonna fly over to Italy and study on-site. And I'm planning on ending everything there if I do end up going. I've looked into cheap apartments, but the cheapest apartments are still too expensive and impossible to pay and live in with a minimum wage job here. I've tried to sign up for an internship but it got shut down because the duration is 6 months, but I'm expected to get shipped off to Italy in 3 months. But I am going through this coding academy for 3 months. Will learn HTML, C++ among other things. But it's too little too late. I can't find a job that can sustain me, all I've got is a highschool diploma, a graphic design certificate along with other insignificant experiences and achievements. Therefore I can't move out and make a living for myself, therefore mom still has control over me, therefore I will end up in Italy...

How can I escape this? If I could just move out and live on my own, I wouldn't have to go to Italy and suffer through this university. But I can't find a job that would allow me to do so. I just don't see any way out of this."

I did an internship on this company and now that it is over, they are offering me a position there. 

The internship was not exactly about software engineering but a more-or-less similar field. The thing is, they want me to say what salary do I expect but after searching Gehalt.de and comparing salaries to my country, it feels like I would ask for either too much or too less. 

According to Gehalt.de, the minimum salary for a Junior Softwareentwickler is something around 38K-40K. Is it appropiate for a new grad to ask for something inbetween these two values, or should I tell them the minimum (38K) and see what their reaction is?

Edit: Basically, it's a small company, barely a hundred employees, specialized on embedded systems. The city is Kaiserslautern, in Rheinland-Palatinate.

Thanks in advance"

My mother was a meth addict, and her boyfriend was a creepy perv who spent all his time harassing me. I filed a restraining order on both of them and so I threw myself in as much work and school as I could. I was in my last year when I was introduced to him by one of the other patrons who was trying to set us up, and we just clicked. He was cute, funny, and handsome. He had these hazel eyes that turned into pure gold in the right lighting, and his smile could charm even the most violent beast into being his friend. 

I was so overworked and stressed out that to me, life felt like a dark thunderstorm just waiting to drown me. But Alexander pulled me out of that darkness of my life. 

Pretty soon, he became my sun, my moon and all my stars. He waited for me to graduate and in the meantime, he interned at some fancy accounting company while I worked on setting up a marketing business. Once I graduated and he finished up his internship, we moved in together in an apartment and eventually he proposed. After a couple of years of moving around and advancing in our careers, we ended up in a small-town upstate New York. 

I was a little hesitant about moving to a small town, but after some convincing, I realized that our long terms financials were better off if we relocated to an area with a lower cost of living compared to staying in the city. The pandemic had exacerbated our time frame of moving out of the city and buying a house. Besides, when we had kids, they would have lots of room to play and explore. We found this beautiful house built near a large lake, ordinarily I wouldn’t have chosen it because I hate the water, but Alexander was so insistent on it. He said it was our forever home, our little slice of heaven. It was perfectly isolated away from any intrusive neighbors or drunk tourists, so I agreed. 

We moved in on April 19, 2020. 

The first half of the year went by great, we both worked virtually, and I was ecstatic at how our relationship was going with the both of us being home 24/7. We would go fishing, boating, swimming, camping, and even painting every other day. 

It felt completely and utterly perfect. 

It wasn’t until his 30th birthday when I noticed that things had turned a little strange. I baked him a cake and made a romantic dinner, but I noticed that he seemed a little distant. I tried asking him if something was wrong, but I could see that he would downplay his emotions and brushed it off. I played along expecting him to tell me when he was ready, but he never opened up. This went on for a week before he was acting normally again so I didn’t bring it up again. I chalked it up to him turning 30 years old because he always lamented getting old. 

Then sometime last month, I started getting really nauseous in the morning and everything started to smell awful to me. Even the scent of foods I once enjoyed had diverted my appetite. I took a pregnancy test and found out I was pregnant. I spent all morning prepping myself with the news that I would tell Alexander. Funnily enough, Alexander had also wondered if I was pregnant and that very same afternoon, he came back home with a pregnancy test. Once I told him, he was more ecstatic than I had ever seen, and he was already browsing nursery items on the internet. 

Because Alexander often ran errands on the town or went on frequent business trips, I decided to install security systems all throughout the house. I didn’t feel safe being all alone in an isolated house anymore, especially with growing a whole mini me in my stomach. When he came back, I told him about it, and he agreed with my reasoning, but I felt like he was slightly hesitant. I didn’t pay much attention to it, and I apologized and told him I should have consulted with him beforehand. 

Then one night, I woke up around 3am with the sudden urge to urinate and I quickly got up and ran to the bathroom. It wasn’t until I came back when I realized that the bed was completely empty. I laid back down and closed my eyes, thinking maybe when I went to the bathroom he also went to the bathroom in the basement or something. So, I laid in bed expecting him to arrive but after half an hour, I started to feel this strange sensation that he wasn’t coming. I shook it off and tossed and turned until I fell asleep. I did have a zoom conference in the early morning that had to maintain my full concentration for some business deal.  

Morning came and went, and my presentation went perfect. We were discussing celebratory plans for the weekend when I remembered about the former night. 

“Hey sweetie, when I went to the bathroom last night, I noticed you weren’t in bed.” 

“Uh, was this around three in the morning?” He asked not even looking at me from his phone. 

“Yeah, it was.” I replied. 

“Oh yeah, I heard a weird noise in the garage and went to check it out. I think I left the garbage bin open, and some raccoons got in.” 

I would have taken his word for it but there some was something odd about the way he said it. Nonetheless, we moved on and enjoyed the rest of our night. 

A couple of nights later, I had to run to the bathroom again, it was like my bladder had shrunk but I guess that’s one of the perks of being a pregnant woman. This time, I noticed that once again, he was gone from our bedroom. 

I was already up so I went throughout our house looking for him. I even checked the garage, but I couldn’t find him. I decided to go back to bed and wait for him, but I fell asleep waiting. In the morning I decided to ask about it. 

“Hey, sweetie, where were you last night? I woke up to pee and you weren’t there. I even fell asleep waiting.” I whined jokingly while grabbing his arm and playing with it. 

“I, uh, went for a walk.” He replied while pulling his hand back. 

“You went for a walk in the middle of the night?” My playfulness now turned to curiosity. 

“Yeah, I just couldn’t sleep. Lately work has been stressing me out, and I’m worried for you.”

“For me?” 

“Well, for our kid. I don’t know what the future holds. What if something happens to us? He or she will be all alone.” He said while looking down at the floor. My heart burst and I wanted to hug the life out of him and ease every stressful thing he was worried about. 

“I promise nothing will happen to us. We’ll be fine. And if anything does, he or she will be fine because we will have raised them right. Look, the future is unpredictable, and nothing will ever be certain but all we can manage is the way we react to things. For now, just focus on us and how we can make things transition better.” I said hoping to at least alleviate some of his worry. I mean, what do you say to those concerns. Even I had those same exact worries. 

“Thank you. You always know what to say. Promise I won’t do it again.” He smiled and pulled me closer for a quick peck. 

Things went perfectly after our little conversation and in fact, every night before bed we would sit and fantasize about the things we would do with our future kids over a cup of tea. I used to be an avid coffee drinker in the nighttime, since caffeine had no effect on me, I would drink it and fall asleep. However, since my pregnancy Alexander started to make me a nice cup of tea. I guess my body had adjusted to the growth of my womb because I no longer had to pee in the night, in fact I was so knocked out that I’m pretty sure I could sleep through a whole tornado. 

I thought that was the end of it until I had a doctor’s appointment. The doctor was an impatient stubborn cold old man, and as much I preferred a sympathetic female doctor, he was the closest one within miles. The checkup itself went fine, my little one was growing pretty fast. In fact, the doctor insisted that I was 3 months pregnant, but I didn’t believe him. After all, I only found out last month due to symptoms and I was positive that he was wrong. I took the standard urine test and went home. The day after however, I got a call from the doctor’s office. 

“Hi Mrs. Rodriquez, I just wanted to confirm some information. You said you weren’t on any current medications, is that correct?” He asked flatly. 

“Yeah, that’s correct. I don’t take anything other than some prenatal vitamins.” I replied. 

“Ok, because we found traces of diphenhydramine or DPH, in your urine.” He replied annoyed at my supposed deception. 

“I don’t even know what that is.” I replied completely confused. 

“It’s one of the main ingredients in Benadryl. I find that most woman have trouble sleeping at night and resort to sleeping pills. However, Benadryl is not a sleeping pill. Studies show that they can cause birth defects! If you’re having trouble sleeping, I think you should come into my office, and we can go through the cause and find out what treatment works best for you. Will you like to make another appointment?” He pushed, his tone sounding more and more annoyed with every word. 

“I don’t like your accusatory tone. No thank you.” I replied firmly and hung up. The nerve of that old man. Oh, I didn’t care how far away other doctors were, there was no way I was going back to him. 

That night I vented to Alexander who was making me another cup of tea when it hit me. Ever since he started making me tea, I found myself incredibly drowsy and would sleep through the entire night. I smiled over at him and found myself wondering if he was capable of actually drugging me. I chuckled a bit but out of curiosity I declined his tea. 

“I think I might stop drinking tea at night. Makes me too drowsy. You can drink it though.” I said while slightly moving the cup towards him. 

“Are you sure? He asked, while reluctantly grabbing the cup.

“Yeah. Take it.” I said going back to my phone. He took the cup and raised it up to his lips. 

I felt slightly relieved when I saw him take a big sip. I almost felt like an idiot for even thinking that. This is Alexander. My big softie. 

“Hey, I’m gonna go get a glass of water.” I said, standing up and heading into the kitchen. 

“Yeah. Ok.” He said looking down at his magazine. 

I opened the kitchen door and started opening the top cabinet and getting a glass cup when I noticed one of the tea bags on the counter had slightly tore, releasing its contents. I grabbed a paper towel and wiped it, carefully collecting the residue before opening the garbage can. As I held it open, I noticed a glimpse of something silver reflecting off the kitchen light. I reached down to grab it, while putting the paper towel into can. It was a plastic wrapper, the kind that encloses a single individual capsule for Benadryl. You know, the kind where you snap a piece off the small tablet and peel off the silver thing. 

None of this made any sense. 

Why would he be drugging me? I couldn’t confront him about it just yet though. I wanted to check something. I looked up to see a camera pointed towards the kitchen door into the backyard while facing the counter. I had to check something. 

“Are you ok in there?” He asked from the other room. 

“Yeah. I just needed to clean up.” 

I went back into the living room and sat down for a bit, turning on the TV and watching it for a bit. It was uncanny watching him act like everything was alright. The more I thought about it, what did I really know about this man? He knew about my family and my entire past. He’s even seen my crazy family and their horrible antics. 

But he said he was an orphan that had no family, and we were both introverts that barely had friends. We only had coworkers that we talked to over Zoom. I knew all the lovey dovey stuff I saw on a daily basis but who was he really? 

Curiosity was now tugging at all my heart strings, and I wanted to cry. Why would he sneak Benadryl into my tea at night? Could he be sneaking out again? 

I decided to go into our office under the excuse of me wanting to finish up some work. Instead, I decided to pull up all the security camera footage. The usual day stuff was fine, so I fast forwarded it to right before he made my tea.

The footage showed Alexander walking into the kitchen and heading towards the top counter, getting a box of tea packets. He set the stove and put some water and sat down on the table and went on it phone. Once the water started boiling, he carefully poured some onto a cup and put the tea bag inside. He opened another cabinet and pulled out a small pink and blue box. 

Fuck. 

He opened a plastic capsule and pulled one of them out and crushed it with a spoon before pouring it into the tea. 

That wouldn’t make sense. Wouldn’t he be affected by it? Why would he be fine giving it to me?

I decided to go to another day, fast forwarding it through the night. 

But we both slept soundly throughout the entire night. I sat there just watching the both of us lying in bed. Our breathing was unison, and I stuck my leg out of my side of the bed at least 5 times in one hour. 

I sat there reflecting on my actions, maybe there was an explanation that I was missing. Maybe he was doing it because he wanted me to sleep. I almost began to laugh at the absurdity of my situation when I realized that I kept sticking my leg out at that exact angle. It seemed off. 

Every ten minutes in that recording, I would shift and stick my leg out at an exact angle and turn back to the right side of the bed to face him. 

It was a fucking loop. I quickly backed out of that recording and moved onto a different date. Same exact thing with the tea, he would crush up a capsule of Benadryl and pour it into my tea. But the time frame between the hours of 3 and 5, the recording would be looped to make it look like we slept all night long. 

I sat there thinking about what to do when it hit me. The company had the original versions uploaded in the cloud somewhere. These physical recordings were edited but the copies automatically saved offline. I quickly logged onto the company website and entered my username and password. 

I checked the exact dates of the edited versions and found the recordings. Every night, between the hours of three to five am, he would get up and head out. Then he would come back in and lay in bed, just staring at the ceiling until my alarm went off. It was unnerving seeing the man I loved, just lying there unblinking and emotionless. 

I had to see where he was going. 

But I couldn’t do it tonight. 

He already knew I didn’t drink the tea.

I had to wait another day just to avoid arousing his suspicion. 

I had trouble falling asleep that night, he tried to be all cute and cuddle me and I played along but I felt the goosebumps on my arm. My skin felt like a thousand bugs crawled over it when he touched me. It was killing me to pretend this way. How could he play it so cool? Eventually, my eyes felt heavy, and I dozed off.

I awoke to a loud bump and a hoarse whisper. 

“Zoey. Zoey! Are you awake?” Alexander shook my shoulder as he asked. He was checking to see if I was still asleep. I just kept my eyes shut and kept my breath nice and steady. 

I felt the weight of his body shift from the bed and onto the creaky wooden floorboards. I heard the slight footsteps head off into the hallway. I laid in bed for a couple of minutes, contemplating as to if I could truly wait until tomorrow. I cradled my stomach in an attempt to comfort myself. 

I just had to know. 

I quietly got up and grabbed a sweater and headed out as well. I went through the backdoor instead of the front, I didn’t want him to hear the front door system. I typed the password in quickly and moved as fast as I could. I couldn’t let him get away. 

By the time I reached the front of the house, I noticed that he was heading down the road into the direction of the lake. I walked over and stuck to the edges of the road, hiding between the various bushes and trees in an attempt to conceal myself and stay away from his view just in case he turned around. 

By the time we reached the shores of the lake, I was slightly winded, and my knees were sore at having to kneel behind a bush. The glow of the moonlight had casted a silver glow over the lake, and I could hear the soft cries of every animal and insect in the forest. The only one that seemed to be consistent was the cacophony of crickets and mosquitos flying near my neck. 

I could see my husband stand near the water, taking a moment to stare at the water before pulling off his shirt. He started pulling off all of his clothing, standing completely nude, his pale white skin emphasized by the moonlight. If he weren’t my husband, I would have thought he was a ghost. Then he started picking at his skin, pulling off sheets of some kind of white film. 

What the hell was it? 

He reached deeper into his skin and started pulling off even more, revealing a bright red color underneath it. 

He wasn’t picking things off his skin. He was ripping his skin off. 

I felt a disgusting feeling all over my body, like when you stare at those creepy holes that maggots make. That repulsive feeling didn’t even come close to what I was witnessing. Underneath his skin, he looked like those pictures of when you see anatomy textbooks all red and the muscle fibers stringing off of him. But once he stepped into the water, his red flesh started turning a deep green and his fingers started turning sharper and sharper as if the bone protruding into these claw-like things. 

What the fuck was this? 

I have to be dreaming. That thing came out of my husband. 

I had to go. 

I had to run. 

After a couple of minutes, I started to walk back and made a full sprint towards our house. I ran in, setting off the security alarm but I didn’t care. I didn’t have time to care. The sound of the alarm was too loud for me think rationally. I grabbed my wallet and my car keys and quickly went into my car. 

I turned on my headlights revealing Alexander’s naked body right in front of me. But it was all wrong, ripples of fleshy skin hung off some areas exposing red muscles while others had green reptilian skin. 

“Honey? Is everything ok?” That thing’s voice no longer even sounding human, rather like a raspy mix of a husky barking and a reptilian lisp. 

I backed up until I almost hit the garage door in our driveway. Then I moved the steering wheel to the right as I moved the gear to drive and pushed on the gas and as I passed that thing, it jumped on the side of my car. 

“Zoey, let’s talk about this.” It hissed. 

I slammed on the gas and as it banged on the window, cracking it slightly. As I made out into the road, I saw headlights up ahead. A truck was heading down my street and it was beeping at me once it was that I was in its lane. I quickly swerved trying to get the truck to slam onto the beast that was grabbing onto my car, but instead my car flipped, and I felt instant pain everywhere as the car slammed against the road. The windows erupted into hundreds of little shards raining all over me. 

The last thing I saw before I fell into a deep sleep, was an old trucker running to my side asking if I was ok. I looked over at the right passenger window, only to see the silhouette of a dark figure taking off into the forest. 

I woke up in the hospital surrounded by cops and doctors barraging me with a shit ton of questions, but I didn’t have any answers to give them. 

“Ma’am where is your husband? Are you alone?”

“What happened on the night of the incident?” 

I tried to speak but every time I opened my mouth, I felt the absurdity of my situation take over. If I told them anything, they would definitely lock me up in a mental ward. The doctors tried to comfort me by telling me that my baby seemed perfectly healthy.

I would cradle my stomach, feeling for any signs of kicking. What once brought me joy, now brought me curiosity and disgust. If Alexander was that thing, then what the hell was developing in my womb? 

In a couple of hours, I will be released from the hospital, and I tried to do some research on my cracked-up phone but all I could get was something called a Selkie. Shape shifting seductive creatures that stemmed from Celtic mythology but were also found in Inuit mythology. 

The only difference is that Alexander was not a fucking seal. He seemed something straight out of hell. 

And that’s not even the freaky shit. From what I overheard from the nurses gossiping, local cops found hundreds of humans remains from this area spanning down to the lake. They think it could be the work of several serial killers due to the timelines. But I think I have a different theory. 

Not sure who to tell though. 

Anyone have any idea of what it is? I have nowhere else to go except home and I know for a fact, that he will be there. ‘

I don’t know what to do."

So any advice is greatly appreciated!

My bro is currently in OCS and he's keen to take up the SAF Academic Award and sign on. He didn't have much interest in academics during his poly years and I'm glad he found interest in a military career.

His poly GPA is not great, just slightly above 3. When he applied for uni courses last year, he was called in for interviews but didn't manage to get any offers. He tried again this year and he received an offer for a part-time degree from SUSS (Marketing). Unfortunately, SAA does not support part-time degrees.

He's thinking to first start his career after OCS graduation and try again next year but I'm pessimistic since he has been rejected for 2 years already. So we're exploring other options as well. Any advice?

He's also wondering:

* Does anyone have experience converting from a part time to full time undergrad at SUSS?
* What is the possibility of taking up the part time course first and then apply to transfer in a later sem (if other unis happens to accept him in his future attempts)
* What about applying to SIM (not covered by SAA), would it affect your pay grade in the military?

Thanks in advance! Happy to give back if you have any questions around exposure / internships / job hunting overseas as a local student."
o4x9vy,755,2021-06-21,Advice From a Recent College Grad,Muvinco,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/o4x9vy/advice_from_a_recent_college_grad/,"I graduated from a 4 year college in May - I didn't have the best experience but I think I made the most of it. I learned a lot about myself and a lot of underclassmen have told my tips helped them so here are my tips/advice (for background, I was an Econ major): 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Take Your Time** \- You don't have to do every single major requirement in your first 2 years. I paced out my major pretty slowly and it worked wonders for me. My senior year I had to take 5 classes to finish my major (3 in the fall, 2 in the spring) but they were all easy electives. Spacing out requirements gave me the bandwidth to take easier classes so I could focus on my core courses. I knew lots of people that did too much too early and burned out by sophomore. They ended up switching majors or just unhappy.  

&amp;#x200B;

* **Free Time is King** \- Every school/major is different but try to make a schedule that has more classes that only meet 1-2 times a week. Sometimes I would take classes that I knew would suck but they only met once a week so it was worth it for me. Having more free time in your schedule gives you **time to study, go to the gym, meet with friends, get a job, office hours, etc.** I didn't have classes on Fridays on my last 5 semesters of college and it was one of the best things for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Everyone's Path is Different** \- Try not to compare yourself to others. It's hard not to, but try your hardest. Some of your peers/friends may get great internships or research opportunities while you're still trying to figure out what you want to do. That's okay. **Just focus on doing what's best for you.** When I was a sophomore I applied to countless internships and didn't get any but my peers were all going to big companies like Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan. I used to feel like a failure for so long but I ended up stressing myself for no reason because 2 years later I ended up in the same companies as them. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **""There's More to Life than School""** \- This is what I would tell myself when I would get burned out. I like to think I'm a high achiever but everyone has their limits. If you ever get to the point where your mental health is suffering, just remind yourself there's more to life than school. **Take a break, go out.** It's okay to get a B or a C from time to time. **As long as you know you tried your hardest, that's all that matters.**"
o4y4ez,18,2021-06-21,Am I being taken advantage of as a junior engineer?,Available_Delay4516,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/o4y4ez/am_i_being_taken_advantage_of_as_a_junior_engineer/,"I was ""lucky"" enough to land an internship this summer at a fairly large company.  


I made it very clear in the interviews that I was currently heavily focused on web projects outside of school (heavily invested in React, Postgres, getting AWS certs, etc) and that I had C++ and Java experience in my school coursework (albeit I've done some of what I consider ""advanced"" projects in those two languages but that's besides the point).  


Fast forward a few weeks and I get hired and am now being expected to work at an incredibly insane pace (3 projects at once) in languages/frameworks/libraries I have never touched before, are not related to what I was asked about in my interviews, and am struggling greatly to pick up.  I am also being expected to know how to do some electrical engineering work as well as some heavy math-related work that has to do with one of the projects I've been assigned to. I've reached out and told the people on my team I have no clue what I'm being expected to do here and haven't gotten a response. This is besides the point, but I'm also expected to show up in a ""suit and tie"" style dresscode to work every day even though we work remote (we aren't fintech, so this is REALLY weird to me and I had to go spend money to get new clothing and was laughing at myself the entire time I was doing so).   


I am being paid, but it's barely above minimum wage.  


I ask questions every day, sometimes multiple time a day, but my ""mentor"" (I was never really assigned a mentor, one of my projects involves working closely with another engineer and I've been asking him questions as that's the only person I've really met at the company besides my senior \[we're remote\]) seems annoyed with me doing so (constant sighs and just genuine lack of care when I ask questions relating to the projects I'm working on).    


I do not want to feel burnt out at my first CS related job, but I'm finding it incredibly hard to keep up and am barely able to make any headway each day on the job unless another engineer is sitting there with me on zoom helping me along (I've made SOME progress on the projects I've been assigned to but it's not anything close to production level code as I have no clue what I'm even doing or how our massive codebase works \[and I've asked and gotten very surface-level answers\] ).    


So, am I being taken advantage of by this company?  All the people I talk to in my CS program at Uni have told me their internships are mostly laid back, that they're not expected to know a whole lot, and are being paid a competitive wage while learning more about the technologies they're interested in. Did I screw up by taking this job? Is what I'm experiencing any somewhat normal?"

I kinda started panicking when I saw that and I'm wondering how enforceable it is. 

How similar would a new job need to be to prevent me from working there? Could they claim that any job that involves software development counts as competition? 

I'm even more worried since the position was advertised as an internship that would last a minimum of 6 months, but could last longer. Was it a bad idea to sign a non-compete that lasts 2 years after employment just to work a position that might only last 6 months?"

The company separated me from the other IT interns so that I could work on a ""special"" project. I feel confident in my coding skills, however this internship (so far) has been SQL-related things. I have a basic understanding of SQL scripting, but apparently not enough to get the given tasks done.  Any advice? I really hope I'm able to be more useful soon."
o50l51,1,2021-06-21,Postdoc in Need of Advice,RiverSnorkeler,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/o50l51/postdoc_in_need_of_advice/,"Hello, 

I have a PhD in Fisheries (I am based in the US);  my research focuses on the physiology and behavior of freshwater fish. For my dissertation, I studied the acoustic modulation of hormones in a sound-producing minnow. I also measured the effects of anthropogenic noise on stress physiology. 

Prior to finishing my degree, I accepted a pathways internship with the National Park Service. My experience with the NPS was valuable; but I found that I was missing the research aspect of my job. I then accepted a term research position with a federal lab (I'd rather not name any specifics here), which turned into a nightmare. I was the only female researcher on the team, and I was consistently treated as a technician. They never provided support for the projects they wanted me to accomplish - yet somehow it was always my fault when I could not produce the data. When my PhD advisor asked how things were going, I gave a pretty unfiltered response. She immediately offered me a postdoc back in her lab (which saved my sanity). 

She said she had money to support me for about 2 years; so I could get a ton of work done and we typically worked well together. The challenge is she brought me on via temporary employment services (TES), which is the mechanism she's most familiar with, so it was faster. TES employees are limited to 1450hrs per year, and I have about 2 weeks of paid time left. After that, I am terminated. Rather than provide any helpful solutions, the admins in fisheries sent a series of angry emails saying I was not allowed to clock-in for more than 4 hrs per week. I can't accomplish my research in that time, nor can I make rent on 8 hrs per pay period. My advisor and I have suggested multiple solutions to the  Dept. head, which were discarded. The last time my advisor spoke with him he suggested firing me and getting an undergrad to perform my research (not realistic). 

At this point, my advisor has kinda given up, and I am essentially working for free. I contacted the Ombudsman, and he spoke to the Dean of the graduate school on my behalf. I spoke to the Dean directly, and he's going to try to help by converting me to a proper research associate. I'm not sure how this will go down with my advisor since she wasn't happy I contacted the Ombud in the first place. But I can promise that she definitely would not even be coming into the office if she wasn't being paid. 

If anyone can offer insight or advice based on previous experience, I would be incredibly grateful. My husband and I both took pay cuts so I could come back as a postdoc. We knew it was temporary, and staying in my former position was killing my career. At least as a postdoc I could get a few publications out. But at the moment, I feel incredibly let-down. 

The experience has me questioning the future of my career. Part of me wants to stay in academia so I can create the environment I wish I had as a student (if I progress to ever having my own grad students). But the other side of me just wants to say screw it, I have bills to pay, just go into industry."
o50ti2,11,2021-06-21,[IWantOut] 25M Mechanical Engineer Grad Canada -&gt; USA,IntergaIacticspace,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/o50ti2/iwantout_25m_mechanical_engineer_grad_canada_usa/,"Hi, so I am a Canadian citizen, who graduated a few months ago with my Degree in Mechanical Engineering with no experience or internships under my belt. I graduated from a US institution, and my I spent a good portion of my life (mostly due to academics) in the states. Unfortunately, since I was an international student, I had to return home to Canada post-grad as I couldn’t find a job. Having been looking for months now for an engineering job but no luck either here or in the states. I can’t help but feel my lack of experience, and my visa sponsorship requirement already make me a less desirable candidate to employers in the states. I really want to live in the US (as a permanent resident) and start my life there as soon as possible, but I am losing hope in finding an engineering job with the visa requirement for either a TN or (my preference) H-1B that I come with. 

I do however, have a plan though and I really would appreciate if anybody can critique or help me understand what I may be overlooking with it. I have years of Customer Service experience working part time, and I have gotten interviews for customer service jobs in the past. I was reading a lot about immigration and I saw the L-1 Visa offers the same benefits that the H-1B does but it doesn’t require a minimum education requirement, which made me think I could get a job in customer service at a company branch in Canada, which has a US branch, for a year or 2, then ask my employer to transfer me to the US location and ask the US location to sponsor me for a green card upon arrival. On paper, it seems like the best way to go in absence of any biters for my engineering career. A few friends of mine have expressed concern that having a gap in my resume while I do this would make getting an engineering job even harder, but I’m not sure if that’s entirely true. Am I wrong in my thinking that this could work? The only thing I could think that could pose an issue with this plan is if I go on an L-1B, I would need to possess “specialized knowledge” but I figure that’s something my employer would be able to demonstrate on my behalf working with immigration lawyers. 

Am I missing something obvious here for why this plan may not work out or is not worth pursuing?"
o514bj,152,2021-06-21,"""R&amp;D? More like R&amp;Deez Nuts""",InBabylonTheyWept,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/o514bj/rd_more_like_rdeez_nuts/,"In a future where intelligent life had managed to break the chains of death, disease, and famine, it had yet to escape the iron grasp of bullshit corporate team building exercises.   

Luckily for the R&amp;D division of TLOB Enterprises, they had a human. His name was Earl, and he surpassed even immunity to bullshit, literally gaining strength from it like some sort of coprophilic vampire. It was almost as disgusting as it was fascinating, but the novelty of it was still charming enough to keep things in the green.   

The specific brand of bullshit the group was dealing with on that particular day was a “team-building laser-tag battle” pitting the three main divisions of the orbital branch against each other: Accounting, Sales, and Innovations.   

To be frank, it didn’t seem like a very fair fight. Accounting was the largest branch by far at twenty-seven heads. Sales lagged behind this a great deal with seventeen members, still absolutely dwarfing R&amp;D’s mere four.  

The rules of the game were explained by a cheery corporate speaker, aided by pictures presented in something that was dishearteningly close to a power-point program.    
 
First, each player would be given an infrared phaser, and a tag suit. The suit itself was surprisingly high tech for a toy, freezing limbs if they got hit, and paralyzing the person entirely if they were struck somewhere vital. After receiving their gear the three groups would retreat back to their offices and strategize for the next fifteen minutes. When the time was up, the station would begin to decrease its spin, lowering gravity from a comfortable one-point-two G's down to zero. The match would then proceed in the low gravity environment until two teams were eliminated, with its end being signalled by the return of gravity.  

“Any questions?” the speaker finished, chromatophores flashing a nervous pink as the room remained silent.   

“Haha, I’m gonna take that as a sign that I did a good job of explaining things! Alright everyone, back to your offices! And remember: We’re all part of a greater whole!”  

Brisinj smirked, jagged teeth on full display. There was a moment of slow motion horror as Shiloh, Earl, and Valrose all realized that he was about to “whisper” something under his breath. 
  
Brisinj’s equivalent of whispering was still more than enough to be heard across the room.   

“Hard to. Be greater hole than. Sales. Even if. Hole is. Asshole.”  

As seventeen heads swiveled towards him in disbelief he did the only thing he could that would make the situation worse.   

He made eye contact with them and kept going  

“BET THEY FART. LIKE. AN AIRLOCK. OPENING.”   

Spittle foamed between the gaps of his jagged teeth as he forced air between them, the hiss he made literally filling the room.   

And it just kept going.   

And going.  

And *going*.  

Disgust morphed into disbelief as Brisinj continued to make the noise, eyes bulging, face flushed, before his lungs mercifully gave out and the hiss died with an artfully strangled gurgle.   

Earl couldn’t help it. He guffawed. Shiloh’s disappointed and betrayed expression broke his heart, but he couldn’t help it. That final gurgle had been a *masterpiece.*  

Valrose was the one that wound up taking the initiative, his hydraulic musculature giving him the strength to gently manhandle the cackling duo out of the room. Shiloh tried his best to give an apologetic wave as he followed the pseudo-crustacean out of the room, but the raucous laughter of three people behind him scorched that bridge like a leaf on the sun.   

With a defeated sigh he ran to catch up to his coworkers.   

***  

“So… What do you think the odds are that sales decides to storm our little lab first?” Shiloh asked.   

“Oh, 100%,” Earl replied offhandedly, his attention focused on rummaging through an old toolbox.   

“Those are *chances,*” Valrose corrected, “*Odds* would be zero to one. But yeah, they’re definitely hitting here first.”  

“I. WOULD  BE. OFFENDED. IF THEY. DIDN’T.” Brisinj intoned at his standard just-below-deafening volume, “THAT HISS. WAS. PERFECT.”  

Shiloh ran his claws over his scalp.  

“Shit. They’re gonna slaughter us.”  

Earl seemed to have found the tool he was looking for and was now rummaging through the LED drawer, gathering a collection of bulbs that he seemed promising to him. His tone was amused, even if he didn’t look up long enough for his facial expression to be read.  

“Calm down. Slaughter is for real wars. Worst thing that happens here is they paralyze us and draw dicks on our faces.”  

“That’s still not pleasant!” Shiloh protested.  

No one argued that point.   

The silence stretched on for a minute or so longer. Earl gathered his collection of bulbs before moving to the power testing lab, leaving the other three in the quiet. Valrose gave in first and pushed himself up, claws failing wildly as he got his four legs beneath him.   

“So what are we gonna do? What’s our grand plan to avoid having to pretend to be dead for the next hour while the sales bastards make us into doodle boards?”  

Shiloh shrugged.   

“Make them work for it I guess? We could start by moving our shelving units, trying to funnel them through a choke point. Could give ourselves some cover while we were at it.”  

Earl chimed in from the power lab.   

“I got an idea, but I’m gonna be a little dramatic about it and make you wait to see it. Just uh… Cluster em’. The more of em’ you can pack together, the better. Even if it means making some cover on their side of the room.”
  
***  

There was a slight sideways pulls as the station’s retro-thrusters activated, the rotation of the great craft gently pulling to a complete stop.   

The game was starting, and Earl still hadn’t made his way back from the power lab. Brisinj was not pleased with this.   

“HEY. EARL. DONE YET?”

Earl’s voice came back a few seconds later, strained but chipper.   

“Almost!”  

They could hear banging on the walls, the telltale sound of people launching themselves down halls in the zero gravity environment.   

The noises were getting closer.  

“So, uh, how ‘almost’ is that almost?” Valrose asked, his casual tone betrayed by the nervous twiddling of his manipulator claws, “Cuz I’m hearing a lot of boots hitting the walls and four wouldn’t be enough to hold them off, least of all three.”  

Even without a person around to witness it, Earl still shrugged before answering.    

“Yeah, well, that’s the thing: Four ain’t enough. Only way we’re winning this if I can get this party trick in working order, so just...  Hold the line. Alright?”  

Valrose clutched his pistol tighter, still feeling exposed in the pillbox he’d made from old shelving units and cardboard. Brisinj wasn’t pleased with Earl’s absence, but even that nuisance wasn’t enough to ruin the joy he felt at even this imitation of a fight. Shiloh just kept his sights on the lone entrance to the lab, hoping he could get the timing of his first shot right.   

He did.   

There was the black flash of a sales rep rocketing down the hall. He landed on all fours, limbs splayed like a tree frog, when Shiloh’s beam hit him in the back. He’d been too busy absorbing the shock of impact to begin his secondary launch, and as all four limbs froze at once from the registered vital shot there was nothing he could do but await his doom.   

Apparently, doom chose to wear a grey suit that day. Another sale’s colleague had been following close behind him, and simply lacked the time to change direction. With no way to change course he slammed into his paralyzed comrade with a muffled swear, the two sent spinning into the open space of the research lab.   

Brisinj picked the flailing survivor off with a casual snipe. His species was adapted for hunting and he didn’t even need to use the sights of the gun, firing from the hip like an old Western. The flailing stopped, but the accusing glare remained.   

The second batch of sales workers seemed to have learned from the first, recognizing the challenges of rushing the choke point. There was the sound of scuffling in the hall as they struggled to position themselves in the 3D space before the first wave launched themselves out of the blind corner.   

There were five of them, and they weren’t just smarter than the frontrunners, they seemed more physically capable. There was another sharp-toothed biped of the same species as Brisinj, and the two quickly locked themselves in a duel. Brisinj’s stationary position gave him an advantage in accuracy, but the speed that the other one was moving at made him hard to hit.   

Brisinj let out an involuntary hiss as one of the shots hit him in the arm. His opponent’s eyes narrowed in fury at the sound, and the moment of distraction was enough for Brisinj to swap the gun to his functioning hand and take out one of his opponent’s legs.   

Unable to position his landing well, the clerk hit the next wall and glanced off, spinning. Valrose took a careful shot at his chest and the flailing of limbs stopped, giving him the appearance of a shuriken as he whirled off in the direction of the power lab.   

Still, his efforts gave four of his comrades enough time to get to cover unharried. As they began to fire at the entrenched trio, they gave more of their friends time to get through the door and set up.   

Valrose was able to put up the best fight here. His head barely poked out of the pillbox, the only part of him truly exposed when he fired was whatever arm happened to be holding his pistol. He simply ran through them like an assembly line, one pincer passing the pistol off to the next as his arms took hit after hit.   

He managed to get a chest shot against an upper levels sales manager, but the real gains of his strategy were in the way he took fire off the other two. Brisinj’s sharpshooter accuracy had gone down to mortal levels after swapping to his non-dominant arm, but he was still able to get two cocky reptilians through the chest when they tried to leap for better positions. Shiloh himself seemed content to take limb shots, whittling the sales team down slowly. His reptilian comrades weren’t particularly good shots, but they made up for it with their default ambidexterity. It was the real sharpshooters, the mammalian bipeds and greys, that suffered the most from losing their dominant limbs. For a moment, it looked like they could manage to hold their positions indefinitely.   
   
The moment couldn’t last.   

Two shooters made a bullrush for Valrose. The first, a reptilian, was taken out easily, but Brisinj only managed to get the second’s leg before he dove in through the entrance slot. There was a muffled curse before Valrose was evicted from the box, limbs splayed.  

A chest shot.   

*Shit*.
  
The pillbox was positioned behind both Brisinj and Shiloh. Having it captured didn’t just mean that they’d lost their main distraction, it meant that they were about to get caught in a crossfire.   

Shiloh may not have had the quickest body, but he had a lightning mind. Before Valrose was even shoved out of the slot he was launching himself out of cover. He had his knees bent in front of him like a shield, sacrificing them midflight. If he’d been aiming for a wall, he’d have hit the ground crippled, unable to push off, but he knew better: There was a water pipe hanging off the wall he could swing around like a gymnast on, repositioning his trajectory on a beeline for the power lab.   

Brisinj himself realized a half second later what he needed to do, but his superior speed made up the difference nicely. He dug his clawed fingertips into the carpet, weaving serpentine down the hall, more of a climbing motion than anything else. It was working beautifully, beams of infrared traced all the places he would’ve been if he’d been foolish enough to move in a straight line. He’d almost made it the full length of the hall before a lucky shot grazed his hand, the remaining arm locking tight. Dropping the last pretense of strategy, he simply kicked as hard as he could off the wall, launching himself towards the door he’d just barely seen Shiloh disappear behind.  
 
It worked. He barreled into the lab, just barely managing to twist enough to land feet first on the wall instead of bouncing around the room like a 140 kilo rubber bullet.  

“EARL! THEY GOT. VAL. ARE YOU. DONE. YET?”  

Earl turned around, a wild grin on his face. He’d built… something. There was a breadboard covered in crudely soldered chemical batteries, a handful of resistors, and most importantly, an LED. A matte black cone of plastic was wrapped around the top bulb, focusing the light from a radial burst to a much more concentrated cone.  
 
Brisinj was *good* at circuits, but the whole thing was so rushed and messy he could barely tell where the on switch was. Shiloh, on the other hand, seemed to understand immediately.   

“Does that LED emit in the same wavelength as the pistols?” he demanded, almost gleeful at the prospect. 
  
“Close! We’ll see if it’s close enough to fool the suits.”  

There was no time for self-congratulating speeches. The sales team had begun to follow them down the halls, eager to finish what they’d started.   

***
  
Earl braced himself by the doorway. Behind him laid his wounded teammates...before him laid destiny.   

And what human would he be, if he had not laid with destiny?  

He launched himself across the room, body parallel to the ground even as he fired the cone down the hallway. He didn’t have the expert precision of Brisinj, or the fast thinking of Shiloh, but he married both in a way that lent itself beautifully to movement. He only needed to be good at dodging, his homemade infrared blaster was basically miss proof. 

It was a massacre. The infrared cannon froze everything in its massive, continuous cone, combining the best traits of both a machine-gun and a flamethrower. You couldn’t *pray* for a better room clearing device. Earl was able to clear out the entire corridor with a flick of his wrist, paralyzed salesmen drifting through the zero-gravity environment like frozen corpses after a hull breach. There was something eerily beautiful to the scene. 
  
The effect was ruined somewhat when the drifting “corpses” started whining about *rules* and  *blatant cheating*, but Earl was far too busy not listening to them to bother listening to them.  
 
Using the floating bodies as jump-off points, he rocketed down the hall, the cone making a gentle figure-eight sweep as it cleared every point in his field of vision. Limbs froze at awkward angles, as people tried to fire from behind cover and those that tried to move for a better vantage point, desperate to make sense of the chaos, found themselves cast adrift.  

It took him a little under four seconds to wipe out the remnants of sales. It took him longer than that to spot Valrose, buried as he was under a pile of four clerks.   

It only took him one bounding leap to reach his friend, and two great heaving pulls to send the clerks flying off into space. Val was currently face down, and he took a moment to steel himself before turning his friend over.   

*No.* 

They’d got him. There were easily four dicks on his face, with a level of anatomical detail that Earl found both frightening and educational.   

*Huh. So that’s what they look like.*
  
Val’s expression was as inscrutable as any shrimp’s, and his casual tone wasn’t helping.   

“Give it to me straight Earl: How bad is it?”  

Earl placed a gentle hand on Val’s shoulder. They were both men here. He deserved the truth.   

“Val… There are four dicks on your face. Like, full on dicks. Dicks with veins kind of dicks.”  

Val’s face twitched a little, but he kept that calm, stable tone that everyone on the station knew him for.  

“I see. Earl, could I ask you a slight favor?”  

It was probably the result of seeing too many cheesy war movies, but Earl didn’t think he could refuse a comrade that had, in a way, given it all in pursuit of duty.   

“Anything man. Just name it.”  

The temperature seemed to drop, so cold was Val’s simple response.   

“Avenge me.”   

***  

R&amp;D solved its vengeance problem the same way it solved all of its problems: By breaking its solution down into easily replicable steps and then moving on to mass production.   

It took Earl only a minute to print out a halfway decent stamp, time that Shiloh and Brisinj spent figuring out how to act as the other’s limbs. They were far from graceful, but they could get by. With no time to lose they began clumsily navigating the open spaces, moving from body to body, a flurry of stamping, jumping, and laughter. 

Earl himself spent his time getting situated in the pillbox. He wasn’t sure if he could beat the onslaught of accounting, but it was worth a shot. Even in the worst case, his goal could be to just buy time for Val’s vengeance. 

There was time for two people to get stamped before the first accountant poked his head around the corner. Earl recognized his face, even if he didn’t know his name. He was a fellow intern, green as a sapling. A quick pulse of the blaster was all it took to turn him into a statue, a fate he seemed surprisingly at peace with. Even as a casualty he continued to relay information to his teammates. It seemed that he’d been chosen specifically as a sacrifice.  
 
“Alright everyone, you’re not gonna believe this, but the lab boys actually managed to eliminate everyone in sales.”
  
Even muffled by the blind corner, there was still an audible wave of surprised hums. It seemed that they’d massed just out of sight, taking a slow and steady approach. Their patience and general willingness to strategize didn’t bode well for R&amp;D.   

The intern spent a few more seconds analyzing the room before relaying back even more info.   

“They’re uh… they’re graffiting the sales branch with genitalia. I can see Val, it looks like he’s been out for a while. They’ve got Brisinj and Shiloh helping each other out, but they’re both missing the use of two limbs, they’re not very combat effective. The only one that seems intact is Earl, and he’s got a little fort made at the end of the room. Hi Earl!”  

Earl gave him a little wave. This was… oddly amicable. If he could pull this bit out longer, it would be a lot simpler than fighting.   

“Hey! Sorry, I forgot your name. Always been bad with names. Who are you again?”  

The paralyzed accountant didn’t seem very bothered by this.   

“I’m Velen! The thing in your hand isn’t a phaser, so I’m assuming you made your own weapon?”  

Earl’s eyes widened in alarm. Huh. Well, that element of surprise burned out real fast.   

“Eh… Well… Yeah.”  

He was already tucking the weapon away, but it was too late, Velen was already passing on more recon.   

“Earl’s made a phaser! Lots of batteries and a large LED! It’s got a cone shaped barrel, probably covers a wide area continuously. Anyone got any ideas on how to handle that?”  

Earl couldn’t hear the voices too well, but there were suggestions of various shields, ranging from using a wall of interns, to coffee tables. The winning suggestion came from a reptilian voice, recognizable by its faint lisping accent, identical to Shiloh’s.   

“...I think there’s a large mirror hanging up in the lobby? We might be able to reflect the beam back at him.”  

Earl considered this. If he waited here, there would be the substantial delay of them traveling down to the main docking area, then traveling back, then making their slow and steady charge. He didn’t have a good counter to it, but it would at least be a slow style of victory.   

Alternatively. He could charge, right now. He might get shot immediately, he might win, hell, he might do neither and just succeed in delaying the inevitable a little more staunchly.   

What the hell. He still had some fight left in him.   

He braced his legs on the back of his pillbox, blasting himself out of the narrow entrance slot like an ICBM leaving a submarine.   

Velen startled a little before continuing his play-by-play.   

“He’s pretty fast! Hey, he’s making a run for the hall. You guys might want to pull back a little, or you’ll end up like me.”  

There was the ominous banging of twenty-five points of shoes bouncing off the walls before Earl even rounded the corner. He froze, unsure of what to do, when he heard that same, old reptile speak. 

“Not bad! After what happened on your colony world I thought you’d be taking things slow. War of attrition. Glad to see that you’ll gamble on victory!”  

Earl launched down the hall towards the voice. The lizard that he saw was old, older than Shiloh. He’d braced himself at the edge of another blind corner, shooting a wink before launching out of line of sight.   

Earl followed in hot pursuit, gun held on in front of him. The lizard was damn fast, always just a few steps ahead.   
Panting, he rounded a corner just in time to see a green tail whirl into the bathroom.   

He grinned.
   
The little guy was fast, but he’d cornered himself there. Earl pushed quickly, eager to catch the lizard before he realized his mistake.   

He rocketed in through the door, blaster on, and immediately realized that the lizard wasn’t the one screwing up. He was.   

*Mirrors.*
   
He froze as the reflective surfaces in the room bounced the beam back at him. He drifted silently through the empty space, *hoisted by his own petard*, before he saw a familiar spiky head pop up from one of the stalls. Now that paralysis wasn’t on the line, the lizard’s movements were a lot more relaxed.   

Earl spoke first. It was really all he could do, frozen as he was.   

“I don’t actually know your name, but may I just say that you pulled this off beautifully?”  

The lizard grinned.  
 
“Ha! I’m Petrunko. I’ll take that compliment, today was probably the most I’ve used my brain in the last ten years.”
  
Earl tried to shrug, the suit reducing the movement to a neck twitch. He laughed at himself for trying, the excitement of the last few minutes wearing off, leaving him happy and tired.   

“You sound like my boss. Get too good at your job and it gets boring, huh?”  

Petrunko wiggled his hand a little, the surprisingly universal sign for ""kinda.”  

“Your job doesn’t really change, but your view of what you’re a part of does. Imagine if one of your cells became self-aware and you’ve got a good idea of what my life is like.”  

Earl winced. That sounded like an existential nightmare. 

Petrunko caught the expression and held up his three fingered hands placatingly.  
 
“Whatever panic your ego has right now about feeling small and insignificant will be replaced when you get older. You’ll *want* to be part of something bigger than yourself. Give it time.”  

Earl grinned at that. The advice was good but beyond that…  

“Psh. Went from sounding like my boss to sounding like my dad.”  

Petrunko crossed his arms, more amused than annoyed at the jab.   

“Wonder what your dad would say about your little art project back there. Those canvases are a bit pricey for dick stencils.”  

“Well, if it makes you feel better, we only defaced two of them before your nerd squad showed up.”  

Petrunko laughed. The noise was only cut off when a distant hum began, the ion thrusters on the hull giving some faint warning that the station was about to begun rotating again. Apparently, the other accountants apparently had seized the opportunity to finish off Brisinj and Shiloh.   

The game was over. Earl felt himself gently falling to the ground, arms and legs suddenly free to move once more.   
Petrunko offered him a hand up, and he took it gratefully.   

“Hopefully your friends got a few more with the delay you bought them. Sales has always been hard to get along with, but they’ve been mean bastards for the last four years.""  
 
Earl dusted himself off before offering a handshake. Petrunko clearly wasn’t familiar with the gesture, but he got the hang of it quickly.   

“What’s it mean?”
  
Earl paused, processing. He was still getting used to explaining body language, to expressing so much in only words.
   
“It’s got a couple of meanings, but right now it means ‘You beat me, and earned my respect.’”  

Petrunko concentrated for a moment, clearly trying to commit it to memory.   

“I like that. I hope I get the chance to shake your hand next time, Earl.”

Earl had a moment of startling clarity: He’d just made a friend. A good one too, it seemed. He choked up a little but forced his voice to go casual.    

“Well, we’ll see if I can earn it. In the meantime, we should go check the other science boys. I’m curious to see how they’ve managed without me.”

Petrunko shrugged.   

“I’d point out the strangeness of the newest person here trying to mother people with three, four times his expertise but… I do want to see what they managed in your absence. Come on, let’s go.”

And together they left, walking down the halls that just moments before they'd flown through. 

In the companionable peace of things after the battle, Earl had one final thought:

*I can't believe I wrote this off as bullshit.*

Earl: Main character, born on the colony of world Neo-Tallahassee. Human. Works in the research lab of a weapons manufacturer. 

Shiloh: A reptilian coworker of Earl, acts as a mentor. 

Brisinj: Another bipedal mammalian species. Intelligent, but not articulate. Likes his job a little too much. 

Valrose: A member of an enormous crustacean species, known at his job for having a very even temperament. 

**Species descriptions**

Reptiloids: Notably small, the biggest are around 50 kilograms, and the tallest are around 168 cm. They have three fingers, digitigrade legs, and a tail. Colors are highly varied. 

Voxoid: Brisinj's race, the name a reference to their difficulties with speaking. They are bipedal mammals, but they seem to have specialized in individual hunting rather than social outcomes. Highly intelligent, but aggressive with a tendency towards antisocial behaviors. They have fine body hair like humans, but no thick patches. Their most notable physical features are their dark sclera, and their constantly regenerating serrated teeth. 

Crustaceanoid: Notably larger than any other intelligent life in the Dark Forest Pact, likely a result of their semi-aquatic environment. Weight varies substantially, between 250 kg to 550 kg, increasing mostly with age. They move on four main legs and have two strong pincers for carrying heavy objects, with a dozen small ones that can be used for fine manipulation. Is fully capable of using all of them at the same time."
o51760,1,2021-06-21,How to address the employment gap in next interview?,AviatorCrafty,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/o51760/how_to_address_the_employment_gap_in_next/,"First post in this sub after lurking for a while. Wanted to know the best way to address an employment gap on my resume after being employed since 2018. 

So for my background, I got my first IT job (internship) in the IT department of my school district during my senior year of high school and worked there for just shy of a year. I left that job when I took on a student IT job at my then community college, and I worked there until I graduated there this past May, I had to leave since it was a student position after all but my boss did attempt to justify to higher-ups for me staying over the summer but was unsuccessful. Right now I've transferred into a 4-year university to attend there for two years starting in August. I did apply to a short summer internship I managed to find since I didn't want a gap, however recently got an email after months of silence saying ""despite my amazing background and experience, I didn't quite meet the qualifications"", whatever that means. 

I was made aware that my new college hires a few students into their IT department, and that here starting in July they'd open up fall positions, so I'm hoping there will be an opening then. Any advice on preparing to address 2 years of IT experience then a sudden gap?"
o519ps,5,2021-06-21,How much support should I expect as a junior software engineer?,xDenimBoilerx,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/o519ps/how_much_support_should_i_expect_as_a_junior/,"I was an intern for about 8 months and worked almost exclusively on front end. We use Angular/Ionic and I'm very comfortable using it now.

The entire internship I was supposed to be learning backend as well so I could eventually be doing full-stack work. Our backend code is so massive and confusing. I've done some Spring Boot tutorials and know the basics, but this thing is unfathomable. 

I am always told that I'll get support and some easy work to get experience in the backend, but that support is never there. I ask questions and get answers basically telling me to ask other people because they're more familiar. Those other people don't reply usually, or give a very simple response that seems to expect me to know as much as they do somehow. 

I have no clue how I'm supposed to be learning this, and feel like it is really ruining my future. I've been doing this for about a year now and am officially a ""Junior Software Engineer"", but feel like if much more time goes by and I have absolutely no clue wtf I'm doing with the backend that it's going to make me look worse and worse. 

Am I just supposed to stare at the mountain of code until it makes sense? I've wasted hours and hours and know less than I did when I started. What is typical for this kind of thing?"
o52c8h,11,2021-06-21,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (6/21/2021),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/o52c8h/weekly_job_qa_thread_6212021/,"Hi all,

Here is the sixty-ninth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:**

*1500 - 2000 USD*

**Are you open to refurbs/used?**

*As long as it's lightly used/refurbished to a high standard.*

**How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**

*Pretty high. I'd like the laptop to last as long as possible, so a robust build quality and battery life are desired.*

**How important is weight and thinness to you?**

*Not very important. I plan to stow it in a backpack, so neither should be much of a concern.*

**Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**

*Big is good, but I don't really care.*

**Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**

*Video editing in Blender and photo editing in Photoshop, both for fun. Gaming via Steam.*

**If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**

*Games on the lower end of performance requirements, such as Spelunky 2 and Empire at War. The most intensive games I'd play would probably be a Total War Shogun 2 and/or Deep Rock Galactic. Good graphics are obviously ideal, but are not a requirement.*

**Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**

*Long-lasting build quality is a major positive. The ability to modify/upgrade it would be good as well. I also enjoy drawing, so a touch screen would be a nice bonus, provided no concessions are made for reliability.*

**Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**

*Based on my business school's information page and statements from students, Windows is the preferred OS due to infrastructure like Office that's present in both the university and internships.*"
o56djc,20,2021-06-21,"Passionate about CS academically, but meh on coding",Threight,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/o56djc/passionate_about_cs_academically_but_meh_on_coding/,"I really loved my bachelors, learning about all these abstract concepts, from finite automata to AST's, algorithmic complexity, data compression, first order logic, etc. I had been a ""script kiddie"" since I was around 10, I still love coding as a hobby on random projects that don't go anywhere or have any value, just the kind of stuff I'm interested to try out over a weekend. I've never really been interested in coding anything with the goal of making money.

Now my bachelor's over and I've been a software dev for over a year and I'm on my second ""real job"" so far and I just... don't like it. I don't like coding professionally, I don't like having to deal with legacy codebases or weird node errors stemming from decisions taken by a bunch of people who no longer work there. The two jobs I've had were completely different (big insurance firm before, small startup now)

I just feel lazy and unproductive all day long, doing the minimum to coast and I hate myself for it and don't feel any motivation to learn new tech and stay up to date and at the end of the day I just don't feel like I belong in this field. And looking back at my internships during my bachelors, I didnt like those either and just counted the days until it was over so I could back in school.

And like I still do love reading books about CS concepts and random papers about abstract problems that don't really ""matter"" in the real world. 

I'm making decent money right now though, I now live on my own and I gotta pay bills and stuff. Like if I became a millionaire overnight I wouldn't change a thing to my lifestyle, I'd just set up something to live off the interest without having to work, and go to school for no reason other than to keep learning stuff.

What are my options, career wise? I don't want to take a salary hit by doing something I like more, but that just feels unrealistic. I'm basically just a junior dev with the resume of a junior dev cause that's what I thought I wanted."
o56ga6,10,2021-06-21,Advice needed. Boss not acknowledging my time off for brain surgery,PattyJH,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/o56ga6/advice_needed_boss_not_acknowledging_my_time_off/,"
﻿I’m going to try to simplify this, but it is a somewhat complicated issue. 

My current supervisor has moved up in the company quite quickly and for good reason. He is smart and personable, he understands the needs for our clients, etc. He began as an intern assigned to my office with much of his training being done with me. We formed a friendship and when our team had an opening I encouraged him to apply then advocated for him with upper management. He got the job and he was a great team member until his personal life wouldn’t afford him to work the crazy schedule our team has and he took another job within the agency. We kept in touch and he continued to do intermittent work with our team. 

Fast forward a couple years and our team had an opening for the working supervisor position. I encouraged him to apply, wrote a letter of recommendation, etc. He accepted the job and has been in that position for about a year and a half. Unfortunately there have been multiple challenges to the team in that time, we have been short staffed for most of that time, have had many changes in what and how we do things and we have become less cohesive and have a significantly more demanding work load. This is not entirely our supervisor’s fault but he has not been very helpful, supportive or proactive about it. We cover a 6 county area and I have seen him only two times in the past year with my office being on the far west side of our catchment. Each time he stopped at my office, he did not tell my ahead of time that he was coming and he stayed for less than a minute as he was there to drop off/pick something up. He will reach out if there is a problem and I have to call him on the rare occasions that I need his approval for something but aside from that I see him only at our monthly virtual meetings. He often seems out of touch with his team members who aren’t located in the same office as him (he has four staff in the same building that he is at and 7 of us in outlying areas).  He has been controlling about some very minor decisions we have made for ourselves in the past, like who is taking lead on the next assignment, switching shifts with eachother as needed, as well as clinical decisions that we have been hired to make. Additionally, he dominates our (4 hour long!) monthly meetings with trainings that are often not applicable to us or do not take into account the decades of expertise team members are bringing to the table. Importantly, this also leaves no time for ideas, concerns or dilemmas facing the team, our workflow, and basic team building. So I’m struggling to know how to address the following issue…..

After years of suffering with neurological problems and treatment that was no longer working, I recently had to undergo brain surgery.  I am home on a 6 week medical leave that was certified by the neurosurgeon and approved by our HR. My kids are grown and I am rarely sick so I have accumulated 500+ hours of sick leave as well as plenty of vacation time. I mention this because, not knowing me, I think it’s important that you understand that I am a hard worker who goes to work and takes my part in the team seriously. That being the case, I was unhappy about his request that I work 5 12-hour shifts in a row as well as 2 nights of being “on-call” on the week just proceeding my surgery but I understood his wanting to give others a break. Still, it felt punitive. I have been with the agency for 22 years and have never taken more than a two week vacation. I know if I’m not there someone else may have to pick up the slack. I am afraid that my supervisor has done nothing to prepare for my absence and has left my teammates extra short staffed. What is especially troubling is that he has me on the work schedule starting three weeks before I am supposed to be back. He was given the dates by me and HR. He was reminded of the dates a week before I left for surgery. I’m not sure how to address this, or if I should address it. I sure don’t want others planning on me being at work when I am clearly not going to be there. 

One last, more personal, note on this….My supervisor did not contact me before my surgery. He did not contact me after either. I have not heard from him at all. His supervisor reached out to me multiple time asking how I was and if I needed anything but nothing from him. The staff located in the same office as me have so supportive and helpful, but not my own supervisor. He did take a vacation the first week I was off so I know he was busy but to say my feelings aren’t hurt would be untrue. 

Help me figure out how to best address this. Thank you so much!

o58jo8,289,2021-06-21,FINALLY LANDED A JOB,angstyang,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/o58jo8/finally_landed_a_job/,"I graduated a year later than I should have because I got kicked out of mechanical engineering at my university due to 2 continuous semesters on probation. I wanted to end my life, didn't know what to do, my major core GPA was less than a 2 and my overall GPA was barely 2.9 and this was junior year for me!!!  Got diagnosed with ADHD in the summer before junior year (I got Adderall and that helped a lot. As an international student coming from India, ADHD knowledge was almost non existent there!). To add to that, getting internships as a low performing international student was always tough. I screwed up 3 interviews (one with fkn Tesla). One company almost gave me a co-op but they had a minimum 3.0 requirement and they strictly enforced that which led to them going with another candidate even though my experience through internships in india and a project my team won second place for made me perfect for that position. 

After probation, I switched into Industrial Engineering, realized I loved the material and started to actually go for lectures. Added a stats and econ minor, realized I was passionate about data analytics and started to take courses in that. I managed to land an internship in data analytics with a startup that couldn't offer me a full time offer due to covid. 

Fast forward to now, I got my GPA above a 3.1,  my industrial engineering core GPA was above a 3.5 and FINALLY LANDED A JOB AS A DATA ANALYST!! I know that things can look dark sometimes and you may be struggling but please know that if you find something you love to do and work hard towards achieving it, you'll make it.

I'm a little worried that it won't be enough but I also don't know what to go for in that area. 

From the research I've done, it seems easiest to apply to international finance companies with offices in Japan but I'm open to any relatively high-paying career.

I don't have much stuff and I'll be able to move with one plane trip, but I worry a lot about finding housing (seems to be quite a nightmare from what I've read) and generally living there (culture is different, no clue what the overall vibe is, etc).

Aside from learning the language, what should I do ahead of time to prepare for everything and what's a simplified process of getting to Japan that I can further research in my own time?

**Letters of Recommendation**

I ended up getting my rec letters last minute from the teachers whose classes I'd done the worst in in 11th grade (Calc AB, APUSH) because I ran out of options; didn't have particularly strong relationships with either of them. Eventually I got a 3rd letter from my orchestra director, who isn't known for particularly persuasive rec letters but with whom I had a stronger relationship. There was also a counselor recommendation; I had a pretty warm relationship with my counselor.

**Interviews**

I was only offered an interview from UPenn; it was only about 15 minutes long and was over FaceTime. Tone was pretty casual and the interviewer seemed impressed by my research experience.

Somewhat related to interviews, I sent a custom video profile to Brown and UChicago, and did Bowdoin's separate video profile prompt.

**Essays**

I started everything pretty late; that being said I think I wrote a pretty good personal statement. It was about the overactive imagination I've had since childhood, and how that manifested itself in the form of a fictional world which I've been developing in different ways in my mind and through my artwork since I was little; my language always tends to be a little flowery, but I got my point across and told a story that's pretty unique to me.

I procrastinated heavily on my apps and wrote a lot of supplements the day before or the day they were due, but I reused a few essays/essay fragments over a bunch of different apps, most especially writing detailing my experience of creating a constructed language.

In addition, I wrote a 25-page extended essay in the style of a research paper about my constructed language and submitted it to Vassar, UChicago, the Ivies, and a couple others, as well as a Letter of Continued Interest to Yale (after being deferred SCEA) and UChicago (after being waitlisted). I'm fairly certain that both of these became really influential with respect to my results.

**Decisions**

*Acceptances:*

* Texas A&amp;M University - College of Liberal Arts (rolling, auto-admit)
* Connecticut College (RD)
* Vassar College (RD)
* Cornell University - College of Arts &amp; Sciences (RD)

*Waitlists:*

* University of Chicago (RD, accepted off waitlist post-gap year!)
* Colby College (RD)
* Swarthmore College (RD)
* UCLA (RD)
* UC Berkeley (RD)

*Rejections:*

* UT Austin (RD, got into CAP program but rejected from Austin)
* Johns Hopkins University (RD)
* Bowdoin College (RD)
* Pomona College (RD)
* Williams College (RD)
* Dartmouth College (RD)
* University of Pennsylvania (RD)
* Brown University (RD)
* Harvard University (RD)
* Yale University (SCEA deferred, then rejected)

**Additional Information:**

Other than A&amp;M and Conn (my safeties), I got an endless stream of waitlists and rejections up till Vassar on March 31st, and then Cornell on Ivy Day. Yale and UChicago were my dream schools, so UChicago's waitlist and Yale's rejection especially stung for me, but after I got into Cornell, I was super happy and spent the next month interacting with the Cornell community.

However, Cornell's financial aid office was struggling, and the whole month of April came and went without my aid package showing up. By the end of the month, I was kinda freaking out because I still had yet to commit anywhere; I asked both Vassar and Cornell for commitment extensions as I waited for Cornell's aid.

But on April 30th, the day before the commitment deadline for most colleges, everything changed. I got an email during my AP Research class (right before lunch) from my UChicago Admissions Officer asking to call me to give me an update regarding where they stood with the waitlist. I was totally shocked but responded immediately, and she called me during lunch and told me that while they were overenrolled for the Class of 2025, they wanted to offer me a seat in the Class of 2026. I was ecstatic!!

Financial Aid info was sent the following week (ironically, Cornell's came out too, within a couple minutes of it, but UChicago's ended up being better), and I accepted the offer exactly a week after I first got it, on May 7th.

Now that the process is finally over, I've had a chance to reflect, especially with regards to my UChicago Application. I came to realize that many things came together in the end to help me reach the result I did. More than just the common app and essays, I submitted a number of supplemental materials, including the constructed language extended essay, the video profile, a couple music-related supplements, and finally my LOCI. My AO told me that they usually offer a post-gap-year enrollment to about 20-40 students per year, meaning that the statistical probability of getting the result I did was likely &lt;0.1%. This was truly a miracle to me, and while I was already blessed to have gotten into Cornell and Vassar, my acceptance to UChicago was a dream come true.

Though a gap year was never a part of my plan, I've come to realize that it too was a blessing. Over the  past year I've developed some significant mental and physical health complications, and a gap year provides me with enough time to heal. Furthermore, with AP-heavy courseloads the past two-years, I've had barely any free time to spend on artistic pursuits, at least outside of orchestra, and the gap year gives me a chance to do this as well! Once I heal, I'm hoping to travel, reconnect with my culture, and pursue internships. Though I never intended on taking this path, I now have a whole year to explore and to craft an experience for myself that I'd never have gotten to had I not gotten this opportunity. The future looks bright! \^\^\*

To any rising seniors reading this, please know that even if things look bleak in the beginning, that things do get better. Trust the process, because it will take you to where you need to be, and things will work out in the end as long as you have patience and put in your best work. Best of luck to everyone!"

It has been more than 3 months into my new job and I'm kind of struggling with not having enough things to do daily. I have talked to my team lead about it once and he asked me what areas of interest I would like to experience more of, to which I replied him. But because my team is undergoing reorganisation, he just told me he'll keep that in mind. At the end of that conversation, I just straight told him ""ok then what do I do now cause I don't have much on my plate"", and he gave me an ad-hoc task, which after completing, I'm back to the I-have-nothing-to-do state. 

We are working from home right now and I think I messaged him 2-3 times telling him ""let me know if there is anything I can help with since I don't have much on my hands right now"". But I was always either given an ad-hoc task or ignored, the last time I told him that was last friday and I saw that he read the message but didn't reply. I feel like I'm bugging a busy man but I really do have alot of free time right now which makes me think of finding a new ""proper"" job but I feel like I haven't gain enough experience in this company yet to have anything to write in my resume. Also, I really do like working in this company, the culture, the flexibility, the people and all. 

Also, everytime I'm not asking work-related questions to my colleagues, I'm telling them ""let me know if theres anything else I can help with"". But they have never given me much other work too (some do give me some small tasks but that's all).

I'm not sure if it's the way I'm asking questions or if there's anything I'm doing wrong when asking my colleagues? Was thinking of asking my team lead again if he have anything that I can help with, and if he doesn't reply (since he seems to be very busy) I'll go and ask the other 2 perm staff in my team... Would like some advice on how I should phrase it (hi &lt;team lead&gt;, I don't have much on my hands right now, is there anything else I can help with?)??"

)










But for those of you that don't have the time, I'll give you the quick and dirty. 




It's a story I wrote a while back about a game played by eldritch entities for an unknown purpose. Did fairly well as a matter of fact. 




But I'm not here to brag, actually, I'm here to confess something. 




I didn't write it. 




A little over a year ago, I got an e-mail, an account I only use to abuse free trials, but addressed to me by name. 




You can call me Patrick by the way. Not my real name, no, my real name was staring at me from the subject line of that email. 




Shocking, but the contents were not threatening in the slightest. Odd, but nothing that made me want to call the cops. 




The gist was that the person who sent the email wanted me to post a story they had written. They made some vague insinuations as to problems with the mods, not that I was analysing their reasons too much. 




They said I was free to take the credit, they just wanted to prove the story would do fine without their name attached.  




I'd been thinking about returning to writing for a long time. Corporate garbage in my 20s put a bad taste in my mouth in regards to the premise of making art, but with this plague and infinite free time, old grudges were becoming less staunch. 




And with a few months of quality stories to drum up interest, I thought this offer was a happy coincidence that would lead to my return to writing, with a pretty built fanbase. 




And until recently…that's what it was. Didn't give me a Stephen King following, but at least it attracted a few fans that have been doing their damndest to spread my writing around. 




I've always assumed some mod got a cocky email they didn't care about over the issue, and that was that. Nothing more than one angry writer's ploy being to my benefit. 




When I came home to find a large leather bound book on my kitchen table, I began to realise I was wrong. 




I knew what it was well before I cracked it open. Different subjects, but the same theme. This was another volume of the instruction booklet, but this wasn't a sanitary text file I could write off as the product of a creative,  if offbeat mind. This was a real, bound, cobbled together text. 




Not like a scrapbook, more like it was put through some serious trauma and put back together as best as someone could. 




Seems like a great prank right? Friend of mine went through my computer maybe, read the email and decided to mess with me. 




If I thought that, I wouldn't be skipping from town to town trying to avoid suspicious individuals that are showing up more and more often. 




Last night was the closest call I've had. I came back to my cash only hotel and had just sat down on dusty smelling bed when a well muscled arm grabbed me around the neck. 




I'm no fighter, hell I've been flipping houses poorly for the last 2 years to make ends meet. So the fact I managed to slip out of this clumsy choke hold is a miracle in and of itself. 




I spun on my attacker, the bed now separating us. I guess his age to be early twenties, he is wearing a black hoodie that seems slightly too small for his whip thin frame. 




His eyes are wild and a grin is plastered over his pale face. He pulls a spring assisted knife out in a flash, waving the cheap silver blade in front of him as he begins to circle the bed. 




I grab the steel ice bucket, small and light it doesn't make for an imposing weapon. But wordlessly the man mocks fear backing off in a pantomime of surrender. 




I start to sweat, I know something isn't right, beyond just a lunatic brandishing a weapon. 




He reaches into a pocket and pulls out an old camo green package, reminds me of something military, an MRE packet maybe. He waves it as if I'm a dog waiting for a treat, and I find myself watching it as intently as a pistol. 




He takes his cheap switchblade and tears the package open. A dim orange light pours from it along with the acrid rank of burning fuel and plastic. He widens the cut and looks into it, a look of pleasure on his sallow face. 




He points the open end at me, and I see what is inside. 




War. 




That is my best way of describing it. Real, brutal , modern, war. Stripped of its grandeur,  it's glory. A century of violence and hatred condensed and beamed from that tiny little package into my mind. All the emotion, all the suffering, all the loss. 




I'm no soldier, I can't even grasp how someone can deal with those kind of conditions day in day out. And I can now say that from experience. 




I could feel my mind begin to fray and snap, my soft civilian sensibilities having zero ability to cope with the distilled war being thrown at them. 




Before I'm rooted to the spot, I slam the ice bucket into the bridge of my nose. It weighs next to nothing, but the cheap piece of garbage has a nice sharp edge. 




Blood pours down my face, my eyes well up, blinding me , but breaking the spell. 




I put my head down and charge forward, slamming the thin man into the wall hard enough to buckle the drywall. 




I scramble out the door into my truck, half blind still, I stumble down the first flight of stairs, slamming myself into the railing rather than losing speed. 




I don't look back but I can hear the man behind me, I scramble into my front seat slamming the door. 




I hear a sickening crunch, as I turn to see the man had almost caught up to me, one finger of his right hand is caught in the shut door, his left is stabbing fruitlessly at the truck door. 




My tires screech as I pull away, the man manages to keep up for a full block before a stumble separates his finger from his hand and him from me. 




And that brings me to what we are doing here. 




I'm not going to be that idiot we all know of who refuses to realise the spooky has hit the fan. I just had a struggle with a meth addict looking guy who used a snack filled with war on me. 




I don't know how long I can keep running, but I thought I'd do a little good while I do so. I'll keep you updated on any information I can find on who… (I'm not going to say 'or what' , yet anyway.) Is following me, and more so,  I'm going to try and transcribe as much of the book as I can, maybe some of you can put together this mystery before I do. 




At the very least it'll give the next poor idiot who gets caught up in this a leg up. 




So , let's start at the beginning,  shall we? 










Peons- An Introduction




The organization has gone to great lengths to classify the various sentient elements of the game. This volume of our booklet will outline those who's main defining characteristic is being of a species  designed specifically for game function.  




These can be broken into 3 catagories: Peons, Profiteers and Paragons. Do not use these as value judgements on the entities level of danger. I've always been of the opinion that these designations were designed with alliteration in mind before descriptive ability. 




Peons are catagorised as such due to several defining characteristics that separate them from other sentient or quasi sentient game elements. 




Intellect- With some exceptions , usually related to game function they generally function at a level of cognition that ranges from top 1% of animal subjects to average cognition of a human toddler. 




Motivation- None outside of basic function in the game and minimal self preservation. 




Phenotype and population- Nearly identical to identical physical traits , and populations consisting of biostatic numbers of individuals based on needs for game role. 




As of this edition, all attempts to domesticate , or otherwise control these entities, have met with resounding failure. 




-Tiffany Patel PhD,  BSc, phrmb and current Chief of staff for the Office of Sentient Mitigation. 










Entity Designation: Peon- 1




Colloquial/Nicknames: Mountain Doctors, Deadnecks, Bone Carpenters.




Physical Description: Average examples stand from 2 and a half to 4 feet and are vaguely humanoid. 




The trunk of the creature is barrel shaped and uniform. The 'head ' of the creature being attached directly to a large fused bone that acts as both ribcage and hip bone.  




Their skin varies by region but tends to have very subtle markings meant to help the entity blend with local plant life. 




Their limbs are uniform, comparable moreso to a chimpanzee than human, giving them perfect pedi dexterity and the ability to gallop on all fours at average speeds of 25 kilometers per hour. 




They have 3 fingers tipped with long thin claws, used for defense and for game function. 




Interestingly their eyes, large , green and luminous as they are, are vestigial.  How , and if these entities can see is still being researched. 




Location: Can be found worldwide, must be in a forested or extremely overgrown area not within 400 Kilometers of any human settlement. 




Traits/Role: Non players should avoid these entities at all costs. They are extremely hostile and their robust body types make them extremely resiliant to most small arms. 




They will , without exception, incapacitate non players, then over a period of 1 to 2 weeks use pieces of the individual as both food and construction materials. Once the individual is near death, they will stabilize the person, using them to mark the edges of their territory till the limbless individual expires of exposure or starvation. 




(Project ""Appropriation"" has yet to yield useable results. While we have found methods to record the small battles between these entities, their methods of dispatching each other in combat are confounding our specialists. )




Their game function is to provide medical aid to the player, tempting as it may seem this should be an option of last resort. 




Each entity , while possessing minimal reasoning abilities , posses a level of medical knowledge on par with an average surgical intern. But often with certain gaps. 




If the player is wounded in such a way that the entity can repair, they will, often immaculately though without anesthetic. 




If the wound is beyond the knowledge of the entity, it, and all surrounding members will proceed to take the player within their encampment. 




Not much is known about the end fate of those brought in, in this fashion , other than it is not the same process as Non Player Individuals. 




Notes: If we could find a way to talk to these things, it would be problem solved for our player agents. But , their language is as perplexing as their anatomy. 




Unpopular opinion, but I think there is more to these guys than being mean stubby little fellows. If that is all they were , we'd have figured out what they are saying and where to put a bullet into them by now. 




-Paul Torn , data entry and revisions committee.













Entity Designation: Peon- 2




Colloquial/Nicknames: Old Soldiers, Cemetery Golem , Plastic Hero, Toy Soldiers




Physical Description: 7 foot entities made of  plastic possessing paranormal properties in regards to durability , flexibility and tensile strength. 




Visually resemble 'Green Army Men' manufactured by various companies in North America.  




Location: Any graveyard where there are over 36 bodies of veterans from a single military conflict taking place after 1920.  




Traits/Role: Non players can neither see, hear, nor smell these entities. Though they can touch and be effected by them in general. 




Thankfully they pose no threat to any non player who is not actively attempting to harm them or prevent them from fulfilling their role. 




Their invisible nature tends to explain many myths and urban legends involving 'haunted' graveyards and this can be a good guideline for players looking to seek them out. 




To players these entities will provide combat  assistance as long as they are within the graveyard in question. The entities are unwilling or unable to leave their associated cemetery.  




In the instance of 2 players asking for aid that are in conflict, the entities will remain neutral. Though, if for some reason a player is unable or unwilling to request aid, they can still be attacked. 




Exposure to these entities has a unique effect on the human psyche. While the entities have been proven to be altruistic, exposure to them causes a player to feel strong feelings of suspicion and fear toward the entities. This starts out with minor feelings of aprehension, but within 6 hours of exposure (depending on aid rendered this could be several incidents or one protracted fight.) The player will develop extreme obsession with destroying the entities. After 8 hours of exposure the player will forgo everything besides basic nutrition in attempts to destroy the entities. 




This is a futile task as anything short of a vehicle mounted weapon is unlikely to even wound the entities. And despite the obvious conclusion their composition would bring one to, heat has absolutely no effect.  




Notes:  Even given their restrictions, the toy soldiers are not much of a benefit. One of the main reasons being they don't actually talk. 




They can listen, somewhat, but you realise really quickly they only say about 7 different things. All random military jargon. 




It's less like a personal army, more like a handful of attack dogs that drive you insane. 




There have been reports of them speaking in a child like voice, asking ""Where do you live?"" To players, but, I don't know, could be guys repeating scuttlebutt,  could just be more gibberish.  I'm more concerned with keeping our assets away from these things than what they are. 




- General information ommitted  Combat and Tactics.













Entity Designation: Peon- 3




Colloquial/Nicknames: Shopkeepers, Store Coroner,  Bossmen. 




Physical Description: the top half of the entity is that of a nondescript male of about 40 to 50 years old. While regionally there are variations in appearance, within a region all instances are identical. 




Clothing generally consist of styles popular for men circa the mid 1980s. This holds true even if the store the entity is found in requires employees to wear a uniform. 




The bottom half of the entity is composed of dozens of tentacle like 'roots' that allow the entity some locomotion within a small area. These 'roots' extend into the floor of the building, regardless of the structural strength of the material. 




Organization scanning protocols have measured the roots extending over 4 kilometers into the earth. It is postulated they extend much further, but due to their sporadically appearing nature, this is the maximum depth of scan that has been completed. 




Location: Any business commonly used as a corner, general or variety store. The entities seem much more likely to pick independent locations, but appearances in retail chains have been recorded. 




No observable pattern in when these entities appear has been seen. 




Traits/Role: For non players the entity will do it's best to conceal it's nature. If it's lower half is seen, it will become violent, though the risk of injury is low as the maximum distance the entity can move from its rooted location is  approximately 15 feet. 




When attempting to make a purchase the entity will offer a similar product, the brand of which does not match any known corporation. Additionally these products will be sold at an extreme discount. 




The products, invariably will have paranormal or reality warping traits. 




A partial list of common products dispensed is below. For a full list a level 5 information request can be submitted. 




Killer Mosquito- Energy Drink: Causes a temporal shift of approximately 1 to 2 percent to the consumer for approximately 6-8 hours. 




Users describe this as a feeling of being extremely energized without any of the negative effects associated with caffeine. 




These effects are not mitigated in any way causing a severe drop in life expectancy due to accelerated aging and organs working at significantly increased rates. 




Oakwood Grape-Cigar: When smoked indoors there is no noticeable difference to a normal, budget cigar. 




If the consumer smokes it outside however, it will attract information ommitted  . These attacks have universally proven fatal, for obvious reasons. 




Lucky 9s-Lottery Ticket: Winning tickets will cause the consumers teeth to soften and fall out. 




Conversely, losing tickets will cause the consumers body to generate random teeth. Extremely dangerous as location is entirely random. 




Crusader-Condoms: High likely hood of causing extreme violent outbursts. Noteably not when the provalactive is used, but when carried in a wallet or watch pocket. 




Despite the almost universally harmful nature of these products, customers who survive will be inclined to purchase more items from this entity. Should they be unable to symptoms similar to alcohol withdrawal wI'll be experienced indefinately




Players may 'sell' any negative curse, trait or consequence of the game to the shopkeeper. Though the amount received is trivial, the obvious benefit is removal of the negative consequence of a game action. 




Notes: It's clear this thing is somehow manufacturing the effects from the game , somehow, into products. If we could domesticate one, our game playing employees would be at a severe advantage. 




-LeRoy Tooms, biological manipulation division. 










Entity Designation: Peon- 4




Colloquial/Nicknames: Power Creep




Physical Description: While having no obvious external physical differences from average humans, internally these entities bear more of a resemblance to parasitic invertabrates. 




Universally these entities will appear fit, healthy and be extremely socially adept. 




Location: Any major city no more than 100 miles inland of an ocean. 




Traits/Role: For both players and non players the entity will show up among a group of peers without logical reason. A mild delusion adjacent effect occurs in which members of the group will not question this appearance. 




The entity will then select it's target from among the group. Interestingly it's criteria only skews slightly toward picking victims that are actively playing the game. 




For non players this entity will become a social, romantic and even career rival. Universally the entity will triumph over the person, often via paranormal means which are only noticed by the targeted victim. 




The victim will become obsessed with competition with the entity, going to more extreme lengths to win even minor competitions , arguments, etc. 




Within 6 to 12 months the victim will eschew all thoughts of social,  legal or physical consequences. Leading to imprisonment , isolation or permanent injury. 




Players targeted will be those that are paragons in some game related sense. Longest survivors, largest following, a boon or ability beyond the normal etc. 




The entity, after ingraining itself in the players life will then attack. Universally these entities will attack with a similar trait to the one possessed by the player that attracted them. (A player who is superhumanly strong for example would attract an entity with superior strength.) 




While possessing no paranormal durability, the entities will have a nearly perfect knowledge of the player. Often resulting in conflicts being drawn out and one sided in favor of the entity. 




Notes: Anyone who has came face to face with one of these things feels they should be priority 1. 




Understandable, but the problem is, there is no nest to find, no dimension to raid. They show up to take out someone valuable, that's it. 




-Tim Sanders, Preventive Operations. 







That's all I'm going to share for now. I'm really hoping some of you out there can make more sense of this than I can. My suggestion box is wide open here folks. 




I'm on the run from some kind of cult, and unfortunately I don't have some kind of special ops background to help me out.

I’m now beginning to worry that, because i’m not doing some internship or job or big personal project relevant in my intended field (computer science), I’m going to be at a disadvantage when applying.

o5dwyl,3,2021-06-22,Adding old co-workers on LinkedIn/ asking them for references,SaruEscape,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/o5dwyl/adding_old_coworkers_on_linkedin_asking_them_for/,"I've been searching for a job post-graduation, and I'm finally in the late stages of the interview process for a company. They're now requesting for references and I believe an offer will follow after they check.



There's just one small issue: I'm not sure who I should put as my references. It's not that I don't have any; I've done a number of internships at various companies during school, so I have some potential references. Problem is, I never really bothered with the whole LinkedIn thing and so I haven't been in contact with any of them for a long time. I recognised its importance, but I never really liked it and was always too anxious/ socially awkward to add any of my co-workers. Internships never really required references so it was never really an issue until now.



I've found the profiles of a number of my old co-workers, but I'm hesitant to add them. Some of them are from 5+ years ago so I doubt they remember me, especially since I was only an intern and they've since moved on to bigger companies and better roles. The more recent places might still have some memory of me, but there's no guarantee. I think I've generally left on good terms with each workplace so giving a good reference shouldn't be an issue, so long as they remember me.



I'm probably overthinking this, but then again I've always been very bad with this sort of thing. For instance, on the last day of one of my more recent internships, I was told by my manager that it would be a good idea to send a farewell email to my team, along with my LinkedIn. Only my team lead added me (even my manager didn't). A co-worker/ mentor that I would have expected to add me didn't, even though we were on pretty good terms. I even recall him telling me on my last day that he would like to see me again some day. Perhaps he expected me to take the initiative and add him, but this sort of thing just drives my anxiety through the roof (and he knew I wasn't good with this sort of communication; he even brought it up during my last day review). It's been over 2 years since then and I just haven't been able to bring myself to add anyone else, even though I did genuinely enjoy my time there.



I guess my question boils down to whether there's a social time limit to this sort of stuff. I've been trying to think about it more rationally and the conclusion that I've drawn is that worse case they just ignore my LinkedIn request? Or perhaps they add me and then ask who I am (which, in my mind, is so much worse than being ignored). It sounds so silly but I just can't seem to overcome it; the more I think about it, the more anxious I get. Has anyone else faced something similar with regards to old co-workers and LinkedIn/ references?"

i live out of state to the colleges i got accepted from, and also the cc i have in mind is also out of state. i want to go out of state because i absolutely fucking hate the current state i live in. im currently planning out what i need to do to successfully transfer to my dream school. like researching what courses can successfully transfer, how im going to pay for an apartment, stuff like that. but as im researching all of this, thoughts of doubt fill my mind. what if i dont get a job to pay for the apartment, what if i dont get an apartment, what if the classes are too hard, what if i dont get a good gpa, what if i get rejected, what if i never pay off my student debt, what if i dont get an internship, what if i dont get a job after college, how am i going to make friends in a place i know no-one.

my familly is insufferable. i have pressure from my dad telling me to not go to college out of state, constantly telling me that i have to golet a job, and that hes not going to support me if i attend an out of state college. i also have pressure from my dad going thru his second divorce. i have pressure from my mom and my step dad always fighting. i have pressure that i put on myself for pursuing my dreams and goals. i have pressure planning out my future. 

i want relief. thats all i want. i want my problems gone. this is the 4th mental breakdown ive had in the past month and its getting worse. i have to decide what im going to do in a week and i still dont have an answer. everyone around me (hs peers and friends) already had their plan and seem to be doing fine. im to the point of making a reddit account to somewhat relieve my mind from my thoughts. 

i want a good future. i want to have a stable home. i want to be free from the fighting. i want to be free from divorce. i want to have a good house. i want a good car. i want a good family. i want to send my kids to a good school. i want a good job. i want to be fucking happy for once in my life; none of that 1 day of happiness bullshit once a month.


i can relief this pressure by two ways.

1. succumb to my dads wishes and do what he tells me.

2. shooting myself in the middle of my fucking head

ive left out a lot of details because i cannot thing straight atm and i just want to get my thoughts out.

 i just dont want to be here anymore.


 tldr: i have big dreams that i want to achieve, but my parents and living conditions are putting pressure on me mentally to the point of suicidal thoughts"

My question now would be whether there still is a reasonable chance to get on the grad program of company B, despite not doing an internship with them?"
o5iu5g,3,2021-06-22,"Got my first job, not enjoying the training or job in general. Keep training or head out ASAP?",somisomiso,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/o5iu5g/got_my_first_job_not_enjoying_the_training_or_job/,"**tl;dr: I feel like a burden at my job, but I still have a few days of training left. I failed my first evaluation, but my boss extended my training period since she didn't want to experience wasting resources on a trainee she wouldn't take in, and she feels that if I put a few more days in, I would probably pass. I feel like I am losing interest in the job and that I am actually wasting more resources by extending training. Should I quit now or hold on till the end of my training period and possibly even take the job?**

This is terribly long, since I also slightly used this post as a form of venting. The tl;dr probably summarizes it enough, but if you want any more detail here it is. 

I'm in my late teen years, and I decided to get a job. Almost a week ago, I was able to somehow land a job at a boba shop I absolutely adored. It's really well-presented aesthetically, and I love boba. I thought it'd be the perfect fit and that I would adjust quickly since I was passionate along with the fact I am usually a fast learner.

Definitely was not the right fit. I am struggling a lot. Most of the processes I am completely inexperienced with and its taking me a lot longer to grasp onto it than both my boss and I would like. The training process also isn't well organized for my taste since it is mostly just shadowing over a person. I think it's because it's more meant for people who do not need thorough explanation -- which is something I needed since I am completely inexperienced. My training process was supposed to last 3 days, and by the 2nd day, I realized I would definitely not be up to the quality they want for a more permanent employee. I decided to just accept getting turned away, but then my boss gave me an unexpected statement. My boss said she recognized my hard work, yet it was very clear I was very inexperienced. My boss decided to try and extend my training period to 7 days because she ""has never failed somebody on training"" and ""really did not want to waste \[her\] resources"" on a trainee she'd throw away.  

I was almost excited to leave. Honestly, during those 3 days, I realized did not like working there as much as I wanted to. While I occasionally did enjoy making new drinks and meeting customers when they were nice on the register, I am very clumsy and have made many mistakes, and the morning shift which I am forced to train at drains all the energy out of me. My family at home all work late hours and do not come home till 2-3 AM and stay up for awhile; hence, I do not go to bed till around the same time as them since otherwise I'll stay up due to noise. Yet, I wake up every morning at 7 AM for work. I only get 2-4 hours of sleep each night. That, on top of how busy it is because the place is understaffed, has me feeling like I am nothing more than a zombie. 

Also, not going to lie, the whole process hurt my ego a lot. While I was not the best worker out of the team or anything, I feel like I was a competent worker and/or helper when I've worked on other internships that are more related to the career I want to go in or project-based classes, but with this one, I just can't seem to do most anything right without making some clumsy mistake. It's clear it's not my forte. 

Hearing my boss's statement about ""wasting resources"" made me feel like a burden when it came to leaving though. Although I wanted to leave, now I feel like I couldn't because I was wasting the efforts and pay she spent on me. But, part of me also feels the complete opposite in the sense that I am wasting resources by extending training more than anything -- especially since I highly doubt I'll improve enough to pass even with the extended period. While I acknowledge I have been improving, the rate of it is just way too slow for it to be considered efficient.

Should I stick through with training? The pros of this is I get the full pay for training, and I may even get a consistent job if I improve enough. The cons of this is I am already losing a lot of interest in the job this early into it, and if I don't improve enough, I'll feel like a burden. 

On the other hand, if I leave early, the pros of it is that I get to get my sleep back, and I'll feel more free. The cons are I would definitely feel like a burden with this option, and I lose the possibility of consistent pay.

I feel like I should definitely note that I am not in a financial situation where I desperately need the money. My family is decently well-off and are very supportive. I just want to have more independence and not have to financially rely as much on my parents as my older siblings do.

I appreciate any help and if there's any additional solution that fits somewhere in between, please feel free to leave it."

I don’t speak or use english in my daily life so sorry if I have a lot of mistakes. As the tittle mentioned, I really feel that I will not succeed in life. I have a bachelor degree in Electronics engineering, I have some experiences as internship and normal jobs. I am currently working as a data center engineering in 12 hours-shifts but I am not learning anything here! All my coworkers keep saying that this job is very underpaid and they do or work as a freelancer/independent. I always do some search for others jobs but it is difficult because of the pandemic and my studies (here electronics is not well paid and there a few jobs). I just started learning web development (first html and css, then javascript) because I have a friend two years older than me and he just bought a flat! He keep saying me that only with 2 years of experience in web development he can recommend me. It's really hard because my mom have an chronic illness and lost her job the last year because the pandemic (she was the main income in my family of 2) so I can't quit my job. I just want to tell all those things because I have some really low energies and anxiety. So Thanks if you read all.

o5jv1f,20,2021-06-22,[RANT] Dreading to Return to Office,savemydumbass,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/o5jv1f/rant_dreading_to_return_to_office/,"I am currently doing an internship and have been picked on since day 1 because of my 'low EQ' that couldn't match with the company's culture. It's been really stressful for me to socialize with everyone in the company as 90% of the stuff I said or did was considered to be wrong.

It'd be so outrageous that even simple things like taking a slice of cake for myself when everyone rejected my offer was wrong (apparently the right thing to do was to force them to accept the cake even if they didn't want it). Another example would be when I would get wrecked and mocked in front of everyone for not helping to clean the table (there were already 4 people doing it).

It's been so stressful that I dared not speak a word in the office and if I were to do so, I'd be so stressed up and afraid that I said something wrong (even if it's things that are said by others in the same scenario; yes it has happened before). And this has affected my parents as well as I've been asking my parents to help vet all my message replies to see if it's ok.

The wfh by default rule has been a blessing for me as I didn't have to interact with anyone, neither do I have to see anyone's faces. But all good things gotta come to an end right (': I have just been asked to return to the office tomorrow. The stress and fear are building back up.

Just need some comfort and maybe advice on what I should do..

The only plans I have are:

1. Pray my appeal to NTU is a success so I can quit and be a good full-time student
2. I've applied to various other companies, but none have replied so far

edit: oh.. forgot to mention that there were some stuffs that I mightve said wrongly which offended people. maybe I was marked since day 1 that's why. but ugh. the fear..."
o5ky9b,4,2021-06-22,"New graduate: should I take any position and just run with it or should I spend time working out what I want, losing out on experience?",Shortbull,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/o5ky9b/new_graduate_should_i_take_any_position_and_just/,"Hi, earlier this month I finished my final university exams and now have began my search for a programming position within CS in London. My degree is just Computer Science BSc, and I must admit I wasn't the best student. If I am lucky, I will just about get a 2:1, if not I'll get a 2:2. TLDR at the bottom.

I have heard it won't matter what the grade is, moreso the fact that I have a degree, but I also didn't do any internship programs. Instead, I started a marketing business in my first year and some web dev during that but it wasn't a great success - I dissolved that business at the start of this month. For the past year I have also been working on an app for shopify that is like a start up in many ways. I believe my grades were impacted by trying to do too much at once, but I learned an awful lot and it is what it is, so no point moping about it.

Now, my question is what do I do. There are so many options - I'm on LinkedIn and have been contacted a few times by recruiters. One of these is by Revolent / Mason Frank I think on training for a Salesforce job (2 years training, then into Salesforce apparently). At first it sounded interesting but I researched it here on Reddit and a lot of people had poor experiences with them so now I'm a bit lost again. 

I don't want to just jump into something I know nothing about, but I also don't want to miss out. My close friend has also just finished his degree in CS (on my course) and got offered a job two weeks back with a fantastic salary (didn't ask to see grades), within the top 4% for our age I believe, which has made me think I am selling myself short. He also worked on that marketing business with me and our grades are fairly similar, so it has me thinking I want a position similar to his but at the same time, I don't want to get unrealistic expectations and pick something random that I might hate just for the salary. Another friend at uni on my course also got a job with a salary higher than my friend, which makes me think I really should be looking for something higher.

Now I am very torn between picking something within the lower(?) range of salaries at around 25-30k, or keep searching for something around the 35k mark. I'm not sure if that's unrealistic to aim for in my position, but I do have a lot of coding experience (studied CS academically for 8 years) but aside from my own ventures, no commercial experience. I have used a lot of languages, I have used Java and Python off and on for about 5 years and HTML/CSS/JS for at least 3, and PHP 2 (both also off and on). 

**TLDR:** I understand this sort of question would have been answered before but I feel like my position is quite unique in the fact that I have gone my own way with businesses rather than with an internship, and so my commercial experience is different - in some ways more valuable, in others less so. 

I am really stuck on whether I should take a lower paid job to just get my foot in the door and start building experience now, or whether I should hold out for a bit for a job with a potentially unrealistic salary. I'm most confident in Java, Python and web dev although I don't want to do just web development as I don't really enjoy it.

My question to people in the industry, especially those based in the UK / London, is 35k a realistic graduate's salary for a software engineering / fullstack position, and going from what I have said about myself, would I be worthy of that sort of salary? I know there are many more factors, but just a rough idea would really help me out. Thanks for reading!"

************

**Bonding**

Dad had walked back inside and shut the front door the moment the Shil’vati officer was in her vehicle. 

I walked back to the garage, worry and anxiety combining to keep me from feeling the worst of my injuries and general soreness. I fished out the omnipad from the rearmost pocket of my backpack and took a deep breath, lifting the bag up to my shoulder and trying to will myself to a state of calmness. I pulled her profile up and tapped ‘unblock,’ and through that single button press, I felt like a ship that had come out the other side of a major storm, battered but still afloat in calmer seas. That the worst of the storm was over. She was back in my life again.

I started writing ‘Are you alright?’ before deleting it.

“Douglas Adams had pointed out that humans had a tendency of asking questions when the answer was obvious. “Oh dear you seem to have fallen down a thirty-foot well, are you alright?” I felt embarrassed to even ask something so idiotic. Surely, six months ago, I’d have typed something like that. At least now I was a little more self-aware. Right?

If she wrote back to me at all then clearly she'd been right, and her bodyguard, Morsh, wouldn't hurt her. Second-guessing her with a question like that would just make it seem like I had no confidence in her. She kept on insisting that she was capable of protecting me, and it would just be insulting toward her if I thought she couldn't protect herself. It would make me look stupid and sound like I wasn't taking her seriously, or worse, that I wasn't listening to her at all. None of that could be further from the truth.

I started staring at the omni-pad in frustration, still not sure how to kick this off.

My thoughts were still spinning from all the events of the day. I knew I was a little rattled- but Amilita had said this award had involved Natalie, and I wanted to know how. Then there was how Amilita’s words made it sound like I was being used as some sort of exemplar for humanity at large. Though I trusted that Natalie cared enough for me, and that whatever argument Natalie was using me to make was to my credit, my curiosity still demanded answers.

G-man- *George*, was right. I had a tendency to choose my words poorly whenever it came to actually being social. 'What did you tell Amilita?' was not a good first message to send someone after unblocking them. Especially after that someone helped me take down that mountain of a woman, even if I was still irritated at being followed around.

I began deleting the message, trying to think of *something* to write, when I saw an indication flash up that she was composing a message. That meant she’d made it out, at least, answering my first aborted attempt at a message.

Natalie was livid, to say the least. “Mom!” She threw her hands around her mother, Morsh in tow. 

""I take it from your expression that it didn't go too well?""

“Morsh picked a fight with Elias and me, then nearly lost!”

“Technically, he attacked me first.” Morsh said casually. “But, yeah, maybe my idea wasn’t too bright. But hey, it sort of worked. You two fought together, and it’s clear the boy really does like you. After that little grappling demonstration you pulled I have a feeling he’ll be all but yours.”

“Humph, the only thing you felt was Elias's knife,"" she murmured angrily.

Morsh’s grin didn’t shift despite the ribbing. “I *really* like that he got up right after he heard you shouting. He didn’t try and run for his own life. He went right for me with that knife, because he thought I hurt you. He cares a lot, and he must be the world’s biggest idiot if he doesn’t see that by now.”

“What *exactly* was the plan, again?” Mrs. Rakten asked curtly.

“I wanted to get the two to work together to take me down. I didn’t expect things to get quite that carried away, but hey, it worked.

“Oh?”

“I just got a message from Amilita. The kid’s apparently fine, and is now home.” She seemed very cavalier, despite it all.

Mrs. Raktan put a fist against her head. “You did say you had a stupid idea, but I thought your threshold for ‘stupid, but actionable,’ was higher than that.”

The grin the bodyguard gave her employer was unrepentant, because Natalie’s device suddenly emitted a series of beeps. The lovestruck teen dug through her bag, fingers fumbling for her omni-pad.

“Well, apparently, *someone* just got un-blocked.” At least Morsh didn’t add a ‘*you’re welcome*.’

A jolt of excitement ran through the teen, fingers shaking, she let out a girlish squeal of delight.

Mrs. Rakten smiled softly, and not just because Natalie wouldn’t be sulking this evening.  “I’m just glad this has been sorted out before this evening’s dinner.” 

Morsh paid attention in Natalie’s stead, since the young girl was clearly no longer mentally present whatsoever. “Oh, right, Mar Sara’s rotation is finally close enough to where you all can eat together again, as a family.”

“I was worried that the fallout from all…this would interrupt that.” The mother realised her daughter wasn’t listening at all. She waved a hand to get her daughter’s attention, but she was way too enraptured by her Omni-pad to even notice the lingering silence, or the hand being waved over her head.

Natalie’s heart flew as she saw the bubble appear, then disappear for a second time on the device. Now her fingers flew across the keyboard furiously, and she hovered over the ‘send’ key, looking up to see Morsh and her mother looking at her, pointing out her rudeness. She was shaken from puzzling over her own text to send. 

“Natalie? It’s a bit rude to be sucked down into your device like that while in the presence of others,” Her mother said, slipping into her ‘proper’ voice, high shil’ tones clipped and precise.

“What? I- oh. Right. Sorry, Mom. May I depart to my room? I do not wish to be rude, however...” Natalie responded as best she could, then swallowed and collected her thoughts. Her mother was a permissive woman, provided Natalie could explain *why* she wanted something adequately, and do so in a proper way. “I don’t want all of what’s just happened to be for nothing.”

“Want some help figuring out what to say?” Morsh offered in Trade shil’.

“I think I’ve had enough of your help, Morsh.”

Mrs. Rakten had to keep from smirking at her Daughter’s answer.

“If you do screw it up, then that’s on you. Let me know if you need me to go play ‘bad girl’ again. That’s the most fun I’ve had since I found this who-... uh… place in...” she drifted off as Mrs. Rakten gave her a withering glare. “Uh, yea, we’ll talk about that kind of fun place when you’re… never mind...” Thankfully, Natalie was once again losing herself in her omnipad, no longer paying any attention to the two adults, and was already headed to her room.

Mrs. Raktan watched her daughter run off to her room with a spring in her step, anger apparently dissipating at the prospect of talking to her 'Earth boy'. “Don’t be late for dinner,” she called out to her daughter. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I heard Dad’s voice and followed it toward the living room. He was on the phone with someone, pacing around the library while the cat watched. He finally took his seat as I came in. The cat took his opportunity to jump into his lap not even a second later. One of dad’s massive hands sank into the cat’s thick fur and idly began running through it, then giving it a few affectionate pats. “- But I think it’ll work out nicely. It’s a matter of arranging their permissions for interstate travel.”

“Dad, I-“ he took his hand off the cat to pick the glass back up, swirling it and then sticking a pointer finger out from the glass, and turning to show the phone as an added gesture of ‘I’m on a call, hold on a sec,’ before turning away from me. I opted to wait for him to finish the conversation.

I heard my sister’s voice on the phone answer him, “I don’t care about your new interns, dad. I just called to say that the concert went okay. Not as good as the one four years ago, the closed borders meant the hotel was shut down and there were way less bands this time. The whole thing was a lot smaller. They even had some shil’ artists, and everyone booed them and it ended the concert when people started throwing bottles at the stage.” 

“Oh no! What did you do? Where did you sleep?”

“Dad, we were *fine*. We camped out in the tent you bought me and rode out the high- from the concert- and we got home this morning. Thanks again for the emergency blanket. Even though we didn’t need it, it really kept us warm.”

“Of course! Do you think I’d tolerate my little Jackie getting hurt? I’m glad you had fun, honey. It’s important to get out there, see things for yourself, but also to stay safe at the same time. How’s the car?” 

Jacqueline hadn’t been around since the time she’d shoved me down a flight of stairs, so Dad took every opportunity to talk with her that he could, whereas I was around for a conversation if he ever wanted to talk with me, more or less whenever.

I glanced down at the omni-pad as it buzzed to see Natalie’s message pop up on the display. *Amilita just checked in to say you made it home safe, I’m glad. How are you, really, though? Are you okay? I hope you’re not still mad.*

I realised Jacqueline and Dad would be talking for a while and excused myself without another word, tapping a reply into the device. Yes, I was irritated, but I knew I had to be careful about the whole ‘tracking’ thing. If I didn’t handle this right, it was *possible* she’d start just doing it whether I wanted her to or not, especially if she was concerned with my well-being. 

*A little, but we can talk about it. I know why you went out to find me. I understand it was for my own good. I do need to talk with you about boundaries, though. Now that that’s said, I’m glad you made it out, too. Morsh is okay, too, right? I know she’s important to you. I’m sorry I got so angry and scared.*

There. That would do. Convey all the important bits without being *too* upset. It was time for that shower I’d promised myself. 

Natalie rolled back and forth on her bean bag chair. He was happy she was okay! And he...was scared? He’d been so fierce and fearless, and violent. The idea of him being *scared* during all that made her want to wrap him up in a big hug and protect him. Natalie looked up at the window showing the late afternoon sun, and froze. She had to think of something else to say, though, and quickly, before she lost him! 

*She was provoking us for sure. I won’t say I’m glad she got stabbed, but I totally understand. Thanks to the medical droids, she’s already back home and good as new. Got Anything big planned for the rest of your day?* Natalie winced at her own message after sending it, but couldn’t bring herself to be mad. Sure, the first part was fine- they’d cornered a boy, and the only surprise was how well he could fight. But the second part of her message was so dull-sounding! But maybe… maybe he was up to something? She dug around in her bag. She’d save *that* for if the conversation started drying up.

\*\*\*\*\*

It took a minute for the bathroom off the hallway that Jacqueline and I had shared to warm up and I caught a look of myself in the mirror. I looked a little bit less like the scared boy I’d seen before. But I still saw fear there. Here- at home. Why? 

I stripped down and stared into the mirror, checking myself over for bruises and scrapes, and trying to mentally catalogue them until I heard my omni-pad chirp again. I wrote back.

*Thanks for being understanding, I know the two of you are close*. *Getting in the shower now. Do you want to talk for a minute? I can’t exactly wash while typing*.

\*\*\*\*\*

Natalie stared at her omni-pad, then dropped it into her lap, both fists raised in the air. “JACKPOT!”

She had only just hit ‘Call’ when she froze up from a sudden spike of fear. Had she hit ‘call’ too quickly after? Would he think she was a creep? Her hand flew for the ‘end call’ button but he’d already answered. Natalie’s mouth dried out, unsure what to say.

“Hello?” He asked, sounding a little uncertain, the sound of running water splashing against porcelain filling her room. Natalie looked over to her door and tapped the command to lock her door to ‘airtight’ and changed a few settings to prevent feedback. 

\*\*\*\*\*

“Hey,” Her voice sounded nervous. Was she afraid I was going to hang up on her? I supposed it had been a while since we’d talked without me leaving in some urgency or telling her to go away. Deciding to change the tone for once from her being the one doing all the engaging, I kicked off the conversation.

“Are you alright? You and Morsh were tangled up. I wanted to say ‘thank you’ for, well, protecting me, and, well, extend my gratitude.” I cringed at my own clumsiness. Not only had just fallen right into the pit Douglas Adams has laid, I’d even managed to make it sound way too formal. I tried to think of something more ‘normal’ to say- and came up short. Should I have also apologised for stabbing Morsh, on top of it? How would I even phrase *that*? Should I even apologise? She’d cornered me. 

I didn’t hear anything back, so I grabbed the footstool and put the device flat on top of it, and then dropped my pants and turned to pull away the curtain and sample the temperature, then stepped inside.

\*\*\*\*\*

Natalie watched, eyes wide. His pad was *ancient* by all standards- and he’d somehow turned the camera on when he’d set it down. Albeit it was pointed straight at the ceiling, there was the *possibility* of seeing something. She could hear the water’s pitter patter change as he splashed and washed himself clean. But for now, her imagination showed her what her eyes couldn’t. 

\*\*\*\*\*

The unfamiliar but pleasantly fruity scent of the new scented soap bar mixed in with the steam. I held it tight and ran my hands down my sides, over my belly and over the strange lumps of muscle that had formed, across the still unfamiliar feeling of a concave shape from my flanks to where the V met, and scrubbed intensely while she spoke. 

“Yeah, no problem,” I heard her say back after a few moments, voice sounding strained. “I’ve gotten Morsh to promise me on her House’s Honor to not hurt you, ever again. ‘She’s not that bad- and I want to reiterate, no, my culture is not like that, not really. Not all of us. We’re okay and we’re home now.”

I paused in scrubbing to think about it. A House Vow was a big deal. Even if Morsh wasn’t the most reputable person, the two had always seemed a lot closer than just ‘bodyguard’ and ‘assignment.’ As gruff and tough a front as Morsh liked to put up, it went beyond money with those two. I heard her add, quietly: “I’m certainly not like that. I mean, I like y- boys- guys- I mean? Men? But, not like she said- or not in the way she said. I mean, I like-.”

She sounded like she was beating herself up about it. 

“I understand,” I cut her off gently. “My culture isn’t perfect. I could express a lot of elements of it that would make it, or me, sound pretty irredeemable too. You stood up for yourself, and you stood up for me, and your culture, and I think that’s admirable. Sometimes I feel I’ve had a bad exposure to Shil’ culture’s interest in boys, but then I think to myself: ‘I’ve gotten to know a fantastic shil’ girl.’ It’s things like that where I know what your culture and people can be.”

Silence on the other end lingered for a bit, and I worried I’d said something wrong. Had I been too forward?

”You, uh, you came up in conversation today with Amilita, by the way.” she sounded...bashful. “Kind of in the same way like you just talked about me, but about humans.”

“Thank you for sending her to check on me. It was really…” I fought against the urge to point out how ineffectual her ‘check in on me at my home’ strategy was “…thoughtful.” *And it’s the thought that counts.* I knew I’d sounded awkward. I had spent days working on oratory skills, imitating some of the past masters so I could speak to hundreds. Now I was falling apart talking to a single girl my own age, feeling heat on my face that had nothing to do with the shower’s temperature. 

I’d picked up a few pamphlets from Nurse Schumer and found myself surprised at the amount of hair I was growing. Sure the book *told* me about ‘what to expect,’ and ‘changes,’ among other euphemistic language, but it didn’t really strike home for me until I felt like a stranger in my own body.

“We were talking about culture, and how most of the humans she was interacting with don’t have much of what we’d call ‘human ‘culture’. You sort of came up, since you taught me a lot of it. I think she must have inferred that you have it. I don’t think she’s wrong, though.”

“That’s nice of you to say. Oh, by the way, do you know what a Moon Award is? Or Moon Medal. Service Moon Medal?” I shrugged- they’d tell me about it eventually.

I listened for Natalie’s reply as I finished scrubbing and put the bar of soap back on its shelf and reached for the shampoo bottle- then stopped to massage my calf muscles loose. They were still stiff and sore from both the day’s abuse and the beginnings of yet another growth spurt. Stretching only accomplished so much. I thought I heard her cough.

“Are you okay over there?” I asked. She didn’t answer for a few seconds.

I reached for the shampoo bottle and felt how light it was. Empty. 

I’d already cut it with water to get the last dregs out. I tossed the tall plastic bottle with the grinning girl with flowers in her hair into the stainless bucket trash can, gracelessly stepping out onto the tile, being careful to not slip. I grabbed a towel from the side, wrapping myself, and opened the door to the bathroom closet.

“What was that!?” Natalie asked, alarmed.

“Throwing out an old shampoo bottle. I’d just asked if you were okay, and you went really quiet. I thought you might have hung up.”

“No, I was just surprised,” she replied. “Uh, yeah, that medal, it’s kind of a big deal.”

A wall of plastic faces printed on plastic bottles smiled down at me. Dozens of lotions, cleansers and scrubs, and a jumble of strange devices cluttered the shelves and even the floor. These little artefacts of my sister’s time at the house remained well after she’d left for boarding school, and from each visit home.

“Yeah?” I asked.

While waiting for Natalie to respond, I briefly wondered where all of these came from- the ‘how’ and the ‘why,’ and the sheer wastefulness of these dozens of bottles, before shrugging. It wasn’t *my* money. I was, however, the happy beneficiary of her wastefulness. Not *all* the items had chemically broken down yet, and I’d made good use of the more stable ones she’d left behind, spending an evening with Google and YouTube to fill in the gaps from Larry’s half-remembered instructions. 

I may have had some money for now, but things had been hairy there for a bit. Literally, in the case of shaving away the first bits of peach fuzz. A quick trip to the shops with Larry had helped me get ‘squared away.’ He seemed surprised that my parents hadn’t been teaching me much about this stuff, and had insisted that we go on a shopping trip to the local [Happy Harry’s pharmacy](https://i.imgur.com/C8AG8YA.jpg).

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Natalie couldn’t believe it. The *Service Moon Medal*? She’d had to grab her tusk and forgot all about his showering for a moment- until she’d caught just a moment of him moving past the camera, anyways. This day was insane. Genuinely insane.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

“Yeah…” I heard Natalie say. “I’ll do a little reading, first, and tell you the rest.”

I reached out past Jacqueline’s spare curling iron and face mask for the last of her old bottles of shampoo. Same exact smiling face as the one in the shower, same flowers, and unsurprisingly, it was barely used. I made a mental note of the brand’s name for the next shopping trip. I’d not trusted myself to buy the right kind, and since Jacqueline’s fine hair was a lot like mine, it had seemed smart to raid from her excess supply to start fixing up my hair. Though I did remember at the time, Larry had pointed out hers was much better kept, courtesy in part to an array of brushes and combs.

When I’d pointed out the car grease under his nails and that he was hardly one to talk, he’d simply laughed and clapped me on the back, staining the old t-shirt I’d worn to combat drills that day. He’d said it was an inescapable part of the work he did, but that I didn’t have that excuse, and we’d bought my first razor shortly after. I stepped back into the shower and started massaging my scalp. 

I was startled out of my thoughts when Natalie coughed again. “We had a bit of a time explaining human culture to a particularly unpleasant Lieutenant we sat with over lunch. Amilita looked pretty shaken to realise all the policies she was working on were setting her back and really pissing people off- and for good reasons. I wonder if the medal’s being assigned for reasons.”

I applied the facial scrub and let it soak into the pores, and turned my face into the water to let it all wash off as I wetted my hair. I felt my blood run cold. “What sort of policies?” 

“It’s something I didn’t know about until today, and I couldn’t stay quiet about it. I kind of lost my temper at the Lieutenant. Then Morsh suggested we go find you-”

“About that,” I said. “No more tracking me, ever. Okay? Not for any reason.”

“We weren’t tracking, we...just…”

“I mean it, Natalie. I know you care, and that it was...” *It’s the thought that counts*. “...thoughtful and from a place of caring, but really, please, I’m going to have to ask that you never do that again.”

I finished counting down in my head the amount of time that the conditioner ought to set for and washed it out, then turned off the shower.

“I won’t. I promise.”

“Alright, gotta shave for now. Can’t really talk during that, kind of still getting the hang of it. Can we talk later?”

“Yeah, sure,” she said. “This was...nice. Thanks!”

Before I could even respond, she’d ended the call.

I walked over to the bathroom mirror and began working on shaving, then quickly applying aftershave.

I heard the omni-pad ding again and I looked down at it- an image had loaded and my heart froze in my chest. *The Dagger!* 

*‘Forget something*?’ the message read. 

A thousand different possible responses flooded my mind but I couldn’t bring myself to pick one. The ball was still in her court. Was this her way of saying she knew? Was this her saying she had figured me out, without tripping whatever monitoring system might be in place? I didn’t know enough, dammit. I wasn’t even sure how to respond, and thankfully, yet another text followed.

‘*I think it fell out of your bag when Morsh threw it at you. You wanna come get it?*’’ 

Was that some kind of veiled threat? I forced myself to relax and looked at myself in the mirror, eyeing the giant bruise Morsh had left near my sternum. No, Natalie had just given her all to keep her bodyguard at bay. She’d thrown herself at her bodyguard, and then been thrown around by the aforementioned bodyguard. I let out a deep sigh of relief as the tension faded from me. No, Natalie was not out to ‘get’ me.

*Thanks for getting that for me.* I forced myself to take another calming breath in. *Just keep it safe and with you for now, okay?*

*******

**Dinner**

I ran downstairs to the chime of ‘dinner’s ready!’ I knew it wasn’t really ready- at least, not yet. Dad was still cooking, a fresh refill of his glass on the counter next to the stove as he stirred away at the wok.

Mom had come in and set her leather purse down on the table, scanning the room as I collected the silverware and napkins to help set the table.

“I had a hard time parking. I can’t even open the passenger door in the garage. There’s these *bicycles* there.”

I looked up from my silverware, “Sorry, mom.” I’d put them off to the side as far as I was able. Her own bike was at the back of the garage, gathering dust. “Where should I move them to?”

“I don’t know,” she said. “Maybe the basement?” That would be a pretty hard trek through the muddy side of the house, with three sets of doors. Without the integrated baskets that the commuter bike had, the road bike wouldn’t be so hard to fit. But the commuter bike would be another story. At my face, I could tell she was going to start in on me, so I picked up the silverware and dipped out of the room to start setting the table. Mom thought the better of following me in, and decided to finish unpacking from her day.

A few minutes later, dinner was ready.

“Son,” Dad said. I looked up from my plate. It felt good, being acknowledged, even if the tone was one of concern. “Are you seeing someone?”

“Ah, well,” I said quietly. I hadn’t expected to be first up to talk about my day.

At this bit of prompting, mom could no longer contain herself, a smile stretched over her sallow pale skin, with the rosacea the only color left in her face. “There’s a sweet girl I was briefly introduced to. Go on, tell him.”

“There’s this exchange student at school.” 

Mom scoffed.

“From space,” She added, exasperated at my lack of details and ability to tell things to her satisfaction.

I briefly considered what might have happened if Mom had been home to meet Amilita instead of Dad. She’d probably have left the stoop at the very least, tried to insert herself into the conversation, horning her way in, and move me out of it before I could do anything ‘rude,’ or possibly even apologising for me, and any presumed trouble I’d caused before she’d even heard anything about it.

“From space,” I confirmed. Dad sat up a little straighter in his chair and looked at me, his eyes searching.

“Well,” he said, thinking for a bit. “That’s...good, son.” The word rolled off his tongue oddly, as if he wasn’t used to calling me that.

“Wouldn’t you prefer someone your own age?”

“That wasn’t her,” I groaned. Did he have *no* faith in me to protect myself?

“The entire time, you were speaking that weird language, so how was I supposed to know?” He was slurring a bit, and took a whole second to aim his fork’s jab into his slice of steak.

“She was just checking in on me after the school incident today. I thought you knew about it. Everyone’s parents came and picked up their-.”

“I didn’t know you spoke any Shil’” mom said, surprised, and running over me as I spoke. 

I didn’t think to ask why I hadn’t been picked up. They must not have gotten the call, or maybe they just assumed I was supposed to catch a school bus. Had I left the right contact details? I couldn’t remember filling out any paperwork about it. 

“I speak a little,” I confessed. I didn’t want mom to start getting ideas or to start getting the way she sometimes would when she sensed blood in the water. I felt like I knew why she was showing an interest. It wasn’t in *me,* though. It never was.

“What did they want?” Dad asked. “Just to check in on you?” He seemed dubious that anyone would check in on me. I had to agree with the sentiment. Sending out a Lieutenant Colonel at all to do what a letter or call might have was excessive. But it did bring to mind a question- just how powerful *was* the Raktan family? 

“Well?” Mom asked. 

“I guess so? I sort of… pulled her out of school today. There was an incident. Some people weren’t really enthusiastic to have her around, and tried to beat her and the teacher up. I got her out, though, and the officer- she wanted to make sure I got out okay, since Natalie was worried about me.” 

“Well, that’s sweet. Isn’t that nice, Bill?”

“I suppose,” he said quietly.

“Isn’t it?” Mom’s voice took on an edge of raw aggression, trying to browbeat him into saying how nice it was with convincing enough enthusiasm. Enough to where he’d be happy about his son’s hypothetical, just-discovered interspecies relationship. 

Maybe dad had envisioned me dating human girls and having children of our own someday, or having friends, or going to parties without being so unpopular I got into fights. Maybe it was the lack of the above that drove him to drink in the first place. I wanted to repeat the silent vow I made whenever this routine played itself out- that I’d work harder to make friends. That I’d look harder to find a girl I could approach, and then talk with her, and hopefully not fuck it up, bring her home. That, from all that, he’d stop drinking out of shame of his son, and maybe be proud of me, and see that I was ready for him to support me more. Maybe he would buy me clothing that fit outside of just my birthday. I hadn’t had the heart to tell him that I wasn’t a size ‘small’ anymore, and that almost nothing from my birthday actually fit me right to begin with, let alone after my most recent growth spurt. 

I was shaken from it as he spoke, “yes, very nice,” before slouching back down into his usual position of the evening, his head starting to hang a little as drowsiness took hold. Of all alcoholic fathers, I suppose I was lucky insofar that he wasn’t gripped by rage or violence, nor even snide commentary the way some were. He just got sleepy. 

I poked at the food on the plate idly in the awkward silence. 

“What are you doing!?” Mom hissed at me, and I felt my eyes snap over to her. “She sees you eating like that, you’ll be lucky she doesn’t run away. I guess you haven’t been eating together?”

“Sorry.” I put my elbows back under the table and fixed the way I was holding my knife and fork.

I had a whole bag of wishes for my family, but then, maybe we all did. I wasn’t exactly the best son.

“Explains the uniform,” dad piped up- and then hiccuped, sagging further into the dining room chair.

“Oh, I was meaning to ask about that,” Mom asked. “You came home that one evening and looked so sharp in it. Also, is that a new t-shirt? Where did you get the money for that?”

I’d gotten one of the new ones- the fight had stretched the other one, and it had a giant, clay-orange mud stain on it from where I’d hit the ground.

I shrugged. “There was a business thing where we sold-”

“-You’re not dealing drugs, are you?”

“No, mom. Natalie and I worked together for a bit.”

“Ohhh,” she sat back. Now that I was working for the aliens, suddenly, I was above reproach? “That’s like today. We had an inspector fail one of the patients on a drug test. They kept swearing they were clean, but they got taken to the rehab centre, and it’s *in space*. I almost want to take drugs, just so I’ll get to go up!” She joked, but neither dad nor I laughed.

“It’s just aliens everywhere today, isn’t it?” He asked me, conspiratorially.

Mom looked insulted, and her southern twang came out a bit thicker. “It’s only the most exciting thing to happen since… ever, Bill. I happen to like being a part of it, is all.” 

Lost in thought, I began to let my mind wander. What would happen, if Mom put herself in the crosshairs of all this? What if she did something embarrassing at the event? She was *far* from a major player, but she was so eager to sell us out. How many people were like her- no real prospect of moving up the alien hierarchy but willing to exploit their own family just to get a half-step ahead and up? What would happen to her, if she succeeded and rose to some level of prominence, and the insurgency grew more powerful at the same time?

“I’m kind of mad at her.”

“What for?”

“I don’t know,” I said. *Gee, Mom, I’m a terrorist.* I couldn’t exactly explain it- not even to my own family. But there was something about it all which was grinding at me.

What if they learned about the event and decided to strike? It fit the pattern of our attacks- a brown noser trying to climb the ranks by fouling the efforts of the insurgency to preserve human culture. A human embracing the aliens and their way of life. Hell, Vaughn had suggested attacking an event of vaguely the same sort.

Something in my stomach turned, and I was troubled by the thought. I fought the urge to poke at my food again. “Dad, how was your-“

Dad’s head was already starting to hang a bit.

“There he goes again,” Mom said snidely. Dad jerked back up, bumping the silverware across the ceramic plate with a screech and clatter.

 “What? I’m awake. I heard you.”

“Oh yeah? Then what did I just say?” Mom challenged- even though I’d been the one to speak. Embarrassingly, dad then stammered out something about the homelessness situation. 

I glanced at Mom to see if she had meant it as some sort of trap to nail dad that it had been me speaking, but she didn’t even comment nor spare me a glance. 

The two started into their usual argument- him insisting he didn’t have a problem, and mom insisting that he did. The two argued just to argue, never to resolve anything. As long as a dialogue went on, then nothing would get done. Adults were incredibly illogical and set in their ways. It’s what made them predictable. 

I pushed the plate away, my steak only half-finished. 

“What’s wrong? Food not good enough for you?” Mom asked.

“No, just… going to check on something.” I pushed the chair back, and walked toward the house’s extension, past where the old side door used to be. To my right was the bathroom. To the left was the door to the garage. Checking my pocket to make sure I still had it with me, I unlocked my omni-pad and sat on the toilet.

*Hey*

*Hey Elias!* *Just getting ready for dinner. What’s up?*

*Would you happen to be free after dinner?*

The message came back immediately. *Of course!*

*You’re up near Yorklyn, right?*

*Granogue.* 

I knew the area. The DuPonts famously had a mansion out near there, along with like, a thousand acres. That part of the Brandywine Valley was beyond scenic, and right next to the State Park. My device flashed again: *Do you want my address?*

*Yes Please. I’ll see you in a couple hours?*

A GPS coordinate flashed up on the screen. *See you soon!*

I tucked the omni-pad into my pocket and ran from the bathroom to the garage. I slapped the garage door open button and sprinted for the commuter bike, rolling it down the driveway and throwing a leg over it, and was halfway down the driveway by the time the door had finished opening.

Running away from my problems hadn’t worked out so well for me today. But maybe I could try outriding them.

I’m currently studying for and taking actuarial exams and really struggling to bring myself to enjoy it. As an actuarial major I have a strong background in math, as well as a solid background in data science / machine learning, and I even added on a CS major my senior year to see if that was something I might want to pursue further. 

I ended up just graduating with the AS degree and getting out, but I can’t help but feel I’ve made a mistake. I’m very interested in computers / technology and I feel like I messed up by not going into software engineering in college. 

How difficult would it be to make a career change? I’m planning on getting a job in the next month or two (doesn’t have to be SE right away). Also, how would I go about this? At the moment I can’t really afford to go to college again. Would it even be possible to get an SE job without a degree in the field? My girlfriend is currently working as an intern for a very large computer technology company, as well. 

CS/SE is definitely something I am much more passionate about so any advice would be greatly appreciated."

I’ve always been working late and sometimes over the weekend to catch up with the rest and hope to get promotion within 2 years frame. The thing is, I do not enjoy the tech industry nor doing sales. Doing it because of job stability and it pays pretty well (also support my family). 

Today, I had a 1:1 with my manager where he was questioning me a on list of customers and found out that I haven’t been calling down every customer (emailed all, only selectively called those I find have the potential). Then he started mentioning this is the basic task I have to cover, and that any intern would have done a better job.


I have a mixed feelings - scared that I’ll get fired. On the other hand, kinda relief a little that this will be a big push for me to find alternative career path.
Not sure what should I do next.. clear the backlogged work and speak to my manager?  Or just get a new job - which I have no idea what I want to do either and pretty sure a new career wouldn’t support my fam or my brother’s abroad master fees"

However, upon returning I have discovered that the company is not at all the company that I knew and loved during my internship. There has been major discrepancies between what I agree to and what I am experiencing. For example, I was informed my first project would be thirty minutes from my home, and was given a week's notice upon starting that my location would instead be multiple hours from home, and that I would be given living allowances to cover the costs of my hotel and travels. I then discovered that I was only being allowed 1/3 of what I was told I would receive for living expenses, and no travel compensation. This results in me paying out of pocket for many expenses associated with the new location, and I am now only able to be home with my partner and pets one or two days per week. 
My mental health and my wallet have been taking a toll, and I am desperate to find a job closer to home with a better work/life balance. 
With that being said, I am also afraid of employers looking me over due to the short tenure of this job on my resume, and for the long term ramifications of having a short tenured job or employment gap on my resume. 
I have also never looked for work while currently employed, and have no idea how to go about the reference and interview process when I work during typical interview hours and have not accrued time off. 
Any advice on what to do and how to go about this is greatly appreciated, and I thank you in advance!"
o5rpzo,1,2021-06-22,Just need some advice on whatever it is I'm feeling,throwawaayhelp_,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/o5rpzo/just_need_some_advice_on_whatever_it_is_im_feeling/,"I'm 16, and I'm the type of person that is never really nervous or anxious about anything. I can (or could) talk to anyone and everyone just fine independent of the situation, I never felt nervous during presentations, whatever it was, I felt fine. But now... I feel strange. Nervous? Anxious? Depressed? I'm not sure. I haven't cried for as long as I can remember, because I've never felt a reason to.

I'm on the second year of school and we have mandatory internships, it's a total of 6 weeks this year, and 12 weeks next year. I started my internship in a place I didn't know, it was over 2 hours of public transportation, and I have to admit that this was completely my fault. I had an idea of the place I was going in my head and just decided not to look up a lot of information on it because what I thought I knew about it was how I thought it was. It was the complete opposite. I was alone 2+ hours away from home, surrounded by hundreds of people that were scurrying around like cockroaches anywhere I went, and I was alone. I felt uncomfortable, nervous, anxious, for the first time in a long, long time.

The first week I felt bad, but it hadn't really escalated all that much just yet. The second week, I had what I can only describe as a panic attack when I got home - my chest ached from trying to hold in the crying from how nervous and anxious I felt, and my mom decided to call up my teachers and tell them I wasn't feeling well and that I needed some sort of help. Instead of going to my actual internship, my teachers made a ""imaginary"" internship at school, and that's what I'm currently doing, 3 weeks into the 6 week internship.

Even though this is better than where I was before, I am alone at school, most of my teachers aren't there, none of my friends are there, and I stay there for 9 hours a day not even working because I just can't muster up the strength to do it. I only feel like crying, and have only felt like crying for the last 2 weeks. I've cried a lot, I've made my friends and family worried, and they try to help me as best as they can, but I still don't feel like myself.

Yesterday I went to the doctor's and the doctor gave me some tips, stuff I can do to help myself, and perscribed me some Bio Stress-relief Pills, which I have been taking 3 a day of. However, even though I feel slightly less nervous now, I still have this thought inside me that I don't feel well, and that all I can do to feel somewhat better is go home and cry while I'm with my family.

I still don't feel right and I don't know how much longer I can keep forcing myself to go to school and forcing myself to not just cry for 6 hours when I get home until I eventually fall asleep. I want these pills to take effect. I'm forcing myself to go to school, take my dogs out on walks and eat healthy like my mother and doctor have been telling me to do for 2 weeks, but I still hardly feel any better.

Knowing myself, I think I need a break from school work, I just need to stay at home and chill, or go outside with my friends, but I don't have a reason to miss school for a week or whatever it is I need, and any minute, hour or day that I don't go to school, I'll have to catch up on some other day, even if it's justified.

Even worse, even if I start feeling better after this year's internship is over, I have one that is two times as long next year, and next year I won't have the chance to go to school instead. Aditionally, after I finish school, I don't know how it'll be to work because if I feel this bad just going on an internship, I can't imagine getting an actual job...

I need help on how to improve, and especially how to not break down like this next year, because I most definitely won't be able to handle it (mentally) next year if this happens again."

&amp;#x200B;

Education

B.A. in Speech-Language Pathology, pretty useless unless you have a master's you can't get any job in the field. I chose this because it seemed *practical*, and I wanted to help others. I realized after volunteering for years both during and after graduation that I did not want to work in the helping professions (physical therapy, speech therapy, healthcare etc.). It's just not for me, although out of all the populations I worked with I loved working with children (elementary-age) the most. 

&amp;#x200B;

Work Experience

My last two internships have been at NGOs. The first was as a social media manager, my job was all over the place which I love - I also created some PPT presentations for conferences, made presentations with orphanages, again loved interacting with the children.

In the second internship, I worked as a community impact coordinator -- I did everything from event planning, 'customer' service, grant applications, event analytics. My boss could somehow tell I had an **eye** ***for*** **art** and asked me to create some digital posters/content for events, and I just kind of lost myself in the work. I have never been so excited to work in any role until this one. I learned pretty fast how to use Adobe and other programs to create content, and it got to the point that the marketing branch (which I didn't even know we had) kept asking me for help with their digital content even though I wasn't trained in any of this like they were, I picked it up pretty easily. 

Attendees would also compliment my event artwork. I could spend hours working and editing, even if my boss told me to scrap and start over because they had to change it, I wouldn't get upset, criticism didn't bother me - I wanted to do the best job. I wanted to improve, I took all criticism with grace like it might as well have been a compliment. 

Growing up

I was known for being artistic - other kids would ask me to help them write fictional stories for class and they'd get good grades and praise from their teacher - this happened in every school I went to in every country I lived in. I remember one time I wrote a story for a friend and the teacher asked her to read it in front of the class and everyone only praised the parts of the story that I wrote. This was the same teacher that would always accuse me of plagiarizing my work with no evidence, she couldn't believe I wrote it (I was considered goofy so I couldn't possibly write anything serious or deep), but she praised my work when written for other people (but that's a long story, and probably one of the reasons I'm so insecure about my art and didn't go into a creative field). I'd also make drawings for my friends as gifts and they would tell me someone tried to buy it off them. I still get some people who knew me back then asking me to create art for children's books and other projects they have going on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Interests

\- I still draw sometimes but in a more cartoony style. Think Tasia M S

\- I gave up writing a long time ago when I decided to not pursue a creative career but it's my first love

\- I enjoy working with youth and people in general, I love collaborating with others

\- I love understanding how people think, that's why I love meeting people especially from different cultures/backgrounds

\- I love to travel, most of my friends are foreign, I'd love to work with global charities. 

\- I love learning international cuisines and watching shows about other cultures.  Another activity, I lose myself in is cooking. 

\- I took some coding classes and again find myself in love with it, but mostly just like making pretty web pages. I'm still a beginner. 

\- I took a UX course and it just wasn't for me but I enjoyed the UI aspects the most."
o5t91c,5,2021-06-22,I want to rant about my piss-poor HR-recruiter experience from over 10 years ago and see if anyone else has experienced similar,dysonsphere87,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/o5t91c/i_want_to_rant_about_my_pisspoor_hrrecruiter/,"Since we all usually inevitably go through the process of dealing with recruiters and HR, I'm a bit curious to know what other people have run across in terms of this that was mind-boggling or ridiculous?

I have one for HR, and one for recruitment that I'd like to share.

**HR Blip**: DOD company (which I will not name) who I worked for previously. They were my first job out of college. I left them after a year or so and went to work for a large company in the private sector that doesn't deal with government contracts. I worked as a junior developer on a team with only very senior people, and I worked as their DevOps individual as well as learned how to write Scala / C++ and had a lot of good coding practices instilled into me and great mentorship that I value to this day. 

Left original company where I made $61k a year. Joined new company @ $75k a year.

Promoted first year - $91k a year, and bonus bumped to 11% (from 7%). 

Pay increase second year - $100k salary now. Also received a nice stock grant worth about $30k per year.

Promoted third year - Senior developer now, making $115k a year, and a 16% bonus. 

Being a big company there was some writing on the wall that our team may get axed soon, so I started looking. I loved my manager at this job and the fact that he let us know what was going on and everything as well as provided stellar references. I decided to apply to old company as my old manager (who I wasn't super close to) there reached out. Applied to equivalent (senior) role. Talked to the recruiter (who was an HR person actually) and told them I would absolutely not join (because it required relocation) for at the very least, $130k a year, and some kind of annual bonus. Recruiter/HR said no problem. I interview twice on the phone, and go in for a 4 hour long interview that was 3 hours away, which I drove. I got through the whole process. HR called me saying they were constructing an offer letter for me. 

I received the offer, excitedly open it. $75k / year, no annual bonus, 2 weeks PTO, no WFH, and $700 of relocation assistance (sign on bonus) paid after 90 days of employment. I say there must be some kind of mistake. He ""agrees"", and talks to the boss who wrote up my offer. The boss says, ""He only made $61k here, so we can't justify paying him what he asked for. And he only has 3 years of experience."" - The irony here is that I worked for them as an intern for 3 years, with the last year being full time since I only had my senior design class. When they were selling me the internship they sold it as ""you will get real applicable experience to add to your resume."" As a matter of fact, my job changed very, very little from internship to full time. The only change was that I now had benefits. When I told them they should count my internship as it is directly applicable to their business, they said they can't. 

Overall I don't see salary as a huge deal where I need to keep all my cards close to home and negotiate as high as I can. I come up with a number I want, and present it to whoever is recruiting me, and if they can meet it, we proceed.. if not, we don't. I've found salary negotiations to cause me personally some undue stress and having the ""number"" in mind has always benefitted me and my overall happiness greatly. That said, to have someone agree to my number, then undercut it by over 50% (when you count the bonus and stock) is not only insulting; It's a HUGE waste of my time. 3 hours were wasted each way driving, 4 hours of interviewing on site, having to stay overnight somewhere, and the wasted time on phone calls with recruiters and engineers. 

**Recruiters:** I don't have any crazy stories here. I do get some funny noise on Linkedin. I recall a couple of years ago receiving a message on linked in for a relocation-required, contract-to-hire ""junior jenkins engineer"" in the Bay Area, with salary ranging around $60k (at a point I was making $300k, and living in Texas). I found the idea of doing a contract-to-hire in the bay area for what is the bare minimum I would expect to be the salary for the career as a whole, not even in the bay area (wtf lives there on $60k a year?) to be pretty laughable. Not harmful though, since no time wasted except the recruiter's. I enjoyed the laugh."

After graduation, I moved cities to go into an extensive training program for this company for 10 months. As the training program goes on you start to look for a more permanent position within the company at a different site that needs an engineer and apply as they come up.

During my training program, I missed my family and friends and struggled with my anxiety and depression. The job was great, my coworkers were great, but I was miserable outside of work and wanted to go back home to be closer to family.  

I was hoping to find a position with this company back in my home city by the time the program was over but nothing came up. So I found a job with company B (a very small company with about 15-20 people) back in my home city. I’m feeling much happier and my anxiety is much better now that I’m back with my family and friends.

I started this week and it’s not really what I expected. Very strange environment and much different from the fast paced manufacturing plants that I’m used too. Plus the pay is lower and the benefits are not as good. 

My boss from from my training program with company A gave me a call yesterday evening and told me about a position that was open at the site I was an intern at  in my home city. I sent in an application and called my supervisor from when I was an intern. He was happy to hear from me and said he would talk to Hr and see about getting me an interview. 


At this point I’m just trying to see how things play out and see if they even want me back. I didn’t want to leave company A because they treated me well and I like what I was doing.  The pay would be about 15-20% higher with company A also. 


Would it be wrong for me to leave company B so soon? They know from my interviews that I didn’t want to leave my other job for anything other than personal reasons. Company B is an At-Will company also so I don’t know if it would be a big deal if I left this soon anyways. 

I’m early in my career and I’m not trying to make any missteps but also take care of my financials. 

Thank you for any advice"

o5uxpi,2,2021-06-22,Is a move into computer programming/IT a viable career move for me?,DaNibbles,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/o5uxpi/is_a_move_into_computer_programmingit_a_viable/,"I am not sure if this is the best place to post this, but I am kind of at a loss on how to approach this. I am in a good career currently but my boss and one of my only coworkers in a similar role are about to retire in the next year I am not sure I want to continue working with my current employer when they do.

&amp;#x200B;

Some background and context - I am a 32 yr old male with a bachelor's of mechanical engineering from a top state university in that field. I live in the Midwest in a low cost of living area of the country. I got a job with a national HVAC company and have worked for them ever since graduating. I spent about 5 years in design engineering at one of their manufacturing facilities and then switched to a sales office about 6 years ago. My current role was advertised to me as being half customer focus and half job estimates, however it essentially is me doing estimates full time. For the past few years I made it pretty clear that I have no desire to estimate full time and have seen little progress on making that transition from management. I don't really blame them for it because the situation is complex (if people want more info why I can explain) but at this point if I don't do some more drastic measures it is clear nothing will change. On top of that with the other estimator set to retire it will only make the chances of changing my role even less likely.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the positives with the current job and staying:

* I have good networks and experience in the industry. 
* I make just over 100k (salaried) with bonuses with very good retirement and medical benefits.
* I have 4 weeks paid vacation and work is very flexible with running errands, sick time, flex time, etc.  My time isn't tracked, but sometimes I will work weekends or late nights if we have deadlines. (no overtime opportunity)
* I get to work remotely full time since the pandemic (they sold our sales office so even if they want me back in the office I no longer have a desk there). This is very important for any future jobs in that I have decided being able to have access to my family and 2 young daughters is more important than earning more money.
* The job is isn't very stressful anymore now that I am at a point where I have it down pretty well.

&amp;#x200B;

Some drawbacks:

* The job is tedious and boring. 
* I have a good amount of vacation days but the job is... persistent. I have flexibility in hours but the tradeoff is that it is difficult to schedule longer vacations because of the constant flow of work.
* With my coworker retiring I just have a feeling that I will be locked even more into this type of work with less chance to get out.

&amp;#x200B;

So tallying all this up, it makes me think a career in programming/IT is a possibility. I have always enjoyed coding and IT related things as personal hobbies. I build PCs and default to being the ""computer geek"" in a lot of my previous roles job for my natural affinity to it. I love coding MATLAB in college and VBA in previous internships and rolls. I have gotten raspberry pi's as gifts to do some different fun projects around the house and I and a voracious self-learner. I have no formal experience with coding but have taken network classes from Microsoft Virtual Academy because I find it enjoyable. I have always enjoyed online courses around IT things. All this coupled with the fact I really desire a remote role is making me feel this is a possible direction to go.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I don't have any formal CS or IT training. I am not worried about my ability to learn and thrive in this area, but that doesn't exactly guarantee someone would pay me. Since I am putting a year timeframe on a possible move I think doing any online training/certification would be a possibility in my spare time.  The fact I make good money and benefits for my area also is a little bit worrisome and I am doubtful I could find something similar in pay scale. My wife quit her job to stay home with our daughters and we are frugal people in general, but we do have a house payment and do not want to move locations. My wife will probably go back to work in a few years when the kids get older and that would open up lower paying options.

&amp;#x200B;

To sum it up I would need a job that would:

* Remote work opportunity
* Flexible hours
* Similar pay/benefits (or if not likely a pay cut after my wife goes back to work in a few years to keep our standard of living)
* Some sort of work involving computers/coding/programming

&amp;#x200B;

If it helps at all my skillsets include:

* I really enjoy bulleted lists
* Project management experience (no direct reports but I managed teams of designers before)
* Sales/customer focus experience
* Skills with VBA and various CAD software

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my current idea is to wait out and see what shakes up with new management and see if there are any opportunities for me there. If it turns out poorly though I want to be positioned to make some moves into a different career if possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Any insight is appreciated - Thanks!"

After 3+ years of being an undergrad and realizing that it’s quite impossible for me to get my foot in any of the companies that recruit at my university, I’ve decided to drop out. I have nothing on my resume that showcases any sort of experience and, according to my peers, that’s what internships are for. Because of my legal status in this country I am not even able to land an internship.  

I thought “maybe I stop wasting my time and money and learn some coding on my own.” I was quite enthusiastic about all things coding and actually went through a few tutorials on many languages just to explore what’s out there. I thought going through a bachelors degree would expose me to other languages more in depth and point me on the right direction. But this was me pre-university.  

Post dropping out, I realized that I would be in the same situation. If I become a badass self-thought programmer like many of you, where could I go if I cannot be hired? Any motivation that I had before going to university is now gone. University showed me that the future looks bleak at best.  

So, I wanted to ask here, are there any undocumented immigrants living in the US that had found some success after acquiring programming skills?"

I need to speak out loud

At the beginning of this year I was in a very healthy relationship with a girl that I thought I was going to marry. Long story short, I became complacent, let things get bad, and decided that I did not want to be with her anymore because of problems that I had caused. We broke up and I got over it a little too quickly. 

Fast forward to now. I moved to a big city for an internship this summer with nobody I know within hundreds of miles other than those that I work with. I met a girl and I'm sleeping with her regularly now. I haven't felt this lonely in years. I am using her for temporary solace, but I'm poor in spirit and don't want to stop. I know I'll probably never see her again after the summer

I've done things in the past that have taken a toll on my mind. I've been forgiven by the party that was wronged by my actions, but I can't forgive myself. I need therapy because of what I did. I've never sought out that help because I'm a coward and I don't like talking to people about my problems. 

My future on Earth is bright. I have what the world tells us to want, but I don't want it. I can't stand the routine I'm in. I'm depressed. I have been for the past 5 or so years. I have never talked about my depression to a soul other than strangers who I will never see again. In other words, people that I'll never have to face. I know the truth, I know my family would love me if I opened up about it, but I can't. I have to face them.

Things are spiraling, but I continue to justify my decisions with ""Just for the summer"". I thought I was having a good time, but in reality I'm opening the wound.


TL;DR this summer has been a movie, but not one I want to be a part of


These are just my thoughts today. I'd love to know if anyone has good advice on this topic. Leave the girl, friend zone her, continue the ""relationship"" or what? Also, how do I take the first step talking to those that are close to me about my problems? 

Thanks in advance for anything"
o5votr,5,2021-06-22,Employment advice for recent graduate,KnockKnockComeIn,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/o5votr/employment_advice_for_recent_graduate/,"Hello Reddit,

As title says I’ve recently graduated with my BS in EE.

I did not take part in any internships and my only work experience is in unrelated fields.

I have completed quite a few personal projects which relied heavily on the engineering skills that I gained during college. I am trying to collect photos and do a write up for each of these and host them on a website.

I have a resume but am not sure what information from personal projects and course work should be on it.

I have a few jobs I would like to apply to but my fear is that the recruiter will look at my work experience and toss the resume immediately.

I have had the same desk job for 10 years and my current boss is very proud and would speak very highly of me, but like I said the work is completely unrelated. 


My questions are:


1. How do I present my skills/knowledge effectively pre-interview? 


2. Will employers actually check my website if I spend some time creating write ups for things I’ve built/designed/etc?


3. Am I overthinking this?"

(Am I the girlfriend/boyfriend who is never satisfied with potential suitors and keeps trying to date around?)

To make a long story short, my most recent role is at a multinational conglomerate that does 10s of $billions in revenue but our specific BU is very tiny. Turnover is somewhat high, but in the past 6 months, several of our senior leadership (including the regional CEO) have departed. Now, someone on my team in accounting has also decided to leave and majority of her work is coming my way.

I’ve had a great relationship with my boss, but the workload to me seems somewhat unsustainable. They are trying to source a backfill internally, but if they go external, I can seem my life being miserable for at least the next 6 months + until we try to get the new potential external hire trained up.

Job market is looking up right now because of the summer season and things opening up post COVID. What is my moral obligation here? Do I stay until our team becomes whole again or if a better opportunity presents itself, can I bail without seeming like a dick? What about my long term career prospects?

I did construction for a few years. After about two years, I took an internship with it, and I was the worst carpenter there. I didn’t touch it for about a year, and then this past year, I’ve just been shit.

Ever since then, all my measurements or my decisions just feel or are wrong. I’m in the middle of putting up sheet rock, and it’s just all going wrong to the point that, I don’t know what the hell the plan is anymore.

My brain is mush for everything. And I basically had a low work year for the past year, a lot more days not working than working. I can’t focus, I can’t do the things I need to do. 

I’m going to be moving in a month and a half for a year long caretaker position helping disabled men and women go through their lives and work. But I am afraid my brain will just fizz out, and I’ll be of no help and stuck in a different part of the country.

I feel like a child in terms of responsibility, and I’m even failing at that. I don’t have to worry about food or housing, not much in terms of bills. What do I even do?"

With that said, I'm thankful I have a crazy supportive family but I feel guilty for the thousands of kids who aren't as fortunate.

o5xzhr,0,2021-06-22,Which internship is the best way forward for me?,Sufficient_Package73,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/o5xzhr/which_internship_is_the_best_way_forward_for_me/,"I've gotten two internship offers so far. One of them is for low-level technical work at Oracle Labs, which pays well and interests me. The other one is mobile/web development at a small bootstrapped open-source startup. It's more aligned with what I want to do in the future, but it only pays $110 per week and I'm not optimistic about the future of the company. It's not strictly unpaid, but I don't think the pay is fair.

The issue here is that while I have a good amount of experience with lower-level work, I'm looking to pivot to higher-level mobile/web development in the future. I've been working on doing this via side projects in my spare time, but I also wanted to do it as an intern to get it on my resume. The other factor is that Oracle is generally not regarded as a good tech company nowadays, and I'm not sure it'd look good to say ""I interned at Oracle."" My position is at Oracle Labs, but it's still Oracle. However, I suppose it would still look better on my resume than a small startup with a relatively boring, open-source product.

Despite the negative sigma around Oracle, I think I'd still rather take it for the pay and reputation, then work on mobile/web in my free time. Some people have been telling me to avoid it, however, because it's Oracle and/or not aligned with my future plans. Which one is the best way forward for me?"

I've been with the company for several years and started as an intern, moved from service desk to junior systems administrator, then moved to systems administrator, then asked back to the service desk to manage it.

I have two associates degrees (Computer Networking and Computer Information Systems) and working on a bachelors in Information Systems Management to get that cinched (I'll be done next year). However, I'm struggling to find what the next best things are for this position and beyond.

I've found a website, the service desk institute, but their certifications are expensive and I'm not sure if they are recognized or not (especially here in the states). I'm trying to find things to continually build myself up (such as LinkedIn Learning and my current degree pursuit) as well as something I can bring to the team and company to continue building the department up.

Are there any recommendations? Is Service Desk Institute a good venue to look into? I'm not looking to jump ship to another company, however I want to have that option as well just in case (layoffs, company folds, whatever).

Three months ago I took a position as a data analyst at an organization and things have been going well. Some background on me is that I have a BS in Math/Stats and an MS in Data analysis with an emphasis on modeling data.
I completed a year long internship before this as an analyst and moved to this role because it looks like it would be closer to my goals of being a data scientist which is what I want to move towards. 

They did some re org changes this week with my team and I have been moved to more of a BI developer role because of my competence with SQL I think.I feel like is further away from modeling/ predicting. 

They also said they were going to be hiring for a junior/ associate data scientist position soon that I am interested in but we just had a big meeting where they said they moved people into a role where their strengths are for the re org and the team is the strongest it’s ever been.Idk what to do but I feel like telling my supervisor I’m interested in DS over development might not go over well. Also I’m pretty sure the change from analyst to developer comes with no raise lol and I could get stuck in the role.

I like the org and want to stay. How should I go about telling my sup of my interest in DS when they already executively changed me to developer? Do I just bide my time? Thoughts?"

o60rxu,2,2021-06-22,My two-week panic attack. I feel hopeless.,mentalc,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/o60rxu/my_twoweek_panic_attack_i_feel_hopeless/,"Hello there, I’m 24(f) and I’ve been struggling with an anxiety disorder. I moved to a foreign country 5 years ago, when I just turned 19. Half year later, I had my first panic attack, I won’t go into the details, but it did feel like a heart attack, and I thought I was going to die. 

At that point I had them occasionally, when they lasted 15-30 mins, I had some spasmatic medication, and that’s it at the time. 

When in 2018 I had a job where there were these women that hated me, and were talking shit about me which triggered this amazing avalanche of self-doubt and self-pity. This is when the worst part begins. 

After finishing this job (which was actually an internship) I started having very long-lasting and very hard panic attacks. In the beginning it was some hours, and I thought I could manage it, then it passed and I could live my life. 
I fainted, vomited, my hands were shaky, some time it would last for a week and I was hardly eating , only water mostly. Then I fainted at work, they put me on a couch, called an ambulance, I was low on sugar and blood pressure, I couldn’t walk, so they rolled me out on a wheel chair… that was the biggest shame in my life at the time. 

At some point  panic attacks started to last for days, then weeks. I cut the whole story pretty much to cut to the chase. 

I’ve been doing therapy for 2,5 years, I tried tranquilizers, meditations, yoga, muscles exercises, breathing exercises. It does help to ease it, but it won’t help in the long run.

The worst part is that my panic attacks are not that much about going through the same thought, but it’s a high muscle tension, as if I was constantly flexing my abs as in exercice you do in the gym… 

The thing is, I know I am very thin-skinned, I take critics very badly, I have issues with my mother, yes, BUT now I know that I can hardly master that muscle pain, now it’s been tense for 1,5 weeks after a panic attack … and it affects my whole body and nervous system, I am much more vulnerable in a stage like that, I can have mini-panic attacks because it’s too hot, or my jeans are too tight, or I was thinking badly for 0,0001 secs about myself … 

I am really desperate, I don’t want to live a life like that, I did some research, it seems like my parasympathetic nervous system is not coping well whatsoever …  maybe someone had something like that and could share some experience? 

I didn’t find that much info on the internet, sometimes they talk about muscle tension but it’s hardly noticeable, in my case it’s a constant panic attack and I feel like every second something bad with my body is about to happen.

Thanks a lot !!!"

US Citizen, Public high school, cis white female. 

Dad attended college but dropped out, mom got a GED but no further education. Mom is deceased, raised by a single dad, low income family (about 30k in taxed income with 3 in household)

**Intended Major(s)**: Nursing, preferably direct admit. (Human Biology or anatomy focused major at colleges that don’t offer it, but favor nursing)

**GPA, Rank, and Test Scores**

• 3.997 UW (one A- on the quarter system). My school doesn't do weighted GPA.

• 19 out of 382, top 5%, I believe everyone above me has a 4.0

• ACT Score: 30 composite, 32E, 28M, 29R, 31S. I take it a second time in July.

• Still waiting on AP scores, but I expect AP Lang (3 or 4) AP US History (3)

**Coursework**

*Freshman Year:* 

1. Honors Biology
2. Honors Secondary Math 1

6. Spanish 3
7. A health science related internship

Might do AP Calculus if I can't do an internship or if I am able to fit it in my schedule, still deciding ( 7 or 8 total credits)

**Rigor:** Could only take 4 honors for freshman and sophomore year, no APs offered until junior year. I think my school offers 10 APs. My school offers a lot of college classes through our university but credits are only transferable to certain schools in state so I've stuck with mostly APs in subjects I could take college courses.

**Awards (nothing super notable)**

* 1st place in county wide personal essay contest (10th grade)
* One of like 3 to 5 people (can’t exactly remember) students from my school chosen to go to a poetry event where a professor spoke

2. Have training for an Animal Rescue Shelter volunteer next week. Probably a 100 hours by December

**Essays/LORs**

Haven't started either but I think my essays will be like 7/10, not bad but not impressive, might have some good topics about my life and hardships lol

Letter of Recommendations: Best will probably be from my school counselor/GSA club advisor, known me since 10th grade and really likes me. Also my HOSA club advisor/intro to health science teacher, known me since 10th grade, wrote my recommendation for my CNA class. 

**What I'm Looking For**

**Location &amp; Size:** In the US, open to mostly anywhere although I'm not a fan of snow lol but doesn't really matter. No specific size but prefer a larger school.

**Curriculum:** Little to no religious affiliation if possible, direct admit nursing.

I also think some level of prestige is important to me (although not a must) as well as diversity and some sort of campus life"

I literally can't understand any of the company's documentation, since it's all about threads, memory, disks, IO, databases, etc. and all the code is in C. Is it possible to learn all this stuff by myself in a short amount of time? Is it common for companies to assign an intern to a project that uses technology that they've never learned about? I was very honest about the fact that I know nothing about computer architecture or C during the interview, and they told me that I would get a project in Java, so I didn't expect to have to teach myself everything really fast and now I'm pretty stressed."

To keep the story short, I was terminated today for attendance issues. HR then let me know that my internship will also be ending.  I made a mistake by coming in late so many times to work and for some dumb reason didn't think it would affect my internship. 

What can I do to improve my chances of getting hired after I graduate? I laid all of my eggs into one basket and did not plan for this to happen"
o6494t,15,2021-06-22,Passed Sec+ 501!!! Looking for some tips/advice on career progression moving forward,dcdomin8or,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/o6494t/passed_sec_501_looking_for_some_tipsadvice_on/,"Hey guys! This past Saturday (6/19), I finally passed Sec+, first attempt, with a 785! I can't thank this community enough for all the helpful study tips and motivation! I first watched all of Professor Messer's vids and then read Darril Gibson's GCGA cover to cover which I really enjoyed! That definitely helped me the most as well as Messer's and Dion's practice tests. 

So I graduated a year ago with an electrical engineering degree (no IT experience), but since then, I've really been interested in pursing a cybersecurity career. I managed to land a job as an IT field technician back in November and I've been here ever since. It's only $18/hr, but I figured it would be a great way to get my foot in the door within the IT industry and to get reimbursed for certifications. However, now that I have sec+ under my belt, I'm really looking to move forward and hopefully land a security analyst position. The thought of working for the DoD seems really exciting to me, but I'm not sure if my background would be competitive enough to land something (although I guess I won't know until I apply). 

 Just looking for some tips/advice on what to do next moving forward. Whether it's more certs, DoD internships, specific jobs/organizations to apply to, etc. I also just applied to this online grad school program for cybersecurity that is part time, so I'd definitely prefer to stay busy working and hopefully find a new/better job by the fall. 

Any advice/feedback would be greatly appreciated! Thank you again in advance and good luck to those who are going for these certs! You guys got this!"

I'm a rising junior and I'm looking to apply for internships for summer 2022. This summer I'm doing an internship where I am using AWS on a daily basis. I have already taken and passed the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam, and I'm considering if I should take the AWS Developer Associate exam. I know I will have to spend a lot of time studying to prep for this exam... is it even worth the time, or would that time be better spent studying for interviews?

I think I'm at peace. Allthese years in school i grinded though eng and managed to get 4 decent internships. But I dont got that level of motivation anymore....Before I used to want to go into FANG more than anything, solely for the money ofcourse, but now I'm even considering staying in my town and even government. Is this wrong? AM I being compalcent not trying to start my own company, build my own product, and diligently Leetcode to get into FANG to work 60 hr work weeks?? WIll I regret not making that +100k? Or is there more to life?  


  
Just a bit more context:

Basically my reason for engineering was to get a decent paying job, that would have the possiblililty for remote work, good market, transferrable skills, intellectual stimulation and growth. I only saw engineering as the way I think all of that is possible now with the pandemic. So I've been a little reluctant to grind the LC I should to get a Full time job, let alone FANG since I'm scared of the commitment of the fulltime grind. Did anyone else go through this? And what did you come down to?"

I have previous software and web development knowledge and I’m currently looking for a internship but have no luck. have applied to about 100 or so internships at this point but feel like I’m throwing my resume into the void. Also I’m wondering if it’s because of the time I’m applying because It’s currently summer and it looks like most of the internship programs I’m looking for have closed applications, Since Most are government internships given I’m in the dc Virginia area. Maybe I’m going about applying wrong I’m not sure, obviously I don’t feel entitled to an internship as I know  it takes time and dedication but any help or guidance would be appreciated. (Note : I felt like I was ready to actively start looking for internships in June, before then I needed to study networking Linux configuring firewalls my security + and fixing my resume)"

A few months ago, I wrote a post about an offer I had with a defense contractor and lost for security clearance purposes (feel free to read it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/mvbhxm/summer\_internship\_revoked\_not\_sure\_what\_to\_do\_next/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/mvbhxm/summer_internship_revoked_not_sure_what_to_do_next/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)). At the time I was very sad because it was my dream offer, but I was still feeling ok because at least I had an internship offer for the summer from my former employer. Well, since then, everything has gone downhill. 

That offer I had from my former employer? Yeah, I managed to lose that too. I should have been suspicious of the offer when he said the company had ""no time or resources"" to give me any guidance over the summer (it's a startup and they're spread thin over many projects). I was ok with this because I like to think I'm motivated enough to do things on my own. I even learned an entire programming language just to work on the software he wanted me to create, then he just pulled the offer from me like \*that\*. He said it was because they ""couldn't fit me in over summer"" because of how busy they are, which kind of makes no sense considering the fact that they said they would spend 0 time or resources on me. This leads me to believe that they Just couldn't afford to pay me over summer for my work.

Keep in mind, he pulled the offer just a WEEK AFTER I told him I had lost the defense contractor offer--he even offered his condolences about my situation, but ending up doing the exact same thing they did. In fact, I'd even say that it was worse than losing the defense contractor because their offer was contingent on being able to pass the security clearance process--his offer seemed very much final to me, all that was missing was the contract (learned my lesson there, always get the offer in writing). Long story short, I got strung along and they dropped me when they realized they wouldn't be able to pay me.

To make matters worse, around this time I also managed to lose a co-op offer I had. For context, I had also applied for a co-op at a 3 letter agency earlier this year, and I had gotten accepted, the offer once again being contingent on my ability to pass the security clearance process. Since I was already processing for security clearance due to the summer internship offer, they were able to dual process me for the 3 letter agency as well, which was pretty convenient. Two opportunities, one clearance. Felt great at the time. As I mentioned in my last post, I never got denied the clearance, so I was hopeful that I would still be able to obtain it before my co-op started in the Fall of 2021. Well, I got an email about a month ago letting me know that I had been rejected from the co-op for the Fall. They said it was because their Fall class was ""too full,"" but that I could start in Spring of 2022 if I still wanted to pursue the co-op. Naturally I said yes because I had already gone through a great deal of effort to get my clearance, but they wanted me to fill out a planning schedule to track my graduation progress and see whether or not I would still be able to graduate on time. This is where everything starts to fall apart.

Without boring you guys too much with the details, I discovered that it was impossible for me to complete the co-op program. The way they set up their rotation schedule made it incompatible with my school's class setup. They counted summer as a block, and my school doesn't offer full-time summer courses, which is what they wanted me to pursue in order to complete the co-op. They also do not allow double blocks except in extreme circumstances, which made matters worse. Long story short, I was forced to discontinue processing for the program. I was pretty heartbroken. Even though it was technically a voluntary decision on my part, I felt like I had no other choice. I was really looking forward to working there as well.

So here I am now, sitting at home with no internship for the summer and extremely bored. I feel very inadequate and insecure about my future. I like to think I'm a good student: my GPA is pretty high and I really try to go out of my way to do projects at school. But I don't have any tangible experience that I can put on my resume, and all I hear from the engineering community is ""Get internships, get internships, get internships!,"" which isn't much help when I simply could not get one despite doing everything right. 

For some context, I'm a sophomore, and this summer, I've seen many of my engineering friends get opportunities at amazing companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Northrop Grumman, etc., while I'm playing video games and rotting away. Next summer is my last opportunity to get an internship at a real company, and I'm afraid that I'll lose it again. Clearly, I have issues getting through the security clearance process, so I don't even know if I want to accept another DefCon offer (if I even get one). If I were to go for non-cleared positions, I'm afraid that my lack of experience and knowledge will make me undesirable to companies when everyone else applying is so much more impressive than I am. I honestly don't know what to do at this point. I've gotten so desperate than I'm willing to go intern at some non-engineering places just so I can get something on my resume. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but I feel like crap. That's all I have to say."

Now its been 4 months and there is no income source in the family and all our savings have been depreciated.

My father is trying but couldn't get a job as he's 50+ and no good qualifications.
And my mom also has only done teaching her whole life and dosen't know what to do now as the schools are closed and not sure when they will open up.

I've started looking for jobs / internship in web dev, but I dont have a good portfolio and hence its very low paying job (2k) .
I'm also trying freelancing on upwork as well as word of mouth but haven't got any help there as well.

From the next month I've to pay my college fees and I planned to cover it by getting an education loan which I applied to early this year, but the govt. Banks delayed it so much that I still havent got it, and now as my father dont have any job , its most probably gonna get rejected.

o66usp,1,2021-06-23,What do I do about an aggressive/controlling family member?,Interesting-Show-157,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/o66usp/what_do_i_do_about_an_aggressivecontrolling/,"Before I start, I want to give a little back story. This is about a situation with my grandfather in particular. This isn’t really the first time something like this has happened, but I usually ignore them. Though this situation is so stupid, it infuriates me. 

I am a young early 20s college student. I recently won a scholarship/internship that I'm excited about. I also am president of one of the larger clubs at my school. For the past two years, I've been living with my grandparents while I go to school. I also work with my grandfather and help/ devote a lot of time to his business. I'm very underpaid, but there's a weird gray line because I don't pay rent. 

After a lot of conflict between him and me, I've realized that he affects my mental health, and I need to start making an effort to separate myself from him as much as possible. 

Luckily, my mom is moving to the area, and I can move in with her to buy myself some time to figure things out thoroughly. 

However, my moving out has seemed to piss my grandfather off to the point where he’s been making snarky remarks about me throughout the week. I usually brush them off and move on, but sometimes they do get to me. 

He’s very adamant about me getting everything prepared for the move that doesn’t happen for another six days. He’s repeatedly told me and had my grandmother tell me to get someone to help me move. I don’t think it's necessary because I don’t have many personal items and am 100% confident I can move any of my items on my own. 

He’s taken it upon himself to create a schedule for me to follow this week and emailed it to me. Though, the schedule completely disregards school and my other job. 

So my question is. What do I do? 

I don't know if I'm being enabled because I don't pay rent. I don't know if I need to be respectful because of that. Or if it's perfectly reasonable to stand my ground and let him know I'm an adult and I can handle this move on my own. 

I feel like this is some kind of mental abuse and am not sure how to get away as I'm not yet capable of surviving on my own with an unpaid interns salary."

o67yen,1,2021-06-23,Which College should I attend?,Susssss37,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/o67yen/which_college_should_i_attend/,"Hi everyone, I'm a recent highschool and early college grad (I have associates in science and math) from texas looking to attend university this fall semester and I am currently undecided between two schools: UT Dallas and the University of Alabama. UTD appeals to me more due to demographics, culture, big city(possible career and internship opportunities), and being somewhat close to home. University of Alabama on the other hand is a large, big name school who is also offering me the presidential scholarship, which would save me about 9k (Prices for two years: Univ of Alabama= $15k, UTD= $24K)after all estimated costs of attendance over my 2 years (already having completed about 70 college credit hours during high school). If for some reason I end up attending for 4 years the difference would be reduced to 5k, (Univ of Alabama= $39k, UTD=$44k)

I'm intending to major in physics or computer science and figure either route I could find a lucrative career. And I also would like to participate in internships, hopefully paid during my summers.

I've been stressing out over this decision for probably much too long, telling myself that Dallas is a better option for the aforementioned reasons, especially considering the opportunities and what I could make out of the DFW area, but the nearly $10,000 price difference still haunts my dreams.

As a kid trying to make adult decisions I wanted to know if any of you can give me some insight on what a sensible decision would be?

And in advance, thank you for your input."

I would have an awkward 4 months of doing nothing from Dec to April, and also the exams in Germany would clash with semester 1 as exams for Germany are in Aug/Sep but NUS semester 1 would start in Aug. 

I have 2 main questions:   
1. Is it possible to clock a credit bearing internship from Dec - Apr? As usually they are done in summer.  
2. How would the exam arrangements be like for Germany? Would I have to stay in Germany for the exams or can I take the exams online?

o68e02,466,2021-06-23,Sober Post: Things I've learned as an industry engineer,Humor_Fantastic,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/o68e02/sober_post_things_ive_learned_as_an_industry/,"Inspired by [Drunk Post: Things I've learned as a Sr Engineer : ExperiencedDevs (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/nmodyl/drunk_post_things_ive_learned_as_a_sr_engineer/)

Thought I would jot down everything I've learned through college and over the last \~2 years in the industry.

Background: Top 20 CS program, high school/college internships were a mix of gov't, FAANG, Big N, defense contractors

Full time work: FAANG + Unicorn

&amp;#x200B;

* Getting started:
   * The best time to start is now. some people start in high school, some in college, some when they're 60. Don't compare yourself to others with different backgrounds, just compare yourself to your past self. As long as you're improving and better than yesterday, that's what matters
   * Imposter syndrome is normal - use it to your advantage. thinking your entire team is smart should motivate you to get to that level, not keep you from learning. everyone starts somewhere and soon you'll have people looking up to you too
   * don't do CS for the money unless you have an extremely strong will. this field will burn you out if you do it for money unless you're somehow able to separate the outcome and your day-to-day. i would recommend against it
   * laptop recommendations get asked a lot. I would personally say get a mac product (used or new) made in the last \~1-3 years for simplicity. things will work out of the box and you have unix support from day 1. If you're more adventurous, get a pc and load linux, or get a VM or build a hackintosh. these approaches require a lot of work. Swappa is a good place to find used deals
   * Programming languages don't really matter too much - I would recommend python or java to get started with
   * College is what you make of it - you can go to a low-tier school and do great if you push yourself. You can go to MIT and be a bum. it is easier to do well if you go to a high tier school and push yourself though
   * CS is a learning experience even past college. you'll be learning new technologies, frameworks and having to brush up interview skills continuously. make sure you enjoy learning new things
   * bootcamps vs college is an interesting debate. bootcamps teach the high-level knowledge without in-depth fundamentals. that you have to learn on your own. don't expect just a bootcamp to set you up for success against college grads. you have to put in more work than the minimum. [Would you choose a coding bootcamp or a computer science related degree? Why? - Quora](https://www.quora.com/Would-you-choose-a-coding-bootcamp-or-a-computer-science-related-degree-Why) The top answer here is a solid one. Generally, bootcamp grads are extremely rare in FAANG because they want fundamental knowledge. bootcamp grads do very well at small local tech companies that might want something basic without having to worry about scale
* Once you're in college
   * Try new things. go to hackathons, try new clubs, make friends. You learn from those around you and this is an easy way to surround yourself with smart people
   * go to class. as someone that skipped a lot of classes, it's not worth it. you'll spend the same amount of time if not more trying to learn things yourself. the only potential exception is if the classes are recorded and you have enough discipline to watch them
   * GPA matters and it doesn't matter. It matters for government, trading firms, traditional companies (although they'll stop caring once you hit a few years of experience). Normal tech companies don't really care ASSUMING you can show your value in other ways. Having a low GPA and no projects is a bad combo
   * Personal projects are just another way to showcase your skills. it can be substituted with a contribution to open source, part-time work, etc.  It's better to have them than not
   * Core classes to take in college IMO are network security, databases, algorithms, linear algebra, up to calc 2, an advanced data structures class, compilers, OS. you don't need to take the highest level classes but knowing these are good.
   * Have a social life - growing as a software engineer requires soft skills. you can be the smartest person in the room but won't grow unless you're also easy to learn with
   * Be humble and eager to learn. try not to be in an environment where you're the smartest person in the room. Goes back to point 1 where you should get comfortable being uncomfortable and learning
   * Careers fairs are good but do your research. some companies just tell you to apply online, others will give you an interview on the spot. Go first to the ones that will give you an interview and go to the other ones last
   * Hackathons and clubs are a good place to find jobs too
   * [http://angel.co/](http://angel.co/) is a good place to get started on the startup hunt
   * your professors and TA's are there to help you - ask them for help
* Internships/new grad jobs
   * getting the first internship is the biggest hurdle. after that it kind of compounds
   * there's a correlation between the number of applications submitted and job offers. success = attempts x success rate. even if your success rate says the same, applying to twice as many places is good
   * failing interviews is normal. its not a reflection of you as a person or your skillset but your demonstration of that skillset given at the time and situation. learn from it and move on
   * Algorithms and data structures is the core of CS. Do leetcode and get started on these things as soon as possible
   * FAANG has specific programs (FBU, Google engineering practicum, Microsoft explorer) geared towards underrepresented minorities and freshman/sophomores. apply to them
   * [GitHub - j-delaney/easy-application: Over 400 software engineering companies that are easy to apply to](https://github.com/j-delaney/easy-application) and [Intern Supply](https://intern.supply/) are good places to start
   * Optimize your internships for learning and growth. Learning means trying new things, pushing boundaries etc. Growth means jumping around from company to company. Use a defense contractor to go to Big N and then to FAANG.
   * Learning standard tools like git, docker, etc can make you more effective at internships
   * being young is the best time to take risks. if you want to do a startup over a large company, go for it but do your research. don't turn down google for a company that does IoT socks.
   * information is power. especially when it comes to negotiating. sites like [https://www.teamblind.com/](https://www.teamblind.com/), reddit, and [https://www.levels.fyi/](https://www.levels.fyi/) are crucial to make sure you're compensated fairly
   * practice coding on paper/whiteboards. most interviews expect this and will probably be the norm once covid ends
* Industry experience/new grad tips
   * Optimize your first job for (in order) learning, manager, interest in work, compensation. How much they matter should be up to you. ex - don't turn down a 100k job for a 50k job that has a slightly better learning opportunity. but a 90k vs 95k job, optimize on things other than compensation
   * FAANG is overrated and underrated at the same time.  There are plenty of smart people but also plenty of slackers. That being said, the pay and benefits is fantastic. But there are always different and potentially better opportunities. Finance for higher pay and worst wlb, unicorns for higher pay but with more uncertainty, gov't for wlb and low stress. The one thing about FAANG is, there are very few other places in the world where you can work on things at such a large scale
   * silicon valley is a good place to be when you're young, not so much when you're older (unless you're doing really well). living in a house with 3 roommates paying 1500/month is fine in your 20's but paying 2 million for a small house in your 30's with kids is not optimal
   * not all jobs are in silicon valley/est coast but a lot of them are. new york and DC are also top contenders now
   * learn personal finance. ESPECIALLY if you already have internships. Invest as early as you can so you set yourself up for a financially successful life
   * invest in a good setup if you can - ergonomic chair, keyboard, a mouse so you don't have to deal with issues later on
   * dual monitor/ultrawide screens are great for productivity
   * noise-canceling headphones are essential for office work
* General life tips
   * your health is your wealth. eat well, sleep, exercise. money, success, intelligence means nothing if you die early
   * be kind to people - you never know when you'll run into them again
   * take risks when you're young, it'll be harder (not impossible) once you hit 30ish
   * generally have a balanced life. an extreme of anything tends to be bad
   * have a good group of friends - they mean a lot once you get out of college. as time goes on, the opportunities to make new friends come by less often - people go out less often and you don't get the same interaction levels you get in college with clubs and classes. once you're late 20's/early 30's you've pretty much made your core friend group and it becomes harder to break into new friend groups (not impossible though)
   * spend time with family - by now you've spent 90% of the time you will with them so make the last 10% really count
   * money and other things in life are only a part of it. i know people worth tens of millions that barely spend time with family, i know people making a very average income that are happier than people making 300k. everyone has their own issues

I can't really think of anything else at the moment. If you disagree with anything i've said, feel free to ignore or just post a comment so others can see your point of view. i'll respond to comments/dm's when I can.

This is my first time posting on Reddit and I am also a non-native English speaker, so I apologize for any grammatical errors.  In the fall I am going to be a junior (currently majoring in Finance and Applied Economics), however, I feel more lost than ever and I always think that I have not done enough during these three years. Even though I have a perfect GPA, I am involved on campus (I am both an e-board member at a  fraternity and at a professional consulting club), and currently doing an internship (a research internship at my uni), I feel useless, miserable, and lost. I apologize if this seems in any way braggy, it is not my intention, and sorry if this post seems that way. I feel lost in a sense because I am not sure about:  

A) my major: since I am not in a target school for a high-end job in finance or economics,  I feel that I am not retaining what I am learning,  I always keep hearing that a business degree is not a ""real"" major or that it is useless for finding a job, and I am not sure if I am passionate enough for this field (maybe I still need to discover my passion)

B) future career path: since Finance and economics are so vast and I do not know what specific job I want and I am afraid of not finding a job here in the US due to my indecisiveness.

c) my school/current extracurriculars. I do not know if I want to continue staying here or if I want to remain in the clubs that I am a  part of (I feel like I am doing a lot of things just to boost up my resume and I do not feel a lot of pleasure from what I am doing anymore, maybe due also to the ""different"" environment we all lived in due to COVID).   

Thank you for reading this and any reply helps. I hope you have an amazing day and again I apologize for my English (if there is something that does not make sense structurally/grammatically)."

For the first two years of the school, I could not find an internship, and many programs, local or overseas, required to be at 3rd or 4th grade to apply. Meanwhile, I learned about building a product, and built technical skills on computers and related mathematical concepts; as far as I needed while working on my own projects.

Even if I learned how to design, plan, research, test and program a (digital) product (I work on games and applications, usually.) I could not complete a project, yet. I have a project cemetery, full of new ideas, concepts and mechanics I have programmed; also on-going projects, but nothing to show-off.

I think the main reason why I can not find an internship is that. I got rejected by almost 100 companies. Even worse, not only I want to have a (paying) internship, my school requires me to do an internship in this summer too...

Also, I can not afford a unpaid internship, I am also working as a waiter, and I want to leave it and grow as a engineer. I also think there is no value to unpaid internship, but it is another story.

I have crafted a CV in a way that I can prove what is written about me if I get an interview. However, no avail. I unfortunately started using LinkedIn a little late, but I am working on it too. So far, only one company downloaded my CV, but I did not get a response.

Anyway, I need some advice on how to turn my situation around. I want to have an internship, paid if possible, so I can look after myself, graduate in time and also can work on my own projects without worrying about things.

EDIT: I had forgotten to add that I am also willing to work as an volunteer, *for a good cause.* But, even NGOs I have applied to rejected me.

I can answer questions about more details. Thank you for your time."
o6axws,2,2021-06-23,[UK] Is putting a word in for someone a help or a hinderence?,KneeAm,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/o6axws/uk_is_putting_a_word_in_for_someone_a_help_or_a/,"So I work in quite a niche area. Its a decent job, good pay and good opportunities to move up the ladder early in your career. That's mostly down to the fact that the job was previously not that well known, so getting a graduate role was surprisingly easy. Demand far out-weighed supply. 

Well its been a good 10 years now and the governing body have put in a lot of work to advertise and promote the job to try and get more people into the role. It's actually started working. The company I used to work in had 300 applications for 5 graduate roles where previously they would literally be lucky to get 5 applications for those roles.

Anyway a young person I know, I used to babysit him back in the day, has recently completed his college course. He let me know he's really interested in this job. He did an internship last summer where he got some experience with it. 

Now unfortunately my current company filled its graduate roles in March so I couldn't even get him an interview until next year. 

I'm thinking of asking around other companies and maybe getting his CV in with them? Like in this industry you get to know a lot of people in the job. It's a bit of a small world amongst us all. Would the HR team companies be put off by me trying to put a word in for him? Like they are trying to avoid nepitism if you could call it that. I just think that with 300 applications coming in for some roles, just getting your CV looked at can be a bit of luck.

I'm sure if he keeps applying without my help he will eventually get an interview somewhere. He has decent grades and that internship is a good boost. And maybe the interviewers would be a bit harder on him if it was me that got him in the door, rather than just getting himself picked out of the bundle of CVs on his knees accord?"

I've always had a passion for teaching and told myself that I would pursue a field in secondary education near my late 30's once I've gained real-world experience. When I recall the teachers that have made the most impact in my learning experience are the ones who brought their real-world experience to explain certain topics. I've had the opportunity to take on various internship opportunities during my undergrad in teaching and mentoring roles, these experiences have been the most memorable moments in my life. Now that I've had the opportunity to work on some really interesting software projects and have had a taste of the ""real world,"" I'm starting to look at the next phase in my career and I'm ready to change my line of work into teaching.

The main thing that I've taken into account is the lifestyle change and a large decrease in salary. I've spoken to my wife about this and she is on board with the career change as she is also in a corporate career that would help sustain our lifestyle.

Before I take on this new journey, is there anything else that I should factor in before making the transition? How was the change from corporate to teaching? What hurdles did you have to go through to make the transition? Has your corporate experience benefited you in your teaching practice? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!"
o6eus1,78,2021-06-23,Human interaction exhausts me,Imaginary_cherry99,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/o6eus1/human_interaction_exhausts_me/,"I've always been an introvert, but depression periods when I wanna isolate myself, and lockdown just when I was getting better, really fuucked me up socially. When I'm with others most of the time I don't wanna talk very much, and I really try to, because I don't want to look weird or snob.

 On the other hand human interaction is important to me and feeling connected to others is not something I'm indifferent about. And the thing is I also got this with friends lately and that's the saddest part.. I feel boring and I'm getting bored easily. I rarely have a good time anymore. And having friends and having fun while being myself is very important to me.  But even if people approach me and get close to me I feel like I'm keeping a space and don't let them close or even push them away. 

Also my job which I'm now starting cause I'm an intern, feels quite challenging cause it is based on human interaction as well. I like it very much but I'm often in this mood of being tired and having to try really hard to keep it going, and at the end of the day, I am feeling exhausted even if the only thing I was doing is just talking with people.

 I feel I need to do something about it but it's been a long time and I don't know where to start.
It feels like I have forgotten how to socialize, not that I ever was the best at it. Any tips of facing that unwillingness and tiredness that comes with interacting with people?"

Feel free to ask any questions regarding my study material, topics, etc in the comments btw. 

A little bit about me, I am a recent IS grad, IT-related internship over a year ago, and then ""did nothing"" during pandemic so there's a year or so gap in my resume. As I am applying to jobs, it seems that help desk is the ""stepping stone"" to the IT world, and as it turns out a lot of these types of IT jobs require A+ (some without a degree even!)

A lot of the interview topics for entry level IT positions cover things that aren't covered in S+ because CompTIA assumes you already know this stuff, and as someone who hasn't had any hands-on experience, I'm struggling to ace these technical interviews. E.g. I can explain to you the PKI exchange in secure email exchange but when it comes to things such as Active Directory, my knowledge is more limited. 

Anyone else in this position, are there are any good resources out there preferably on udemy (there's a lot but I want to narrow down the good ones) on quick review of A+ concepts? Any help, questions, advice would be appreciated. Thanks!"
o6giz5,230,2021-06-23,Is three years out of university not using my degree too long to find a job in the field? Or can I use COVID and moving states as a reasonable enough explanation for why I am getting back into the field at the entry level?,snizarsnarfsnarf,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/o6giz5/is_three_years_out_of_university_not_using_my/,"Like the title says, I have not been using my degree the last few years. 

I had a turbulent home situation for the last couple years of uni (took me 6 years to finish), and upon graduating, was extremely depressed. A number of compounding factors led me to not search for jobs right out of uni, and try and focus on my mental/physical health. 

Ultimately, a situation fell into my lap where I was able to help my friend start a music studio back in 2018. Designed the space, ordered all of the equipment, fabricated a vocal booth with help from a general contractor, and worked there as studio manager/recording engineer for the last few years. The hourly rate was quite good (75$/hour split evenly with my friend who owned the studio), but it wasn't a full time gig, just when we would get sessions scheduled.

Covid ultimately led to my family moving states from the state where I went to university (IL) to WA, which left my living situation up in the air, and I decided that working in the music industry, while a dream/passion of mine, wasn't something I wanted to commit my life to pursuing, and so I moved away from IL to CO about a week ago, where I am staying with some friends of mine who are already established engineers. 

So I'm now 3 years out of uni, where I got a mechanical engineering degree, and the last 3 years on my resume are as a studio manager/recording engineer (I have worked since I was 14, so I have extensive work history going back very far, but none of it relevant to mechanical engineering, mostly retail/sales and restaurant work, and only one supervisor/managerial role at a catering company back when I was a teenager) 

My friends who I am staying with are skeptical that I will be able to find even an entry level position, being that I have been out of the field for years since graduating uni. 

I am hoping to find any entry level mechanical engineering position/internship, interview well, and bust my ass to show I am a very good worker once my foot is in the door. 

Do you think that such a gap on a resume is too great to overcome, even for an entry level position? My friends who I am staying with say that companies wouldn't want to hire someone for an internship who has already been out of school for multiple years, even though most companies on linkedin looking for interns say they are looking for someone with a bachelor's in ME, or someone who is currently enrolled in the program. 

Do you think that with COVID having happened, it would be easy enough for me to convince an interviewer/recruiter that COVID changed a lot of things for me, and that it led to me reprioritizing certain things in my life, and moving out to CO to start my career in engineering, and that ultimately my passion is in engineering since that's what I went to school for?"
o6gwxt,7,2021-06-23,How to stay positive? Not getting past interview stage,selfloveselfcare,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/o6gwxt/how_to_stay_positive_not_getting_past_interview/,"&amp;#x200B;

I want to be one of those people who can post I got a new job on here, can not wait for that day!!!!! the current job I have has no consistency in terms of hours and pay, I work in hospitality, a restaurant to be precise. Since covid hit it seems as though the company is struggling in terms of the amount of labour they can spend on staff, so frequently if it is not busy or even if it is sometimes they cut the staffs hours during the week and then have to use my holidays to make up for the hours that were cut because I have things to pay for. Anyway I'm looking for my way out I have been for a long time, I need something that will not have me worrying about money every week plus I have a degree that I would love to use.

&amp;#x200B;

I Luckily managed to land 4 interviews this past 6 weeks, this is briefly how each went;

1. First one was a bit strange, I loved everything that the company was trying to do however they were a start-up and were only offering £323 per month until the project (3 months) was completed and did not provide the programme they required although it was advertised as £19000- £21,000. I no longer went forward with this, I felt bad because it's the first interview that I had in a long time but it just wouldn't solve anything for me.
2. Second one was great, it was almost 2 hrs from home but I was willing to do whatever to get that job, I fit the job description and 1st interview went great, 2nd interview was not too bad but I didn't get the job due to lack of knowledge in their interior side of the business although this was an internship. I was willing to learn and hardly had time to prepare as they gave me a days notice after the first interview and I had to take up a shift at work on my day off in order to get that morning covered in order to attend that 2nd interview and in turn I had to work 11 days straight because I worked on my day off and again the place I currently work at is not really good at planning rotas, I felt a bit defeated at this point.
3. This third ones location was great however I felt at the interview and even beforehand that I may not be the right fit for the company because it was marketing based, nothing I had knowledge about, I'm more design, however I went for the interview experience and just to see how it would go. It went terrible I felt and I could also see that they felt that I was not the right candidate, it didn't end badly, but I know they will not get back to me.
4. This came through on Monday, great company, set hours and pay and great location, sounds great right? but they sent me a task to do in a specific 3D design programme, only problem is I learnt a completely different programme at university and everything is different,  I have been trying to do this task by asking others for help, watching YouTube and downloading the programme, however I don't think I will be as quick to learn the entire programme as they would want me to be and also I have less of a chance compared to someone who knows this programme. I think I will have to be honest with this one and I again let this one go as I am not the right candidate if I can't even complete this task.

Honestly I am so grateful I have been given the chance to have FOUR interviews!!, but with every unsuccessful interview I can't help but worry about when the next one will come, so I always treat each one like it's my last chance, any job that I have to let go makes me feel horrible and guilty, I feel terrible after each unsuccessful one tbh, I feel a bit depressed, happy that it's progress but I feel really down.

I don't know if I'm asking for advice here or just ranting but how do I make sure i'm the right candidate and stay positive??

&amp;#x200B;

As we all know, the global pandemic has had a significant impact on the ability on the way higher education institutions around the world function, most of the time, for the worst as it is the case with the previous institution i was enrolled (in North Africa). After finally graduating a few days ago, I have carefully thought about pursuing my graduate studies elsewhere (The US would be the most preferable for personal circumstances) and determined that it would be desirable both for my academic development and my mental health. My overall experience with applying has been very negative (I tired my luck out late 2020 and was embarrassingly met with rejections only), and it was later explained to me by a contact that works with admissions abroad that application from students with 3 year degrees (such as my own) with no significant practical experience rarely, if ever, make the cut. My strategy since has been to apply for internships and lab positions that find my technical qualifications desirable and also tailor careful emails to professors in universities with labs and programs in my field of interest, but unfortunately, i haven't managed to land a position yet nor get a response from people i have contacted, which is frustrating to say the least. I feel like i am approaching my situation the wrong way entirely. I would like to know if any of you found yourselves in similar situations, and if so, how did you resolve it? Are there any resources that i may have not seen or overlooked?

But, I'm not allowed to work in the US, due to restrictions with the TN visa.

Not being able to work in the US gave me a lot of trouble, schools require internships to graduate, while I am not allowed to get an internship.

Is it possible for me to also get a TN visa and work in the US? I know it limits to a few types of jobs, but my internships are mostly tech-related.

Also, is it usual for 16-year-olds to get a TN visa? The official site just mentioned ""14 - 79yo usually needs an interview"", does that mean I can work under the age of 18?"
o6k7ts,5,2021-06-23,Are you morally obligated to keep a job?,gaandchodthrowaway,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/o6k7ts/are_you_morally_obligated_to_keep_a_job/,"Backstory, been working in corporate finance/accounting for the past 5 years or so. Did internships at all different companies and then in my professional career, I’ve worked at 3 different companies. Lasted a year at the first one, about 15 months at the second one, and currently been in my my most recent role for about 18 months. (Am I the girlfriend/boyfriend who is never satisfied with potential suitors and keeps trying to date around?)

To make a long story short, my most recent role is at a multinational conglomerate that does 10s of $billions in revenue but our specific BU is very tiny. Turnover is somewhat high, but in the past 6 months, several of our senior leadership (including the regional CEO) have departed. Now, someone on my team in accounting has also decided to leave and majority of her work is coming my way.

I’ve had a great relationship with my boss, but the workload to me seems somewhat unsustainable. They are trying to source a backfill internally, but if they go external, I can seem my life being miserable for at least the next 6 months + until we try to get the new potential external hire trained up.

Job market is looking up right now because of the summer season and things opening up post COVID. What is my moral obligation here? Do I stay until our team becomes whole again or if a better opportunity presents itself, can I bail without seeming like a dick? What about my long term career prospects? Am I a serial job hopper at this juncture? Am I considered unstable?"
o6kwqh,4,2021-06-23,"Rising seniors - how are you preparing for your senior year, graduation, and the transition to post grad? (If you already graduated please feel free to chime in too!)",morenxlife,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/o6kwqh/rising_seniors_how_are_you_preparing_for_your/,"I’m going to be a senior this fall and the idea that I’m graduating soon feels great but also incredibly weird. I’ve created a post grad folder and have added a couple things pertaining to graduate education, fellowships/scholarships/travel opportunities, places I’m thinking of relocating to, and the job hunt but it feels a bit overwhelming to have to think about all this on top of my summer jobs. 

I’ve been applying to some internships for Fall 2021 and Spring 2022 in the hopes of securing full time offers I can easily transition to upon graduation, but beyond that I haven’t made much of a dent in all the things I want to do to prepare for this next year. 

What are you all doing to prepare for your last year and the transition into the “real world”? 

For those who want to move out of their hometown/state what are you doing to make sure this happens? (I’m seriously wanting to move out of my home state and have been interning remotely in different places across the US throughout the pandemic)

For those who already graduated, what do you wish you did your senior year to make the job hunt, post grad life, etc easier?"
o6lldy,124,2021-06-23,Just got fired,Throwaway43215782,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/o6lldy/just_got_fired/,"I got fired from an internship at a boutique consulting firm. My project was tech work but it wasn't working out, either for me or for the firm (I let my personal problems affect my job). I let go of better opportunities to take this role because it paid more, but I regretted it from day 1. Now I'm unsure what to do, please suggest options (I'm a international student in the states)."
o6mu1k,0,2021-06-23,Contracting rates for a fullstack authorization portal,fuckinglazerbeam,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/o6mu1k/contracting_rates_for_a_fullstack_authorization/," Hey guys. I have a question about contracting rates that I'm hoping someone can help me with.

I was offered a job today creating a fullstack enterprise-scale authorization portal. I'm expected to do this job alone (with access to the company's engineers and resources should I need advice or something along those lines), and I'm expected to turn in an MVP within 2 months (give or take).

The thing is: I'm about 2 months out of bootcamp and have absolutely no idea what kind of pay I should ask for. The job was referred to as an internship, but this seems like WAY more responsibility than a typical intern is given. By that logic, shouldn't I get paid way more as well? What do standard rates look like for something like this, and should I ask for more being that I'm expected to do it alone?

Through my research I've been able to glean that less experienced freelancers tend to charge about 75-100 per hour. Does that seem right for a job of this scale?

Any advice or even just a shove in the right direction research-wise would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

I specialized in quality assurance. However, within my experience with the program and life events going on because of covid and my family being toxic, I  had expressed my difficulty learning due to all of that to my teacher and all they said was that I should quit. I really enjoyed the process of programming and creating something cool, but how can I learn from someone who doesn't think I belong???? it really affected me in the long run and I got placed into an internship in UX research. I basically had to learn everything from scratch (I also don't like the work) and I feel like it wasn't fair on my end and on my internship manager's end too. with that said I want to learn all of this on my own. I have an idea of where to start but I don't know if boot camps are my best option due to this experience. I've watched youtube videos about learning alone and I want to hear other people's experiences and what was helpful for you."
o6nhtp,3,2021-06-23,I hate my boss but I need this job. Help?,missgemini619,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/o6nhtp/i_hate_my_boss_but_i_need_this_job_help/,"I (20F) got a summer internship back in march at a physical therapy office in my hometown. I started late may working two half-days a week, primarily just shadowing and getting observation hours for when I apply to graduate school next year. Right away I realized that my boss treated my other coworkers like garbage; getting mad over the tiniest things, not training them and being upset when they do things incorrectly rather than telling them what to do differently. I knew she was tough, but there’s certainly a difference between being tough vs. flat out mean. 
 
The office has two physical therapists, my boss (who is also the business owner) and another doctor. when i started, it was the two of them, two girls who were PT techs (R and T), and myself. R had recently been fired (over text) and I got promoted to her full time, paid position. my boss lied and told me it was because R had recently been diagnosed with cancer, and R told me that was a flat out lie and that she had simply just been texted saying her help was no longer needed. Yesterday, my boss told me in private that she’s working on replacing T without her knowing. She told me yesterday how great i was doing, she was going to write me a great letter of rec, etc and then today (during my first opening shift) i accidentally triggered the alarm while opening the door since I didn’t have the code. She yelled at me for the entire shift about it. I kept apologizing and told her I learned from my mistake and that nobody notified me of the code prior to my opening. Likewise, today she kept telling me what I was doing wrong and got tremendously upset when she found out I didn’t understand the scheduling software, fax machine, etc. Let me emphasize: she NEVER trained me and expected me to know. Completely a different person than she was yesterday. Patients have told me while working one-on-one that the staff at this business is constantly changing around and i truly believe it’s because people are frequently either quitting or being fired. Side note: most of our patients are older a immunocompromised , and my boss isn’t vaccinated and doesn’t let patients or employees wear masks. don’t know how this is okay in her mind, but that’s just my opinion.  

 Bottom line, i’m frustrated by the lack of professionalism my boss displays and how one day i’m her favorite in the office and the next day i’m a target. however, this job pays well and i need the experience for grad school. I’m stressed out every shift in fear i’m going to make a mistake that’s enough to get me fired like my other coworkers. i’m supposed to work until the first week of august… I’m not one to bail on commitments, especially since this could be my opportunity to get to grad school. I don’t know if my boss is legitimately bipolar, overworked, or just flat out mean.  I feel slimy working for this company, and my boss in particular. Should I just tough it out these next 6 weeks, or start standing up for myself?"

In this company I work in a project where we are doing the software maintenance of the different applications of a university.

The problem is that the software used in the university is very old, it uses egl(seems to be similar to cobol), java 1.5/1.8, jsp, jspf.... (Scrum methodology is used in the project and we use jira for our tasks)

My plan is to work in this project for one year or two, so I can gain a year of experience that is needed to work in other companies but I am afraid of being obsolete being such an old project, I am terrified about becoming an outdated software engineer who get refused by companies/projects due to this first year. 

I'm also constantly learning about other software technologies and doing my own little projects hoping this gives me a way to not get outdated, I am experienced with android development and now I'm doing a full stack course too.

¿Do you think that I made a mistake taking this first job and it will make me fail about finding other projects/companies? ¿I'm in the good way by doing other courses and projects on my own?"

I’m currently a contractor, ISSE, for the Navy.  I got out of the navy after 4 years as an IT in March 2020. I was fortunate enough to participate in SkillBridge &amp; was able to intern my last 6 months of my contract.  I worked closely with the Director of Cyber &amp; Program Manager at HQ for this company. 

I got out of the navy &amp; was offered a job by the place I interned, but turned down due to buying a house &amp; there being no start date due to COVID.  I took a Systems Engineer gig, and 6 mo after got a call from the Director of Cyber for the company I interned for asking if I could work for them as an ISSE, so I took it.

Shortly after I started, the Director &amp; PM (who now live in a totally different state) took me under their wing to become a Project Manager one day. I talk to the PM weekly &amp; Director monthly, along with a one on one class about PM type stuff.

I don’t have a degree, just certs… although I’m in school currently (WGU).

They’re building me up to be a PM or Lead on this contract eventually, but I’m skeptical… I’ve gotten offers for 30%+ what I make now, and I would love to make more… who wouldn’t?

Question is… should I stick this job out or snag another making more?"
o6ooza,123,2021-06-23,Why I'll never go to Disney again,Freakythings456,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/o6ooza/why_ill_never_go_to_disney_again/,"Disney World's Toontown was my first job out of high school, and at the beggining everything was great. For those of you who don't remember, Toontown was where Mickey and Minnie lived in the park and had everything you would imagine would be in a real neighborhood a neighborhood that a cartoon would live in. There were houses, kitchens, bedrooms. Kids could even go in and microwave stuff on a little cartoon microwave. Donald Duck had a little houseboat you could go inside.Goofy had his Rollercoaster. There was a lot of cool stuff. And although it was for kids I actually really liked it. I mean, where else in the world could you go and step in a real cartoon village. That was all until I started working the night shift there. What in the day time, looked cute and silly quickly became very creepy after the sun went down and guests left the park. 

I worked in custodial so I was one of the last people to go through the parks at night and unfortunately I usually had to go in alone. So one night I was doing my rounds and emptying trash cans. I walked straight through Toontown to try and get to Tomorrowland  and back to the front of the park. I was finishing a ten-hour day and was definitely ready to get out so I was walking pretty fast. 

Normally all of the little houses were dark and the sound effects would be turned off. Not tonight though, I went back there and all the lights and effects were still going strong throughout the area. I was dumbfounded, this was a serious departure from protocol. So, I had to tell someone about it and people were going to get in serious trouble. I continued walking and pulled out my radio bit as soon as I did... everything shut off. I then heard shuffling in the distance and thought I saw a tail go into some bushes over near the train station. I figured it was probably just some raccoon or something, the area back there was completely surrounded by national forests and animals turn up all if the time, so I completely forgot about it and went about the rest of the night. 

During my shift the next morning though I heard some very disturbing news about that area. A rat was found gutted and smeared all over Minnie's house floor. The official story was that it was killed by a possum or two but the amount of carnage involved seemed suspicious to me.  

Anyways, it was business as usual of course. The amount of situations at this park that could happen before there is any change in operation is truly astounding. That was until later in the evening I saw a batch of policemen and security officers crowded around mainstreet strategizing something. For that amount of them to be all gathered around one place meant something definitely must have happened. I found one of my leaders standing over on a sidewalk staring over at the group. I asked her what had happened.she said she wasn't sure but heard something about a baby going missing. I had never heard about anything like that happening in these parks so That really freaked me out.  

By the time I did my sweep later that night it was about 2 in the morning. I did all of my normal tasks but I was certainly dreading getting to Toontown. I was still kind of shook up by the events of from the night before.even though I knew they were honestly pretty much normal. So by the time I got to the area I was relieved to see that the lights and sound effects were not on. 

I approached an empty trash can I'm front of Minnie's house and noticed through the window that the cartoon refrigerator was still open. I figured that one of the crazy interns must have forgotten to shut the door when they closed down the park for the night. So I walked inside the house and went to the kitchen to close it but when I tried it didn't close all the way. Fear suddenly surged through my Veins, I automatically knew something was wrong. I slowly opened the refrigerator door and witnessed to my horror a baby inside, lifeless and cold. 

In a panic, I radioed my supervisor and told him what had happened. He told me to get outside the house immediately and that the police were on there way. Then a number of boxes and items got knocked down In one of the rooms  behind me and somebody ran out of the door. Too terrified to move I stood there and watched as a man like thing with a tail skittered past the window. 

I immediately went outside, desperate to see what it was,  It was gone. The police arrived soon after, I told them everything, when no one was paying attention I saw something on the kids coaster, it looked like a silhouette...of Mickey Mouse 

I am now writing this 3 weeks after this incident. I was the obvious suspect for killing that baby, My family stopped talking to me, not even my therapist beleives me. But you believe me, right?"
o6p40d,3,2021-06-23,How to approach a recruiter about new grad opportunities,DiningFancy,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/o6p40d/how_to_approach_a_recruiter_about_new_grad/,"Hi everyone, 

I'm currently in a summer internship at a big finance company. I'm a Financial Analyst Co-op for the summer and I got my job because I was contacted by a recruiter from the company about my position. The company only had 1 general posting for all summer intern positions and she mentioned that my application/profile seemed like a good fit for my position. I interviewed with the hiring manager and got the job and I haven't talked to the recruiter since I was hired in late April. 

I started networking with some people at the company and learned about a rotational program they have for new grads to spend 3 years rotating through different positions at the company. I spoke with a few people who are currently in the program or recently completed it, and they all told me it's super competitive and having connections at the company is a really big plus when applying. I also found out through chatting with someone currently in the program that the recruiter who reached out to me about my position is also the main recruiter in charge of applicant relations for the rotational program. 

I haven't reached out this recruiter since I got the email telling me I'm hired. I sent her an email to thank her and spoke with her over the phone to confirm some details but other than that I haven't had any contact with her. I obviously know now that I should probably try to get a zoom coffee chat set up with her or something just so she remembers me but I'm not sure how to go about it. I don't want her to realize the my main reason for reaching out is that she is closely involved with the program I wanna apply to. 

I'm gonna be entering my final year of uni in the fall, so I'm gonna be applying to the new grad program when September rolls around and I was hoping to get some advice on how to reach out to this recruiter and hopefully leave a good impression with her so she remembers me when applications start coming in lol"
o6p88q,5,2021-06-23,Advice from a nobody who landed an Intel internship as a freshman,CantStopDoingTheCode,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/o6p88q/advice_from_a_nobody_who_landed_an_intel/,"Been lurking here for months and finally decided to make a post about my experience finding an internship.

As the title states, I started an internship at Intel as a developer this month. I’ve just completed my freshman year at a state university and had no prior work experience or really anything exceptional on my resume. I’ve learned a few things that I wish I knew last fall, so here it goes:

1. Start applying next month. I’m 100% serious in saying that you should apply ASAP to maximize the number of people who read your resume. Speaking of maximizing applications,

2. It’s a numbers game. As I mentioned previously, there was nothing exceptional on my resume that stood out enough to land me interviews consistently. With no exaggeration, I applied to literally *hundreds* of internships in hopes that something stuck. I’d estimate that 3-4% of my applications went further than an instant rejection, but my response rate back after the initial coding test/interview was far higher (closer to 75%).

3. Your resume is just to get you in the door. After that, it’s up to your interview to get you farther. Leaving an impression on the interviewer is much more memorable than a list of qualifications on a piece of paper, so you should focus most on acing the interview. I’d also say that interview skills aren’t as important as people make them out to be as long as you are knowledgeable in the field that you’re applying for. Especially in my case (given that I had no prior interview experience), I believe that my problem solving and subject knowledge is what set me apart and what you should focus on. The interviewer is going to forget your umms, uhhs, and awkward pauses, but not your unique skills.

4. This one is gonna sound cheesy, but don’t be content even after you get an offer in writing from a company. Way back in March, I began work at a local company that offered me an internship position. Happy as I was that I got something, I continued applying and got another offer from a larger, more prestigious company that also paid more, as well as my Intel internship. Had I not kept applying, I’d still be doing a whole lotta nothing at my old internship.

 5. Stretch your skills. This is especially true for CS internships, as having a longer list of skills makes you more desirable. Even if you’re not entirely familiar with a programming language for example, it’s not like the interview will happen the moment you get the email. You’ll have time to research and prepare beforehand, and the best way to do so is reading a list of a hundred interview questions about the subject. However, this only works if you’re confident in your ability to learn what you write down, so use this tip sparingly ;)

Hopefully this helps someone, and I’d be happy to hear what others have to say on the topic!"
o6pbfe,2,2021-06-23,How to create my own opportunities?,cnahik,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/o6pbfe/how_to_create_my_own_opportunities/,"Some background:  I'm currently a student working at an internship that I really enjoy.  Ideally when I graduate in the spring, I would like to keep working on the same program because I am already accustomed to it and I really enjoy the work I am doing. 


Recently, some higher up managers at the company mentioned that ""creating your own opportunities"" is the best way to succeed and get the career you want.  However, I'm not sure how to go about doing something like that. 


There's another location for the company with the same program I am on near my university's campus, so I was thinking about trying to ""create an opportunity"" and see if I could get a part-time co-op there while at school for the next 2 semesters.  I've already worked in this other location some and I have met and talked to some of the supervisors there, but they don't currently have a co-op position for what I am doing.


Basically, what I am asking is:

Should I try to ""create"" this position for myself to get better experience within the program?

And how could I go about actually ""selling"" my abilities and knowledge of the program to possibly make this opportunity a reality?


I would really appreciate any advice anyone has to offer!"

I am trying to decide if I should job hop to this new company. My current company is fine to work for, however I do not think there is too much more room upwards in terms of promotions at the moment. My current company also only gives about 2-4% raises each year, and  an extra 4% if you were to get a promotion. I have already learned most of what there is to learn in this role as well.

Background:

* 24 YO
* Bachelors of Engineering 
* 1 year full-time experience, half a year internships 

Here is a comparison list I have made:

||Current Company|New Company w/ Offer|
|:-|:-|:-|
|General|Engineering consulting firm whose bread and butter is nuclear energy and utilities. Used to be an employee owned company with ESOP, but was recently sold to a private firm. ""employee owners"" did not have much say in this. Bonuses are now discretionary and are reserved for the top 10% ish (mangers, etc). I have proven myself to be a top-tier entry employee , but my salary bump did not seem to recognize that. I did not argue this, though|Fortune 500 company engineering firm focused on aerospace and defense. Google Finance says their revenue has increased by about 1.5B/year over the last 5 years. Lots of government contracts. Same line of work as my current employer, however I would be taking on more responsibility and being the ""mid-level engineer"" with a pretty fast track to higher leadership positions if things go well.|
|Revenue|$100 - $500 million|$10 billion+|
|Salary|$72,500|$82,000 (+13% increase)|
|Stock Options|No longer has ESOP|Can purchase company stock on NYSE at 10% discount each quarter|
|Scope of Work|Fairly entry-level. I am at the point where I have a good grasp on the company dynamics, etc. I am considered one of the better employees who are great at what they do, however I do not feel there is much more for moving up the ladder anytime soon (they promote from within, so those who have been there 2-3+ years were already promoted and there is no need for further leadership roles at this point)|I would be performing basically the same work, but just at a different company. I do think I would be able to get more experience with some important softwares. Potential to move around into different areas of this huge company on down the road. In the interview I was told I would also be helping train entry people on current standards for this specific utility company I am very familiar with. They are basically starting from scratch here to build a team for this massive amount of work, and I have a skill-set they need.|
|Remote Work Policy|Fully remote for now until this fall. Company has mentioned they will implement a hybrid schedule (2 days in the office, 3 days at home if you like)|Expectation would be I go into the office to help train, etc. Once things are up and running remote work could be discussed.|
|Flexibility|Very flexible on hours, can work alternate work schedules, easy to get PTO approved, etc.|Very flexible in terms of working (come in later to avoid traffic in need be, stay later, etc).|
|Team Size|Huge ramp up this year to account for new projects by huge utility company. About 60 employees and looking to continue hiring some entry, probably cap at 80-90|Currently has 6-8 employees.. Was told they are looking to ramp up to 60-70 by years end.|
|Commute|15min (one-way)|30-35min (one-way) \*\*probably will be more with traffic, route is notorious for wrecks|
|401K Match|3% match on 6% of salary|100% match on 5% of salary|
|Paid Holidays|8: 7 fixed, 1 floating|10: 7 fixed, 3 floating|
|PTO Days|15 days each year|15 days each year|
|Culture|Very laid back and flexible, average age range for team is like 75% under 27 years old. Supervisors/leads/""bosses"" easy to get along with|Un-sure of it at the moment, but from the interview my direct report seems okay.|
|Overtime Policy|Paid for OT at a rate of 1x|Un-sure|

Overall, my current role is becoming a little stagnant and I am not feeling like I will get a solid promotion in the next year, maybe even 2 years depending. However, my current employer is a pleasure to work for (the people on the projects I work on that is). Very understanding and you can ""goof off"" at home sometimes when work is low if you want to honestly.

For the potential employer I would be 100% moving up to the next level of ""mid-level"" engineer with only 1 year of full-time experience. I would be helping them get their same project from the same big utility firm off the floor. I feel like I would be able to get a jumpstart on my career development, but not sure if it is worth the great gig I have now.

Any advice would be appreciated."

I’ll have a placement year after the year starting this September so I want to have finished the Odin course before this year ends so that I can be more prepared when applying for internships more related to what I want to do, in the following year."

I don't hate the job, I get flexible hours, and I'm friends with a lot of my coworkers since a lot of them are my age. I live in Cali, and get paid $15/hr, which is the base pay for everyone that works there. I actually got a little mad when I saw they posted a job hiring saying they pay $15, when my last paycheck was $14.50, and I would say I work harder than most of the people there.  

  
Anyways, I feel like I could be doing much better, in terms of pay and the experience I gain. I'm thinking of getting a job at a real restaurant for the pay and tips. I did hear however from my old coworker who now works at a restaurant that they subctract her salary by some amount based on her tips. 

I also looked into retail, something like T-Mobile or best buy, but the pay at restaurants seem to be higher.

A flexible part-time schedule for me would be ideal, since I am trying to do some of my own web development projects, and also picking up some skills like digital art, learning Japanese.

I am pursuing Computer Science in college. I had an unpaid zoom internship last semester of high school through my schools internship program, although I felt like I didn't really learn much from it. For my skillset, getting a paid internship would be nearly impossible, and after browsing around the internet, and on r/cscareerquestions, it seems like unpaid internships would be a waste of time, and that I should focus on my projects for my portfolio instead.

I did apply for a few Data entry jobs, but all have been rejected. I don't have any real experience with it though, aside from having learned Microsoft Access and Excel from school.

TLDR: I worked at McD for 1.5yrs, should I go to a real restaurant, retail,  or some other entry level job I might not know of"

A few months ago I got reached out by a recruiter from a small startup. Eventually I got an offer - the terms agreed were to test it out for the Winter period and (they hope) see if it’s doable to extend throughout Year 3.

From the very first day the work was interesting and very rewarding; the culture is also amazing: everyone (&lt;20 employees) knows each other and gets along very well (there’s only 2 other interns).

Couple of weeks in, I get a callback and subsequent offer from a big name, prestigious company. Completely different industries but still technical roles (this new one is a bit more focused on my interests - also pays a tiny bit less surprisingly).

This looks like an incredible opportunity for me. However, I don’t want to burn any bridges.

Does switching jobs after only 2-2half months give a bad impression?

Am I wrong for having had my current employer waste time and training in me only to leave shortly thereafter?

Should I disclose this to my team?

If I were to take the opportunity- how do I phrase it, or not burn bridges? 

My friends tell me not to worry now but I have a few days to accept and it’s driving me (morally) insane!

Throwaway for safety - idek if posting this is the best option.

I'm currently a student in the U.S. and I'm looking towards spending a summer (2022) in Canada (I haven't been there in a decade and wanna spend some time in my home country). Optimally, I wanna do a fulltime internship while I am there. I'm looking for some tips.

Just a little bit about me: I'm a Canadian citizen, study CS at a ""recognizable"" college, and do not care about salary.

How frequently do big tech companies look for interns in Canada? Will Canadian employers be concerned if I apply as a U.S. student?"

I have been studying programming for the last couple of months a little over 200hours. I have gone through CodeCademy and Udemy for Java. I currently work full-time but study about 2 hours in the morning. My Bf has been a software engineer for about 13 years and has been tutoring me, but I feel like I am struggling to just solve Udemy challenges on my own.

I have a bachelors degree in Business Administration with a minor in Finance (F30). I do enjoy the problem solving of Java, but at the same time I am getting stressed and tired of feeling stuck. I know they say its normal and I know its hard, but I am looking to see if there are less stressful options.

I honestly feel like I need a teacher, but would rather not get into huge debt getting a masters degree/second bachelors in computer science as a lot of people have told me I don't need it. Then others tell me boot camps are seen in a negative light. I have heard revature is an option but that also has a lot of negative reviews.

If anyone can advice me on position that could lead to software internships or junior positions. Like software QA? Legit bootcamps? legit places that might be better than Ravature?

Edit: One of my biggest issues is loops.

TLDR; Anyone has advice for positions that could lead to becoming a software developer intern? What other places might have a more one on one approach to learning Java?

American ones are also appreciated but I’ve got a LOT of replies, so they pretty much already answered that one. Barely got answers with Canadian salaries so I’d really appreciate that :), and if someone happens to know something about the CS field in Newfoundland/St John’s… please DM me lol. That kinda info is pretty rare.


Hey! I’m moving to North America next year to get my Computer Science degree, and then work in the area. But the international tuition fees are _really_ expensive for international students, but I think it should be worth since I aways read how CS is a good area to get into, a lot of jobs, good pay and all.

And I’ve talked to quite some people in the field while I was doing research and they basically confirmed it, most of them made really good money and all, some even worked remotely and said they have very nice work hours, super flexible, etc etc.

 But I was talking with an American dude a few days ago and he basically said I should expect a 45k/year starting salary, 90k/year for recently graduates are insane, work culture in the US is toxic af... Is that true, or was he just exaggerating it? It really doesn’t match the past experience I had talking with people but idk, maybe the few people that use this sub are just the lucky ones?

So, what salaries should I actually expect after I graduate? (I know it depends on how many internships I got, projects I worked on the way, I’m just asking for like an average student. Not someone who got internships at microsoft, google, neither someone that has a 2.0, just an average guy).

(I’m mostly concerned about entry-level jobs salaries, but I’d also appreciate expected salary growth for the area, but I understand that that is way harder to tell).

Edit: one thing that might be worth noting: I’m not getting into CS for the money, I like the area, but universities here are free, but the pay is awful too (Brazil), so going to NA is my plan since, as far as I know, I could do what I like and get paid well for doing so. Which wouldn’t happen if the pay is as low as that dude described…"

I won't go into everything, but he has narcissistic abusive parents and their constant presence in our relationship was draining on my mental health, so I had to get out. When we first started dating, he took an immediate liking to my family and my family liked him as well. I think he saw them as the parents he never had, and I told him no matter what, whether or not we stayed together, my family and I would do everything we could to be there for him.

Flash forward, we break up after 10 months together because I just couldn't handle his family. I thought about the idea of possibly getting back together with him in the future, but honestly, I don't know I would want to. I think I was over the relationship for a while before I broke up with him and stayed with him because it was safe and comfortable. I feel like I knew with his situation it wasn't going to work out, and honestly, I've had more fun with my friends in the last 2 weeks than I had in the last 4 months with him.

Last night, my mom calls me and tells me that he called her. His parents have gotten worse and have given him an ultimatum: he gives them access to all his money and he lives on an allowance of $60/week or they kick him out. Why his parents did this, I don't know, but it's not abnormal for them to do stuff like this and honestly doesn't surprise me. My mom asked if I would be okay with him moving in with them for a bit (there would be a contract, he would pay a bit of rent, etc.) if he decides to leave (HE HAS NOT DECIDED TO LEAVE YET).

Now I'm conflicted. I want my family to be there for him. I still care about him, and I don't want him to end up homeless. But we just broke up, and I don't know I would be comfortable coming home if he were there. My mom asked me how I felt about the idea of him potentially living there for 3-6 months until he was stable enough on his own to afford a real apartment. I told her to help him in any way she feels comfortable, and I would figure things out as they progressed.

On one hand, I'm out of state for an internship right now and will be out of town for college for the most part, so if he's living there, I might be home with him for 2 weeks at the end of the summer, a week over thanksgiving, and four weeks over Christmas, maybe a month and a half total. On the other hand, how do I live with someone I literally just broke up with, especially since I know he still has feelings for me and other than friendship I feel none for him?

I want to do the right thing and help out someone in need, but I don't know what the right thing to do here is. Is it helping him and potentially putting my mental health at risk or is it not being there for him and protecting my own comfort zone? I care about him. I don't want him put out on the streets or feeling like he has nowhere to go, but how do I handle him moving in with my parents if that's what happens?

I'd really appreciate some advice. I'm glad my parents are willing to help him, and I want to help him too; I just wish the circumstances were different so I could be more comfortable with it."

My full-time employer decided not to renew my contract. I want to use my business as ""resume"" to apply for marketing/business/ecom role.

**Background**

I'm a Linux sysadmin for 7 years with an IT degree. Around May 2020, I started my first ecom business on Shopify selling fitness equipment because I chanced upon a product I love a ton. There are plenty of similar products in my local market but none has the quality of this one. 

So I sourced the product from China, made a small order, tested the demand in second-hand marketplace without paid ads, sold-out, collected some pre-orders, made a bigger order, sold out. Then I decided to go for it. Set up a store on Shopify, registered a company and gets thing rolling. 

I'm a big fan of DIY and always a have a passion in trading stuff. Although I love technology and would call myself a nerd, I know working as IT person all my life is not what I want.

I want freedom. I like the idea of having the ability to make money without any physical limitation. So I can work anywhere I want, owning my time. I think ecommerce checks all the boxes. 

**Growing the business on the side**

I love my current job, because it is so chilling and flexible that I can use the idle time to learn about the my new side-hustle.

I have totally zero business or marketing experience prior to this business, but I'm super keen to learn. Of course, the lack of budget forced me to pick up skills that I wouldn't learn if not for this business.

* I think paying a fortune for someone to run digital ads for me is damn silly. I started to learn about paid ads from FB &amp; IG to Google. 
* I have high standard in graphic and I love art, so I get a iPad Pro and Affinity apps to learn basic illustration and photo editing.
* I shoot all product photos mostly with my phone. 
* I cannot afford a fitness model, so I diet and train up to be my own model. 
* I know I can't always relying on paid ads, so I start to learn and apply SEO on the website.
* I was not a social media guy but I know IG works wonder in my niche, so I start a business account, learn to create super-engaging content instead of just posting boring product images. 

The list goes on. I have learnt a ton and was super glad I took the first step one year before. I stopped FB ads earlier this year after spending $3k per month for 7 months. Google ads is the new champ for me, high buying intent and higher ROAS. And I believe my SEO effort starts to taking effect, that I get more organic orders from Google everyday. 

**My boss decided not to renew my contract**

I was kinda expected this is coming as the company is not doing really well. But when it becomes a reality, that I'm no longer a salaried man and going to be my own boss, is very exciting and terrifying at the same time. 

Despite the good performance in recent month from my side-hustle, it can't gave me 100% sense of security since I can't be sure if the demand was only seasonal. That's why I'm looking for a another stable source of income.

I know I can quickly land on a new tech job on my local market (recruiters have been hunting me hard), but I've lost my passion in tech job. 

I would rather take a huge pay cut and take a job that is going to help my business. It can be anything like digital marketing, ecom-related stuff, product design, graphic design, brand building. The problem is, I'm not coming from that background and I don't really want to start from super fresh position like intern.

**Can I use my 100k business as ""resume"" to back my application for job like head of marketing, or any similar managerial roles?** Has anyone here been on the same boat? I honestly think I'm better than those experts in the field who have never ran their own business. 

This is a super bold idea for me to apply a higher-level job with just ""experience"". I was raised to believe that one has to be certified or formally educated in order to be employed.

I'm not saying I will give up the side-hustle, that will never happen. But if given an opportunity in a company with more resources that can enhance my skills further, I will focus more on the job and let my business running on the side on its own."

At a bit of a crossroads right now and thought I could ask for advice here.

I'm currently set to start my PhD this fall, in a country basically across the world from me. I'm really excited and can't wait to get over there and meet my cohort, advisor, etc. 

To give some context, I just finished my Masters about two weeks ago. The last 3/4 months of this were really tough and I was pushing through burnout nearly every day for the last month.

During the process of applying for my PhD, I got an internship thats pretty related to my intended PhD topic. I just started this internship on Monday, and its interesting, fairly chill, but still a full time job (literally, 40 hrs a week). It is supposed to last 3 months until the week before I leave for my PhD.

Even though its a bad look all around (in my advisors eyes and obviously the internship companies eyes), I am considering dropping out of the internship to take some time off before I start my PhD. I think that this would benefit me by letting me be well rested and avoid burnout in the first year. However, I don't want to lose out on connections from the internship company (who seem to like me very much so far), and also don't want to piss my advisor off, since the internship was definitely taken into consideration as part of my acceptance to the PhD program.

In my position, what would you do? Push a bit and do the internship, or take 3 months to relax before I work hard for the next 4 years?"

Took month and half off to clear my head and since then I’ve been applying for jobs.  
  
I use the terms “applying for jobs” loosely here because I’ve fallen into a rut. The rut being I’m a total idiot.  
  
I’ve fallen into this state of sadness where these rejection letters demotivate me. When I’m at my least motivated state, I don’t study, I don’t leetcode I don’t code I avoid it all.  
  
Weirdly enough during that moment of avoidance, I get a response from a company. I get a coding challenge. I attempt the coding challenge, always a difficult challenge. Fail and repeat this cycle.  
  
The next month is the same, brief moment of motivation, I apply for a lot of jobs, I start studying and coding. Get rejected, stop with everything…so on and so on. You get the point.  
  
What’s wrong with me? I must’ve applied close to 100 jobs now. Maybe 5-10 responses. I’ve had a previous internship at a startup that doesn’t exist. I live in the Silicon Valley, went to a no name state school.  
  
Before I keep rambling, any advice on my situation? It’s month 6 now, and it seems like I’m starting over every month. I’m literally insane, doing the same thing expecting different results."

Company 2 - Asked me about MLOps concepts,  and everything about ML in the cloud, and in production.

Company 3 - Asked me about big data technologies and software engineer type of questions (data structures and algorithms)

o77jif,1,2021-06-24,What has worked for you? Am I alone in this feeling?,MaterialPossible6750,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/o77jif/what_has_worked_for_you_am_i_alone_in_this_feeling/,"I've never really posted much on Reddit, but I use it religiously when searching for products or looking for advice on things. I also have never shared my story, but I am having a tough day and felt like today would be a good day to do so.

I am a 26 year old male that suffers from anxiety/depression. I have been dealing with this subconsciously my whole life, but didn't really become consciously aware of it until I was a senior in college (4+ years ago). Growing up, I was fully involved with 3 sports a year (football, baseball, basketball) and had a lot of friends. I never struggled to make friends and continued playing sports all the way through high school, doing pretty well. I graduated with high honors and I went off to college and joined a fraternity after my freshman year. I remained on the Dean's List every semester of college and maintained a great social life outside of school. I was involved in IM sports, had a lot of friends, and never had less than 4 roommates. Life was good - really good.

Once I got to my senior year of college, I started to become aware of some things that looking back have likely always been there, but I have always had a distraction, whether it be sports or social gatherings, so it never really impacted me. For whatever reason, I was struggling putting down meals, I mean every single meal. It felt as if my stomach was at my throat and I was consistently gagging/dry heaving. At the time, I think the reality of graduating and starting a job in the real world was setting in and caused a great deal of anxiety, rightfully so. By February of my Senior year, I had accepted a year long internship upon graduation working in an athletic department at my dream school. It was a dream job out of college. I was scared, but happy and excited to start this chapter.

Less than a month into my job, I started having some real struggles with sleeping, more specifically in the morning. I would wake up on a consistent basis ready to throw up, with no appetite whatsoever. It was as if I was hungover every single day and I wasn't drinking at all. I couldn't eat anything, especially in public with friends/family. In high school and growing up, I was always able to eat a ton of food regardless of what was going on around me. I saw numerous doctors, therapists, and psychiatrists. Doctors thought it was acid reflux, so I have been taking Prilosec OTC the last 4 years, which definitely does help. Psychiatrists thought it was anxiety/depression, so I was prescribed .25mg of Xanax to be taken up to 3 times daily. This helped dramatically out of the gates. However, I was still having an extremely tough time eating food. I just wasn't hungry and couldn't stomach food. This began impacting energy levels and motivation among other things.

I got through that year, although quite miserably, and started a new job in a sales training program with a top apparel brand. I went through 8 months of extensive training and the majority of my issues continued. I had learned how to live with them, but it certainly wasn't healthy and there were days I just wanted to give up and would get extremely frustrated with life. Everything is perfect in my life, why do I feel this way? And how much longer do I have to suffer? These are questions that often ran through my head. Again, I was going through training and was going to be assigned a territory without a clue of where that was, so I understand I had some anxiety. However, it was making every day a nightmare for me and I simply wanted to get through each day. I found that smoking weed has helped me considerably. Even just a hit of a bowl at night can calm me down and relax me - it was the only thing that worked. It was around this time I had my first panic attack. This was the most terrifying experience of my life. I went home for lunch and out of nowhere, I couldn't breathe and my heart was beating out of control. That is all I remember. I woke up a few minutes later and was on the ground of my bathroom with a lump on my forehead from briefly blacking out and collapsing. I took the rest of the day off.

I went back to work without really missing a beat the next day. I was embarrassed as all hell from the bump on my forehead and I couldn't tell people the truth. It was painful, as a lot of people simply don't understand how crippling anxiety can be unless they've experienced or seen someone first hand go through it. I got through it. I was fine. Following training, I was assigned a territory more than 750 miles from where I grew up, went to school, and originally started my career. I was excited, very excited for a new chapter and to finally get my feet underneath me in my career. I should also note that I have an extremely loving family, one that is consistently in my corner, and one that is always willing to help. I am the youngest of 3 siblings and my parents have been married for 37 years. They get this stuff to a degree and we've all experienced it in some sort. I've never really explained the depths of mine because in reality, it sounds kind of crazy.

Anyways, I was now in my own territory halfway across the country and this is when my anxiety accelerated significantly. I was terrified. I couldn't control it. My first year in the new role, I was doing well, but outside of work, I was struggling terribly. I was throwing up on a daily basis, I mean every single morning. I am a very upbeat, positive person, or at least I always have been and I found myself crying alone in my closet, often. Any large meetings where food was provided, I stomached as much as I could and often times had to go throw up in the bathroom. You would NEVER pick up on this or guess it from the outside, as I had mastered how to make things look great to others, when inside I was crumbling. I wasn't sure what to do.

After 6 months, my girlfriend (of now 6 years) moved in with me. She definitely saved my life. She saw first hand what I was going through and I felt terrible. We both felt helpless over controlling basic aspects of my life. It got so bad to the point, I had 2 straight months of barely being able to get out of bed. I would throw up and hop into my office, trying to work as much as possible.

At this point, I was prescribed Lexapro to help. The first week I was on the medication was one of the worst weeks of my life. My body reacted terribly to it. I was stuck on the couch with a bucket to throw up into for about a week and couldn't stomach any food. My doctor told me to continue on with it, so I did. After about a month of the medication, I decided it wasn't really doing a whole lot for me, and likely impacting me in more of a negative than positive way. This was all prior to my 2 month issue of not being able to get out of bed. Fast forward to after that 2 month period and we decided that maybe a Hypno Therapist could help me out. It had helped my brother, so why not give it a shot? I gave it a shot and it did seem to help, but not to the point where it was life changing for me. I was still struggling with the same issues.

Being in sales, it requires a lot of communication with people on a consistent basis, which I do enjoy. However, it is incredibly difficult when you feel this way on a consistent basis and quite frankly, I feel like it is holding my life back. Following hypno therapy, I continued on with my regular medications and the roller coaster my life had become internally. I would have 3 amazing weeks followed by 3 awful weeks. It was no fun and I had no reasoning behind it, it fucking sucked. I was now experiencing the same issues mostly around appetite and sleep for 3 years straight, which felt like a lifetime.

Fast forward to 2021 and I decided that maybe it was time for change with my psychiatrist. He didn't really seem to care much for my well being and I had never given anyone else a shot. I have tried therapy multiple times, but it just doesn't do much for me. I really don't have many issues in my life, so I become even more discouraged when trying to unravel things when there's nothing to unravel. I switched to a new psychiatrist and she seemed so much better for me. She instantly came up with a plan for me to get off of my xanax and start living life to its fullest.

I am in such a better place now than I was even a couple of years ago, but I still am nowhere where I want to be and feel like I'm almost stuck. I had another panic attack about a month ago where I collapsed, but didn't black out. I felt paralyzed, like I couldn't control my breath or heart. Again, this was terrifying for me. I make great money, have a solid job, have friends I talk to on a regular basis, and I exercise routinely. My goal is to eventually get back to where I am from, as that is where most all of my friends and family are. However, I know that won't fix this issue in its entirety. My mind is still consistently telling me how much I suck, how I'm lacking in things, how I'm no good, and just constantly beating me up. It exhausts me, especially when I have to act like nothing is wrong. I even received a highly effective rating with my job during my annual review, which only a few people out of about a hundred people in my position receive. I can't point to a single thing that is genuinely wrong in my life, yet I still feel like absolute shit every single day when I wake up.

The mornings are far and away the worst for me. I wake up almost in a panic every single morning. It has consumed me, consumed my life. My chest hurts, my heart beats fast, my body is tense/restless, and I'm consumed with thinking about every single thing I have to do over the next few months. If I forget something, my mind beats me up until I remember, even if it is as simple as a thought to drink water. I don't feel like I am living anywhere near as full of a life as I was living when I was even 15 years old. I can't eat or rarely can unless I smoke weed (no, I am not reliant on eating with weed, as a lot of times I still can't eat). When I wake up, it feels like I am almost out of breath, my thoughts start racing, and I can't go back to sleep. No matter the time I go to bed, it is the same time every single morning and it wares me out quickly. I am nauseous, as well and I almost feel hungover when I wake up. By Thursday of each week, I am so tired that I don't want to do anything.

I have worked with my psychiatrist through some of this stuff, but with little success. He wants me to try Prozac, but I am strongly against it. I don't feel depressed at all and I have felt that way before. I don't feel the urge to cry a ton or go be alone like I used to. Sure, I feel that sometimes, but not to the point where it seems to alter my life. I guess I am just extremely discouraged at this point and just want this to go away. I am sick of living with it and I have never met anyone with the same morning issues or even eating issues for as long as I have had them. It's like my brain did a 180 one day and I can't get it back. One therapist had told me she feared I wouldn't live past 25 years old if I continued on with this. She was trying to motivate me I believe, but it scared the shit out of me. I did make it past 25 years old and I'm here at 26. I just want to know that this will get better for me and I'm struggling to hold onto faith.

My girlfriend always tells me, ""I wish you could see in yourself what everybody else sees in you."" I think about that quote all of the time and it tears me apart. I don't want to think like this, I don't want to feel like this, so why why why do I continue to feel this way every single day? I look around and my life feels damn near perfect. To anyone else, if there is anyone that feels this way, you are not alone. I am here and would love to talk. I am so sick of living life like this and just want to feel how I deserve to feel. Thank you for anyone who read this novel and I hope I am not alone in some of these feelings. It really can be tough and another reminder that you truly have no idea what someone is going through. Things can look perfect, but that person could be dying inside. I feel that is where my life is at and I don't know how to continue on. I'm stuck and would appreciate any advice."

On the other hand, I'm also thinking I could stay at my current school, work very hard prepping and try to land a good internship before graduation? I might possibly be getting a research position at my school, so that might help lead to further opportunities.

I was wondering if I could hear some opinions from those who are transfers? This is a tough decision, so I really appreciate any advice I can get."

Going into it, I knew I’d be dealing with a lot of verilog, which is exactly what I wanted. However, they are having me learn to use YAML, which I personally had never even heard of before having this position. Is this something that companies normally use? Is it worthwhile to really learn to use this past the internship besides if I wanted to continue working with this company after graduation? It doesn’t seem like a terribly complicated language, but there’s a decent bit of learning I’m going to have to do to in order to understand using it."

It’s an exam that will give me a certification for the field I want to work in (IT). I failed the exam for it twice.

What now? I feel down. I needed a 650 to pass and received a 520 on my first time and a 551 on my second time.

I got a summer internship but am still living with my parents and want to move out, especially to a far away city like NYC."

This is a follow up to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/chipdesign/comments/nl9san/ee_student_wanting_to_become_analog_ic_designer/) here, where I discuss some general career goals in chip design. I'll repeat a lot of what was said there for readability sake.

I'm currently in my 3rd year of electrical engineering at the University of Calgary and *my dream is to become an analog IC designer at a top technology company.* ***I hope to improve my chances of grad school between now and when I apply in December 2022.***

**My application metrics at a glance:**

* GPA is 3.62/4.00 and my last 60 credits are 3.75/4.00
* Target GRE score is 165Q/160V/4.0AW (Have not taken it yet)
* Several internships on an ASIC team (one digital and one analog)
* Worked closely with a professor on an advanced FPGA project
* Several personal electronics projects advised by another professor (discrete high speed FET amp)

After reviewing several of the comments from the last post and speaking to some university advisors the common theme I see is research experience. Does a professor mentoring you on a project count as ""research experience?""

**I am concerned about my lack of no formal research experience:**

* Should I try and get some with a professor before I submit my application?
* How much do they expect from undergrads?
* Should I go for a MSc first at another school? Will that improve my chances of a PhD?

**I'm most interested in the CMOS Analog IC thesis with Professor Stephen Lewis at the UC Davis Solid state circuit research lab.**"

I don't understand where this is coming from. I am a summer intern so far 1 month in to this position and I have always completed my tasks before target dates as well and am constantly asking for more work to be given to me.

One side of me thinks I'm being a pussy and need to man up a little and stop thinking about it too much but then again I overthink a lot. TBH that kind of made my motivation for this job go down a lot. That sucks to hear when you are giving it your all. I feel like my work isn't appreciated and it hurts.

I have no experience, so I’m applying to entry level jobs there. I have graduated from college in December with a business degree with an option in IT. 


I am moving from the west coast to the east coast.  I am working to get my Comptia ITF and A+ and am working with a placement company to help me find a job here and have gotten a part time internship to get some experience. I also have an interview coming up for a part time job. 

How hard will it be for me to get a job here, especially considering I am not too picky about the company I work for, as long as I can live and work in NYC one day?"

I'm a worrier, so even in January/February when everyone thought the virus was a joke, I was doomsday prepping. Right before lockdown started, one of my parents (keeping it general neutral for privacy purposes) got COVID - we had to put up a fight for them to get tested as tests were limited, and that was at the time when they said to stay home from the hospital unless your dying. 10 days home, 15 days in the hospital not knowing if they were gonna make it, and still quarantining after returning home - a total of 7 weeks they were locked up and bedridden. That parent is the sole provider of my house, if they died, my other parent and I would not be able to survive financially. I also plan to work in their business once I graduate, without them, not only did I lose my mentor, but I would have to sell the business as I couldn't take it over yet. I already have high blood pressure, and during this time it reached 200/140. Once they were going to be ok, it was still a long road to recovery. Then the protests started, and I got even more distraught as this country is going permanently down the toilet. Oh yeah, and to top it off, I was academically dismissed from college because I wasn't allowed to take a makeup exam (from when I was sick the previous semester) until we got back to campus which was not going to be for the foreseeable future. I also love traveling and going to concerts, and if theres any 2 hobbies you can't do during the lockdown, of course it was those 2. I started to feel like I lost myself.

Fortunately I was able to transfer to the other location of my school to finish my degree (finally graduating this year!) and found purpose through schoolwork. Since there was nothing else to do I grinded school work and have gotten pretty much straight A's through the past 41 credits I've taken in the past 8 months. But then I got the COVID vaccine, had extremely negative reaction (hyperacusis/tinnitus and a blind spot in one eye) and it absolutely destroyed me. I experienced severe panic attacks and developed severe hypochondria, which led to diagnosis of OCD. OCD is horrific, I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. And now my OCD has gotten a hold on the same thoughts I had last summer about feeling lost and without purpose, and distorted them into me thinking that things may never get better. I work 14.5 hours a day (full time internship + summer classes) 4 days a week. When I'm working and distracted I feel pretty normal, I have purpose and function. But when I'm not distracted by work boy am I driving myself crazy lol. When I do have a minute to go outside or go out on the weekends, I'm overthinking every aspect of it. It just sucks I can't tell what's pandemic boredom/gloom and whats OCD.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has tips on how to recover from the post-pandemic/lockdown mental health implications I'd really appreciate it. I just kinda got used to being home, seeing few people, and not doing much that now it seems impossible to feel ""normal"" again. Also here to talk if anyone is going through similar struggles :)"

o7c768,157,2021-06-24,UMD CS Grad '10 - What Life's Been Like Since &amp; Tips for CS Students,webren,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/o7c768/umd_cs_grad_10_what_lifes_been_like_since_tips/,"Hey everyone,

I recently discovered the UMD sub reddit and noticed a lot of posts are around the Computer Science program and the challenges around it. I majored in Computer Science and minored in Math, and I graduated in 2010. I figured I would share what my experience has been in the job market post-graduation and some tips I wish people told me when I was a student.

**Background**

I completed 2 years at a Maryland community college, majoring in CS and took a bunch of electives and Calc I. Everything transferred to UMD successfully except for the programming courses. When I started at UMD in '06, I had most of my electives done and started with CS 131 and Calc II.

**If I Could Talk to My Student-Self Now / I Wish Someone Told Me This Sooner**

* **Your GPA does not matter.** Holy hell I spent so much energy worrying about grades and my overall GPA. No company or interviewer has ever asked me for my GPA. I have friends who graduated with me that had an overall GPA in the 2.0s and they're very successful. Seriously, it's OK if you get some Cs in  these classes. Some CS classes are truly difficult. Because of the program's rigor and rankings, most companies I've interviewed with in my career see the school name and degree and they're impressed with that alone. What's funny is I don't even remember my GPA. Who cares?

* **It gets easier in the 300-400 courses (except 351 - Algorithms)**. The 100-200 courses are all weed out courses, so they're supposed to be hard. With the exception of the cornerstone Algorithms course, the other 300 and 400 classes weren't as bad.

* **Join a consistent study group immediately.** After my first semester, my GPA average was 2.6 and I dropped out of one of the CS classes. I was really worried and contemplated changing my major but had no idea what to change it to. I re-took the CS class I dropped in the summer and met a group that today are some of my best friends and we still live in the DC area and are close. These guys were my rock and we studied constantly together and took almost all of the same classes. Find your people. I honestly don't think I would've made it without them. Do not do this program solo.

* **The program will make you a good problem solver.** Almost every person I met in the workforce that's graduated UMD CS is sharp and can solve tough problems. Embrace the hurt - it will grow you and you will be able to work with some of the smartest people in the field after graduation.

* **I encourage you to switch majors if you're doing this only for the money.** I was a TA for CS 132 in my junior and senior years, and I helped so many students who were going for a CS degree because of the money or because of family pressure. Every single one of these students eventually switched majors or failed the class (or a future class in the 200s). Even though these classes are hard, you should enjoy them (especially when you figure out a tough problem or all of your public tests pass after code submission). I always say - CS at UMD is kind of like being a masochist. You have to love the pain. If you absolutely hate it, get out.


**After Graduation**

The job market has been good for CS majors and continues to be good. Don't stress too much about finding a job after graduation - there are plenty of them out there. I highly recommend doing an internship or two in your junior and senior years and create relationships with the people you work with. You may very well come back to the same company and work there full time. I did exactly that. I interned at a company and worked there for over 9 years after graduation. You will also make good money. After my 3rd year post-grad, I was in the six figures. If you're able to land a job at Google, Microsoft, Facebook, or another company that prints money, you may be making six figures right after graduation. Life is great - bought a large home in DC, have traveled around the world, and continue making good money thanks to the CS program. Hang in there and I hope my post was helpful!"

o7e1z9,22,2021-06-24,I think i am being exploited. Would It be bad to talk to HR or should i just quit?,belissar,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/o7e1z9/i_think_i_am_being_exploited_would_it_be_bad_to/,"Hi guys.

I (23m) am an HSSE intern in a large shipping Company. We basically do support work for the ships.

I am actually a mechanical Engineering student and this job has nothing  to do  with my bachelor but i Felt like any experience is better than none and this was actually the best i could find at the time.

The job is Ok and people are Nice. The problem is that the ships operate 24/7 and this somehow appears to make people think i should be assisting 24/7. 

This week i got calls Every single day at 10:00 PM asking for info or for me to coordenate Jobs. Even on weekends!!

I try to assist the best i can but: 1- i dont have the authority to plan things on my own. 2- this is not the job i am being paid for.

I know that It is very Common for interns to be exploited but the laws in my country (Brazil) are that  interns cannot work more than 30 hrs a week and although i could understand doing a bit more i cannot stand 10 PM calls Every day.

This is killing me emotionally and i am having trouble focusing on my uni work because of the long hours.

I though about talking to HR but i dont want to be office persona non grata as i would like to be permanentely hired. They Just should pay me for the hours i am working.

How can i approach this? Or should i Just quit? I know these are some red flags but a job is better than no job"
o7ecu5,1,2021-06-24,Work anxiety,lanaoftheking,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/o7ecu5/work_anxiety/,"Hey. I’ve been dealing with some crappy thoughts for the past few years but now I feel like I got to the point where I just can’t live my life normally. I’m a 22M

Last year I got an internship which was really exciting, but it quickly became a nightmare to me. I usually tend to take things very personally. My boss was pretty strict, and I could feel her frustration everytime I messed up at minor things or asked for help for things that were basic. I consider myself pretty clumsy and not particularly smart. With no experience in the field I was working at (I was the only applicant for that position), I was problably the worst type of intern my boss couldn’t have gotten based on her personality and expectations. Anyway, to sum it up I sort of came to the conclusion that my boss thought I was just too lazy or too stupid to work with her. On top of that,due to covid I wasn’t able to interact with people from other departments and was paranoid all the time of catching it and infecting my family.

All of that was too stressful to me so I wanted to quit from day 1. I actually ended up working there for the full length of my contract since things got better when they fired my boss for other reasons 2 months into the job. However, everyday was just awful. I was anxious all the time. Every time my boss called me I would assume it was to call me out for some mistake or missed deadline. It was like being in a constant state of fear.

Two months ago I got a new job and things haven’t changed. I do over the phone translation, and I take medical / legal / insurance calls. Some of them are pretty serious (involving lawsuits or medical stuff) and sometimes it is very hard to do a good job for many reasons, like the quality of the line or stuff like that. 

Everyday I wake up very anxious thinking I might get a report for doing a bad job. It sort of feels like I worry too much about doing a bad job which gives me anxiety which ends up actually affecting my performance.This new job is actually very convenient to me since it pays well and I get to work 100% from home. However, this anxiety makes me wanna quit and it sucks. I wanna be able to have a job I actually enjoy.

This being the second time I get this feeling towards work makes me realize this is something that is coming from me so I would like to know if anybody has any advice or maybe activities or resources I could find only to try to overcome thais ‘work anxiety’ that I somehow developed over the years.

Thank you."
o7eqic,1741,2021-06-24,To those of you doubting yourselves,doughnuts_dev,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/o7eqic/to_those_of_you_doubting_yourselves/,"Quick background: I work at a big tech company you've probably all heard of. I'm \~3 years into my ""career"" and I just barely feel like I know what I'm doing.

I talk to a lot of high school CS students, early in career software engineers, and interns at my company. There's a common theme between almost every single person I've talked to: impostor syndrome. Some folks even ask me how get around it. My answer?

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

I find it funny because impostor syndrome is something I still deal with to this day. I feel like I just normalized the feeling of being confused, and got more confidence in my ability to ""figure it out."" Take it from someone who graduated high school with a 2.3 GPA and went to a college not known for its CS program because it was affordable:

YOU CAN DO IT! It's a tough road, but its satisfying and well worth it.

Dunno why I decided to write this but I hope someone who needs to see this does. Also forcing this post out to fight my own ""perfectionism"" that does more harm than good.

Edit: Now I understand why reddit posts that blow up have an ""Edit: RIP my inbox"" lol. Expect more ""tangible"" posts from me in the future! working on a ""what to expect in a whiteboard interview"" post."
o7eygj,1,2021-06-24,I want to quit my job for another job…,SeaOtterReddit,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/o7eygj/i_want_to_quit_my_job_for_another_job/,"This is a long story, please bare with me and try your best to follow.

Basically, I started as an intern for a company that is in my field. I worked there for a semester for college credit. They had asked me to return the next semester and this time be paid. While I did not have fun at the internship, I decided it is in my field, is good for the resume and therefore I should suck it up and do it for at least 2 days of the week along with my schoolwork. 

So along comes the summer and I’m in need of a full time job. What do you know my internship was able to offer me a job full time at a decent pay! Even though I again knew I didn’t really like it, I had thought I would be getting more responsibility and therefore I would be doing different things than I had. While that is maybe slightly true barely anything changed.

Now I’ve been working here full time for weeks and I literally hate it. It is repetitive, mind numbing desk work. I honestly believe I have some form of ADD/ADHD that has really really shown in this kind of environment. All my past jobs were physical and high paced moving jobs so I never really saw that side. When I’m here I straight up CANNOT focus. I’m on my phone, on my laptop, standing up, laying with my head down, fidgeting, playing games, surfing the web, etc. etc. etc. All my life I have always been an above and beyond employee… this is nothing like me. 

But I get so so bored. There is not enough for me to do, and when I have something to do it is so boring and a different thing but with the same means. For example a new project but it’s the same thing where I put words in an excel spreadsheet for 1500 rows. 

I keep trying to tell myself life could be so much worse but I can’t stand feeling useless, lethargic and mentally demotivated and drained from the job. 

I have just received a job offer from Target and Lowe’s. Originally I was going to do one as a second job and trim my hours slightly at the job I don’t like for extra money and to get less time spent in the bad job. But now Im wondering should I just quit the bad job and work purely Target and Lowe’s for the rest of the summer? The pay is the same or better. And the hours sound like they’re there. Both jobs would be interacting with people and involve being on my feet all day moving around. 

I feel obligated to stay at the bad job however. They are great people and very genuine and they want nothing but the best for me. I told them I would be there for the summer and I feel like I would be killing any plans they had to use me for and completely blindsiding them with leaving. Im also worried it would give me a bad rep with them where I can’t use them for a recommendation now or something down the line. While the work I do with them really has nothing to do with the career path I want to do. They are in my field and definitely well known and it’d be good to leave on good terms.

Is that even possible? Should I leave? If so how would I go about it? Should I suck it up?

This is a follow up to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/chipdesign/comments/nl9san/ee_student_wanting_to_become_analog_ic_designer/) here, where I discuss some general career goals in chip design. I'll repeat a lot of what was said there for readability sake.

I'm currently in my 3rd year of electrical engineering at the University of Calgary and *my dream is to become an analog IC designer at a top technology company.* ***I hope to improve my chances of grad school between now and when I apply in December 2022.***

**My application metrics at a glance:**

* GPA is 3.62/4.00 and my last 60 credits are 3.75/4.00
* Target GRE score is 165Q/160V/4.0AW (Have not taken it yet)
* Several internships on an ASIC team (one digital and one analog)
* Worked closely with a professor on an advanced FPGA project
* Several personal electronics projects advised by another professor (discrete high speed FET amp)

After reviewing several of the comments from the last post and speaking to some university advisors the common theme I see is research experience. Does a professor mentoring you on a project count as ""research experience?""

**I am concerned about my lack of no formal research experience:**

* Should I try and get some with a professor before I submit my application?
* How much do they expect from undergrads?
* Should I go for a MSc first at another school? Will that improve my chances of a PhD?

**I'm most interested in the CMOS Analog IC thesis with Professor Stephen Lewis at the UC Davis Solid state circuit research lab.**"

I’m currently a senior in college and I major in computer information systems and I graduate in December. About two years ago, I decided that I wanted to pursue IT. I came to this conclusion because my major was mostly software and programming and I decided that I still wanted to stay in tech cause I still found out interesting but just without the programming aspect (I despise anything with programming, algorithms, etc.)

I was finally able to land an IT internship this summer which mainly goes over enterprise networking and IT infrastructure. I enjoy it and I learn a good amount of material and I get plenty of hands on experience (especially with Cisco products)

Now here’s the issue that I’m having. I did a lot of research about the IT field to see if it was a good direction for me to go to but I was honestly unaware about the true amount studying that one has to do and the weight of certifications once I started the internship and talked with my manager. My manager has been really pushing and motivating me to study for and take the CCNA exam. On the first day of the internship, he wanted me to purchase the CCNA Udemy course to study for the CCNA exam but I catch myself barely watching the tutorial videos (there’s a lot of videos and many of them are 10 minutes and up), plus I don’t even want to attempt the CCNA exam as I don’t think I want to go into networking full time (plus the exam is $300). The thing is that I don’t really have much desire to do much studying when I get home. I just want to learn at the internship and gain hands on experience and be able to go home and do hobbies and unwind and relax but I feel that’s not possible in IT because I always hear that you always have to keep constantly learning new things in ur spare time and go after certs.

Part of me feels like I chose the wrong field because of my mindset and Also part of me feels like I feel this way because I had to study so much in school for exams and I don’t want to have to do the same thing in my career/job. I’ve always liked the idea of having a fixed schedule and to be able to just worry about work at the work site. As of right now, I plan on starting at an entry level job like help desk or technical support after I graduate and just go on from there.

Any suggestions or possible alternatives?"

Instead of going to university in Europe which will cost approximately 40,000 euros for 3 year degree. 1000 per month living expenses and 4000 fees.

Saving this money and doing the University curriculum online for free in mother's house. Then specializing in programming software development (C++, python) and also specializing in full stack engineering in mother's house for free.

Also reading up on communication, leadership, and teamwork for free and then starting out by looking for nonpaid internship online or in person. And then trying to find more opportunities and higher-paying job slowly but surely.

And finally if opportunities are not available considering doing University thing many years into the future while already being a computer scientist with 2 speciality and with work experience.

I Think a skilled engineer without a degree would be able to find 60,000 to 40,000 euro a year salary. The 1st few months will be unpaid low paid internship. If you can prove your skills and have some experience And projects there should be plenty of opportunity.

o7kf0l,2,2021-06-25,TIFU by trying to level up my staff,bitofrock,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/o7kf0l/tifu_by_trying_to_level_up_my_staff/,"Obligatory this happened a couple of years ago.

When Gravity announced they were going to set a high minimum wage of $70k I thought it was amazing and brave. I run a slightly smaller tech firm and I'd also noticed some people struggled with finances more than others. However, where I messed up is that I never took a big income so I didn't have a lot of money to redistribute. But created a plan!

I gathered the board and told them that people with poor backgrounds would struggle more to match colleagues with a generous family background. So I'd identify them and pay them $5k a year more and that would help them buy homes or have babies.

I looked at the faces in front of me expecting smiles and maybe even some expressions of how awesome I was for assisting with this. They'd all been very supportive about my rainbow flags idea, and our fundraising for charities.

I heard crickets.

Then they kicked off. I told my wife. She also kicked off. Everyone said it was unfair to reward people based on background more than on simple merit. But on simple merit those people can never ever catch up economically. They start from behind and their peers will always have an advantage.

After lots of battles I conceded defeat. Except I didn't really. I choose people's incomes anyway so I just seed everyone by telling them how awesome the more humble people are, explaining how they went over and above to help me with a problem and so on. Then when people get a raise, everyone thinks it's on merit.

Moral is that you sometimes have to do good deeds in secret. I was disappointed to discover I was the most socialist person I know...and I consider myself very much in the political and social centre. Liberal, chill, and a desire to give people better opportunities. I thought most people agreed, but turns out that most people are only a bit socialist when it's somebody else that's paying the cost of sharing the wealth. The super rich or other tax payers or something.

I'll keep hiring people whose accents don't quite fit, or don't have amazing internships or top college degrees. And I'll pay them more too. I can't make society better but I can influence my little corner. 

TL;DR I tried to raise the pay of the poorest people in my firm and got roundly attacked by everyone. Got depressed discovering that as CEO I'm the most socialist on the board. Did it anyway by over-stating the achievements of poorer employees."

The models aim to optimize inventory of hospitals and predict  the maintenance of the material before it breaks. They already have the data, and therefore want to give sense to it. For now they are just asking for a prototype, not a state of the art model. 

I don't know if it is the impostor syndrome or if I am really not qualified for this. I don't know if I need to learn a lot more to be able to produce such models that's why I am asking here.

Hi everyone! As the title suggests, I would appreciate anyone’s opinion on the matter.

I recently graduated poly (hospitality biz course) with a high 3.6x &amp; diploma w merit. I was busy during the university application period with my internship &amp; what not so I only applied to NUS/NTU/SMU. Unfortunately, SUSS/SIT/SUTD completely slipped my mind and I didn’t manage to apply in time before their application window closed. (completely my fault, ik can’t stop beating myself up over it) I got rejected by all the unis I applied to. 

Currently I’m working on appealing to SMU and I’ve applied to SIM UOL. I got the acceptance letter to SIM UOL a couple of days ago.  

I’m not sure if I should take a gap year and try for a local uni again or just head straight into SIMUOL. 

My concerns are:
1) People around me keep pressuring me to take a gap year as my cgpa “should enable me to enter a local uni”,I’m afraid that nxt year I might get rejected from all the unis again. Additionally, I also keep hearing them say that entering a private uni with my cgpa is “abit wasted”, kind of sick of it bc it feels like they are rubbing salt on my wound. 

2) Going down the private uni route my degree is less recognised and I’m going to have a hard time finding a job later.

3)SIMUOL is known for their notoriously hard exams (based on what others say), afraid I might not be able to cope and end up wasting a large sum of $.

Thank you for finding the time to read my post, right now I just feel very lost and I would appreciate any advice or opinion!"

o7n6r4,11,2021-06-25,"26, Useless Degree, Stuck in Dead End Jobs",spacedxraider,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/o7n6r4/26_useless_degree_stuck_in_dead_end_jobs/,"I'm currently 26 years old working as an ""Onboarding Analyst"" at a start-up that sells cars online. Onboarding Analyst is just a blanket term they give everyone who works in my department, in actuality I take photos of cars all day. I have a Bachelor of Creative Advertising Degree which is essentially useless unless you have connections at ad agencies which I do not. My internship year my school went on strike, I had a ton of trouble finding an internship, my program coordinators ignored me when I asked for help and I ended up having to do my internship with a family friend which resulted in me basically doing nothing at all and just getting the hours ""written in"" (probably one of the biggest mis-steps I've taken in the past few years). I make $18 an hour right now which I feel like is a very low number for someone my age.

Since my school went on strike I got a job at a car dealership being a lot guy which started me on this string of dead-end minimum wage jobs. After graduating I stayed at the dealership and eventually was ""promoted"" to photographer which resulted in the same base pay and a small bonus every 2 weeks for hitting a target amount of vehicles photographed. I applied to the job I have now on a whim because my girlfriend and I we're planning on moving in together and the new job was closer to the apartment. In the interview they told me there would be room to move up in the company and essentially gave me an outline of how the first year of the job could work out and how I would be taking on more responsibilities and with my advertising degree I would have the opportunity to assist the marketing team. I'm sure it'll be no surprise to anyone reading this that that obviously didn't happen. I've been with the company for 6 months, after 3 months I was supposed to get benefits, I waited a week before I asked about them and no one was even aware that I had been there for 3 months. In the past 6 months my role has gone from being in charge of taking photos of the entire car, editing them and uploading them to our website to taking photos of the interior of the car which gets extremely repetitive. They hired 3 temporary workers to ""assist"" me with my job, all of which don't have driver's licenses or any experience at all with photography and any time they make a mistake (which I try to help them avoid doing) I get blamed for it. Frankly, I'm sick of being stuck in dead end jobs at 26 years old, I believe I have the skills to move into the marketing department at the company but instead of being allowed to take on more responsibility or try out different roles at this company, my responsibilities have actually been diminished to one aspect of what it once was and I do the same thing (that takes about 10 minutes) over and over for 10 hours a day. Any time I suggest anything or give my opinion to managers I am simply ignored. We are supposed to have performance reviews this month, I have not been spoken to by anyone in management and it almost seems like it's not even going to happen. I was waiting for the performance review to make a concrete decision about what I'm going to do next in my life.

All in all, I am losing my mind working these jobs that will never lead to any growth in the company and I'm sick of making the least amount of money of anyone I know, it feels like I'll be floating around minimum wage for the rest of my life. During the first quarantine I was laid off from the dealership job and began studying online for an A+ certification in IT but as soon as I got called back to work I lost motivation and haven't done anything with that since. I am decently knowledgable about computers, I've built my own PC, I generally troubleshoot my own problems when they arise so IT did seem appealing to me. I chose to go to school for advertising because for some odd reason I assumed it would be similar to graphic design which I've always been passionate about but the program was more about agency culture and ""thinking creatively"" (I could've learned about these things for much cheaper than that degree costed lol). I have quite a bit of photoshop, illustrator and indesign experience. I have some knowledge with video editing just through making my own videos of skateboarding and other hobbies throughout my life. I'm also an avid car enthusiast and somewhat mechanically inclined (which is why I keep taking jobs revolving around cars). I'm open to the idea of going back to school I just don't know if I want to take the risk of spending all the money and still being unemployable. I just want a job that feels like a ""real job"" it kind of feels like I'm stuck in these bullshit jobs that anyone can get right out of high school, often times I'm working alongside 20 year olds who are just starting their lives. I feel like I completely wasted the prime years of my life with the four (actually five because I had to do an extra semester part time to finish some electives) years I spent at school. If anyone has any advice for me I could really use it, I feel lost."

Our financial condition was impacted too. In order to earn extra cash and gain work experience, I went to Shenzhen City and got myself an intern. Out of my expectation, from late May, the situation of Shenzhen epidemic was rebounded. Before the situation went worse, I decided to quit the job and move back. However, on the day I took the flight back, the Delta covid case was found at the airport. So according to the strong policy, I was asked to be observed and put under centralization isolation for 14 days in which exactly included one of my final exam time. My home city is a small city with small population. The place for centralization isolation is lack of WiFi. Due to lack of stable network, I failed to take one of my final exam and got NP grade. I was so stressful about my offer may be rescinded. 
Now the situation is, this course is neither my major prerequisite nor IGETC/ GE. And other two courses, one is linear algebra as major required course, I took in this spring quarter I may get both As. So my overall GPA can be 3.78 and major GPA can be 3.8+. All of major required course, calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra I have completed. I'm also waiting for my final official transcript sending to UCLA.

I am from the UK and am going back to university in September to finish my degree. Naturally I am starting to think about Grad jobs.

\- I have a years experience working for a surgical robotics company as a software engineering intern ( I took a year out due to covid)

\- I have other non-tech work experience, the mostly retail however i was a supervisor at a student nightclub.

I currently qualify for a year long work-holiday visa to visit Australia, I have never been before but the idea of working and traveling sounds kinda fun. Make use of my youth and all that malarky. The visa restricts me from working longer than 6months at one company (however from my understanding changing locations/buildings resets this counter). How common/feasible is it to obtain a 6 month contract or several off-cycle internships (2-3 3 month internships). Also what salaries should I be looking for out there. I wouldn't be looking to make a fortune just enough to travel and see Australia and the surrounding countries.

My areas of interest are in fields that require math skills (games, audio, 3D or 2D space), or an automation task for something around my apartment (except I can't think of any problems I need to solve).   


**Background:**

I am entering my junior of Computer Science and Mathematics studies this fall semester, and I am looking for some substantial project ideas that I can add to my portfolio.

Just in case it is relevant, my ulterior motive for this is to maximize my job opportunities (by building skills and experience) so I can work from or near the same living space I am living in for college. This summer I am working on a WinForms CRUD application in my internship, and in my free time I am making an [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) website for my parent's hobby-business. So I already have a couple items, but they don't display a passion, or an individual drive for problem solving.

  
**Question:**

What are some good portfolio projects that companies look for? To provide some insight, I will list my current ideas and interest below.

I have an interest in mathematical fields and / or higher level software design / architecture. 

*Starting with Math:* I have an idea for a game, and an idea for an audio editing tool, but neither of these are relevant to most careers. However, they will showcase technical skills.

*Now with design and fun:* Since I live with computer science roommates, it would be a fun collaborative project to automate a task, where I can handle the higher level application design since that is what I enjoy doing, however, I don't know how collaborative projects are seen as by employers. This may be an opportunity to showcase design or management skills.

Thanks for any ideas or insights  you may provide!"

I've heard horror stories about the capstone final project and how it'll devoid me of any free time ever because it will be my sole focus for this year. Truth be told I'm not really too sure if chemical engineering is what I want to do anymore. I've had moments of extreme stress, contemplation, and crying alone in the corner. At the end of my 3rd year, I was so sure that I was absolutely going to fail at least one classes and if not all of them. Thankfully I managed to pass them all but even then I have this feeling or thought in the back of my head that maybe I don't wanna do this anymore. I ended up taking an extra year because I dropped a  2nd year course that wasn't provided in the spring or summer and didn't want to take it during 3rd year and overload my course schedule. During this extra year before my final year, I felt kind of devoid of motivation most times and I struggled to study properly. I pretty much relied on the fact that classes were online and also open book so as a result I did the bare minimum for the most part. Also throughout my entire time studying chemical engineering, I was never motivated to seeking opportunities. I never bothered to join or look for extracurriculars, and after applying to a decent number of applications for internships, I just gave up and forgot all about it. I feel like this aspect in particular shows how im not really motivated or interested in what I'm doing right now. Overall I'm just scared and lost on what to do. Going through this last year feels like its going to be pure hell that I honestly don't want to deal with at all, and I have no idea what I actually want to pursue. I don't even want to think about what I'm going to do if I graduate. After recently finishing the extra year I set up for myself, all I've done was play games with my friends while working at a fast food place part time; all to avoid whats going to happen in a few months. I'm just hoping to get advice on maybe how to maybe stay motivated and push through for this final year, or how I can figure out what I want to do with my life. 

TLDR: I'm currently unhappy with where I am right now, Just hoping to get some advice on how to figure out where I wanna go in my life after graduating or before that."
o7vnxv,3,2021-06-25,EE Student applying to Grad School - Admissions Advice,Mean_Championship_22,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/o7vnxv/ee_student_applying_to_grad_school_admissions/,"Hello prospective and current grad students,

This is a follow up to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/chipdesign/comments/nl9san/ee_student_wanting_to_become_analog_ic_designer/) here, where I discuss some general career goals in chip design. I'll repeat a lot of what was said there for readability sake.

I'm currently in my 3rd year of electrical engineering at the University of Calgary and *my dream is to become an analog IC designer at a top technology company.* ***I hope to improve my chances of grad school between now and when I apply in December 2022.***

**My application metrics at a glance:**

* GPA is 3.62/4.00 and my last 60 credits are 3.75/4.00
* Target GRE score is 165Q/160V/4.0AW (Have not taken it yet)
* Several internships on an ASIC team (one digital and one analog)
* Worked closely with a professor on an advanced FPGA project
* Several personal electronics projects advised by another professor (discrete high speed FET amp)

After reviewing several of the comments from the last post and speaking to some university advisors the common theme I see is research experience. Does a professor mentoring you on a project count as ""research experience?""

**I am concerned about my lack of no formal research experience:**

* Should I try and get some with a professor before I submit my application?
* How much do they expect from undergrads?
* Should I go for a MSc first at another school? Will that improve my chances of a PhD?

**I'm most interested in the CMOS Analog IC thesis with Professor Stephen Lewis at the UC Davis Solid state circuit research lab.**"
o7y8jw,2,2021-06-25,Struggling with a career change,Throwaway173952864,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/o7y8jw/struggling_with_a_career_change/,"I had a non-traditional upbringing. Essentially unschooled, and spent more time raising my younger siblings than actually focusing on my own education (not by choice). High school was self-taught. I started a computer science engineering transfer program at the local community college as an adult, but had to drop out at the end of my second year (before transferring to the 4-year college). 

Now I’m left with student loans and no degree. I’m 39, and feel like my life is passing me by. I’m doing medical billing, but want more with my life.

My issue is that I’m uncertain where to go from here. How do you know if a tech/IT job is right for you? I know with traditional schooling you can get internships, but feel like as an adult that may not be available to me anymore? 

Is it too late to make a career change? Do I need to go back and finish my degree, or is there another way to break into IT? Is there a way to job shadow so to speak, to get a feel for what day to day life is like?"
o7ypg3,1,2021-06-25,Asking for reality check and advice for a chemistry undergrad applying to top chem pHd?,Shio-zhi,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/o7ypg3/asking_for_reality_check_and_advice_for_a/,"Hi, this is a throwaway account, I'm a rising senior, applying this fall 2021 for 2022 cycle. Chemistry major at US R1 school, 3.82-3.85 gpa. I like chemistry for renewable energy, catalysis, inorg/org synthesis, materials, and I hope to go to a top school (US or international) for this kind of research. But I'm worried bc my undergrad profs, while kind to me and willing to write good recs, couldn't let me do too much in lab bc of Covid and I feel unaccomplished. I'll be working full time in lab from summer until grad apps though. I'll explain more with bullet points, but if tldr, my situation is already explained in this intro paragraph.

Research experience:

1. Joined large catalysis lab as a freshman 2018/9, prof left me to the grad student, I did reactions, cleaned, etc, but never got results because Covid hit my sophmore spring and I couldn't be in lab anymore. Wrote a mini review to complete my stipend requirements. Then grad student graduated and the project was canceled.

2. Joined tiny computational chem lab as a junior 2020, learned coding, ran side simulations to support the main project but never got access to the clusters and main simulation work of the group. No publications but was on stipend. I was unsure of myself the whole time due to the new environment, but the prof was always supportive.

3. Started in person internship at a national lab, summer before senior year, and I got an offer to extend full time through until Dec 2021 (turned down another position to stay haha). Doing work on catalysis and energy storage, might get to do nanoparticles, some materials chem. Chance for second or third author publication, I'm working hard to make the project successful, I get to solve research problems, it's been great. I'm picking up all the lab skills I missed out on.

I'm applying this fall and I'll have three recs from PIs, the third will probably be the most detailed. The first I've known the longest but I'll probably never return to his lab before graduating which makes me sad. I might try to spend my senior year spring semester there...

I can talk at length about all my projects, my interests, my reasons for doing grad school and research. But am I qualified for a T10 chem school? Everyone else seems so accomplished, yet I've been a struggling mess this whole time. I'm very determined this summer since I don't feel like I can prove that I'm capable otherwise to future PIs.

Lastly, I won't graduate with chemistry honors bc I won't do a honors thesis. My only choice is the computational work I did, and I think my contribution was paltry. Maybe the prof will say differently, but I have no confidence. I hope not having an honors thesis is fine?

I'm so worried honestly. So just to save my feelings, should I expect rejections? I'm applying to phd programs in the US T10, and a few top masters programs in UK/Switz (to finish a phd there after). Am I aiming too high?

This summer I am working at a pretty solid tech company (big Seattle type). I know finance companies are less forgiving for low GPAs than the big tech ones ( I had a 3.1 when I got my current internship LMAO ) but I was wondering if I would even make it past the resume screening with my GPA? Anyone have any experience they can share with any big fin tech companies? Thanks xx

edit: I go to a lowkey ivy idk if that makes a difference"
o7zx73,6,2021-06-25,Would you hire a Developer or a Marketer?,seekingtruthiness,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/o7zx73/would_you_hire_a_developer_or_a_marketer/,"Hey r/startups, I’m currently grappling with a couple issues, so I came here seeking some internet wisdom. I know you all have your own problems, so I’ll do my best to keep this brief.

**Situation**

We’re a 2 person team (me and an overseas dev), and we’re facing two primary problems: Marketing/lead generation, and development speed.

On the marketing side, I believe I’ve found a repeatable way to increase traffic of high-potential leads, and the process is solidified enough where I should be able to hand it off to an intern or VA.

The development side is a bit more challenging. Currently, my developer is not very motivated to work more than 20 hours a week so progress is quite slow. I’ve talked about this with him and mentioned bringing on another dev to support the difference between the hours he works and what I’ve budgeted. He’s open to the idea.

We’ve recently raised some money, so I want to put it to use as intelligently as possible, which is where my dilemma lies. As I see things, there are two potential courses of action.

**Option #1**

Based on our funding/burn rate, I could probably afford another part-time dev, but they would need to be overseas and probably quite junior. This would raise its own challenges, but I would be able to continue focusing on marketing/lead generation in large part (which is still technically a problem).

**Option #2**

I’ve taught myself to code over the past few years, and I’m comfortable enough with the web stack to jump in and contribute myself (although also at a junior level). In this situation I would be able to allocate the money saved toward increased marketing support, which I don’t much enjoy doing.

There are numerous risks associated with both options, but based on this scenario, what would you do? Are there options I’m not considering?

I appreciate any feedback you're willing to provide."

o81u21,1,2021-06-25,I’m struggling with work and could use advice,zestythroaway,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/o81u21/im_struggling_with_work_and_could_use_advice/,"Hi Reddit! I haven’t posted on here often but needed to get some advice. 

I graduated from College in December, and started working in January. I’m a part of a rotational program and currently on my first rotation. 

I wanted to post on here because I feel like I’m slow and just struggling. To give you some context, the months of January - May were all training. The real rotation didn’t start until late May (today marked my 1st month of the rotation). 

I interned for this company last Summer and absolutely loved it. I couldn’t get enough of it! The internship was fully virtual and I still enjoyed everything. My work ethic, performance, and curiosity to learn paid off and I was the only intern to receive an early offer (out of an intern class of 11). 

Fast forward to now, my first official rotation in the program. I feel very slow and the days go by so fast that I feel like I can never get enough done. I frequently work late, and as a matter of fact came home and worked until 11 PM last night. This isn’t expected of me, but I feel like I had to because I’ve been so behind. 

I get assigned a lot of things to do, and I’ve been struggling to prioritize. A few weeks ago, one of my managers had a 1:1 meeting with me about this, as I was nowhere near done with the tasks I was given. I had that conversation with them and I made it a point to try harder. 

Today the same thing happened with another manager. I didn’t upload something as fast as I was supposed to because I got pulled in to other stuff and I kind of got called out, although in a nice way. I just feel so embarrassed that I made this mistake again and it hit my confidence. I’m just fearful that I’m not even doing good work for the group at this point. 

Every day I just feel so incompetent. I feel like I always have so much to do and never enough time to ever do it. I put in a lot of hours and hard work, but I feel like it’s of no use as I’m struggling to get things done anyways. 

This whole situation has me stressed out. I eat lunch at my desk most days, I’m the first in and last out, and yet it feels futile. My managers set weekly check ins with me and every single one I just get so nervous. I don’t really eat too much and my mind is always focused on work, even though I’m experiencing the issues I described earlier. 

One other thing that’s making me anxious is the fact that group managers talk. For my next rotation I’m sure they’ll talk to my current managers and I’m just so afraid that my credibility and dependability will be tarnished. This has resulted in a cycle of fear and anxiety of performing poorly and I’ve been feeling that way this past month. 

I know I have it in me to succeed. I’m no stranger to struggles but I just went in with the mentality that I was going to crush it and that’s just not the case. The feeling of feeling slow, incompetent, and the imposter syndrome really wears me down.  By the way, the group is great, and I know the problem isn’t them. 

Any and all advice will be appreciated :). Thank you for reading!"

I'm a 2nd-year Computer Science student and I'm really aiming to get into co-op and internship next year. However, I literally have a white resume. I didn't do anything. I don't know what should I do and what should my resume look like?  I have good experience in Java and C from my studies in the uni and I got an A in data structure and algorithms and I'll take OOP and Analysis of Algorithms and Database courses next semester. I really want to improve my resume and build it this Summer, so can you recommend me something to learn or do this summer to help me get into a co-op? I'm already learning HTML/CSS but I feel they are not really programming (just designing )?

Anyway, I hope someone to help.  Thank you all."

o86dg3,23,2021-06-26,I honestly can't wait for the day I won't need to rely on work for money,meatloaf9999,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/o86dg3/i_honestly_cant_wait_for_the_day_i_wont_need_to/,"I have worked in a couple of places as an intern or freelancer. Most of my experience has been complete shit.

So at the end of 2018, I was hired by this company as an IT intern. My dad's friend was able to get me this interview and honestly, it had been a few months since I hadn't worked because its very tough to get hired when you have very little experience. In a way, I felt like the company was doing me a favor. I had very little confidence. Anyway, They hired me but didn't tell me anything about the salary. I went to them again and was like hey can you tell me how much I'm gonna be paid? They said oh forget about that right now you work and we will talk to the manager about it. I was a bit annoyed but again, stupid me just went with it. Two months passed and I was still unpaid. They started sending me to one of their offices a bit far for supervising construction workers.. I told them I can't afford travel fees. They started paying me in the beginning until they started developing an attitude about that also. I got fed up. Told them I need travel expenses paid for! They said they will pay a certain amount and told me to find a driver per month for that amount. I said the amount is extremely little I won't be able to find one.. Anyway, it led to a really nasty argument. Every time I asked for information about the salary they told me the same shit. This cunt of a guy was literally like ""At your age, you should be more concerned about gaining experience than making money!"" Like, excuse me? I am working for you! You are providing me zero support. I don't care how young I am I deserve my fucking salary. 

In February of 2019, I told them I won't be coming in to work if I don't get paid from next month. They said okay we have spoken to the manager we will discuss and let you know. The end of February came around and they said ""he hasn't replied yet but we suggest you keep working until he does"" and I was like ""No its fine. I will come once he approves."" I started applying elsewhere and I got a better job. Problem is, the day I got that job, this company got back to me and said they got approval for giving me a salary of 330 dollars a month (Again, I was an idiot. When they asked me how much I wanted for salary, I got panicked and thought if I said anything more than 300 they would laugh at me so granted, I would say this time it was my fault.)  so I was like I'm sorry but I gave it some thought, I am not satisfied with that low of salary if I can gain a bit higher, I will continue working. Otherwise, I'm sorry. They were like you said 330 and we got it for you and now you are changing demands again! It soon led to another argument between us. I was like 330 is too low and they were like that's what you asked for. I'll give them that. Honestly, at that point, I just wanted out of that hellhole. Eventually, I got the courage to tell them I'm not returning and joined this other company that paid me well enough.

Sadly, this is not the only company I worked for that treated me like shit. Almost every company I worked at, either treated me like i wasn't important, or didn't deserve even a minimum wage salary, or didn't provide any support whatsoever and just expected me to figure everything out on my own. I honestly can't wait for the day I am so well financially that working is something I do just for fun.. Just so I can demand respect and walk out anytime I get treated like shit."
o86ken,1,2021-06-26,Queries regarding Year 5 for CS undergrad,IBslut,UofT,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/o86ken/queries_regarding_year_5_for_cs_undergrad/,"I'm doing the Computer Science specialist programme and am starting my third year in September, however, because of the pandemic and online classes I was only able to complete roughly half the courses that I had to do in second year. Because of this, I feel I'm really lagging behind when it comes to my academics and even my overall portfolio.

Since not all 2nd year courses I still need to complete are offered in the fall semester (which consequently prevents me from taking pretty much all the third year courses), I'm in a massive predicament for which the only solution I can think of is doing another year at UofT.

I know some people, though very uncommon, do take 5 years to complete their CS programme at UofT. Personally, I believe this would give me time to catch up on the leftover courses as well as focus on my portfolio by doing internships and learning new skills before graduating.

However, before I make that decision I wanted to know how much more expensive would that be for an International Student. Furthermore, is this even a decent option? Will this be frowned upon by employers when I apply for a job?"
o86kxm,14,2021-06-26,Am I competitive for Computational Biology/Bioinformatics PhD programs?,pdj307,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/o86kxm/am_i_competitive_for_computational/,"Hello everyone,

I plan on applying to PhD programs this upcoming Fall, so I was hoping to get some opinion on whether I'd be competitive enough for many programs out there. I majored in Molecular/Cellular Biology with an overall GPA of 3.67. Have not taken the GRE, but will very soon. I have approx. 4+ years of research experience. About 2 years of it was spent as an undergraduate research assistant, where I was in 2 different psych labs for a year each. Mostly just simple data collection/analysis. My most relevant research has to be my summer internship for a biomedical informatics program, where I was assigned a project to leverage deep learning for predictive modeling. Was able to get a poster presentation out of this with AMIA. Currently am on a gap year working for a research institution where I get to analyze medical imaging data.

I believe my biology, computational (took a couple programming courses in Python), and research background is pretty sound. Much of my skepticism of my competitiveness stems from having a weak(?) quantitative background. I've only taken Calc 1 and biostatistics. I will be taking linear algebra soon. How important is it to have Calc 2-3, as well as differential equations? Not quite sure how much of these prereqs are overlooked by programs who seem to demand that level of quantitative background. Posted below are just some of the programs I'm interested in. If you have any advice on how I can improve or have an insight on how admissions will look at me as an applicant, I'd really appreciate it. I'm not sure how to view myself as an applicant, but I'm hoping I'm currently in a good position to get in a few places.

Programs:

* UCSD - Bioinformatics and Systems Biology
* University of Michigan - Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics
* Yale - Computational Biology and Bioinformatics
* Stanford - Biomedical Informatics
* Harvard - Bioinformatics
* Brown - Biomedical Informatics
* Boston University - Bioinformatics
* University of Washington (Seattle) - Biomedical Informatics"
o86sz1,3,2021-06-26,Cybersecurity vs Software Engineer,Minute_Future_3458,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/o86sz1/cybersecurity_vs_software_engineer/,"I’m graduating this upcoming year and will be applying for full-time jobs soon. However I am beginning to get confused with what I want to do. I am a computer engineering major with a minor in CS so I had always planned to go into more of a software development role. 

My first internship was a pretty small company and I was doing really high level work (HTML, XML, content development, etc).  My current internship is a cybersecurity software engineering internships (computer forensics, malware analysis, reverse engineering). 

As I took more classes I realized I enjoy Cybersecurity a lot and am now majoring in it (but staying within the BS in CPE program). But now I’m kind of confused on how I should proceed with a full time job. 

Ive always loved the typical silicon valley CS vibe and my dream would be to move to California. However now that I’m becoming more interested in Cybersecurity, I’m unsure about how prominent roles are like that on the west coast. Ideally, if I did go into cybersecurity, I’d love to work on something that would be meaningful to   the US gov (like how my internship is working on a project with the FBI) or maybe something related to cryptocurrency. Are there many jobs relating to this on the west or would that be more so found in the east coast/ DC area? 

Another factor is salary. Is it true that cybersecurity new grad roles would be paid less than software engineering roles? I am just hoping that if I do end up finding a job in California, that they pay well enough for me to justify moving there. 

Another thing is, how can I grow within the cybersecurity field? What would growth look like in 5 years? I know with software roles, you can become promoted several times and earn 3x what you started with as a junior, does cyber allow for this same type of growth? 

Sorry if any of these questions come off as naive, and thank in advance."

o8ae7l,8,2021-06-26,Do companies care about your Upwork experience when applying for jobs?,randomseller,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/o8ae7l/do_companies_care_about_your_upwork_experience/,"Hello, about a month ago, I had to pick between a 'real' internship position for a local company, or a position as a developer for a job I found over Upwork. The intern position was Java based, while the Upwork job was NodeJS/TypeScript based. Even though I prefer using Java over JS/TS I went for the Upwork job. The reason? Not having to travel 1hr to the office everyday(and back). Not to mention that the internship position was for 5eur/hr, while the Upwork position was for 25$/hr(before taxes of course).

My question is, did I make a mistake by picking the Upwork job over the 'real' job as a intern? If I decide to start applying for 'actual' jobs after university, do companies care at all about your Upwork experience and jobs? As of right now, I am thinking that maybe I should stick to Upwork even after university. I don't think anyone in eastern EU is willing to pay anywhere near the salaries that you can get over Upwork.. Thoughts?"

I am a second year computer science student in a private university. 

I've been offered an internship that is unpaid and duration is six months.In those six months i will be working on a project.

My job is to work as a frontend developer. Time duration is 64 hours per month and 16 hours per week.

The only think irking me is that I am not that good of a frontend developer and in the project I will be the only one taking care of the frontend.

The imposter syndrome is kicking so bad right now cause I have created small apps but have not worked in a team before.

o8c1pp,8,2021-06-26,I live in an asylum and it’s affecting my mental health and performance in school and at work,toddtoddtoddTODDDD,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/o8c1pp/i_live_in_an_asylum_and_its_affecting_my_mental/,"Figuratively, I live in an asylum, I’ll tell you why in the second paragraph. WARNING; this is a complex and intense situation. For context, I live under the roof of my father’s sister and she comes over to sleep. I can’t live with my mum cuz she’s an abusive cunt, and I don’t trust being around her. I almost got hit by a car once because I was distracted by her obsessing of my every move while walking, so you get the idea of how toxic she is. I’m financially constrained and unhappy and I am having a break down on a weekly basis. Please help me I don’t know what to do

Anyway, my father’s sister has a neurodegenerative disease (that thing Stephen Hawking had) and insomnia, and she reached this point where she can’t walk normally anymore. She takes 5 minutes to walk 3 metres. Hence, on occasions, by that I mean a few times every night, she needs the assistance of her maid to walk her to the toilet. Her condition is so bad that she has fell quite a handful of times and got major injuries, so it it’s expected highly of the maid to do her duties. The maid has to face this every night, waking up at odd hours just to assist her to the toilet. She’s exhausted to the core, and because of that sometimes she can’t wake up. As such, my father’s sister will scream, with whatever energy she has in her worn out, muscle-dead throat to get the maid to wake up. It’s so sharp I can hear it through my ear plugs, they don’t fucking work. Plus the weird artificial silence and the fact that I can hear my own heart beating is fucking unnerving, you can’t sleep in peace in ear plugs. 

The doctors have already prescribed her whatever medicine she needs to not wake up in the middle of the night. And also to help with her urinating issues. But apparently my grandma drilled this idea of drinking water in the middle of the night, so deeply into everyone that my father’s sister refuses to sleep through the night without drinking and urinating, even at the expense of me and my dad’s mental health.

Now I have decided to rent a place ever since university started earlier this year, and I did, and had a bad experience with the first rental experience. I was duped into a contract of having to deal with a demented lady (the property agent knew, so did the family). I was traumatised from the lack of hygiene and the responsibility expected of me to compromise with her hygiene habits caused by her “forgetfulness”.  I was expected by both the agent and landlady’s family to compromise my expectations, as far as to helping the Landlady to maintain her toilet, common areas. It wasn’t stated in the contract that I had to do these. I feel like puking thinking about toilet filled with urine and unflushed remnants of faeces pieces 😔😔😔 anyway I moved out immediately and went back to my father’s sister’s roof.

The problem is this incident affected me so badly I decided rooms with a private toilet will suit me better until I learn to trust my physical space again, meaning the cost of rent is EXTRA. The rooms are at least $950 for a decent furnishing and I just signed an internship paying me $1000, my first day is 1 July. I am currently tutoring some students for money but I have dropped a lot of them, since the internship is full time. My university fees are paid by my mum but my daily expenses (travel and food) cost up to $400-$500 a month. My university also rejected my financial assistance application, and my parents make barely enough for themselves to pay the bills, their own rent and for retirement. Therefore with the current students I have, plus my studies, I technically have no off days.... despite being able to earn a little 1.4k a month. 

I am so exhausted and uncomfortable around my father’s sister because when she speaks, it sounds like someone just returned from hell and have minimal vocal energy left from all the screaming/moaning from suffering. I have the recording and if you heard it, trust me it will traumatise you.

As of now I go to hostels on some nights and they cost $45 per stay, spending whatever I saved up from giving tuition to recuperate from the physical and emotional exhaustion from home, but it’s not enough.

Will I be able to find the balance between the financial demands of my life and my emotional and psychological needs of having a safe and quiet place to sleep? Do I take that room that looks like it could give me my privacy and peace of mind for $950-$1100? Social services did not respond to me and I’m so scared of being turned down again when that time could be used elsewhere like studying hard and getting a scholarship. Also I live in Singapore so sleeping in the streets is illegal and I don’t wanna deal with paying fines or being taken away to places I don’t know. If you read this far, thank you. 

TLDR; I have no safe place to stay/rest, have a low paying job and a degree to finish, how do I not let my life get in the way of mental health and degree?"

I'm currently a third-year CS student in my country (Pakistan) and I just got done with my first internship at a medium sized startup (scaling rapidly) as a Front-end dev. I currently have 1.5 years before I graduate, and I want to know how I can effectively spend them so that I can put myself on a path to (eventually) get into the EU job market.

Essentially my goal is to move to a EU country where immigration laws allow for my mom and brother to move with me, if not then atleast where they can visit frequently. I know it's going to be a long-term effort so I wanna know how I can effectively spend the next year or so that the path forward can be easy.

My Skills: I am fluent in Java/C++ and have a few university projects (stuff like management systems and networking projects) on my portfolio. I just finished an internship where I had to write production grade code using ReactJS, and stuff like sass/less and other web dev stuff. Since it was a startup, the work was pretty demanding and I learned a lot of stuff (especially version control and how there are different builds such as staging/prod etc). Since I was already learning JS prior to the internship, my plan was to learn Node after getting the hang of JS. Other than that, i also know a bit of python and I think I prefer backend work over front-end. It's more fun for me. I want to be a fullstack web developer, that's the rough goal that I have right now with what I've worked with so far.

What should be my plan moving forward if I essentially want to get a job somewhere in EU? Should i apply for another internship (backend maybe?) or work on personal projects? Also what is a realistic timeframe after which i would be able to get a job in my desired country (considering I would most likely need relocation assistance)?

Thankyou for reading through all of that and any advice is appreciated!"

I have loved it, and do not regret my decision to study engineering. 

However with that being said I have noticed that I find myself more and more interested in the business and managerial side of things.

I have interviewed for a few different engineering internship positions at start up companies, and have found myself in the interview being more drawn to the business model and their business plans that I am about the engineering. When they ask me if I have any questions I almost always ask questions about marketing, sales, growth, or relationships with other companies instead of asking about the engineering side of things.

So I wanted to ask if anyone out there has transitioned away from engineering and more towards a career in other parts of a business? And if so what that process was like and what tips you might have for job searching and selling myself as a qualified person even though I will have a degree in mechanical engineering and not business?

TLDR: tips for engineering major wanting to create a career in the corporate/ business world.

o8e3xt,2,2021-06-26,Is my internship experience valuable?,BacterialDweam,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/o8e3xt/is_my_internship_experience_valuable/,"I am a junior in college, cs major, and I have been working at a large company doing ""software development"" for about a year now. I used quotes around ""software development"" because I don't ever get to actually do any development, all I do is third party test other developer's software. I feel like they are taking advantage of me a little bit because I am good at testing and finding issues, and none of the developers want to test their own stuff, so they always just dump it on me.

I realize that third party testing is a big part of development, and most definitely important, but I just feel like I am not getting to exercise my code writing skills which I would consider myself to be very good at. The one project they gave me I destroyed it and my managers were really happy with my work, but that was my only shot at development it seems like. I talk to other interns at the company and they are getting to work on some pretty awesome projects. 

I feel like this internship isn't preparing me for what I actually want to do in my future career, which is write code, develop, create. I will come home from work and just grind LeetCode or work on other personal development projects on my own time to keep up my skills, learn more, and feel like an actual software developer because I am deprived of that at work. The sad thing is I have expressed to my manager that I would really like to do more development projects and she always just says ""Ok I will relay that on and see if there are more projects we could put you on,"" but there never comes a time for me to hop on a project :/. I try not to blame her because I know things are currently really busy.

Does anyone have any advise on what I should do? Is it time to start looking for another internship? Should I set up a meeting with all three of my managers and deeply explain how I feel? I feel like I am spinning my tires at this internship and the massive amount of testing that I am always doing isn't actually going to prove valuable in my future endeavors. Any advise is greatly appreciated, thank you."

If it is, what can I do?",ThrowAwayAcc1077443,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/o8getb/is_this_abuse_if_it_is_what_can_i_do/,"I am a 21F in a family of 5 (mother, father, and two sisters). My youngest sister has recently turned 18, so I no longer think CPS can get involved. Contextually, my father is controlling/short-tempered. Usually, I can brush it off since he has been like this for as long as I have known him and because my mother keeps telling me it's easier just to let him have his way. I mean, I don't like it, and he definitely knows that, so not saying I don't try to stick up for myself, but rather that I can brush him off emotionally most times. The other times, however, are going to be what I'm going to discuss. 

So as I mentioned, he's controlling. I've tried to become more independent multiple times, but he's stopped me on all accounts. Like he won't let me work and earn money (He even tried preventing me from opening a bank account that only I have access to after my mom took out a couple thousand from it. Which I wouldn't have known about since they weren't planning on letting me know, but I discovered it when I said I would be using it for school and they said that it wouldn't be possible.), use the car to drive anywhere (the one they bought for my sister and me for college), and go to college out-of-state when I found an excellent pre-health university. 

Other times he is controlling is during things like what I wear (like today he said I couldn't go out in a tank-top and high-waisted jeans and got physical when I said it wasn't inappropriate), how I sit at home, and how I walk. I think he's too uptight regarding everything, and when I say so, I never know how badly he's going to react because of his temper. He had hit my older sister before when we were kids, and he got physical today when I disagreed and said I wouldn't change. He didn't manage to hit me, I caught his hand, but he kept trying to push me back (cage me in?). He had also broken some of my things when he thought I was disrespectful. I tried complaining to my mother, who was sitting in the family room while this was happening, but she said I was just being too stubborn. 

He has also acted out in public. While he has never hit us, he stormed out of a restaurant one time because he thought me talking about my friends was too annoying. I personally don't believe that he's doing it for our safety like our mom says, because if that were the case, he wouldn't have laughed and joked about inviting the guy that I complained about touching me inappropriately to brunch when I specifically told them to vent(He even kept joking about it after I nearly cried about it and told him directly about how he kept asking if I was a virgin.). 

I honestly do not know what to do. I've tried asking my mom, the more lenient of the two, for advice in things like finances, but even she said I don't need to worry about that. It's like this for my older sister, too. She had to move across the state because of graduate school, but she's tightly managed even then. I'm also worried that his controlling behavior will affect my schooling. He often threatens to either kick me out or simply not pay for my education (which I can't afford on my own) or not allow me to leave. His actions often prevent me from being able to do internships like I need to do to enter medical school. I'm thinking about entering medical school in another country to get away from everything. I think I would be happy there, and more likely to end up successful."

The company is a great place to work for and during the interview they promised the work will be 50% tooling development and 50% ops/production.

Although I managed to clear the rigorous interview process (10+ hours of interview), I have never had an Software Engineer internship and don't know anything about writing proper-quality code.

I did build a couple of projects seeing youtube tutorials but I don't feel very confident about my skills based on them.

The role is really good and i will be working with a lot of 'trending' techstack (like Golang, Docker, Kubernetes, ci/cd, prometheus etc).

But I am afraid my programming skills will never reach the maturity as compared to a fulltime SWE after 2 years.

1. Is my above fear irrational? What can I do to make sure my coding skills grow equivalent to that of a SWE?

2. Incase after 2 years, if I realise that I want to try out SWE, will the switchover be possible? (I.e am I locking myself into SRE as a career path?)

3. My longterm goal is to gain expertise in and work with distributed systems. For this scenario, does staying in SRE make more sense or does switching to SWE  after a couple of years make more sense?

I’m interested in compsci/engineering.

* Marketing intern @ an NPO to make education more accessible.
* Marketing intern @ a climate company 
* Student researcher @ a hospital here in Canada — related to AI. 
* Student council rep
* Breakfast club and nutrition program volunteer 
* AI intern @ an AI startup. 

I don’t have any awards since I haven’t done many competitions, but I’m really interested in AI. My parents have voiced that they would prefer me study here — but if anyone can give me a better idea of what my options would look like in the US from a quick glance, that’d be great!"

I just did my comm 308 exam and it went pretty horribly. I’m scheduled to start my work semester in the fall and have already secured an internship. I was wondering if they could kick me out of coop if I failed this class? I don’t think my gpa will go below 2.7 if I fail (I have a good GPA) but I don’t know how the system works."
o8jlbb,15,2021-06-26,"20 year old, with dev skills, in wrong degree.",Hydro_Magakz,DevelEire,https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/o8jlbb/20_year_old_with_dev_skills_in_wrong_degree/,"I'm nearly 20, going into my second year of a Politics and Economics degree. 

Now, the title may be a bit misleading. I enjoy my course, and have no regrets picking it. It's just I enjoy coding as much. Have done since secondary. 

When I was younger I made a crappy app, few websites, twitter bots, messed around with vms, got into bug bounty etc etc. 

Nothing structured. Pretty much a headless chicken.

I got a lot of familiarity with things, but not anything deeper.

Since lockdown, I've been alot more regimented. Took the CS50 course, and from there dug deeper into data structures and algorithms (as deep as youtube courses permit). Also rehashed over old Java, python and JS courses I took when I was much younger. 

I now feel I'm at that min point on the Dunning Krueger. I'm only now beginning to see just how much there is to know, and it's quite exciting.

Anyways. As with alot of people here, I'm now wondering how employable I am. 

At the moment I have three projects I'm chipping away at. 

Two are interactive data viz, one with the Twitter API, and another with some cool geospatial data I've found. Third one is a full stack interactive web app.

Technologies I'm currently working with are R, Python, React, D3.js, postgresSQL, and node. 

I'm not rushing these projects, and I'm altering between them to stay fresh. Whenever I run into something I don't know that's relevant, I take time out to learn it. 

So with that tech stack, and imagining that the final product of these projects will be somewhat good, what are my prospects for being employed?

The dream scenario, is to land a frontend internship while completing my pol and econ degree. Then I can build experience, and in the future pivot to something more data orientated. Something that would mesh with my econ and pol degree.

How are employers likely to look at someone who's in a degree with no relation whatsoever to the job? 

Should I be specifically gearing for a front end dev role, as a means to 'get the foot in the door'? Or something else?

Any technologies in that stack that I should seek to really lean into from an employer perspective? 

Thanks for taking the time to read!

Edit: Listen, thanks all for the great advice. You've given me a lot to digest and think about!"
o8l2x8,1,2021-06-26,General Resume Advice AND Developer Internship Advice/Critique Needed,Decent-Training-4697,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/o8l2x8/general_resume_advice_and_developer_internship/,"Thank you in advance for looking over my resume. I'm posting this for two purposes: firstly, for general advice to create a more appealing resume (and see how my resume stands as it is). Secondly, for those with experience in IT/ Software development, I would also like advice on how I can make my resume more appealing so that I may actually apply for internships.

I am also looking for general advice as I will be needing to apply in search of an additional/better paying job to pay my bills as I complete my bachelor's degree. Ultimately, my goal is to become a software developer and I would much prefer to align my time spent working as time spent on coding to accelerate my learning. So far, I have only completed courses in programming logic and pseudocode, Java, and C and C++. I am familiar with the basics and only have one project under my belt that I worked on in class in my previous semester.

Any and every advice is highly appreciated. Thanks for your time and efforts!

I was curious, since I don’t really have an experience with CSS as much, if it’s fine to follow a YouTube tutorial to make my portfolio website that I can share with employers on job applications? 

Or is this looked down upon and I should spend time learning CSS/Bootstrap properly in order to make one from scratch."

Spanish Teacher: I had her for two years in a row and I felt like we had a good relationship. I think she thought I worked hard in her class

Math/Physics Teacher: I also had him two years in a row and took two classes with him during senior year. Most people liked him and he has a good track record with LORs

Counselor: Didn't know him too well, but I think he was rooting for me. Probably least impressive out of all of them.

**Interviews**

MIT interview: First and best interview by far. It could be because the interviewer was the youngest out of all of the or he worked in a field I was really interested in, but it just went really really well

Rice: I thought it went pretty well, but the most we connected on was theatre stuff. He went through the questions like a checklist but he was nice. Overall chill

UPenn: Very nice woman. We connected about science research, but she treated it super informally which I didn't expect.

**Essays**

Personal statement was about musicals and my connection with them. I thought it was good initially, but looking back, it fit better as a supplemental essay. I made sure a ton of my ""why school"" essays were about science research and biology.

There were two main essays I reused. One was about a murder scene we staged for one of my biomed classes and the other was about my volunteer work

Okay okay, so this might sound annoying buuuuuut, I’m honestly not that smart. I would like to think I’m just a hard worker and honestly that’s your best ticket for college admissions. Work hard. Do what you love. I know it doesn’t always work out for everyone but I would like to think it does for a lot of people.

Anyway, questions are welcome for anything I forgot to cover in this post."

Hey 👋 

I am a Full Stack Software Engineer located in the Boston Area. I’ve been working as an engineer at one of the top E-commerce companies in the U.S.

I’m looking to continue working in the E-commerce field and work for you on your Shopify App.

I’ll keep this short and you can dm me if you have any questions.
- I’ve built my own Shopify App (just submitted for review yesterday)
- I consider React to be my strongest skill. I’ve been using it for 3 years, use it at my current job and past internships, have taken many courses on it and used it for most of my projects. I ♥️ React and Javascript.
- I run my own Shopify store so I have an understanding of the needs of Shopify merchants.


My rate will vary from $30/hour-$60/hour depending on the project and time requirements.


I can work on all parts of your app (Hosting it, creating a back end server, creating a database, connecting to Shopify API’s to access Shop data)."
o8oipp,13,2021-06-26,Start-up taking advantage of me,InternationalAd2981,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/o8oipp/startup_taking_advantage_of_me/,"Hi Everyone, I'm looking for advice on what to do about my current annoying situation as an intern. During the holiday season, I accepted an offer to work as an intern this summer at a very small start-up. It looked great. Their two full-stack developers seemed super helpful and I was super excited to work with them. I had very few skills back then and was over the moon that I had an internship offer at all.

The first red flag: I wasn't going to get paid. I was going to back out, but because of good money coming from another project, getting rejected elsewhere, and the opportunity to work with a real team(albeit small), I stayed. When I started I quickly found out that one of the developers had quit, and a few weeks after that, the other quit as well. This left me as the only ""full-stack"" developer there. *Nice.* There's a Mobile developer who is an amazing guy but knows surprisingly little about anything outside of Swift/IOS dev, and there are two developers who are entirely AI-focused.

So we were left with this code base and I was the only one who knew how to read it/update it/etc. The Mobile developer does all the code reviews, and he really tries to help, but since he doesn't know what is going on, it's really up to me to not make errors/fix them when I always do. At first, it was a lot of stress, but I also was getting exponentially better as a developer because of it. I rose to the challenge, and I enjoyed that for a bit. However, the joy has now worn off. *Sigh.*

As a result of my new position and responsibilities, they keep telling me they are working to get me paid. They have apparently applied to some grants for the money, and if that falls through, they say they will pay me *""out of their own pockets""* (sigh).  However, I honestly not sure if I believe them. I see the way that they talk about people in the past and the way they conduct their business, and they take advantage of everyone and everything their can. Interviewing people for free consults (no intention of hiring), making rude jokes about people right after they left a meeting, etc. I just have this rotten feeling that they are secretly getting me to work for free, and stringing me along with the idea of getting paid just until summer is up.

They are also not easy to work for, and in hindsight, I should've clued in when the others left. We'll have meetings and talk about what moves to make going forward, but it's all work I'm going to have to do. Super weird having the room talk about things they don't know how to do, and then turn to me, and be like ""go"". Then, their wanna-be UX/UI designer (it's not their official position) will constantly ask me to develop new features and then get disappointed when it's not exactly their ""vision"".

For example, and I'm going to be general with this example for identity reasons and such, but there was this flow they wanted this huge form on our front end to go through. It has a million dependencies of what shows up when, and how many things can be clicked, etc, etc. I built it, and it was one of the harder projects I have ever done. It works quite well, and I am very proud of my work. However, I organized it such that it acts like nodes in a graph with each child node watching its parents tell it when to show up. I'm sure this is getting vague, but the point was that this person, an adult, practically threw a fit that the dependencies didn't flow from parent to child. I tried to explain how I thought this solution was more elegant but I gave up eventually. They also got mad about inconsistent names across platforms when I was simply following their Figma and documents that THEY made. I was gonna make it consistent but I didn't want them to freak out about me using different labels, backfired eh.

I asked them to bring on more people but we had interviews with them, and I saw some of their work, and so far I feel like working with any of them would be more of a headache than a help. I'm not a great developer but damn I saw some bad stuff. They don't seem to have money to pay for any good developers outside of their AI projects.

So, my questions to all you lovely people who decided to read all of this. What is my best next move? How do I bring up their current treatment of me? I would quit, but I'm getting good experience working on big projects. But I am teaching myself everything, not getting paid yet (despite constant promises), and getting treated by this one person like a bit of their developer bitch. I rather not stir up some bad blood because I feel like that would make my job harder too. I'm not a confrontation person either, but I feel like they know that too. I just have some tunnel vision about the whole thing, and I would love the opinions from technical people. Thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 1: Before anyone asks, during the interview process I forgot a bit about asking about payment. And I was just excited for my first internship offer. Plus, unpaid internships are incredibly rare where I am, and I'm fairly sure illegal. So I never really considered that I wouldn't get paid. I was informed about this about two/three months after accepting to join the team. Right as places stopped accepted applications and most places had their internships filled.

Edit 2:

Td;lr: I got myself into a shitty situation. I'm an unpaid intern working as the only full-stack dev at this tiny tiny start-up. I'm getting a lot of good experience working on big projects. But other than that, this position sucks, and I'm being treated poorly by one particular member. I'm also being told that I will get paid, but I'm sus if that is actually going to happen. Need help trying to find the next steps. Although, it's pretty clear that the next step is run. I just don't want to not have an internship for the last two months of summer. I have become such a better developer because of this, but Im sick of feeling like I am being taken advantage of."

Doing things entrepreneurship related made me very excited and feel alive.

Last year, I joined my old friend's startup as an early employee remotely. I was super excited to be working on the startup but a year later, I am beginning to find it a chore. Sometimes I feel like the startup is going nowhere and I can barely muster the energy to work on it weekly. At the same time, I became preoccupied with an internship at a big tech company. 

I would love to hear some thoughts on: 

1) How do I deal with burnout? and when is the right time to quit if I no longer enjoy working at a startup? 

2) What are some factors that keep startup founders motivated to persevere through hardships for a long time? Am I missing something like ""passion"" lol."

I graduated in May 2020 as an IT major. Before I even knew a pandemic was coming, I had high hopes on finding a good job after college with hopes of moving out, escaping my parents, and have no apocalyptic effects. People my age were lucky we were in a senior year during a strong economy. The pandemic came and ravaged the wonderful economy we had leaving me to suffer apocalyptic effects. I was lucky to land a project based job across the country and I moved in with my normie grandparents. Great. The job lied saying it was part time IT work and it was basically project based manual labor in a data center. They gave me a 40 hr/wk  temporary job as a data center technician eventually, which I got let go of on the second week for no reason and I never told anyone in the family. I landed an internship in May as a wireless testing technician, which I quit because it was 12 hours a day, 5 days a week, and overnight and could not handle it, and I never told anyone, so I'm pretending to go to work every day.

My parents keep hearing about other people my age getting master's degree and some getting full time jobs with benefits. I am 23, and my mom keeps ranting to me how I have 3 years left to be on their benefits because I am going to cost them so much money for any medical checkup when I am 26. I still don't have a ful time job with benefits and now she thinks getting a master's degree is going to help me get a job. Telling me to get a Master's Degree is not going to help. You were the one complaining how I costed you guys so much money on college expenses and even if I paid for my own, you would be the one harassing me about grades, grades, grades. Thankfully my grandparents said they would pay for a Master's if I do go for one.

I graduated DURING A RECESSION! Like do people not understand how recessions work? Then my mom keeps ranting to me how ""everything is opening up"", but the news keeps saying that, but it is still hard to get a job and the news only caters to restaurant workers more than people who need white-collared jobs."
o8s3v5,0,2021-06-27,How to get my foot in the door as a dba or data engineer,tylandlannister,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/o8s3v5/how_to_get_my_foot_in_the_door_as_a_dba_or_data/,"Like the title says, I want to know what is the best way to enter data related careers EG DBA and data engineering.

As I explained here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mtxoax/from\_web\_development\_to\_data\_engineering\_because/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mtxoax/from_web_development_to_data_engineering_because/), I cannot get into most development areas because they require creating gui's / frontend components. Even so-called backend positions ask for knowledge of frontend these days. Besides, just looking at how fullstack careers dominate the market, I'm not enthusiastic about entering a career where I'm only hirable by a handful of companies.

So I'm guessing data related areas are the best alternative since they are minimal when it comes to designing gui's / frontend components. My plan is to go the DBA route and eventually transition to data engineering after some years. I say this because data engineering seems to have a steeper learning curve.

The problem I am encountering though, is there really aren't many junior data positions. The few entry level ads I see require two to three years experience. I guess this is because no company wants some inexperienced shmuck handling precious data.

So my question is what is the best way to get my foot in the door?

Some facts about me:

I don't have a CS degree, and I'm unlikely to get one any time soon.

My southern african country really doesn't have many tech opportunities, so joining as an intern won't cut it, since people with CS degrees are battling to get the few precious spots available.

I'm visually impaired, which means I struggle with most areas of development when it comes to designing the frontend. Like I already said, backend positions are decreasing to the point trying to make it as a junior backend developer with no experience is career suicide.

For what it's worth, I've done some backend for an NGO working alongside a frontend developer. I also have a GitHub with a couple of exercise projects [https://github.com/towercodes](https://github.com/towercodes).

Any advice will be greatly appreciated. Thanks."

I can't go back to my school because of academic probation. I should've taken a break and dealt with my mental issues but instead, I stubbornly decided to resume school as if I was getting better mentally, which is what I told all my advisors, but I lied to both them and myself. 

Besides that, most of the courses I think matters most, I have gotten A/Bs on so I've finished about 70% of my degree. I did actually learn some things in school, I can solve leetcode questions. Despite being a degenerate I guess, I'm quite professional, good at speaking and hard working when others are depending on me. I know people will say deal with your depression first, and I do have a bit of a balance now, but I don't think I will ever be able to ""deal with it"" completely. So why am I asking this question?

Basically when I was applying to internships (which I never got), a lot of entry level SWE jobs I've came across seemed to qualify experience akin to a CS degree. Now that I find myself looking for a job, I'm noticing almost all of the job requirements I come across require some degree whether bachelors or associates. And this confounds me because of the surge I've noticed in bootcamps which are supposed to give non-degree people a fighting chance?"

As the title says, I (22) graduated with a first-class bachelors degree in Accounting and Finance in June 2020. Since then I interned with a big4 as an IT Audit intern. This was a little different from my course as it involved a bit of coding, fraud analysis and also basics of power bi (data visualization).

Now I am back to job hunts and I am conflicted with which area I want to find work in. I am planning to complete my ACCA qualification since I get certain exemptions with my course but that is more to do with Accounting. I applied for Data Analysis positions the past month, since I enjoyed the work I did during the internship, but have received no response. Most of the opportunities in fact require a CS degree. There is finance too but I have had no luck there either. 

When it comes down to the question of what I am passionate about, then I have two answers ready. One, any responsibility given to me that has a bit of puzzle solving, I would love to do it and will put in my all. Two, teaching. But getting into teaching is not easy, I'm concerned that I am more interested in the idea of teaching than it as a career. Once I get into it, will I be able to bounce back if I don't enjoy it? I deep down want to gain some experience and maybe then impart that knowledge through teaching.

While job hunting, I also want to pick up on some skills, but when I am so conflicted with which area I want to get into, I am confused about which course to do as well.

Any advice is absolutely welcome! Big gratitude, thanks!"

I immediately went to staples, looked around, and found a Lenovo Ideapad (a brand I've had success with in the past) [This Specific Model Here](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/ideapad/ideapad-300-series/IdeaPad-3-15ITL6/p/88IPS301550#) that looked pretty good, then found a version the same model but upgraded with more memory and features on sale for the exact same price as the lesser version ([I think it was this](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Lenovo-IdeaPad-3-15-6-Laptop-Intel-Core-i3-1005G1-Dual-Core-Processor-4GB-Memory-128GB-Solid-State-Drive-Windows-10S-Almond-81WE0016US/204694676?wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;selectedSellerId=101029120)) at $450. The guy did warn me against getting an i3 model and said to look for an i5 especially if I'd be using zoom. Outside of school and watching stuff I'm not a very computer intensive guy (though that may change as I get more into coding and online classes). I did manage to run the full two weeks relatively well, though there were two days where the zoom kept crashing (admittedly by that point between installing stuff for the new computer and online data classes I had over 200 tabs open). It's pretty comfortable to use and the screen is nice. Mouse isn't great but I can just buy a separate one to plug in.

In spite of this though I do worry about it getting power crept especially since I've got plenty of college ahead of me. Today's the last day to return it so I'm wondering if I should get my money back and maybe invest in something else. Again, I don't do too much serious computing. My biggest ambition in that regard would be doing coding, and the possibility of doing YouTube in the future (though maybe I'd just get a separate computer entirely for that).

From what little research I've done [I've heard this is a good model](https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-15-6-Inch-Convertible-Touchscreen-i5-6200U/dp/B01ISOO3S4?dchild=1). Though again, I'm not sure if that's a smarter buy, or just unnecessary/a potential waste. The crux being is it a bigger waster to buy the slightly cheaper and simpler one with the fear of it being power crept in a fairly short time, or the more expensive thing which could have the same shelf life or even potentially die sooner (plus even a high spec machine could get power crept depending on how things go).

Also two important things to note before giving some advice. I don't have much money at this current moment, but I am about to be getting over $3000 from an upcoming tax return, so money won't be too much of an issue (though I don't wanna over invest in something that'll only last a year or two). I also won an Ipad ([This one specifically](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08J5S1XYF/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=20QJFS5VYYHV8&amp;dchild=1)) from my internship that's coming in the mail. Currently I don't really need one, so I may just sell it or give it away, but maybe if I look more towards a high performance machine the Ipad can be my casual device (genuine question though, is there any advantage to having a laptop and a tablet? because outside of reading I don't see much extra use from it if I already have a laptop)."
o8xnqk,2,2021-06-27,My Childhood with ADD was a nightmare,undermyrooftop,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/o8xnqk/my_childhood_with_add_was_a_nightmare/,"I got severe ADD and it has conditioned my entire life, but it specially conditioned one phase of my life, my childhood.

I am 25 years old and live in a country where mental health is starting to be a topic right now, but when i was a child, the unattentive kid was just ""stupid"". 

I went to a Religious school that had a very old fashioned way of teaching even for that time. Teachers would hit the kids, and i even had an abuser teacher (physically abuser) that sent me to the hospital in some of her various punishments.

When i was a child i was extremely unattentive, i was all the time lost in my thoughts, thinking about fantasies i made on my head fueled by cartoons and movies, i loved that enterteinment a lot.

I never paid attention in class, all i did in class was imaginig stuff, being EXTREMELY bored (and boredom pushes me to depressive thoughts) and looking at the Watch in the classroom to see how much torture was left.

For being an unattentive kid i was treated like a ""stupid"", kids would make fun of me and teachers too, there was this sentence that even today is stuck in my mind said by every teacher i had and it says ""you are a mess"".

In the religious school the teachers would treat kids who didn't have a good performance as ""rebellious"" or ""conflictive"", when i was extremely shy and insecure, i never gave a problem, never spoke in class, never got in troubles, i just had bad grades.

A teacher once told me i was a ""parasite of society"" because i never did my homework and the state ""is paying my education for me to turn it down"" (i was 10 when she said this). For me school was a torture chamber, kids would bully me and teachers were atrocious. 

I had a teacher when i was 8 that tortured me for being an affeminate boy. I was always with girls and had long hair, and for this close minded woman that was the biggest rebellious attitude in a kid. She banned me from playing with girls, she called my mom several times to have a meeting and insist that she should cut my hair, that it was not okay for a boy to have long hair.

I was terrified of this teacher and i would pretend to be ill every day to not go to school, i tried so hard that i convinced my mom several times, so i would skip a lot of days of class. This teacher also gave me Maths, so after skipping so many maths lessons i was way behind of the class in math knowledge. 

One day i couldn't make a maths operation and she punished me standing up. I have low blood pressure issues and when i was a kid i couldn't stand without moving for more than 5 minutes. She had me standing an entire class of one hour. 

While i was standing i begged her to sit down because i was feeling very ill, but she said i was lying and that i was a liar, the kids of the class started to beg her too to let me sit because i was getting paler and paler, and at one point i walked to her sit to ask her if i could sit for the 10th time and i fainted, after fainting i hit my head against the floor and i had to go to the hospital.

And you may wonder if she stopped abusing me after that... No, she found the new way to punish me, after that event she punished me standing up for absolutely everything and when she saw i was about to faint she would tell me to sit, in 2 more occassions she didn't calculate well and i had to go to the hospital again.

In the Hospital they asked me what was wrong at school, but i was so terrorized of this woman that i lied and said that nothing happenned. 

Many of you might be wondering why my parents didn't do anything, but my parents were extremely absent at that time, my mom would not pay attention to me or my siblings beyond taking me to school, she would suspect nothing, and my dad was all the week at work, i only saw him one day on the week.

The worst part is that my parents would hit me and punish me for having bad grades, it was a never ending cycle. Going to school, getting bullied, having bad grades, getting scolded by teachers, going home after failing my grades, getting hit, getting punished (with deprivation of affection included) and all this started again.

My parents were very strict with my school performance, but they didn't pay us any attention either, i never did my homework and my parents wouldn't even ask me if i did them, they just cared about my performance the day when the grades paper came home.

When i was a teen all got worse, my dad had even beat me for having bad grades, my mom just watched my dad beat me and did nothing. When i was 14 they sent me to an intern school an entire summer for having bad grades as a punishment, while they went on vacation. At that intern school i got bullied for being gay.

At 16 they did the same on summer, and then decided to let me in the intern school the entire year until i was 18. ""You have bad grades, if you don't go there you will never pass"" they said, if i was lonely and bullied there, it was my problem, my mom said ""you were always very special, normal people don't have your issues"". 

Because of all this i had severe depressions, low self steem, anxiety, and the list doesen't end.

ADHD made my childhood a complete nightmare.

TL;DR

Having ADD in an old minded country, with old minded parents and in a religious school led me to physical and psychological abuse that has left me scarred for life."

I moved to the US when I was 17 by myself learned English and graduated college with a finance degree in 2019. And 20k in saving. 

During my time in college, I joined the school finance club where we managed around 600k of an investment portfolio. And I became the co-fund manager because I was very determined to learn and spend days and nights helping. 

After I graduated I had an ambitious goal to start an investment company raising money from connections and spent most of my savings trying to get the business off the ground but things did not go as planned. once the pandemic hit I found myself with 0$ in my account and no job. 

I was so desperate to make money so I started flipping things online to make some money but it’s a very tough business since I have to go to thrift stores and spent hours to find something worth it.

I’m a very entrepreneurial person and love working for myself but things have been so rough that I end up around 20k in debt because of rent and other things I had to pay during the pandemic to get by. 

Last week I had an internship offer from a mortgage company 12 an hour and 12 hours shift as a call center. However, I’m still working to get my work authorization from the government since I’m not a citizen yet.

I raised 25k last week from a friend to start an e-commerce business with a promise to start paying him back in 3 months. 

In the meantime, my roommate is covering my rent 1000 until I get on my feet again. 

I feel like I’m in desperate need for a mentor to at least guid me. 

I feel very lost and not sure what to do. I m hungry for success willing to do whatever it takes but just not sure what to do. I can’t get a job, I don’t have a family here in the United States, and super stressed out."

o90zb7,23,2021-06-27,Grade 12 PCM Gulf NRI here. Torn apart between choosing to study in India or Canada? What do I choose?,rodrygo27,Indian_Academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indian_Academia/comments/o90zb7/grade_12_pcm_gulf_nri_here_torn_apart_between/,"my_qualifications: Grade 12 PCM Gulf NRI student. 

 After thorough research I've decided to pursue Computer Science after graduation. I'm very torn apart between choosing to do undergrad in India or abroad.

My goal after undergrad is to do Masters and immigrate hopefully.

I have 2 options:

Option 1: Do CS 4 yrs undergrad in India  + 2 yrs Masters abroad ( preferably Canada )

Option 2: Do 4 yrs CS undergrad Abroad + 2 yrs Masters ( both preferably Canada )

Option 1 is much more economical and comfortably affordable but admission into top colleges are harder. I will do JEE and try for NITs but if that's not possible , recommend some good  private CS colleges in India.

Couple of reasons I'm looking to study abroad rather than India is because I've read and heard from a lot of people that colleges in India have this mug up culture where they prioritize textbook learning and getting good marks rather than developing critical thinking etc. In cs and programming I want to develop my own skills and critical thinking skills rather than only learning from a textbook/mug up which I've experienced all these years I've studied in a CBSE curriculum.

Also living standards I'm used to currently will be not be the same in India , however I'm comfortable enough in adjusting to anywhere.

However I'm very ill-informed regarding information about doing 4 yrs undergrad in India and then going to Canada for Masters . I did my research but I always got contradicting information which confuses me even more. Some say doing masters in Canada after undergrad in India is hard to get and some say otherwise. So whoever knows few things regarding this , please enlighten me.

Now Option 2 is more strain on my family for funding but somewhat affordable.  I could also take up part time jobs to help. I think quality of education is better in Canada than India. Also internship opportunities are much better and overall standard of living is higher.

Costs: The average university cost for colleges I've researched in Canada is Rs.25 Lakh/yr.  While most colleges in India are from Rs.5-10 lakh/yr.



My family are equally fine with any choice and have left the final decision with me.

I have researched both these options a lot but still find difficulty in finding a decisive answer

What do you think is the more suitable choice?

Any input would be greatly helpful and appreciated."

I'm very much into science and learning so I think it would be amazing if I could get a career in more academic circles but I am not too picky in that.

The problem is now that I have 1 month to figure out where I want an internship, I have already been looking for 2 months and spent 20+ hours scrolling on LinkedIn and indeed and found 50 relevant internships to which I applied for 10. Only one had a follow-up but still not sure if they have something for me. 

So my question then becomes how can I find an internship that will propell my career into becoming an ML expert as soon as possible? Should I aim for big companies? Should I be picky? Is internship salary a relevant metric? Should I look at the team and their experience? Are there any websites that can hook me up to great companies to do an internship at? I don't know anyone with a career in Software but I have so many questions.

o96h0o,16,2021-06-27,18 y.o Filipino-American Don't Want to be a Nurse and is Fearful about Future?,Spare-Phase502,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/o96h0o/18_yo_filipinoamerican_dont_want_to_be_a_nurse/,"Hi, this is my first post on Reddit so sorry if this is a bit messy or disorganized. Like the title says I am an 18 y.o Filipino-American located in the Bay Area. I ""graduated"" high school during the pandemic in 2020. I applied to a couple of UCs and CSUs thinking I would go into nursing or biology. But, I decided to go into Community College (CC) as a pre-nursing major hoping to transfer into a BSN program. I chose those two because I thought maybe I wanted to go clinical and they were the only careers I saw because my parents wanted me to be a doctor or a nurse. As I was doing my prerequisites I noticed that nursing really wasn't for me. Especially after our chem prof posed a question asking us ""What kind of career do you want in the health science field?"" (this was a health science-oriented chem course). EVERYONE said nursing, and many of my classmates were making a career change and I could tell they wanted to be a nurse. But, when I had to answer I guess the truth came out and I said: ""I don't know"".

I would say that month itself was very crazy. I was dealing with a lot of mental health problems like anxiety and depression. In California nursing is EXTREMELY competitive. I understand why because of the lack of funds and the lack of educators. But, just thinking about having to beat 200-1,000 people for the 50 spots in one program was really daunting to me. I was scared of failing my courses because I knew I needed a 4.0 gpa to get into a program. There were many times during the night I would cry just thinking about having to apply, to take the TEAS, passing my future classes, it all sucked. I don't even think I would be able to handle the mental and physical toll that nurses have to carry on their backs. They are amazing heroes and need more credit for what they do. But, then I also knew that I didn't want to do nursing either, especially with all the emotions of just being a pre-nurse felt. I don't want to experience a month like that ever again.

I then switched my major into something else (Public Health) and I am definitely enjoying it a lot more than when I was a pre-nurse. I think I've done more being a public health major. For example, I became a mental health advocate my CC (ironic) and even held a panel where me and my friends (we are all a part of the AAPI community) talked about our mental health being AAPI students in college. It is one of my proudest moments and I want to continue doing this type of work or more administrative work in this field.

Now, this is where my parents come in. Because of course this channel? Subreddit? Is about Asian parent stories. I went to a wedding recently and my uncle had asked in front of my parents what I was studying in CC. Because my mom had to brag about me graduating as a magna cum laude and all of that. I replied, ""I am a public health major"". Of course, a lot of people don't know what this degree is, even I was one of those people before I switched to it. So he said ""Oh nursing? Like doctor?"". I looked at my parents and it even seemed like they were anticipating that I was going to the clinical route. That is the ONE thing I hate about being in this major is that people only see it as a stepping stone to doing something clinical. When I say I am in Public Health they automatically point me towards the clinical route which gets on my nerves. It's true you can go clinical, but you don't have to. I could go on about the diverse jobs within public health, but I'll just get straight to the point. I don't want to go clinical at all and I'd rather be some sort of program coordinator creating programs to benefit a community or hospital. I understand Filipinos have this mindset where being a nurse or doctor are really the only careers out there and it's hard to change their minds without proof. I feel like I'm barely lucky I have a family member in Public Health who has a good career being a program manager to use her as an example of what I want to do. She is even my inspiration because she got into a direct-entry nursing program (one of the best public nursing programs in the state), she had a 4.2 gpa in high school, was very active in leadership, worked hella hard to get into such a competitive program after high school. But, ultimately her passion was elsewhere and it turned out great for her when she switched into Public Health.

I am scared of being in this major (hence the fearful part of the title) because I know I need experience if I really want to reach my goals. Not only that but also transferring to a good school with a strong program. It's scary choosing this major where the career isn't so straightforward like other majors and more of an uphill battle (though I know all majors have their own battles). Because I've been told in the past ""It's hard to find a job in public health"" or ""My neighbor is only a coordinator and can't move up without a master's"". Finding a job, doing the whole networking LinkedIn thing, and just thinking about life after college scares me. My parents/titas (aunts) often talk about my cousins and how after college they struggled to find jobs and all of that because their degree wasn't that straightforward. I could pretty much say I am scared of failure. I have always been a good student but it's just my parents have so many expectations of me. When I didn't get into a UC (honestly I knew I wouldn't get in either because I only applied to two) my mom was upset. Not necessarily at me, but she didn't understand why I was rejected because she thought I was smart enough. So obviously I'm scared of letting them down and not succeeding in this new path.

I don't know if I am complaining. I understand life is hard and I need to suck it up and just put my best foot forward (literally someone said that to me). I guess because this is all so new to me it's just something that has been bothering me. I mean just the other year I was a high school senior and now all of the sudden I'm thrown into the world with a weird transitional period because everything is online. I've also had past experiences with dealing with existential crisis sort of things? (idk how to word it out). I have also had an unhealthy habit of stalking Reddit and searching things like ""What to do with a bio degree"", ""Scared after college"", ""No internships"", etc., etc. I know I shouldn't compare myself to people with those stories, but I just ask myself too many ""What if?"" questioned (and of course one of my friends always has to remind me to snap out of it).

I guess it was just finally my time to post my story somewhere rather than looking through the countless posts, if anyone else felt this way before? I kind of just feeling alone in all of this and I know I am still young, I should work hard, that my whole life is still happening. It's just I don't have a community of people to talk about this specific problem with and I want to know if anyone relates (which is why I chose discussion rather than rant/vent). Anyways that was a lot to get off my chest.

\*Also to let everyone know I am seeing professional help and I am doing things to try to keep myself in a positive consciousness. I just really like reading other people's stories where this resonates with them. Because I feel like I know the obvious of being scared of letting them down again, I just want to know if anyone else had this experience? Or felt fearful about the future which is why I don't generally need much advice."
o96jqo,3,2021-06-27,I need to change roommates because he uses hard drugs,comedymental,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/o96jqo/i_need_to_change_roommates_because_he_uses_hard/,"Hi,

I traveled to this place. My roommate is also the landlord. I need to change roommates because he and his friend use hard drugs. His friend that uses hard drugs is really weird. Although he's friendly to me, he's also been dishonest to me, and he’s irresponsible (he's told me that he has multiple DUIs). The house is really nice and in a very nice neighborhood. He drives a new Porsche. I thought he was like a party kinda guy.

Initially, the lease type was month to month, but when I was signing the lease, I agreed to a fixed lease term. I plan to stay for three months so I paid for those three months and the deposit upfront. I didn't want to worry about housing during my trip. The first couple weeks were okay.

Two weeks in, I ask to go to the beach for a walk, he agrees, then the day of he comes to me and he's super excited about going to the bar near the beach. I agree, then I laid down in bed and took a nap (because i didn't really want to go) and I agreed to play a game with my friend during that time. Then I text him after he pre-games that I can't go. He starts throwing things around and cursing at his dog, I can hear this from my room. He has offered to take me to go do cocaine with him twice. A week later, he brings his weird girlfriend home. The next day, from my room, I hear him scream loudly for less than an hour. One of the things he says is ""nude bodies everywhere"".

After I hear him say his girlfriend left a bag to his room, and that he was worried about getting searched, I deduce that he's probably doing cocaine in his room or possibly something else. I wasn't that worried, but after I saw his girlfriend and the way she carried herself, plus the stories about her stealing things, the fact that moments after seeing me she decided to have sex so loudly that I could hear it on the opposite side of the bungalow. I have a feeling that she's really weird and possibly passive aggressive.  I am worried this will end really badly for me, just because of her.

Another issue is, I bought toilet paper for the whole house. I noticed that a lot of the toilet paper I bought was missing over a shorter period of time than usual. My roommates probably wouldn't horde it. This makes me think his girlfriend took it and it makes me feel like she and my landlord/roommate are already taking advantage of me.

I really wanted a friend as I was visiting this new place. He'd always give me alcohol, offer to take me to places in his car. I don't know if I should lie and tell him I need to go to my home city or tell him why I don't want to live with him. I really want my deposit and the remaining two months of rent. He probably won't take it well if I tell him the real reason why. Also, I can say the time zone difference is affecting me too much while I work and I need to go to my home city.

I am also planning on documenting the drugs to the police somehow. I know it's douchey or that perhaps they won't care. My college applications (and college) mentor, the only person I talk to, is a lawyer, but I am ashamed of this, he's really busy and I don't want to stress him out. I have enough money to find another place, but if I don't get my deposit and rent back, I won't be able to afford a laptop with the specs I wanted for next semester and have a savings for housing over winter break.

July is in a few days, and I doubt he will be able to fill the room by then. I can agree for him to keep half the rent for that month to alleviate the missed income.

By the way, his uncle owns the house. This probably doesn't matter, but I don't think he has a mortgage.

I'm a college student with a 3.91 GPA, with an internship at a prestige tech company. No criminal history. Bad credit. I'm 22 and also moved out of my house when I was 19 and I am very scared about being around people like this."

What should I do in the middle of my first internship?,WhoKnowsThisUniverse,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/o96wm5/burnout_incapable_of_looking_at_code_what_should/,"Hey, first-year CS student here currently enrolled in a web dev internship (my first internship).

I want to preface this by saying that in the past week, I have not put in a single line of code for my current ticket. Yet I tried - I tried really hard, but was too tired and had slight mental breakdowns and concentration issues throughout the days.

At first, I was trying to push through the ticket really fast. I would console log the arguments from certain functions and see what JSON objects were being passed through. But I realized that I was afraid of looking at the actual SQL procedures that were being used to pass these JSON objects.

Then, when I discussed things with my manager, he told me that I cannot assume anything, and he asked me certain questions about the codebase which I was not able to answer appropriately. He lectured me on the importance of not guessing, and eventually, I was determined to understand all the details of the SQL procedures instead.

Funny thing is, I took way too long this time and spent time focusing on rather unimportant things. So this Friday, when I discussed with my boss my understanding of it, he realized how little progress I made and berated me a little. He said he wanted the ticket done (fairly reasonable) and used a rather inappropriate word. He offered me to lower the difficulty of the ticket and have him do much more, but due to a mix of pride (?) and misunderstanding (I thought he'd look down on me if I said yes, and I didn't want to create more work for him neither), I refused. I might ask him to lower the difficulty, but ticket is due next week and it'll frustrate him once again if I tell him so.

So I thought, ""I'll catch up during the week-end"". And turns out that even during the week-end, I could not do much. I was looking at the stored procedure (400 lines of code), and just kept looking at it. I somewhat understand many parts of it, but I'm still unsure as to how to approach the ticket. To be clear, I asked quite a few questions to many senior engineers and people around my team, but perhaps the questions were not the right ones; perhaps I should've said something like ""wtf, how should I approach this ticket plz help me walk through everything"".

And now, I feel bummed out. My head hurts when I look at the code. In fact, being quite sensitive, some of the things my boss said affected me, and I'm afraid of not meeting the deadline of the end of the current sprint (next week), which will disappoint my boss.

I'm not sure what happened this week. I was always quite tired, and sometimes could not concentrate for hours. My back hurt, and I was super sad (crying) and incapable of doing anything.

And I feel... genuinely slow at reading others' code. It is so hard to process and remember the different variables being placed. It is quite hard to understand some of the structures native to the language I'm working with. It's so hard to read the documentation sometimes: I cannot even understand what it's saying and have to look through other references sometimes to understand what's going on. My manager promotes a mixture of ""I cannot babysit you"" and also ""Ask questions! Always ask."" Both of which are correct, but it just leaves me nowhere - not sure if the questions I have can be found (and when I try to find them, I end up not finding them) or should be asked.

I know I'm behind other people in my team, too, and I'm kind of going to go in a cycle of 'try to put in more hours to learn the extra stuff and get the work done' --&gt; 'getting less efficient due to always staring at the screen and not relaxing from the pressure' --&gt; repeat.

Deep down, though, I also just want to quit it all and not do anything. I did not rest at all during the last summer before starting in CS at UW (had some personal issues). I then had some trouble adjusting to my first semester, then spent the winter vacations grinding side projects, then another semester of UW. I want to just not do anything anymore and be free.

I'm not too sure anymore. Deadline of current sprint is next week. And I'm really tired of it all too. I imagine myself being criticized by my boss again (and I'm sensitive...), dragging my team down, being incapable of contributing, failing the internship. And I feel like this might be a mental vicious circle that's going to repeat itself and just going to worsen my performance even more.

I'm probably going to ask for vacations now for a week or so in the week after next week. But I don't know... I don't know how other people do it. How people read the code and understand what's going on. How people... do it all.

Have anyone else had such a similar experience, too? What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: well, I doubt anyone will see this, but thanks to all for the answers! The week went pretty well, actually. I was frank about my mistakes and what I've done wrong, and I simply explained everything to the manager, who helped me accomplish what I had to do and actually took over the ticket. All in all, I guess it was an experience to go through!

Also, I just want to mention that there is nothing really wrong about my boss or the company, I think. Ofc, I would not mention my company, neither. Ultimately, it was a series of (honest) mistakes on my part, I think, that ultimately led to me being super behind on that particular ticket. Just a lot of emotions and thoughts that went through my head."

I am extremely interested in AI research, but I found that when it comes to CS, a lot of career paths interest me in the field. I’ve been told that data science tends to be uninteresting and math heavy, while Software engineering is far more versatile and useful. 

I should also mention I have dyscalculia, a math learning disorder, so I worry that the disorder will make it harder for me to understand certain concepts, though I’m willing to try regardless. 

In the experience of people on this subreddit, what is the more important branch in AI research? Software or data science? Which career path is the better bet long term? I see varied answered when I google this."

It's completely my fault too which is why I came here to vent... To preface this vent, I need to mention that I have pretty severe social anxiety. For me, it just means that I overthink every social interaction I have and I'm pretty uncomfortable in unfamiliar social situations. However, I can be fairly outgoing depending on the situation. 

Back to the vent now. During my interview for this internship I tried to come off as an extrovert and even said I was not often shy, which is such a lie but I really wanted this internship as a resume booster. I was hired based on that assumption, so needless to say, it's been difficult. This is a financing role where I am responsible for drumming up new business and supporting the loan process. I've had to network quite a lot (which is SO far out of my comfort zone) and I have to talk in front of 15 people in meetings. The talking has never been for more than a minute though. I've gotten used to this by now, but it still makes me anxious every time. What is making me the most anxious is that my manager wants me to give a presentation on a new offer we have in front of everyone in my 15-person meeting plus a few more. This is terrifying as all attention will be on me and I'm essentially teaching a bunch of seasoned professionals as an INTERN. My manager is also having me research everything we offer so that I can start making cold calls. This is the last thing I want to do but in the interview I definitely said I would be comfortable doing it. Both of these things are causing me so much anxiety and I really don't know how to make myself feel any better so I'm just trying my best to get through it. 

Honestly, I'm angriest at myself for lying in the interview. I knew my social anxiety was pretty bad but I still decided to do this to myself. I sort of thought it would help, like exposure therapy or something, but it's been the worst couple months of my life and I still have a few more to go. Being honest with my manager and telling him I lied isn't really an option either because I want a good reference at the end of this. I guess I learned my lesson and I know that this is definitely not a viable career option in the future."

I have 2 years of software development experience with a wide knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms. I attend top 10 CS programs in the USA.  
I had a lot of experience interviewing with big tech companies.  
\*\*Why I am doing this for free?\*\*  
I am currently preparing for multiple Top tier companies' interviews in the next 2 months. I love teaching CS concepts to others. It helps me think better about them and it helps me be committed to the prep process. I am doing it for free because most of my knowledge was gained with the help of many people over the years. It is time to pay it back and pay it forward.  
Please before you sign up make sure that you will be committed. I would like to invest my time with people who are committed to the process and learning.  
\*\*Time Commitment\*\*  
2 or 3 live sessions over zoom  
In 2 sessions I will explain the data structure and assign problems for the week  
In 1 session I will explain the solutions for some of the assigned problems  
The total time of the course will be two months  
Start Date: July/ 02  
End Date: August/ 29  
\*\*What concepts will be covered?\*\*  
I will provide easy, medium, hard level problems from different concepts like  
HashMap  
Binary Search  
LinkedList  
Arrays &amp; Strings  
Trees  
Binary Search  
Tree Binary  
Stack  
Queue  
Recursion  
Dynamic Programming  
\*\*How many students am I planning to take?\*\*  
\*\*10 students \*\*  
\*\*What will the classes offer?\*\*

1. 5 coding problems assigned per week.
2. Written solution in C++ for the assigned problems
3. Access to discord community with the other students;  
\*\*Administrative notes:\*\*
4. This is not an introductory programming course.
5. This is a data structure and algorithm course focused on problem-solving for coding interviews and competitive programming
6. The course will be taught in English
7. We will use C++ as the main coding language for the course
8. This is an intense Bootcamp. As mentioned above, this is my prep process for technical interviews. I know it works and I tried it myself to land internships and jobs. I am doing it with a group this time around.
9. You will get out of this course what you will put into it.
10. I will not monitor you if you solve the problems or not. You are responsible for your commitment to the material.  
Please DM or leave a comment if you are interested  
Note: I am only taking a limited amount of students"

o9bsfm,1,2021-06-27,Which internship should I do?,moonmoonoop,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/o9bsfm/which_internship_should_i_do/,"I am stuck deciding between two internships. One I already started and one that is starting this Monday.

Background: I just graduated with a degree in justice studies. My ideal job would be working in a policy role at a nonprofit dedicated to civil/human rights work. (I care most about racial and climate justice). I may go to law school or get a Master's in Public Policy. I would like to work in DC or New York.

I started internship 1 at the beginning of June. It is remote, unpaid and about 20-24 hours a week (although this really is not heavily monitored at all). Most of what this internship consists of is drafting social media posts and creating online graphics for a think tank in DC. I have done social media/communications work in the past. I really don't feel challenged or that I am learning anything new with this besides that I am gaining familiarity with a few new platforms. The main reason I applied for and started this internship was to potentially make connections in DC. However, with it being remote, I don't feel like I am doing that. The only connections I have made are with the social media team which may be helpful in terms of having a reference at the organization in general, but not really sure it'll benefit me in the long run.

Pros: potentially could allow me to have connections in DC, easy work

Cons: don't feel like I am learning anything new

Internship 2 is at the Attorney General's Office in my state. It is in-person (25-30 min commute), unpaid, and about 18 hours a week. This internship is with the Community Outreach/Education department which deals with crime prevention. I think it's a lot of typical intern work (answering calls, replying to emails, social media, research) and the description also states that I'd be ""helping with special projects and taking on a special project of my own."" I tried to gain more info about the day-to-day during the interview, but it's still quite unclear to me. This seems like a more professional, established internship and would allow me to gain experience in a sorta new area. I am sure this one might be more helpful in making connections but I don't want to stay/work in my state long-term and I feel that the connections may really only help me out locally. There are a few things to note like how the party affiliation of the office is not one I agree with. Secondly, with this being unpaid and in-person, I don't think the cost-benefit is that great. I'd be spending money on gas, doing more tasks than internship 1 and then not getting anything in return monetarily.

Pros: more professional, different area of work

Cons: cost-benefit is not great

Here are my options

1. I quit internship 2 before I start. Just stick with internship 1.
2. I go to the orientation for internship 2, decide it isn't for me, quit it.  

   1. the fact that I am quitting after orientation (even though it's not much better than doing it a day or two before) may be pretty bad. I would definitely burn bridges with the AGO.
3. I go to the orientation, decide it's for me, I quit internship 1  

   1. I would try to do a 2-week notice, would probably burn a bridge since I am quitting before the internship ends?"

For starters, me &amp; my two friends are a 6-hour drive away from our other 2 friends, the other is about 3 hours away from me. With the pandemic, we haven't been able to see each other, with all of us being vaxxed we thought this summer would be a great time to hang out as all of us will no longer be in college together at the same time, we all used to hang out all the time before the pandemic separated us. We all talked &amp; agreed that the two friends that are 6 hours away would drive up, pick up the 3rd friend who lives 3 hours away &amp; come to our city (which they have always wanted to visit) to celebrate two birthdays, (one friend that lives with me &amp; the friend that is 3hrs away from me). One friend that lives 6hrs away said they needed time to figure out if they were going to have work or not (they had no job at the time).

About 2.5 weeks before the trip was supposed to start being scheduled (i.e. Airbnb, itineraries, etc) the two friends that live 6hrs away from us told us that one of them could not call off work one of the days of the planned trip, &amp; the other said they did not think they would be able to go in case they got a job or an internship. We were all fine with it &amp; understood. A few days later I talked with the friend that lives 3hrs away &amp; asked if they would be able to come. They were honest &amp; said they didn't have the funds to go on the trip &amp; couldn't do the long drive alone, perfectly understandable.

The weekend of the two birthdays came by &amp; I celebrated my friend's bday that was here (22M), while the other friend who lives 3hrs away drove down towards the two other friends location (6hr away from me) for their bday (they were now about 1.5hr away from each other). The thing is those two friends said they had work they could not get out of, yet they were able to hang out with the 3hr away friend, sleepover &amp; spend essentially the entire weekend with her, but told us they couldn't visit our city because of ""work"" (we found out they were all together through social media posts). If they did not want to come they could have told us &amp; we would have understood but they continued to stall their answers until they finally said they would be busy with work they could not get out of (the day of the 3hr away from me friend's bday). Am I wrong for being pissed at the two 6hr away friends &amp; not wanting to plan future events with them for making time for the other friend and not us."

I am planning on applying to the spring semester of a Swiss university (not EPFL or ETH). Last year and my mental health really messed up my grades so I am worried. I am not done with all of my exams just yet but worst case scenario my profile would look like this: 

~ grade average: 8/10

~ research experience: 5 months as a Student Researcher at my university in the Data Science field

~ work experience: 5 months as a Cloud Software Developer Intern and 1 year as a Computer Science Intern in one of the biggest companies in the world (F100) but the company is not directly CS related.

And that would be all I can offer. I think it really is not much but would it perhaps be enough to apply to a ""normal"" university in Switzerland? For the admission the university only requires documents, no motivational letter, no LOR. Originally I come from Slovenia graduating at one of the two universities we have.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m really into fashion and entertainment (I’m a DJ) and I’ve always wanted to live in NYC. After years of visiting, my GF and I finally moved to Brooklyn last summer. Despite moving during the pandemic, I’ve had great luck with finding work. My current employer, I started as an intern, and I’ve worked my way up to Operations Manager in only 7 months of being there.

&amp;#x200B;

However, everything is not all great. The team is small and in the last year, 5 people have quit (essentially the entire team). The owner has yelled and cussed me out and I’ve watched him berate other employees several times. I’ve had a gut feeling ever since I started that this may not be for me - however after getting promotion after promotion, I’ve kinda stuck it out in hopes that things will get better. ( Which it has in a sense, but the dread and anxiety of going in every day has not)

&amp;#x200B;

Recently a job came across me from my GF’s sister, and it’s working in IT as a proposal manager. A total change of career, but recently I’ve been thinking just because I love fashion - doesn’t mean I have to work in it. The IT job is remote - and it will give me a bit of free time to practice DJ, prepare sets, travel, and travel as I already know kind of what the workload is. Also, there is Unlimited PTO, and the career outlook as a proposal manager seems pretty promising, especially here in NY. I don't mind working a 9-5 that I'm neutral about as long as I have time to enjoy the things I'm passionate about. 

&amp;#x200B;

As things are opening up here in NYC, I’ve already had 3 gigs at pretty reputable venues, and I know that more are on the way.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice here would be greatly appreciated.

TLDR: Moved to NYC to pursue a fashion career - not feeling it. Possibly have an offer from an IT job as a Proposal Manager with good benefits that’s remote."

o9kg93,1,2021-06-28,Is staying unemployed after graduation a red flag when applying for jobs in the future?,Sumukh__,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/o9kg93/is_staying_unemployed_after_graduation_a_red_flag/,"Background:
I am electronics graduate and I have learnt most of  the basics of CS from youtube and others from online courses. I have completed 2 internships, I have 2 projects on GitHub.(all related to software development).
I am aiming for software developer related roles, python is my primary language.

I have graduated a week ago with B.tech, unfortunately I did not get a job due to my high levels of anxiety issues during my college days. Now I have it under control and those issues have reduced significantly.

What I am currently doing now is (or planning to do is) learning popular problems and concepts from Algoexpert. Also practice a few more on competative programming sites. And then start applying for jobs.

I am not aware of the best practices with respect to securing a good job. I am planning to invest 8 hrs per day for 2 - 3 months  from now on. If you guys have ANY suggestions or anything, please let me know. It would be of great help. 
Thank you for your time."

I am currently on my second internship, and this one is at a larger company and I’m in my 7th week now and I have only one small project that I have been working on. Other than that I just update the floor plans. My last internship was a joke and I never got any engineering projects and then I got sent home because of covid. Online classes have also been a joke and I feel like I have barely learned anything in the past year. 

I feel very anxious because I feel like a fraud and I feel like I will never do well as a real engineer. I feel like I have not had any real experience in engineering and I am just worried that I will get a full time job and not deserve it, and then do poorly. 

I’m sure I’m not the only one to feel this way, so how have you guys dealt with the transition from college to career? Were you prepared?"
o9lump,1,2021-06-28,My sister has dibilitating OCD,ramonamax,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/o9lump/my_sister_has_dibilitating_ocd/,"Hey all! 

First off I just want to say thank you in advance for any help I sincerely appreciate it! 

So, my sister (29f) has OCD and I (22f) am currently living with her for the summer while I take an internship for school. So, I recognize that I am in her space, in her house, etc and that I definitely need to respect her boundaries and stuff about how she needs to keep her spaces and so on. 

Most of the time things are fine, we are just hanging out and things are good, we do an even pull of the chores and so on

But sometimes she does have an episode with her OCD where she goes on a cleaning rampage because and this is a direct quote “it’s just not right” and like of course she can do whatever she needs to to help alleviate the distress her OCD is causing her, however, in the course of the episode she tends to make me feel like I am not helping enough/am lazy/kind of just belittles me in general. 

I know she’s not intending to be like a massive ahole with it, and I am very aware that I am doing my fair share of work like to be completely real. I’ve tried to defend myself a little bit but in the midst of an episode she usually just doubles down in being condescending and mean to me. I just really don’t want this to damage our relationship because we are very close but it is getting aggravating and I do not want to lash out at her for something she is having a hard time dealing with. 

How do I bring up how her episodes are effecting me in a constructive manner? How would you suggest like mending the issue or helping to prevent her episodes?"

Many people have recommended the YouTube playlist by Quantum Leaps, which uses an Arm Cortex M processor. Is that a good place to start?
I am confused because I wanted to learn something practical right now, and it looks like many devices run on embedded Linux (at least at my current internship). Is that correct? What would an electric vehicle company like Tesla value more?"
o9nch5,2,2021-06-28,Job Offer Advice,heartsoreduke23,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/o9nch5/job_offer_advice/,"Hi. I have two internship offers for the Fall, and I'm struggling to choose (assume they have equal pay). The first is VC firm (subsidiary of a larger bank) in silicon valley, and the second is Nasdaq in Boston. They are both for SWE / dev positions, but the VC one has more of an emphasis on data science. The tech stacks required would be similar too. I think I would feel more important at the VC firm and may get to work on a larger variety of projects that may be a little cooler. Nasdaq, however, is a much larger tech company, and a position here would not only (I think) be better for future employment, but would use more recent / cutting edge technology. Any thoughts?"
o9p2gt,6,2021-06-28,Average Salary for Grad in London?,ProtoAstron,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/o9p2gt/average_salary_for_grad_in_london/,"I am due to graduate in 3 weeks' time and am on track to get a first from a Russel Group Uni. I have 4 months of experience from a summer internship in Web Dev but I am more interested in SWE / ML and Data Engineering roles. I've just started grinding on leetcode and applying for jobs over the last couple of weeks.

I am curious to know what you guys think is an acceptable starting wage for someone like me working in London. I've applied to a wide range of industries and have noticed large differences in graduate starting salaries.

Any other tips would be appreiated.

Degree: MS in AI from top 50ish school

GPA: 3.69

Research Experience: 1 Year during MS and 1 year during undergrad. One paper accepted in IEEE AIPR

Internship: One summer at a reasearch lab. 

LoR: I have two solid ones from professors I have done reasearch with in NLP/ML.

SoP: Is okay, always trying to improve. 

Work Experience: 3 years as a software developer, 2 years as a system admin.   


I was wondering mostly do I have a chance at a PhD in NLP/ML, or is ML just too competitive and I am way off base? Dream school is Columbia, but my target schools are UC Santa Barbara, Boston University, and NYU, am I being realistic with schools in that range?"

Hello, I don't use Reddit much, sorry if the advice I'm searching for is a bit vague, tldr at bottom of wall of text.

Wall of text:  
Grew up in Ottawa, Canada, moved to Egypt in 10th grade, finished high school there, great grades, revolution! but also economic decay, a lot of events lead to me being in a Mexican standoff (actual), very long story, got into the faculty of engineering at a mid-sized university there, studied architecture, work with good friend to change stagnant faculty, start 2 clubs, all clubs get banned (politics), work for allowing the use of 3d programs for design in faculty, success!, old powerful professor is an abuser of female students, become the class that does something about it, lead class in lawsuit, lots of drama, stalemate as it got out of hand and minister of education wanted it to go away, finish 5-year program, top of class for a bit, politics happen, get shunted, tied for second, still 95th percentile, graduate in Aug 2017 and become a part of the syndicate of engineers (architecture falls under engineering in Egypt), co-found 2 startups, one succeeds another ""fails"", also work as a project manager for 2 years for the family construction company, have been teaching art for 4 years now, make a bit of a name for myself in my city as an architect/artist/entrepreneur, have a massive network all over the country, if your rich in a third world country its always blood money, no matter how ""clean"" it seems, move back to Canada in Aug 2018, father and sister are here, fathers is a non practicing architect, both sisters are also architects, find various non career work, life slows down \*a lot\*, get educational equivalency through Carleton and CACB in May 2020 (lol economic downturn really hampers my slim chances of getting a job), registered now with CACB as intern architect (for those unaware, in Canada its a 4 year undergrad plus a 2 year masters to become an intern), last year had a gallery for my art, sold a piece for a thousand dollars so I guess a ""career"" as an artist maybe viable, though I would rather architecture, worked at the end of 2020 for 3 months on a tiny home on wheels start up idea, however it was not financially viable after I finished the market research/business plan  
Recently landed a sales job working for a construction magazine where base/commission would have paid about 60k a year but I quit two weeks in because cold calling+ sketchy+ not architecture  
Currently I'm working as a merchandiser part time, now have lots of time to work on career  
Financially I have no debt at all, and about 6 months worth of living expenses saved up

tl;dr:  
Registered intern architect (Ontario) with foreign education and experience has hard time finding career job in field that is dying slowly and is known for being quite saturated, where the margins are extremely thin and half of the people in that field end up switching careers 5 years down the line  


What I have currently:

I have my updated resume, a prewritten 2 thirds of a cover letter to customize for each application (WIP), a website with a bunch of stuff on it (portfolio, art, music, renders, photography etc), and my architecture portfolio, indeed profile is up to date, so is LinkedIn, though I don't have many contacts on LinkedIn  
I am a year into an application to become a construction officer in the CAF, however paperwork from Egypt is a nightmare and Covid has made everything much slower, international background check will take at least a year \*after\* I'm done everything, so I don't expect this to pan out anytime soon

Current plan is to actually resume applying to construction management/architecture jobs through the OAA website/Indeed, I am looking at doing an undergrad in Civil engineering since I enjoy it quite a bit (not a s much as architecture or art) and probably some of my courses will carry over, also gets me into the ""system"" which is I think the main issue, though I may be wrong, aiming for the co-op program at Carleton, haven't reach out to them yet  
I can post my website if anyone wants it, though wont post in now because maybe it will get flagged as spam? Idk how reddit algorithms work.  
Any advice is welcome, I can elaborate on any point that is unclear."

It has been a horrible facet my entire life. I was always told that I could get math if I tried at it, that there were moments my “brightness” shined through, but ultimately I am not the best math person. 

I am decent at coding and other forms of logic, just not math for some reason. I think I get overwhelmed by the formulas and it’s hard to push forward. I’ve applied to a data science internship since, to dip my toes in with AI, however I can’t help but feel a bit intimidated. A lot of people say you shouldn’t even try if you’re not a math person. 

I’m totally willing to work to get better, but I don’t even know where to start, and part of me is scared I’ll fail anyway. 

So realistically, how do I approach AI research? How math heavy is it in your experience? I’d like to have a realistic idea of what to expect."

o9s6co,3,2021-06-28,"Starting Fall 2021, seeking advice",Calad,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/o9s6co/starting_fall_2021_seeking_advice/,"Hello everyone! I am in the process of submitting my application to begin in the Fall 2021 term. I have been working in healthcare administration(medical billing/coding) in a large hospital network in the NYC metro area for the better part of a decade. I graduated college over 10 years ago with a BA in Economics, but I had aspirations of going to medical school and so took many STEM classes. After plenty of time in the field I have found that healthcare really isn't for me, the more time I spend within it the more burnout I experience. I feel stuck and its very deflating. I have been with a few different offices within the organization and it ends up the same, its more the work than the office.

After floundering for a couple years trying to figure out my next path a few of my friends and family recommended trying programming. I signed up for CS50 and while it is challenging the feeling when finally successfully completing a pset is incredibly rewarding.

I'd like to transition to this new career sooner rather than later. I'd like to complete the program anywhere between 1.5-2 years. Seeing how I don't have any experience in the field I would expect an internship would be highly beneficial, if not necessary, to help transition careers more smoothly. 

My current job is remote full time 9-5. Its mostly busy work and I would say anywhere from 5-6 of the 8 hours I am actually busy which would leave me some time to either decompress or study. My company offers limited tuition reimbursement with no strings attached as I've been there long enough. My wife is an RN that works overnights so I have a fair amount of evenings to myself. I have no other obligations.

Here is what I have planned out so far:

Fall 21: 161, 225

Winter 22: 162, one of (271/261/352) 

Spring 22: one of 261/271, 290. Perhaps more?

Summer: Internship? and/or 1-2 classes.

As i said, I'd prefer to finish the program sooner rather than later as I am burnt out in my current work. My understanding is a lot of the 300 level courses are gated by the 100 and 200 level pre-reqs, so doing the program fulltime is not practical in the early stages. Due to this I'd begin the program part time then at some point leave my job and transition to fully focus on my studies and career development. This also would give me enough time to take advantage of the tuition reimbursement my company provides. What point in time do you all think this would work best? We have enough money saved up and my wife is supportive of this and we would get by just fine for this period.

Regarding internships, at what point in the program would I be eligible for one? Do internships generally only start in the summer or are they available year round?  Does my proximity to NYC give me greater opportunity at landing one?

If there anything else I may have glossed over I'd gladly take feedback on that as well. Thanks for you time!"

o9tntf,4,2021-06-28,"Recent graduate with BS in CS, have no direction/idea what to do next.",thebriggis,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/o9tntf/recent_graduate_with_bs_in_cs_have_no/,"Some background:
I just recently graduated from a state school in NJ. It has a rising CS program, but it is not primarily a tech-based school. That being said, I did graduate with a 3.5 GPA. I worked part-time in a non-related job throughout college, so I did not have time for internships and did not do any co-ops. My projects outside of class assignments are zero, although I do have a decent website with database integration that I could post on my github that was a collaborative effort in a Software Engineering course.

I feel like my skills are rather limited as I haven't spent much time learning outside of what was expected of me in class. I have a lot of stuff that I do on the side, so programming has never entirely been my priority in life other than doing what I need to do to get by. As a result, graduation came and went without me deciding what direction I wanted to pursue in the CS field. I think I'd most likely be happy in SE, but I'm not sure where to start.

Questions I have:

o9u73a,4,2021-06-28,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (6/28/2021),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/o9u73a/weekly_job_qa_thread_6282021/,"Hi all,

Here is the seventieth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.

All the best,

\--Nick

&amp;#x200B;

The holographic screens floating in front of Cthuli flickered as they shifted through the air. A good few of them, each conveying various details that Cthuli had trouble trying to analyze all at once. Luckily, most information was relatively easy to gleam, like the three-dimensional map of the school with each room labeled and able to be picked apart in neat blocks. Or the status screens for Jackson and Reggie, detailing just about everything about them, from their heart rate to their mental state and any ailments affecting them. This would be useful if not because she was now unable to talk with either Jackson or Reggie. 

**! Dead Zone in Effect !**

The blinking red text appeared at the center of the cluster of screens, demanding her attention. ""Manipulations,"" they were called, these alterations to the game. Cthuli remembered that she had briefly seen them in the Player Manual. Raising a hand up, she delved into her storage. Turquoise particles flooded towards her hand, smashing together and forming a dark crimson tome just above her palm. Embossed onto the cover was an insignia comprised of three symbols from a long-dead language even most gods knew little of.

Cthuli caught the book and begin flipping through it. While the book itself looked compact, the number of pages was numbered in the hundreds of thousands. It was not meant to be completely understood and was constantly being changed and altered on the Staff's whim for whatever they'd want to add or take out. It was ironic that the most critical item they were given doubled as nearly worthless because of its absurd length. Fortunately, one could search through the confines of the book on thought and find the information they were looking for. Cthuli stopped on the page that detailed the Dead Zone. Looking for any way to counteract it.

**Dead Zone**

**Tier II Manipulation**

**The Dead Zone will disrupt all verbal/thought communication that would utilize the RequiOS System or any other means of long-range communication, including (but not limited to) cellular, radio, or telepathy, until the zone has been lifted. Ways of conveying information without language remain available. It is also possible for a player to temporarily null the Dead Zone for the use of points. This cost will consume two points for every second of the nullification.**

""Tch…"" Cthuli folded the handbook closed and tossed it in the air, the book dissipating into a swath of the identical particles that manifested it. Taking a look at the screens, Cthuli ran into another problem. While she could still see Reggie's POV, Jackson's had vanished. Glancing at his status screen, she could see he was…or should, have been still alive. His screen had a yellow hue to it, indicating his compromised state of health. 

By the looks of it, he was bleeding out slowly, the bite he'd taken to his arm being the culprit. He was losing 37mL of blood a minute, and that number was steadily rising. Running off her knowledge of primates, Cthuli knew that once Jackson lost a certain percentage of his blood, that was curtains. Though that knowledge was unneeded as the status screen relayed a nice color-coated indicator for total blood. That injury needed treatment, but with communication cut off and him disappearing, there was nothing she could do. 

Seeing so much detailed information about their physical and mental state made Cthuli uneasy about the implant in her own body. Were details about her being streamed and stored somewhere in this monolithic tower? ""Probably…"" Cthuli thought to herself. Not that she was in any position to do anything about it. Still, the thought of her personal anatomy being at the fingertips of who only knows formed a skeevy, disgusted feeling in Cthuli's gut. 

Reggie seemed to be unfazed by the sudden drop in communication, methodically making his way through the 2nd floor now. After having witnessed him kill three people so far with not so much of a threat to his own well-being, Cthuli was both impressed and mildly disturbed. Cthuli thought back to the moniker given to Reggie as he was displayed on the auction floor. ""The Meticulous Brute.""

Cthuli had spent a majority of the points allocated to her on Reggie in mostly uncontested bidding. The credentials and statistics she was shown would have had her believe he would have been highly sought after. Reggie was skilled in combat and had much experience in the games, being one of few that have lived through multiple rounds of games while actively participating in them. Yet, she was the only one to have placed any bid on him.

This had puzzled Cthuli. Even if she had little knowledge of how these games were played, surely such a piece would have been highly contested. Yet once the auction closed and she won, the other players there with her reacted like she'd done something terrible. Some looked at her with unease and anxiety, while others nodded their head in gleeful disbelief. Cthuli had thought to ask someone why, but she was much too nervous to try to strike up a conversation with any of them. Had she done something wrong? Made a mistake?

Cthuli pushed the thought from her mind. It was something she shouldn't be focused on right now. Now she needed to worry about how she could get her pieces through this first game. Cthuli clenched her fist, staring at the screens. What could she do? What little input she had been able to have was now taken away with the Dead Zone. The feeling of uselessness Cthuli had after that first encounter Jackson had now festering more in her gut.

Just then, Cthuli noticed something change about the 3d map of the school. The layout shifted, the rooms on the various floors jumbling together and shuffling into a seemingly random arrangement. Rooms that should have been on the first floor would appear suddenly on the third and vice versa. The corridors would expand and contract, and various rooms that hadn't been there before formed. The school itself was shifting into a labyrinth before Cthuli's eyes. 

Cthuli looked over at Reggie's POV and watched him enter one of the rooms where an item they needed should have been. Instead, he was met by another corridor, this one on the first floor, stretching to an impossible length given the size of the building. Reggie stopped suddenly, looking to observe his surroundings before retrieving something from his storage. Cthuli noticed his status screen suddenly change, a new ""buff"" appearing. ""**Spiritual Resistance UP**""

Reggie approached a nearby door, the plaque above reading 1-6. Pushing it open, he walked inside, the door shutting behind him. Cthuli noticed it led to some classroom on either the 2nd or 3rd floor, seeing the small blue marker that indicated Reggie's position on the map suddenly teleport. Reggie glanced around the room for a moment. Windows were lining the classroom wall. Behind them was nothing but darkness, no sign whatsoever of the town or night sky. Reggie exited back out into the corridor, only this time ending up in the nurse's office.

Reggie's body temperature suddenly started dropping, his breath turning to fog in the air. The door behind him slammed shut. He tried the handle, it was locked. Reggie looked back through the room. Cabinets of broken glass were filled with various rusted medical tools. An overturned metal desk surrounded by faded paperwork and three mildew-infested beds lined the wall. One of the beds was occupied by a writhing mass of…*something*. The room was much too dark to make out what it was from this distance. 

As if reacting to Reggie's presence, the mass suddenly split into three separate blobs, each sliding into some dark corner of the room. Reggie turned back to the door and began beating his fist against it. The wood splintered from the force of his blows but refused to give way. Suddenly, Reggie spun around, confronted by a hideous amalgamation of decayed flesh in human form. Misshapen asymmetrical limbs connected to a bloated torso, which comprised meat that looked like it was melting. Various faces covered the rotting being, each twisted in fear and agony. The creature made as if to latch onto Reggie's arm, but Reggie reacted fast and pushed it back. The flesh amalgamation's faces all cried out at once in a cacophonous ear-piercing shriek of many voices.

Cthuli flinched at the noise, the volume of its scream like it was in the very space next to her. While she'd be unable to communicate with Reggie, it seemed that non-descript voices would still get through. Electricity arced between the various metal probes along his gloves. Reggie punched the amalgamation, causing it to careen back into the darkness. To his left and right, Reggie noticed two other humanoid figures shambling towards him.

Quickly, Reggie turned back to the door and started beating at it again. His fist pierced through it, yet the door still held in the frame. Reggie punched his other fist through the door. He gripped onto it with both hands, tearing the door forcefully from the frame and tossing it an amalgamation that was getting too close. The door smashed into the amalgamation, its wood rotting into a black pulpy liquid when it contacted the creature.

""Shit…that can't be good…."" Cthuli muttered to herself. 

Reggie retreated through the now open doorway and into another corridor that seemed to stretch forever. Behind him, the door reformed from the bottom up. Cthuli looked over at the map and saw that the passage itself should have been normal length, yet what she saw through Reggie's eyes made it seem much longer. Reggie took a look back at the shambling masses and started hurrying down the corridor. Numerous more of these rotting things were awaiting him, forcing him to dodge between them. 

Cthuli knew that in Reggie's case, there was no way for him to know where to go. The school itself was changing at a moment's notice. While she could see these changes taking place through the map, Reggie was entirely in the dark. If he kept blindly going through doors, there was no telling how long it would take for him to get where he needed to be or what he might end up running into.

""There has to be something. Think!"" Cthuli's mind went back to the description of the Dead Zone. There was one part in which given a second thought prompted an idea in her head. *That she could still use a means of communication not reliant on language.* There must have been some way to indicate information to pieces without words. 

This whole situation, these games that Cthuli found herself forced into. Many aspects of them reminded her of video games. The point system, the layout of these games themselves, the status screens, the way pieces and players are given scores based on their performance. So many details that were right at home in the many games she'd occupy herself within the soothing confines of her bedroom. 

While Cthuli would usually find herself playing dating simulators or eroge, she was no stranger to other genres of games. RPGs, shooters, puzzles, rhythm games, Cthuli hardly ever left her room, so the repertoire of her gaming prowess could only grow. ""Pings."" Cthuli thought to herself.

The ""pings"" that Cthuli referred to is a method of communicating information to teammates in multiplayer games without verbal communication. They were quick and straightforward indicators used for various purposes to inform of potential dangers, valuable items, or places to go. Cthuli took that idea in mind and held her hand up to the map.

Taking a closer look at the map, Cthuli noticed that all the doorways had tiny lines running between them. Making an educated guess, Cthuli assumed that these lines would indicate where a door leads. The only problem was that there were many doorways with two lines jutting out from them, one from the left and one from the right. Cthuli needed to figure out what that meant and how this maze functioned. And to do that, she needs Reggie to test her theory.

""If this works, I hope it doesn't cost anything…"" Cthuli said as she tapped a doorway on the map, wanting to guide Reggie to the door. The doorway went from the solid blue of the map to light green. ""Ah! Did it work?"" Cthuli turned towards the screens. 

A doorway to Reggie's right suddenly started to pulsate with a light green light, matching the color on the map. Seeing this, a tinge of excitement overcame Cthuli. ""Come on! You gotta know what it means, right?"" Cthuli asked.

Reggie caught sight of the glowing doorway and went towards it without hesitation, pushing it open and walking through. Cthuli shifted her head back to the map and watched Reggie's marker glide across one of the lines to the 1st-floor boy's bathroom.

The moment Reggie entered the room, he was met with a man from the opposing group grappling with one of the creatures. On closer inspection, it was less grappling, and more he was being assimilated into the rotting mass's body. A searing noise emanated from the man's flesh like raw meat grilled over an open flame as his body started to decay rapidly. The amalgamation of flesh pulling him deeper and deeper inside of his body. The man cried out in pain, uselessly struggling to free himself, but his arms only sunk deeper inside of the creature's body like it was quicksand.

""HELP ME ALREADY! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!"" The melting man screamed out to a woman standing a couple feet away. She was trembling, holding a spiked wooden club in her hand. The woman half-heartedly swung the club at the creature consuming her partner. The creature didn't even seem to notice the attack. Instead its skin overlapped the man's head, leaving him to cry out a few muffled unintelligible yells before his voice cut. 

The woman back away and turned, being met face to face with Reggie. She looked like she was about to say something before Reggie clamped his hand around her head and forced it through one of the exposed sink pipes in one swift, brutal motion. The woman's body hung limply, held aloft by the rust-coated pipe that jutted through the back of her skull and out of her forehead. Blood and brain matter dripping down her face, mouth ajar, eyes staring blankly towards the stalls. A distinctively sizable chunk of brain meat limply dangled off the tip of the pipe.

Cthuli averted her eyes from the screen. She was never good with the sight of gore, not real gore anyway. Part of her wondered how Reggie could be so ruthless. This was what was needed here, though, wasn't it? Her father had always thought Cthuli was too soft. The majority of her family did. Her family and many of the gods that shared the same pantheon as her father had a similar sentiment.

Cthuli was the daughter of a renowned god, after all, one who had made a legendary name for himself through these games. He was a god that was feared for his brutality and strength through many universes. As such, his children had expectations set on how they should be. Expectations that had yet to be met by any of them. To their father, every one of his offspring were failures, leechees that suckled from his power and gave little of worth in return. Each incurring his spite as he felt slighted by their disappointing existences. This, in turn, would cause the children themselves to harbor animosity towards the family patriarch. Of all her siblings, it was Cthuli who most despised the legacy of her father and the brutality inherited with it. To her, the patriarch of the family was a father in title only.

Cthuli was in many ways reminiscent of her late mother, a woman from a pantheon far removed from that of her vicious father. It was this similarity that spared her the rod of her father's wrath and allowed her to maintain her sedentary lifestyle for a time. That was until her father's patience wore thin, and he inclined for a more survival of the fittest approach. Now Cthuli was here, and no longer could she be shielded from the violence she'd despised.

Cthuli snapped out of her thoughts when she saw Reggie went back through the doorway. She followed his marker, now traveling a different line and ending up in an empty classroom. The moment Reggie stepped foot in the room, the door slammed shut behind him. There were two doorways here, one behind him and one in front of him. Reggie seemed to be waiting for some kind of indication from her as he warily scanned the classroom. 

Cthuli noticed that going through a door that one line represented where the door would transport someone to, and the other line indicated the doorway that led to it. In simplistic terms, each doorway could only be taken one way, as after the door closed, the area behind it changed. With Cthuli's view of the map, this was easy to notice, but the school must have been near impossible to navigate for those without this tool. Movement appeared at the corner of Reggie's vision, the creatures now entering into view.

""Okay…okay…where to go? We need the items, so where are they?"" Cthuli examined the ever-shifting map, searching for the rooms containing the essential items needed to complete the game. 

A couple of shambling masses approached Reggie, screeching in discordant tones. Reggie struck one of them, the creature's body jiggling and contorting from the force as it collapsed back. Reggie looked down at his glove, the leather was starting to peel away, and the electrodes were becoming covered in rust. As another begun to close the gap, Reggie grabbed a desk and swung effortlessly at the approaching amalgamation. The wood shattered into hundreds of splinters that melted away into a black goop after piercing the creature's body. Reggie, still holding the metal desk leg, continued to use it as an improvised melee weapon to keep the creatures at bay.

Cthuli could only see the location of one of the remaining two items. It was the one that was located in the gymnasium, the other room that should have still held an item had seemingly vanished. With little time to think, Cthuli started plotting the way for Reggie to get to the gym. Tracing the lines that should lead him the right way, Cthuli pinged the door on the opposite end of the room. 

Prompted by an audible and melodic chime, Reggie looked towards the glowing door. He rushed towards it, smashing it open and emerging into a different classroom. Cthuli continued guiding Reggie through the branching paths until, at last, he'd enter the gymnasium. This moment punctuated suddenly by the live feed of his view becoming immediately and unceremoniously cut.

""Huh?"" Cthuli stared blankly at where the screen used to be. ""What happened?""

As if to punctuate her state of befuddlement further, another screen popped into existence unprompted. The contents of this screen seemed far removed from the ones Cthuli had seen thus far. It was a simple black screen with stylized 16-bit text reading ""Daughter of Despair."" The screen flashed with the crack of compressed audio thunder and an image formed behind the text, accompanied by eerie music that mimicked the kind you'd hear in a retro videogame. 

The image was of a humanoid figure with features impossible to make out from how pixelated they were. It looked like a girl, though Cthuli wasn't sure. Below the ""girl"" was a recreation of the school. Standing in front of it with various expressions of unease were three boys dressed in white school uniforms, two humans and one kino. Two of them Cthuli didn't recognize, yet she did know exactly who one of them was.

""Jackson?"" Cthuli mumbled. It was indeed Jackson, granted he was in 16-bit form and looked a few years younger, but Cthuli was sure it was him. Below the image, a small line of text blinked.

**PRESS START ALREADY**

""A videogame? What the fuck?"" Cthuli continued to stare at the title screen with a mixture of confusion and uncertainty. She'd compared these games to videogames and had in a way started to treat them as such, but Cthuli hadn't expected to be confronted by something like this. ""What the hell am I even supposed to press start with? And why does that phrasing seem so passive-aggressive?""

As if on command, a rectangular controller materialized right before her, a black wire running from it to the terminal. The controller floated up and down, seemingly beckoning for her to take it. Cthuli reached out, and soon as her finger touched its white plastic housing, the controller plummeted.

""Shit!"" Cthuli fumbled around trying to catch it, the controller bouncing off the palms as she juggled the controller between her hands before gaining a firm grip on it. The controller was quite simple, with 2 maroon face buttons labeled A and B, a directional pad, and a start and select button. Cthuli's finger hovered over the start button for a moment before she pressed it down. Another crack of low-resolution thunder played as the screen faded to black.

Around her, the white space became engulfed in darkness so tangible it was like liquid flowing mere feet away from Cthuli. From this vicious black emerged a new scenery, a classroom ripped straight from the school and manifested here. The screen transitioned into a CRT television that sat on the grimy floorboards. An old-school game console was set on top of the television.

""Fancy…"" Cthuli commented with a cursory look around. The other screens she had been using were each implanted in different CRT televisions that surrounded her. While this may have been neat to a few people, Cthuli thought it made things needlessly more complicated. Though something like this was clearly not done for the benefit of the player. Just a way to flaunt creativity.

Cthuli picked up an overturned chair and, after wiping off the mixture of dust and splinters, sat down in front of the TV with the game console on top of it. She looked over at the CRT with Reggie's status and saw his heart rate was increasing. Cthuli tried to shake away her concern and focus on what was in front of her now.

The ""game"" faded in, and Cthuli was met with an old school JRPG-esque bird's eye view of a classroom filled with students in the middle of a lesson. The sprites, background, music, all of it was perfectly reminiscent of games à la the SNES era. At the same time, there was something just a little ""off"" about it. Like the animations were too fluid and detailed. Too modern for the games it was seemingly aping.  

One of the doors to the classroom began to shake, accompanied by banging sounds before a trio of boys came tumbling inside the class. It was a little hard to make out through the pixels, but they looked to be fighting. The teacher rushed over to them, breaking up the fight as a black text box opened on the bottom of the screen accompanied by a portrait of the character talking.

**Mr. Evans: ""What are you three doing?! It's the middle of class and you want to act like children?!** **What are you even fighting about?""**

The boys looked to be confused about what was going on and had no answer for their teacher. Tersely they were reprimanded and sent to their seats. It didn't take Cthuli long to realize that these three boys were the ones she'd seen on the title screen. The camera focused on one of the boys, following him to his seat by the window. Cthuli was idly pressing buttons on the controller to see if anything happened, but she couldn't tell. 

**ƒ ƒX\[ƒ** **æ–Ê: “•Û‘¶‚µ‚½** **“ƒVE1bUVSb0pKRUc1ZlhvUDByZlhaNF9oeWlPM0o3WXY5cHcyQQ==‰ƒ‡ƒbƒg‚ª”½‰f‚³ƒNƒŠ”**

A corruption of text flowed through the text block, a jarring ringing noise playing as the text scrolled. The place where the character portrait should have been was nothing more than a mash-up of separate layers of spritework resembling a vaguely humanoid figure. Strangely Jackson seemed to converse with this entity as if he could understand what it was saying. 

**Jackson: ""Look, I don't know…we just started fighting.""**

It was impossible to parse what the corrupted character was saying to Jackson. Yet, it seemed that he could understand them just fine. Masking information like this concerned Cthuli little as she came to expect such. No, she was more intrigued by Jackson's appearance in the game. Taking a look at his portrait and sprite, the injuries he should have sustained were nowhere to be seen. Add to that the fact that he seemed to not remember anything about the game he was currently in, and Cthuli was beyond intrigued. ""Soul Warping…*really fucking fancy*."" 

To an average mortal person, that phrase would mean nothing. However, Cthuli was not an average person. She was a god, and even being a god, she was anything but your usual deity. *Soul Warping* refers to the act of transporting an entity's soul to another reality, dimension, plane, etc. It was an exceptionally rare ability for a god to have. Even if a god was capable of it, they'd need centuries to train themselves to use it. Mix that with the fact that Jackson obviously couldn't remember jack-shit about the games indicating selective memory alteration, and you'd have an absurdly powerful deity. Of the millions of gods that existed, only a handful would be capable of doing such. 

Cthuli would know. She had to do a group presentation on Soul Warping in high school. Seeing the high school class splayed out on the screen in front of her, Cthuli's memory of the time resurfaced. The heat of embarrassment reviving in Cthuli's cheeks. Cthuli only had to read out one paragraph and didn't make it halfway through the first sentence, having to fall back on one of her partners to bail her out. Her class laughed at her, of course. The first daughter of one of the most feared gods in Creation trembling with fear was too ironic. Even Cthuli's teacher just barely masked his amusement, making that sinking feeling she had worse. Though on the list of embarrassing moments for her in high school, that instance ranked on the lower end of the scale.

Cthuli slapped her cheeks and grounded herself back into reality. Clearly, the people running the game were in the upper echelon of higher beings. ""Guess they'd have to be to run this place."" Cthuli mused to herself.  

A conversation or more a lecture was being given to Jackson and the two other boys that'd arrived with him over witchcraft. Reading the dialogue being given to them by the teacher, it seemed to corroborate with the diary that Jackson had found. Although, there was something off about the way the teacher spoke.

It came off as unnatural or, in a word, *cliché*. The dialogue felt rushed too, like whoever wrote the game just wanted to force things along. The thought gave her a moment of pause as she remembered the place that Jackson found the diary and noticed that same desk in the back of the pixel classroom. It stuck out like a sore thumb here, just like when Jackson stumbled across it. What was with this classroom having windows compared to its non-videogame counterpart having none? Why did the diary only have two entries? Shouldn't it have been filled with them?

""You're kidding me…no…"" The realization dawned on Cthuli that she was seeing beyond the veil of the game and finding it to be sloppily put together. It was like someone with zero game-making experience tried to design a game. It reminded Cthuli of the old RPGs she would try to make in her ""wanting to be a game dev"" phase. ""Guess they let an intern design this match."" Cthuli joked to herself, for a moment not thinking about the genuine stakes still at play. 

After the teacher's lecture and proposal for the boys to write an essay on witchcraft, the screen faded to black. It faded back in as the rest of the class, besides the three boys, were filing out of the classroom, the teacher leaving them to go grab the book for them to write about. Cthuli tried again mashing buttons on the controller to no results. Or so she initially thought. It took her a moment before she noticed a tiny cursor floating in the corner of the screen, one she could move using the directional pad. Cthuli scrolled over to Jackson and, hitting the A button, was able to pull up a small menu beside him.

**Warn**

**Indicate**

**Command**

Cthuli tried pressing the same button on the other two pieces noticing the menu didn't show up. When she clicked on the corrupted character, all Cthuli got was another unreadable mess of garbage text. One of the boys, Paul, was trying to open the classroom door and finding it locked. 

**╟Â£óÞ¢á: ñ»舐 Ř§ŮaHR0cHM6Ly9tZWdhLm56L2ZpbGUva0k5alhBQUkjckJhbDR4b0ŘáÚÆ 舐 Þ¥¿????????Š Â£**

The character spoke again to Jackson, and he started to maneuver about the classroom. When asked what he was doing, Jackson replied he was searching for something to help with the door. Cthuli hovered over the messed-up desk, pressing buttons to see if anything happened. It was the most obvious place to look after all.

""Nothing…come on Jackson. Please just look at that fucked desk, dumbass."" Cthuli pondered if she should try using the Indicate function when Jackson said something odd.

**Jackson: Is it just the three of us here?**

Cthuli looked around the classroom. The corrupted character had disappeared. Stranger still was that no one in the classroom remembered seeing her, only Jackson. And he looked to discard its existence after a few moments. There had to be something more to that… didn't there? Cthuli logged the strange occurrence in her mind, uncertain of what it could mean.

Henry was the one to finally search through the obviously suspicious desk and found a key inside. Cthuli breathed a sigh, taking this conspicuous key placement as further proof of her theory that an amateur game designer was behind this exhibition. Of course, the key would be in the one desk sprite that looks drastically different from all the other desk sprites. 

It was when the door was unlocked and the boys caught a glimpse of what was outside that Cthuli's air of sarcasm vanished. Catching sight of the sprite form of the rotting witch as it chased down one of the students. After the student tripped and was impaled by the witch, a screen appeared, showing a pixelated close-up of the process of the girl being rotted from the inside out. Cthuli checked on Jackson, noticing that he had already closed the door and was holding it shut. From her point of view, Cthuli could see both sides of the door. Still, she could do nothing but watch as the witch floated by the door. The witch tried the handle of the door, a metallic clicking sounding from the television's speakers. Suddenly she stopped and continued on down the hall.

When Cthuli read the boy's plan to try and find a way out of the building, she shook her head. That wasn't how this worked. There wasn't going to be any escaping from this place. Not to mention that even if they weren't in a death game, they were still in a videogame. And what videogame is going to let you just leave out the front door? Though, even if Cthuli knew all this, it wasn't like she could just relay that information to Jackson. How easy this would be if she could just yell at him. Thinking for a moment, she remembered the command option. Opening up the menu, she selected ""Command"" as the boys were stepping out into the hallway. After she did, a text block appeared on screen.  

**""Define Command""**

""Uh…"" Cthuli whipped out the handbook again and scoured through it for the ""command"" keyword. ""Command…command…okay.""

**Command**

**Player Ability**

**Players may choose to give commands to their pieces in a way that forces them to carry out the given command. As long as the command is realistically achievable, giving an impossible command will result in the command failing. In the case of multiple commands being given at a time to a single piece, the most recent command takes precedence, and the previous command will fail. A command can be given by using the phrase ""I command \*Piece Label\* to \*insert command here\*"" This can be done verbally, telepathically, any way that ensures the command is understood by the piece.**

""Not really helpful for this use case…huh…"" Cthuli stared up at the text box again, tossing the handbook once more to the ether. Cthuli thought about what command she would give. Where was she even going to direct him towards? ""Ah…that old dude talked about getting a book from the staff room. Thinking about it, one of the items was supposed to be in the staff room… let's give it a shot. I command H381 to head to the staff room.""

**Command Initiated**"

So far I've had 1 offer with an infrastructure and cloud provider working under the Managed Cloud Services header (role 1). I've also had an initial call with the company I did my placement (internship) year with (role 2). 

I'm torn with what my next option would be, role 1 would give me experience with a new network vendor, and a large emphasis on further development &amp; training. Whereas role 2 I would be a lot more confident from day 1, having already worked in the team just at a lower pay band, again with an emphasis on training but possibly less than the first role judging by interview discussions. 

Beyond the day to day, role 1 is a multinational, but not a company I had heard of prior to applying. Whereas role 2 is a much larger company but only really operating within the UK, and is probably known by the vast majority of the UK population. The other benefit to role 2 is it would be in a city with a lot going on, whereas the other doesn't seem to have anywhere near as much happening. 

Finally I'm expecting the salaries to be virtually the same, potentially higher at role 2 but no numbers have been mentioned yet. In terms of remote working, role 1 doesn't have any plans to go into the office in the short term, at least not as a requirement to staff. Whereas role 2 is expecting to have staff in the office 1 or 2 days each week.

I would greatly appreciate any thoughts on this, been trying to work out my best option this early in my career."

Let me give you a little background.   
I am reporting directly to the director of a team and he has assigned me to one of the departments under him. Now, this department works on tickets coming in from the clients and there are not a lot of tickets coming in. Most of the time I am just sitting and staring at my Laptop's screen. The other problem is a lot of days are wasted in gaining access/ permission that is required for the work. 

Here comes the question.   


How or What should I ask the director to change my department which has a lot of work and I could get the best out of my internship. I have enough knowledge and skills to be able to work in any of his departments. 

 I also tried asking him many times about the access issues, there was no response from him."

Background: Graduated this spring with a degree in public relations (think marketing/writing background). I had some additional experience in the field (internship + certification courses) and have worked in freelance writing, so I tried *really* hard to be a good applicant and find *something* not soul crushing for a first job during a pandemic-I applied to, no lie, 270 jobs, and of that had 3 interviews. Job seemed great. Clear communication with them, friendly, great benefits and willing to do WFH (I’m chronically ill w/ ADHD as well as depression). 

I read reviews, emailed with them, it all seemed good and in line with what I wanted to do. They told me I’d have somewhat of a choice in working in line with my main skill: writing and marketing. They assured me onboarding would be slow and through. (Company is a large financial group but not “blue chip”- midsize)

Red flag #1: After asking twice during pre-first day discussion, my direct supervisor would outright dodge any questions about work I’d be doing or “a daily workday” example kind of questions. They never explain anything even now, it’s always “we’ll touch on that later”. Always just that it’s a “fast paced ‘family’” 

My first day was HARD, and they realized the Friday before I started, I had no equipment for remote work and rushed a laptop to the nearest office, over an hour from my home. So I got it after the whole drive and set up. Monday morning I’m getting ready for some meetings about basics and my first meeting is to find out I’m *actually* now in charge of an entire publication for the company, and it’s due in just over two weeks. No joke. They gave me the entire publication (5,000+ words) and told me to get rolling. The assignment was *not* along the lines of what we discussed, in an area I’m unfamiliar with (they knew), and required very technical knowledge in niche topics. I literally didn’t even know how to login to the “clock in” yet. 

I stayed positive. The whole week we hardly covered any of the hefty software they use and they’ve only discussed what’s due and are adding responsibilities daily, leaving me to sort it out. On top of the publication, they’re adding more and more with sometimes even shorter deadlines. I’m not even sure of the basics of who to talk to about these things. I’m in week 2 and this job is destroying my mental health. A coworker emailed me on a Saturday night to discuss my work, fellow employees who I’ve reached out to (by instruction, to gather quotes for the assignment) don’t know who I am or why I’m bothering to reach out, instruction is nonexistent let alone training…I’m worried I made a big mistake. 

HR is helping me have a meeting with my bosses, but I don’t know where to start.

-How do I explain that I need more training and the expectations are too much while I’m learning the ropes?
-Should I tell them I’m disabled? I clearly am going to need accommodations like extended deadlines and written instructions 
-Am I crazy? Are all jobs just this fast paced? 
-is it possible this is just a bad fit? 

Please be kind, I’m a mess over this and already working overtime and I sort of feel like I’m being gaslit by my job lol. It feels like they weren’t prepared for this position or a new hire and should’ve gone with someone way more experienced if the need was so urgent there couldn’t be any onboarding."

I think I'd definitely enjoy tech more than consulting (which is what I'm doing for my internship this summer), as I enjoy more technical work and like the idea of a better work/life balance. However, I can't shake the idea that I'm not good enough to code at a top company, and that I'll underperform/get PIP'd as a new grad.

I get good grades in all my project-based CS classes, but some of the kids that I work with seem to be more proficient and have that technical ""edge"" that I don't believe myself to have. I'm a very hard worker, so I'm not afraid or opposed to working extra hard to be on par, but I'm still afraid I might not have what it takes for SWE at big tech. Ideally, I would like to start out as a dev and then transition into something more managerial / PM still within the tech industry.

Furthermore, I don't want to make the leap into SWE/tech and then realize I'm not good enough once I'm there, as I feel I'll be stuck in the industry and would have missed my chance for something like consulting that recruits mostly straight out of college. Sadly, I've never done a SWE internship so I don't have that test experience to see whether or not it's right for me.

It seems to me that the standards of performance and raw ability required to succeed in SWE are beyond other roles/industries. Did anyone have similar feelings when recruiting for FT? Is the benchmark for not getting booted really as high as I'm making it out to be, or am I just psyching myself out?"

What I didn't expect was for her to raise her tone to a scolding manner, asking me if I was aware that I'm being watched and evaluated every day. That's all she said, after hearing me talk about how bad it was to wake up every morning and feel like my mind was shutting off, and not being able to get things done.

I already feel guilty enough, I know plenty about my responsabilities, I just wanted for her to tell me it's okay and that other people like me also go through this kind of situation. I didn't know what to say other than ""yes"" and look away. I was ashamed and felt a wall being built between us. Of all people I expected her to understand, and I've been seing her for a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

Some background information:

No past professional experience or internships. I have never applied to them before.

Other than my class projects, only one small side project where I created a web page (front end only).

Decent at coding but not the best. My past partners led the way/carried me.

Some relevant courseworks: web programming, operating systems, comp networks &amp; security, algorithms and data structures, 

Programming languages I have used: Python, C, C++, HTML, CSS, Javascript

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is:

What should I work towards now? 

Should I  start applying and using my referrals?

Should I do more projects/leet code to better prepare and boost my resume?

Should I specialize in anything (full stack, data analytics, UI/UX, etc) or just go for general software development?

&amp;#x200B;

I know my situation is tricky and it is difficult to give me a straightforward answer but any advice or input is appreciated. My goal is to hopefully have a full-time job within the next year.

My original project was a full-stack, but it was changed only for the front end because I was struggling too much.  All my short years as a CS major I only used Java and C++.  In my interview with them, I was very honest about my abilities, and I said I was open to learning new things, but I feel like I\`m failing miserable and I\`m thinking about quitting. 

My internship uses JavaScript, react, ruby, gaphSQL and a bunch of frameworks that I never heard about.  but now I find myself having tons of trouble understanding JS, in part because their code is so compact and it is so big and so many files that I feel often lost.  I kind of can understand what is going on on their code but I can\`t explain every single detail or recognize everything yet.  It feels like JS has a very weird syntax that doesn\`t even make sense. I have 2 mentors, one of them wants me to break the code down and explain every single detail, which is hard for me because I don\`t even know JS enough and leave alone react to fully understand everything and it has been adding to my anxiety a lot. 

On my own, I have been trying to learn as much of JS and react as I can, but again I find JS very confusing, no syntax, and the online tutorials are not even close to the level of complication of their database.  I\`m starting my 4th week already, and I didn\`t start anything on my project per se, only studying JS and going over their code database and playing with it by adding text, buttons,  and commenting on the code. 

It feels like they gave up on me doing any project, this only JS/codebase learning feels like they just found something for me to do without bothering the team too much.  On the other hand, impostor syndrome is hitting hard. I feel so dumb and inadequate that I just want to disappear. I\`m questioning myself a lot if I choose the right major, how can I work in tech if I\`m unable to learn a new language? I\`m the only intern in the company so I don\`t even have anyone else to compare my progress or even talk to.  Should I quit?  Is this normal?"

I would like some advice on landing my 2nd SWE position.

**Background:**I (21 F) am a based in SF and work for a start up based in Austin. I dropped out of college at 19 to attend a coding bootcamp and was hired immediately after as a $10/hr intern in September 2020. I transitioned to full time 6 month later (March 2021) where i was offered $85k + $5k sign up bonus.

Since I got the internship through a connection, the hiring process was extremely easy (I barely had a portfolio at the time or interview prepped leetcode much) and there was no interview during my transition to full time.

Since the startup is very early stage, I am only 1 of the 3 engineers there. I am getting good experience working here and have made large contributions to this product but the work environment is pretty toxic, and I am overworked and underpaid. I would like to start looking for my next job but I am afraid my lack of side projects and interviewing experience will make this process hard. On top of that, I must return the 5k sign up bonus if i decide to leave within a year of my start date (March).

How important is a portfolio/side projects if I have full time experience? How much longer should I stay at my current job before I start applying? How much time(weeks/months) should I allocate to study algorithms? Should I wait until next year to resign to avoid returning the sign up bonus?

Any advice is greatly appreciated! Thank you :)"

I did no internships, and honestly, have no confidence in anything  IT related.

I don't know. I worked retail throughout college, and just didn't do anything towards tech in my spare time.. I was just going through the motions (college after high school), and didn't really put much effort towards afterwards, and now I am lost to how to proceed.

My question is where do I go from here? I have a bachelors in computer science, no internships, and no confidence. I don't mind starting at the bottom, but from what I read I shouldn't be. I also heard  that getting certifications like comptia would be a waste with my degree.

A little background about myself ; I'm currently 22 year old graduate from New Zealand with a degree in Information systems and Marketing. Originally I was set on pursuing a career in IT but our government( New Zealand) launched a paid tuition initiative for skills that are in shortage due to the pandemic. So I decided it would be a good idea to put my search for a graduate job in IT on hold and take advantage of the fees free study and make a plan B for myself. So as of now I am currently working retail whilst close to completing a diploma in construction with a quantity surveying specialization, But soon I am going to finish this and I need to decide which industry I want to pursue. 

The most important factors to me when it comes to a job in the future would be : As low stress as possible ( I understand every job is stressful to some degree), Flexibility , 40-50 hours a week preferably(less is better haha) and the ability to work from home. Of course salary is important too but these two fields are very similar at each level.

I just wanted to hear your opinions on which would be a better career choice for me? I know that there is a big demand for both career(s) and they both pay really well.




____________________________________________________________________
IT

-I've always been competent with technology with from an early age so I'm really quick to pick up and learn new concepts related to technology. 

 -I dont have too much if any experience with coding (just basic sql and python). But again, our goverment is funding for tuition so I am thinking of taking a 18 week coding bootcamp which normally costs 12,000 dollars to bridge this gap.

 -IT feels very future proof and skills learned are universal. 

 -I achieved really good grades in my degree (A average with a 7.9/9 GPA) but I was too busy partying and do not have any internships or experience on my CV.

 -I hope to work in QA/Project management or even as a business analyst in the future or perhaps a role in cybersecurity . 

 -Talent is in high demand in New Zealand as of right now and all over the world

-Bigger industry worldwide

-Seems alot more competitive than Quantity Surveying. 


________________________________________________________________________________

For Quantity Surveying :

-While I understand the concepts taught in class well, I still feel as though I've barely scraped the surface and it is still a very unfamiliar field for me. I feel like I will have a very big learning curve when I enter the industry.

-I have no relevant construction skills and again no experience in the industry.

-I also achieved good grades in my diploma (A- Average).

-I like the idea of not being glued to your desk all day, as it is regular for quantity surveyors to be out and about on site.

-It seems that the ability to WFH is more rarer as a quantity surveyor but it is available. 

-typical to have lots of benefits such as company vehicle, phone and laptop etc in construction.

-Seems slower to progress in whereas in IT, I've seen some of my friends progress to the top of their salary range in a matter of 3-4 years post graduation.

-The skills I been taught seems to be mostly limited to New Zealand and Australia. If I were to go somewhere like America or Canada there would be totally different regulations regarding buildings etc
________________________________________________________________________________

I know that I will have a hard time trying to break into both these industry as a graduate with no experience, but once I'm set on which I'd like to pursue I'll look for some relevant experience/internships.

Thank you for reading! I'd love to hear any advice from someone in either of these fields or any advice /opinion at all is greatly appreciated."

TLDR : am început primul job in programare ca junior Java dev pe Microservicii (sau cel puțin așa ar trebui) la o banca din țara și aici nu fac mai nimic/nu învăț mai nimic.

Acum puțin despre mine: am învățat programare de unul singur, ca o reconversie profesională, iar pe parcursul învățării m-am agățat de orice oportunitate gratuită care in mod normal i-ar fi disponibilă unui student in domeniu - am făcut cursuri de Java de la Google, Frontend prin cursuri gratuite oferite de firme (Ex: Cognizant), curs CS50, iar acum fac și Mobile oferit tot de Google.
Între timp, după ceva interviuri și respingeri, am primit o oferta concretă la una din bancile din țara. Am ales-o pe aceasta și am dat la o parte alte oferte care erau doar internship, deși companiile păreau mai promițătoare și pe oameni ii cunosteam de la cursurile pe care le făcusem. Am zis ca-i mai bine sa am o oferta concretă, full-time.

Trec 2 luni și puțin iar eu n-am învățat mare lucru aici, doar am idee in plus despre ce fac anumite tooluri folosite in industrie, cum decurg ședințele in sistemul Agile, putina arhitectura de microserviici (doar din ce am citit eu separat, nu din ce am lucrat) și cam atât. Nu sunt absolut deloc pregătiți sa primeasca un începător sau măcar sa aibă o idee despre ce sa facă cu el. Poate chiar am uitat multe din noțiunile avute înainte.
Ma macină treaba asta zilnic, știind ca in loc sa am de lucru ca sa pot învața ceva și sa-mi fie de folos pe viitor, stau in schimb sa mai “ceresc” câte ceva de făcut - iar de obicei primesc de modificat niște log-uri, rezolvat bug-uri minore.
Nu as vrea sa fi muncit atât pe cont propriu ca sa o cam frec p-aici și sa se ducă tot efortul pe nimic.

Voi ce părere aveți de situația asta, ce mi-ați recomanda sa fac? Sa încep căutarea de ceva nou, sa mai aștept poate poate sunt băgat in seama și sa mai fac ceva “vechime” de luat in seama la CV? În timpul programului învăț lucruri noi, acum m-am luat de învățat Golang si totodata urmez si un curs de mobile. Încerc sa ma mențin activ si sa învăț mereu ceva nou, dar mi-ar plăcea sa se întâmple asta si la locul de munca.

Mulțumesc de atentie și sorry for the long post! 😁"

I have good skills in javaScript, python, css, JSON, and i am good in mathematics as well

I am really in need of a job in my field to get a skilled assessment and apply for a visa in the country that i live in.

Is there any chance that i am not getting reply as i am IT student and most companies looking for software engineering graduates for software engineering position. 

Does any one know about this?"

I'm currently applying to almost any software positions like software/systems engineer, Software, and IT interns.

I am expected to graduate in March-2022 so I'm sort of applying to some Full-time positions as well but it might be slightly too early. Let me know if need additional information or have any general tips. Thank you!

I am a computer engineering student at the moment and i want to start my professional career in cloud computing. I have build up some fundamentals and basics about cloud and AWS over research and online videos. 

I have done a couple of internships before as an IT Support. But the company I applied to right now is on a more advanced level that i have not yet experienced.

The role is stated as AWS Support in which i will (hopefully if i get the job) in short, work with all AWS services and create solutions while implementing best practices + monitoring infrastructure.

I would very much appreciate if anyone could give me some advices for the interview as well as what might they ask from me regarding AWS.

Also since it’s my first full-time job in the field, i have no idea what is the salary range for a role like this. Keep in mind i live in a somewhat poor country.

Thank you so much for anyone reading this and giving me their time to help me.

Have a wonderful day!

Update: Interview is Thursday 1st of July at 8:00 am UTC"

For the implementation I am given quite the freedom to choose whichever technology I want, though they have suggested Python or C++. Unfortunately I do not know any C++, I do know C but I think its gonna take me some time to learn C++. 

So I went around looking a bit and I came up with 3 final choices:

1. PyQt5 (Python) 
2. Java Swing
3. Electron (Javascript)

 I have also stumbled upon this issue of 'licensing', like PyQt5 is free only if its open-source, otherwise there's like a cost. Since the desktop app would only be used by other developers in my company, is this something I have to worry about?

I actually would be presenting these choices to my manager soon, but I would like to some input/suggestions. Any other library I should check out?"

I've been spending my weeks doing some leetcode, checking out random free online courses, and applying to more jobs.

I feel like I've had no success in my job pursuit with my email inbox pretty much being filled with ""Thank you for applying to company {X}"" and nothing else.

Every time I look for new grad positions, all I see is job descriptions asking for 3-5+ experience in some framework or technology I have never heard of or have I only touched for 10-weeks of my college journey. I still apply because what's there to lose, but yeah, to no avail. And now, I got spam emails and random phone calls from Recruiters asking if I'm interested in Sr. Software Engineer roles. Like bruh.

I've had my resume checked and revamped by friends who I consider exceptional students (working at: Twitter, Salesforce, LinkedIn, Amazon), So I don't feel like my resume is the issue. I got at least one not-special internship from a small company under my belt so that must mean something I guess.

The only thing I feel lacking is that I am a hybrid major (Half CS + Half LA). The college I fall into is LA still so my education says ""BS in Liberal Arts and Computer Science"". I'm feeling that maybe recruiters just instantly see ""Liberal Arts"" and chuck it away. At the same time, I don't feel like my major is that much of a concern as alumni from my major pretty much all end up as software engineers. And the college itself is quite reputable / top ranking in California. But it is a very new and small department with only a handful of students. The pool of alumni is incredibly small with only software engineer examples.

I'm starting to doubt myself on whether I'm applying to the right things or using my major correctly. I've mainly been applying for software QA roles as TDD feels like the main thing I've taken away from college with friends motioning for me to get into the same field. At the same time, I've been advised to look into consulting positions which I've been applying to as well (but honestly more interested in an engineering role) with about as much success as my software job search.

I just don't know if I'm taking the job hunting path correctly. For software engineer roles, I've been trying to learn popular frameworks but feel like there's too much new stuff for my bad-at-retaining-memory brain can handle. Unless I'm doing something consistently, it all disappears from my brain given 1-2 weeks time. I've done probably 200 applications since Spring with only a handful of interviews.

Worst to me being that I never was the best programmer. I was known for getting projects done fast, but not efficiently since I brute force hard and stayed up late hours. So my algorithm skills suck which leetcode has made me realize nonstop. Is my direction just bad? Any tips for job hunting for people of my situation? Thank you for listening to rant.

EDIT: For anyone interested in courses I took in college in terms of CS courses:

* Intro to Computational Art
* Fundamentals of Comp Sci
* Data Structures
* Project-Based OOP and Design
* Intro to Computer Organization (MIPS Assembly)
* Microcontrollers
* Systems Programming
* Discrete Structures
* Algorithms Analysis and Design
* Intro to Database Systems
* Intro to Mixed / Virtual Reality
* Computer Graphics
* Intro to Software-Engineering
* User-Centered Interface Design and Development
* Calculus 1-4, Linear Analysis, Physics 1-3, General Chem.
* My Project-Based major courses (2) which were more of game-development / design"

Then for the rest of the first year it felt quite slow because I didn't really learn much. We did relational databases to 

In my second year I had algorithms and then a web framework course where we had to use Angular and then also Java Spring for a REST back-end (which was nice because now there was an actual application for Java other than text programs) and it felt like I learned a lot.

Then I did a mobile semester with an Android course and a  React Native team project and since then I feel like I haven't really learned that much after some slowdowns in school.

With the skillset I had so far which is basically web technologies, a JS framework, two mobile frameworks and some back-end stuff it was enough to get an internship after this summer. But I want to be able to do more and I really don't know where to go or what to focus on. It's like there's a feeling I still have a lot of gaps in my skill set but I don't know where to go to learn and close these gaps.

For example my UX (both the user experience part itself and the UI part) are lacking so I have trouble designing something usable that actually looks nice, despite being pretty okay at the front-end at the JS level I somehow still have trouble with implementing designs into CSS as well.

On the back-end it seems like I've only really scratched the surface. I can just open some endpoints and set up either a Spring back-end or a NodeJS Express backend and t hat's about it. I have done some stuff with JSON Web Token or whatever but it felt like I barely understood it. There's also a ton of stuff I came across in terms of back-ends that I really don't know much about, like for example optimizing the retrieval from the database and just the whole industry-standard of doing that stuff.

Then there's like lots of other things like machine learning and cloud and getting deeper into databases.. And I don't really know what to focus on at all. I don't know React fully yet despite it being more popular than Angular and a good career choice to learn, but after going through some documentation and 1/5th of a course I feel like I won't really gain that much by knowing it. Like sure I can make apps in React instead of Angular now, but I still don't understand a lot of technical concepts.

What I mostly wonder is where I am even supposed to learn some of this stuff, because for example I keep hearing about microservice but I feel like I'm not quite in the context to understand how to apply it. Do people just read books? What do people do exactly to learn about all this stuff? Courses seem like an inefficient way to just keep learning, since someone must have learned about it somewhere and is now teaching you the mostly diluted version of what they know. 

I'd like some advice if someone can help me with this feeling of being lost about where to learn the more intermediate level stuff and where to even go."

I always feel and treated like an outcast in my own country (Asia), on my family and peers I am easily ignored and felt like I'm not essential and if I am gone no one will miss me.

And due to my social awkwardness I'm not good at making friends, it's telling when the ones that I consider friends are the online people at a forum that I frequent who accepted me for who I am. And because of that, I have this subconscious desire that maybe I'm better off migrating to other country because I think that I would be accepted there. In reality this might be way too far fetched, but I justified myself that even if I'm hated on other countries, at least it's because I'm a minority. The pain is different when you're among your people and they treat you undesirably.

However one person befriended me. At first it's because I asked her out and she said yes so I thought it was a date but she just considers us friends and I'm cool with that. Months go by and now we've been friends for 2 years, she's like the person I talked to the most, but it's not perfect. Whenever I texted her, for some reason the messages didn't arrive until next day or until I send a new message, and it caused me to think fhat she ignored me. But I understand that it's not her fault because there may be technical issues, or maybe she's just busy.

Recently I just finished my internship and the hardest part of my life has now commenced: determining my future. I have made it my goal since the last 3 years or so to move out of the country after studying, and due to how I endured those loneliness and pain and attempted suicide a few times and constantly thinking about death, I gave myself an ultimatum: Move out of this country before I hit 30 or not, permanently kill myself because I just couldn't handle the pain anymore. And now I only have 4 years left.

And now because my internship has ended, I got even more restless due to the impending time limit. My family have started to ask me to find a job, or continue interning at the place I interned, which I had terrible experiences of and is hesitant about returning. My family doesn't know about my time limit (although lately I have been dropping hints) but they do know of my intentions to continue studies overseas.

Regardless, I just can't fathom the idea of remaining in this country any longer, and feel like I need to get out no matter what. So I vented and vented to my friend and she understandably listened (among many other problems that I shared to her) but I also feel rather bad of venting to her. Like feeling the burden.

And then the leadup to the fuck up commences. My mind started to mess with me, made me think that what if my friend caused me to stay in this country? But my restlessness causing me to abhor the idea of staying here makes me come up with a conclusion: I need to get rid of everything that causes me to be trapped here permanently.

A few days ago I texted her, thanking her for being a friend, and said goodbye. She replied asking if I am okay, which I forced myself to ignore. This morning, she texted me again and later noon she called me. But I started to feel bad about ignoring her so I return the call, and told her everything's fine.

But later that evening, I told her that I lied, I need to cut ties. She asked ""why, you don't want to be friends with me anymore?"" but I couldn't tell her the truth so I just said ""I don't know"" and she lost it, saying that she trusted me and that we promised to be friends forever, and that I broke the promise and said bye to me.

So there you go. I fucked up big time by getting into a fight with possibly the only person that cares about me in this country because I was so afraid that her care prevents me from getting out of this country.

Later that night I texted her and gave my explanation, she just blueticked me. While it is expected, the glimmer of hope is that she doesn't block me, so maybe she needs time.

TL ; DR my life sucks in my country and I need to get out otherwise I might snap and commit suicide, and I cut ties with my closest friend because I'm afraid she will cause me to stay."

I was originally majoring in computer engineering, so to not lose those credits I decided to do a minor in computer science. In my cover letter, I dedicated most of it to my areas of expertise: creating, designing and/or implementing electronic navigation and communications equipment aboard aircrafts. I had exactly 4 sentences related to my computer science minor (and even then, it was about the areas that I knew of it and had worked in before)--but that's all it took to land an internship in computer science. The recruiter was also my mentor, and she knew that my cover letter was not directed towards computer science, but she thought that it would still be a good opportunity to expand my skills in this area.   


The good pay and popularity of the company convinced me to not pursue the offers I got that were more related to my area, as these offers were either internships with Universities which I'm not interested in, or they were offered waayy too late when I had already accepted this original internship. My mentor for this internship contacted me early on in order to ""prepare"" me, and gave me only two tutorial links for fairly simple concepts on version control and navigating directories. Me, thinking that I was on a good path and getting a headstart, did these tutorials.  


Now, as for the goddamn internship itself, I'm working with fucking parallel computing this, and high performance computing that, and dockerfiles this and third party libraries for that and I honestly feel like a goddamn whale out of water. I don't understand anything, and at this point I'm afraid of just admitting this to my mentor because whenever I don't understand something they go a step back--but I don't even understand that step back!!! It feels like I needed at least 3 to 4 core classes, like this internship was /not/ for a computer science minor, but a computer science major. I feel like this was just a grand joke from the company's side, like ""Hey, I put this lil hands-on technologist monkey in an intensive, abstract computer science internship."", ""You fucked up a perfectly good technologist is what you did. Look at it, it's got anxiety.""  


So yeah... not sure what to do, if there's even anything from me to do. I'll keep hitting my head against the wall with these concepts until the brunt force of the blow breaks through the wall, I guess."

I got a conditional offer letter from my school district, but I could not attend because I needed a SSN, and I currently do not have one at the moment.

I have always been positive when people see me, but negative in my inner thoughts. I feel like life itself is coming to an end and mostly everyday feels like the end of the world. I have been constantly searching for a job as a computer science major for almost half a year now and nothing yet with a year of internship experience. I received my bachelor's degree in the beginning of the year with a 4.0 GPA. I have been working in customer service since I was 15 years old and I am now 25 and I am tired of that job. I have completed college and am struggling to find any job related to my field including an internship. I see my relatives and friends moving on with their career and here I am yet to find a job and no sign of hope. I currently am not receiving any unemployment yet although I keep certifying. And the lines are always busy to ask about the situation. I owe people money and yet when it comes to celebrations, I still have to give money as gifts even though I'm pretty much broke. I lost most of my money in the stock market and crypto. My mining rig only gets $20 a week. My girlfriend gets frustrated with my sensitivity and just had a fight where she mentioned about breaking up. At the moment she doesn't want to talk to me and here I am not sure what to do anymore. In my head I plan to just leave and just wander the forest and just die from the heat and hunger. I'm too scared to cause harm to myself, so maybe dying from hunger and thirst will make me faint and die. I know people will be worried, but I often wish I was never born. There's really nothing my useless life can offer to this world. BTW, this is my 3rd girlfriend now. My first one cheated on me 5 times for 2 years and my stupid ass forgave her 4 times and ended it on 5. I know my current one won't cheat, but she easily gives up on me when I get angry. 

TLDR: No job willing to hire me based on my degree, no unemployment, gf probably going to leave me, owe money, lost money in stocks and crypto, pretty much my purpose now is to just be a driver to my family. They probably see me as a disgrace and look down on me and don't take me seriously.

Anyways, that's my story. Not really asking for any opinions. Just wanted to write it all down. Just wish I could die in my sleep or have someone to kill me in my sleep. I'm at the point of giving my life to the devil. I don't know anymore, I rather be possessed by a demon at this point"

Here's my situation, I was first hired at my company as an intern while I was still getting my certification in Network Support Technology. Before this, I was working 12.5 hour shifts in a hospital's kitchen as a supervisor/cook, barely making over minimum wage. The contrast was like night and day, I didn't know it was possible to not dread going to work! I worked really hard and enjoyed making everyone's IT experience the best it could be! But since I was only an intern, I knew I wouldn't be around forever so I started applying around for jobs hoping I could use the experience I've gained as leverage. Someone in management must of caught wind of this, because I was offered a full time position pretty shortly after mentioning I was applying around. I've been working here for over 3.5 years since, under the Network Administrator who was promoted to an IT Administrator and joined the management team.

Throughout this time, I gradually started to realize something: the IT Administrator is incompetent. I didn't know it at first, but I started to realize how frequently he was wrong and how often projects would just fall to the wayside under his supervision. He's why they needed an intern in the first place, the guy just can't perform what's expected. A few examples of what I mean:

* Our virtual machines, including our on-premise Exchange server, were running on snapshots of snapshots. Probably every 2 months our Exchange Server entered a dirty shutdown state.
* All of our networking and administrative accounts used the same password, including service accounts or even simple LDAP lookups.
* Our desktops all had local administrator privileges because ""it's frustrating to troubleshoot why something isn't working"".
* Backups were failing because the server that hosted Veeam was trying to back itself up, which frequently corrupted the database.

Apparently we were outsourcing IT projects to another integrator for stupid amounts of money per hour and they also performed the job inadequately, probably milking what they could because they knew this guy was a fool. Since I've been hired, we have not outsourced one project and I've implemented everything myself. When it comes to helpdesk issues, staff almost exclusively reach out to me because by the time the IT Administrator figures it out, a week has already passed or he just forgot about it. Something he mentioned early on that echos in my head frequently is how I was making the IT department ""too good"". I can only assume he tried to look so busy and valuable that the CEO wouldn't think once to let him go.

And that's probably the main reason he was able to get away with this for so long (over 10+ years), our CEO literally doesn't know any better. I've caught the Network Administrator on several occasions telling ""white lies"" (his words) so the CEO will stop breathing down his neck. A good example is our disaster recovery plan (handled by the IT Administrator), which in it's current state pretty much accomplishes nothing. If our office were to go into flames, the plan is to move everything to our second branch (which features no virtual environment) and conduct business from there. The only problem is that we have no equipment to recover to and our most recent exercise consisted of us going to a different location, plugging into the network and VPN-ing into ours. This satisfied both the CEO and the board. I shouldn't have to explain why this wouldn't work...

Over time I've also caught wind of the IT Administrator taking credit for my own accomplishments, likely to not draw attention to the lack of how much he actually does anymore. For example, I rewrote our phone script to accept dialing by extension at any time along with reporting capabilities so we know what people are pressing when they dial in. I thoroughly understand how everything works in our call center because of this now, but recently we hired a company to create a jingle for commercial use. So the marketing director, in a staff meeting, stated she wants it to play as our hold music and name dropped the IT Administrator stating he was going to take care of this task. If I rebuilt the whole system, why are you asking the wrong guy to change it? I can only assume that in the monthly management meetings, he is taking credit for my own work. Since I'm not present in these, I can't speak for my own accomplishments. This has happened more than once.

It's really come to a point where I exclusively do all the work, while he sits in his office reading the news or handling his personal issues. So at this point you're probably thinking, why haven't you said anything to HR? Well...

* When I was hired full time, I was told that when the IT Administrator retires (supposedly within the next few years), I would be his successor. Since he'll be gone eventually, I'd feel really guilty to just ruin his retirement plan.
* I went from a super shitty job to a job that I genuinely love, which pretty much changed my whole life (I was able to move out, buy my own car and live comfortably). So knowing how hard it is to get your foot into the door with no prior experience, I feel indebted to his incompetence because I wouldn't of been able to be where I am now otherwise.
* I have been complacent in his ""white lies"" for a while, so for me to unearth the truth so late into the game would likely make me look bad as well.
* I don't handle confrontation as well (I'm on the ASD spectrum).

He's guilty of other things as well, like he has a side gig he's established over the years by putting ads in the paper to clean off viruses and upgrade components. He brings these into the office and actively works on them during his shift. He's even asked me for help on occasion. Anyways, I'm tired of playing along and I'm tired of working hard only so we both look good; so here's a couple of my own ideas on what I should do:

* Find a new job, keep things professional and state that when the IT Administrator retires, give me a call. Hopefully they notice the massive shoes I left to fill and realize the IT Administrator isn't doing anything.
* Find a new job, hope I get a counteroffer and ask to be promoted to management, then just be pacified by the raise/ability to speak for myself.
* Find a new job and in the exit interview, drop the bomb out of spite.
* Implement a ticketing system and use the overwhelming amount of evidence to show how little the IT Administrator actually does. (I've actually requested this on all of my annual reviews)

Hopefully this was interesting to read, I'm curious on what you think would be best or maybe if you could share any experiences of your own."

oalhsy,1,2021-06-29,2+ year gap unemployment due to an accident + depression issues. How can I get back to it?,Shuai_Nerd,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/oalhsy/2_year_gap_unemployment_due_to_an_accident/,"Rough outline of my timeline:

* Graduated in 2017 as a math major
* Worked as a math curriculum creator for 1.5 years (all of my prior work experience had been educational).
* 2019, an incident happened and I'll just leave it at that. Lost my job after--I will clarify that I didn't quit nor was I fired outright (at first). I just stopped showing up to work one day, didn't answer my boss's emails or calls. Ghosted my former company. I wish I didn't burn my bridges but what happened happened.
* Unemployed from 2019 \~ start of 2021. COVID happened (I was still unemployed then), and I decided I didn't want to be stuck anymore in this depressive state. Got some gig work tutoring (very minimal with covid) but I had some work nonetheless, and it's the only thing I could even get into short of retail/fast food.

There are such paths I want to take but I can't help but feel overwhelmed at the first and greatest hurdle of landing \*a\* job. A regular job that can be at least relevant to what I want to do. I don't want to teach or be in education but be a data analyst.

I have been studying sql/python for the past few months and have a small personal project. But obviously 2+ years of unemployment and no real relevant experience leaves me probably the least competitive candidate there is and it's hard to get over that fact.

I have anxiety thinking about how I'll talk about it if/when it comes up in an interview (which I haven't had any yet, and it's easy to see why...). At this point my only shot is my cover letters, but I feel lost.

I'm trying not to fall down or stagnate again but it's hard as more time passes and still I'm not employed. 

I'm considering trying to find a data entry position because that's the only thing that seems viable to at least get a foot in the door--and yes, I know it's menial and goes nowhere and the only similarity between that and analytics is the fact that data is in the name--but it has to beat being unemployed/underemployed.

At this point I'm willing to be an intern for free. I just want to have the chance to get experience and learn and progress forward, but it feels like solid concrete in front of me. 

Sorry it was a lot of writing but to give a summary in question:

\- Is it worth taking a minimum wage/menial job (data entry) to get some work experience after 2+ year gap unemployment? Or should I hold out, keep learning and doing personal projects, and just try to get a -relevant- job?

Pay to me is not a priority. I just want to get back into it. Thanks for taking the time to read this"
oalm28,1,2021-06-29,CS Internship or Orientation Student Coordinator?,nathanblanken,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/oalm28/cs_internship_or_orientation_student_coordinator/,"I am a rising sophomore CS major at a university with a very good CS program. I am currently an Orientation Advisor (OA) for the university. They are looking for current OAs to be Student Coordinators (StuCos) for the next summer. The responsibilities of the StuCos are to hire a staff of around 30 people, plan new student orientation programs, and be a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the OA training class. There are more roles and responsibilities but those are the main ones.

I am going into my sophomore year in CS, and so far I have one big data project I worked on, but I mostly only know java, so my coding skills are not phenomenal in any way. My parents are saying that I should get some kind of CS internship this next summer so I can more easily get a job by the time I graduate. 

My question is, is it worth gaining those valuable skills such as hiring, planning, and determining the logistics for a team of that size at a university with about 40,000 undergrads, or will I be better off in the future by getting an internship earlier? If I get an internship next summer, that gives me two summers of time to do internships before I graduate, but if I do the StuCo job, I will only have one summer to do internships before I graduate."
oalnaw,31,2021-06-29,How long did it take you to get hired? Any tips?,pyxelnybbles,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/oalnaw/how_long_did_it_take_you_to_get_hired_any_tips/,"Hello! I'm actually kind of nervous typing this up. I've been practicing programming for so long and i still feel like such a poser or fake or something when I ask silly questions like this... Anyways. I graduated recently, and I've been applying to jobs for months before I graduated. i did all the things everyone told me to do to be successful, I was active in clubs, university stuff, joined a sub-group to the student government stuff, and I had an internship that ended up being one of the best summers of my life. I practiced more programming languages than my school taught (they focused solely on Java and I barely had projects for two years, which wasn't enough for my mind). I just... Don't know anymore though. I have so much trouble and I can barely find an interview. I feel so lazy not being in a job, and while I thought I was applying casually, being rejected is hitting harder and harder.

So I wanted to know, how long did it take you to get hired, where you are today? And are there any tips you have to offer? Something you wish you coulda told yourself when you were younger. Thank you so much for your input!!

Edit: Thank you ll so much for your input, its a pleasure hearing your experiences and advice!!!"

**Interviews**

*-Georgetown:* a little awkward but mostly good

*-Duke:* went very well, the interviewer was literally me from the future

*-Robertson Scholars:* bombed it, I was so nervous

**Essays**

Personal statement- 30/10

* This is one of my best essays. It showcases my passion for social justice and activism and what it stemmed from while also telling about a few moments in my life. It was funny without trying too hard. Every adult that has given it a look over was very impressed.
* Supplemental Essays:
* ""Why x school""-
   * I used a basic outline for all of the schools that requested one of these essays and just inserted different things that interested me about each school. IF YOU WANT TO DO THIS MAKE SURE TO QUADRUPLE CHECK THAT YOU DON'T MISTAKENLY LEAVE IN INFO FROM ANOTHER SCHOOL!!! I think my essay for this prompt was pretty good 8-9/10 depending on the school.
* Diversity/Aspect of your Identity- (8.7/10)
   * Spoke about Judaism and what it means to me, how it has led me to become an activist and a leader, etc.
* A quote you like/Activism- (9/10)
   * told the same story in different formats to address the prompts, but basically about why I am an activist.
* book/person- (9.3/10)
   * A bunch of essays were reformatted about my distant cousin who did many incredible things and had a biography written about him.
* Current Global Issue + how to solve- (7/10)
   * I tried to go with the niche path and talk about unsustainable palm oil farming (an issue that truly does concern me and I have become passionate about during my time at the zoo) but I think the schools must have been looking for a more pressing issue.
* superhero/villain you relate to- (9.9/10)
   * I wrote about how I relate to Harley Quinn (portrayed by Margot Robbie in ""Birds of Prey"") and this is probably my favorite essay I have ever written.
* What's your favorite word- (9.5/10)
   * I really liked this essay because it was funny and cute, showed my personality, and really let the reader into my struggle of learning two languages at once when my family only spoke English.
* Struggle/Issue + how you overcame- (4/10)
   * I hated this essay prompt because I felt (and still feel) like I haven't gone through anything significant enough to write about (or at least, nothing I felt comfortable addressing at that time). I wrote about being the only girl in the basketball programs I participated in and how sexism affected my confidence. I didn't like my essay at all but it made me a finalist for a full ride from that school.

**Additional Information:**

1. My grandparents read and edited my essays. While it added stress to the process, I know it was a huge help and made all the difference. If you are lucky enough to have educated and willing family members, definitely accept their help. If not, find someone who can serve as an editor for you (that you trust and know they can write well).
2. My mom worked on the financial stuff so I only had to focus on the application part. Again, if your family is willing this is definitely something you want.

let me know if you have any questions, post them here or dm me! this process was so stressful and draining but if you put energy into it, you will not be (completely) disappointed when you receive your results. I'm so proud of all of us in the class of '21 for getting through the year and I wish the class of '22 the best of luck &lt;3"

The entire code base is comprised of variable names that are obscure acronyms and code with no comments. No matter how hard I try to read through the code, I can't understand anything and just want to cry. I try to read the wikis but I just can't concentrate when there's 100 new variables named in some acronyms that all look the same to me, and every third word is one I have to read several articles to understand. I ask my mentor for help but I don't even understand anything he says, and even though he tries to answer my questions, at a certain point I just don't know what to ask because I understand nothing. I have to leave my office to cry multiple times a day. An internship is literally the most stressful thing I can think of, it's literally an extended interview where you're trying to impress everyone while knowing absolutely nothing. 

I've been trying to figure things out on my own and only ask ""educated"" questions where at least I tried to find information on my own. At this point, should I just tell my mentor that I have absolutely no idea what's going on, despite everything he's helped me with over the past week? I literally want to quit my internship or ask to switch projects because I don't see how this could get any better or how I could possibly understand this code base enough to complete my assigned project in time. Does everyone feel the same way when they start their first SWE internship?"

Hi all! Just wanted to share my job-hunting experience to make this place a little more positive and hopeful.

I graduated Summer 2020 from a mid-tier UC school by the skin of my teeth. I nearly failed out *twice*, so I wasn’t exactly a stellar student. I had some physical and mental health issues going on that necessitated many doctor visits, went through a devastating breakup, and overall wasn’t in the best state of mind. Long story short, I got treated and I’m doing a lot better now.

I didn’t start applying to jobs until May 2021. I didn’t know anyone in this industry so I wasn’t sure how to network, I only had unrelated work experience working at a small local business, and I didn’t have any internships or cool personal projects. Given all this, as well as all the horror stories on this subreddit, I was super anxious about starting the whole job-hunting process.

In total, I sent out \~20 job applications (yes I know those are rookie numbers), mostly through LinkedIn, before getting my offer. I got callbacks from 3, interviewed with 2, and 1 turned into an offer. The interview process itself wasn’t too bad, mostly programming and data structure trivia type questions, a few LeetCode easys, a couple behavioral rounds, and a small take-home assignment.

I did my best to be likeable, personable, and enthusiastic, did a lot of research into the company, asked questions about the company based on my research, looked up all my interviewers on LinkedIn, and made sure to think aloud and be very communicative during my technical interview.

Not gonna lie, luck most certainly played a part. I didn’t meet all the requirements in the job description and the job listing itself had hundreds of applicants. I didn’t even know the language that was on the job listing title, but I applied anyway.

I’m not exactly sure why they chose to call me, but I’m so glad they did. I’m shy as hell and not a social butterfly, but I took extra care to work on my soft skills and I think that helped.

For those wondering, base pay is low 70’s plus benefits, job title is Software Engineer, and I’m in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. I know it’s not FAANG/Big N, but I’m just happy to be given a chance somewhere.

Good luck to all of you who are still searching!"

Should I spend the remaining of summer 2021 making more web projects, or should I start learning data structures and algorithms to prepare for coding interviews?

Or should I do something completely different?

**Background:** I am currently in a medical coding assistant program at my local CC. After completing this program, I will be receiving a Medical Coding Specialist Certificate of Achievement. From what they have stated, this program will enable me to take the AAPC exam.

Within this program, I will be taking an internship course where I will intern as a medical coder. The course will begin this Fall 2021. It is my responsibility to find an internship with a medical facility before the internship class course begins. This is where my issue is. I do not know what to write on my resume.

I do have a resume, but I am sure my current resume is not the same when applying for internships. The 3 courses I have complete so far are called ""Electronic Health/Medical Records,"" ""Medical Terminology,"" and ""Introduction to Medical Billing and Coding.""

What sections should I include on my resume? In other words, how can I build a resume fit for an internship? And lastly, do you have any other tips in the process of applying for internships, like what questions to expect during an interview or what facilities are best to apply for?"

oatdku,3,2021-06-30,How to set boundaries &amp; build respect with my boss?,Ssashkaa,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/oatdku/how_to_set_boundaries_build_respect_with_my_boss/,"Hi everyone, 

Quick intro:  I have 5 years+ of experience in the business area. However, because I changed my specialization,  I am currently going through my internship. I think it is going very well, and I enjoy what I am doing. They often say.. ""you are the best intern we've ever had...""

I have this subconscious feeling that I have to be extra nice, appreciative, and thankful for the opportunity (maybe it is cultural), and I sometimes think I am putting myself down.

So, for example, when they would say that ""you are the best intern..."" I would just smile and shake my head. (Although, thinking back, I should own it! Of course, I am... I am probably the only one with 5 years of experience!)

I want to seem like I am easygoing and nothing is bothering me, but it started happening more often, and I am kicking myself for not setting better boundaries early on. 

For example - we had a presentation recently, and as I was presenting my part, I was cut off after maybe 30% of my presentation because of time constraints. And we had to move on with the next part. On the one hand, I understand the time constraints... But because of this situation and other instances that start to pile up, I want to make sure I am sending the right message - something like ""I understand, but I don't appreciate that my part was cut off."" Also, if my boss thinks it was not important for our attendees to hear, he could have told me beforehand to make it shorter or just leave it in specific parts. This way, I wasted time on the preparation. And I feel like my time &amp; work are not respected. 

SUMMARY:

We have a one-on-one today. How do I effectively build my boundaries? How do I make sure he doesn't see me only as an intern but also as an experienced human with valid points of view?

Have you had a similar experience before? How did you handle it? Thank you!!"

Be me, portuguese dude in Portugal (24M) withering away at home because of lockdown and so on and a friend and schoolmate of mine asks me if I want to go to Ireland and work at the place where he had an internship 2 years ago. I thought about it for a long time and had various reasons to not come but knowing myself and that I'd say no and threw myself into it and eventually said yes to force myself and not lose a potential opportunity or at least experience as I've done many times in the past.

This said I'm not the most socially apt guy and I have this fear and insecurity of missing out on everything and from time to time I do something crazy as a way to make up for it.

I eventually said yes to the invite and star talking with the hotel I'll be working at, get the  plane ticket, covid test and all that jazz but it's important to note that I came with 3 other people and they are... Rebels and at times childish but they are a fun bunch to hang out with and also very good and hard workers. They are always pushing people to do whatever be it drinking, smoking weed what have you. And this is important to note for later.

Ever since we got to Ireland a little over a month ago our situation hasn't been the best. We have great accomodation as we are staying in hotel rooms with everything we could ask for (electricity, internet, big ass TV, your own bathroom...) But we are lacking what we value the most and we specifically asked for: Food ( which they promised ) or a way to cook food and a washing and drying machines ( which they also promised). Now, it's been over a month and we got nothing we tried talking to them and they are always postponing it to next week and make up some BS excuse like ""oh we have to wait for the owner to come in."". No you don't. You're the general manager of the hotel. USUALLY that's not how things work. Me being ""clever"" thought about not paying my weekly rent of 80€ as a way to get back to them and make them notice that we are unhappy and I was the only one to do it and also because OmG im sUCh a REbEL. Eventually one thing led to another and we started drinking and smoking in our rooms which wasn't allowed. We smoked weed which would be illegal which is important to mention. As we are all strapped for cash because we are being heavily taxed because we don't have a PPS number yet which is something along the lines of Ireland's social security (?) and we are on foot far away from town since accomodation is in hotel grounds we started pecking at the leftovers of the hotel because all we had at home to cook was a microwave, a toaster and sandwich maker and the only food they gave us was also microwave food so we decided we'd buy our own. After we start going for the leftovers we also noticed that all bottles, specially wine, that go into the the steel/still(?) room of the restaurant I'm working at are being thrown away and I look at the bin and see bottles with a considerable amount in them. I had the idea of why not take them with me and get everyone a drink? At this point I'd never thought it would be the hotel's property because it was going to be thrown away as there is a lot of unnecessary waste which rubs me the wrong way because we are starving over here and also everything is clearly being mismanaged which adds to our unhappiness. I took said bottle on Saturday. On that night after work I grab the bottle and a joint and meet everyone in one one of the rooms and the fire alarm goes off. We've had a false alarm so I wasn't worried and took the bottle back to my room to hide it, not because I thought that having the bottle was illegal or wasnt allowed but I'm case management came by I wouldn't have to explain or hear about it. Suspicious I know. The next day one of us heard a conversation between the Restaurant Manager and the F&amp;B Manager about a bottle being missing and that they had no idea where it was and they would have to check the CCTV. FUUUUUUUUCK. We all started panicking but did nothing and thought this would blow over.
Yesterday we got called one by one to the HR and General Directors office to be questioned. It felt like a damn inquisition which it kinda was. The first thing they ask is if we aware of anything illegal going on where we are staying. My heart starts racing like there is no tomorrow, I could feel the blood rushing everywhere and my stomach going numb, I'm starting to sweat and at this point I'm nervous af because I didn't if this was about the bottle of wine which I didn't think it was a big deal or the weed so I said no that I don't know anything of the sort. They give me one more chance to tell the truth and be honest or they would have to envolve the police, reminder that I'm in s foreign country and only been here for a month. I eventually mentioned the bottle and took responsibility for it to clear everyone else and we went into details of how we did it. I told them that if the bottles go in I assumed they were to be thrown away like all the others and that I commented with everyone else and that's when I had the idea to pick it up from the bin once I took it outside because like it's free drink if the wine is still okay and it's less waste. As I'm telling the HR and General Manager this, they don't buy it because I only mentioned the one bottle and this is the second time I've done it so now I'm waiting for something to happen and trying to brainstorm a way to get rid of the empty bottles.

TLDR: came to Ireland for work, unhappy with situation, tried to take what I thought it would be waste for myself and my friends as a way to make it up, investigation was called and police was mentioned and now I'm at the risk of getting fired and arrested in a foreign country

I know it's a confusing read. Just wanted to get it off my chest. It's my only day off today so I'll try and explain anything I can if you wish to know or ask questions"

I'm pretty happy in my current role: slightly above average compensation, good learning opportunities, and 100% remote now.  To practice interviewing, I have been interviewing for other jobs since December of last year.




I'm honestly surprised at what I have seen in the interview process since then while applying for data and ML-related jobs.  I have seen startups with a huge number of steps in their interview process and long take home projects, intense technical interviews at bigger tech companies with no room for error, and companies that have historically asked easier questions asking more difficult leetcode questions.  To my surprise, I have not received any job offers, although I am not complaining given that I am pretty happy with where I am currently working.




At my level of experience, I feel like a new grad applying for jobs.  Also, I'm surprised at how little most companies care about what I accomplish at my current job compared to how I perform in a technical interview.




As an ""average"" engineer, I feel like the job market has been increasingly favoring professional interviewers and ""leetcode engineers"" over other job applicants.  For example, my friends knows a software engineer who has worked at 5 prestigious tech companies in his 3 years of experience.  What that tells me he has never worked long term on any software projects."

Would taking this gap semester put me at a huge disadvantage for transfer admissions? I am starting to have 2nd thoughts and am considering calling my state school to ask if I can accept their offer now. Emory will only allow me to take 2 classes this fall at another institution so I will have some grades to show. I will also be taking summer classes next summer to make up my credits. I plan on immersing myself into EC’s and internships during the fall.

My high school stats are pretty good, I had a generally upward trend of grades and got a 5.0 my senior year. My EC’s were pretty basic though.

I would appreciate any advice for my situation! Thanks so much!"

Must have a Driver's license and own reliable transport

Minimum 3 years relevant experience in a similar role

Good understanding of MS Server software

Excellent understanding of MS Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.)

Knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Programming experience in Java and C++ is beneficial

Programming experience in VB/VB.NET required


My point is No IT professional with that kind of skill set will go around looking for Help desk roles , Heck that looks like a Junior Web Developer role, and the same companies are always complaining about lack of Skilled Labour in South Africa.  Also note a Web developer in south Africa will probably be earning around  $30 000 to $40 000 per year depending on experience which is way more than this role

I'm not saying companies should hire unqualified workers , But surely I can know how to do a helpdesk role without a Degree or 3 years experience ,  just a short training program would be enough.

Also if your Race is White you're more than likely to get rejected because companies are forced to Abide by the BEE laws that force Racial Quotas on them 
 
Also owning a Car in south Africa is very expensive , Petrol costs  $1.19 per Litre or 0.314 gallons and you still have to pay significantly higher for the car because all of them are imports with heavy taxes and don't forget insurance and [the infamous e toll system](https://businesstech.co.za/news/trending/106137/5-reasons-why-e-tolls-failed-in-south-africa/) It's so frustrating how they demand so much for an Entry level job , How am I supposed to get 3 years of relevant experience , It's difficult enough to get enrolled in a 12 month internship program and most internships don't accept anyone who had an internship before.  The cost of living in Urban cities is also very high btw.

I have internship experience in research, writing, and marketing with non profits or public sector both in U.S and abroad. I work as an academic coach for h.s kids and I enjoy being a mentor. I just hate the low pay, lack of career path at this non profit and diversity. For a long time I have felt my lack of business skills or specialization in something like HR, education etc has me at a great disadvantage. I considered a counseling degree but the debt to income ratio, working conditions and emotional toil makes it unattractive. I also want to leave the USA and would like something I could do potentially in another country. 

 My career counselor has suggested going to grad school for a masters in Instructional design, adult education/learning because I am interested in learning and development. I enjoy having space at my current job to develop curriculum for students using research on emotional social skills. I just do not care to teach in front of classroom or taking kids on field trips and crap. I have thought about getting a master degree in management to switch over a year after graduation, but other than HR maybe I do not care to focus on profitability. I actually want my work to be beneficial to people and have a greater purpose. So here i am. Trying to balance profitability with meaning meh. I am an INFJ by the way or ""counselor."""

I also have been looking to different “requirements” before starting to apply to jobs; I’ve used freecodingcamp, Alex the analyst, SoloLearn, stratascratch, etc. I have a solid grasp of SQL and the different Python libraries (numpy , pandas, matplot, and seaborn). I even did a small project using data from kraggle to show the wage gap between men and women from different industries (the project shows data importation, data cleaning, and data visualization/modeling). 

Yet I feel like everything I’ve done, someone can either do it better and faster than me and that it’s not enough. I feel like, if I apply anywhere it’s a laughable project and can be easily ignored by a company.

So I ask, does anyone know of a service that could provide some sort of internship to get real world experience or some sort of mentor ship that could help take my current knowledge to a more intermediate level rather than basic?

They review my pay and gave me a big reimbursement(17k AUD) from being underpaid. This is my first job.

I did ask for a raise. I knew that I was underpaid, but I'm living on a visa and is still studying working casual only so there wasn't much I can do about it (graduation in 3 months ) But I think the company realise that it's getting to me and I was going to leave after I finish my study if this continue. And they have increase my salary to an above competitive rate and give me the payback mentioned above.

I'm not sure how business work. Why and how did they come up with this decision?

But I really don't know if I should feel happy or angry about it.  They underpaid me that whole time and because they knew I need them for my visa. I wish people know what kind of things foreigner like me have to put up with, sacrifice to stay in a different country. I'm angry with the culture that encourage teamworks while some people in the group are underpaid. The more I talked to the other folks, the more I felt like there was something wrong with me that I was a failure because I  got less pay. But at the same time, I know that I'm incredibly lucky especially as a foreigner to get a job during uni. I started out as an intern with this company and progress to a casual role and they offered me a full time role after I graduate. I do get along well with the people I work with. This is today news, but before that I was really wondering whether if I should leave. If I don't leave now, I have to bet on this company for my future visa plan and stay for at least 3-4 years (yep). And if I leave, I really don't know if other companies'd be any better and this will be a huge bet.

I really have conflicting feeling about this. Not sure how to act, what messageI should send, what things I should do so they will  continue to respect me moving forward."
oazp8i,4,2021-06-30,Very lost biology grad w/ CS minor. Should I enroll for the fall so that I can apply for internships or just self-teach myself until I am able to land a FT offer?,iamthat1dude,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/oazp8i/very_lost_biology_grad_w_cs_minor_should_i_enroll/,"Hi everyone! To give you some background, I'm a recent biology grad from the Bay Area who took most of the major CS lower division courses (OOP, DS&amp;A, discrete math, linear algebra, calculus). I honestly thought about switching majors to CS halfway through college but I was pretty set on medical school back then.

Anyways, I've decided I want to work in tech but I'm not so sure how I should plan out my journey since I'm a year out from school and my programming/CS skills are a bit rusty. However, it seems like getting a masters in CS would make my life much easier in terms of getting past recruiter screens. I'm not sure if bootcamp would be worth it for me since I feel like I already have a somewhat solid foundation. Realistically, it seems like getting a SWE job without a CS degree is almost impossible considering I'd be competing against others who majored in CS.

I've already been accepted to OMSCS for the fall but I am thinking of applying to some others that are on-campus as well as the online masters program at UIUC.

My main concern is whether OMSCS is the best fit for me in terms of helping me pivot my career into tech. I'm not sure if I am putting myself at disadvantage by not applying to others masters programs considering that they might possibly land me better opportunities but will probably be more expensive ($60,000-90,000).

I also hate to say it, but it I scared recruiters will think that OMSCS is a degree mill and will disregard my application. If anyone else was in a similar situation as me, I would love to hear what you decided to do and if it worked out for you or not.

Here are the different options I have:

1. Attend OMSCS part-time or UIUC part-time and try to get an internship that will hopefully turn into a full-time offer
2. Attend an on-campus masters full-time and also try to get an internship that could possibly turn into a FT offer
3. Don't attend any masters program and try to use my CS minor along with side projects to get a job (Realistically, pretty difficult)

**TLDR: Should I teach myself the skills necessary to get a job in tech or would it be better use of my time to enroll in OMSCS and get an internship that will hopefully lead me to a FT offer?**"

I’m suppose to be a junior this upcoming semester but had to take a way less credits for a couple of semesters due to reasons I couldn’t control. (I have credits towards my sophomore year but not enough for my junior year)

I originally wanted to go into the cybersecurity field and I started my eMajor in cybersecurity in 2019-2020. But as time went on I found less interest in that. And recently transferred to another school and decided to change to a computer science major. Although I’m not completely sure I wanted to continue my degree, I just don’t feel like college is for me. 

A quick disclaimer, for these last 2-3 years during school I have been taking short cuts with my programming assignments. Getting help from others or other sources online. I feel like I have a basic understanding but no real experience in any languages or fundamentals. I want to learn and do assignments/projects for myself but I consistently lack the motivation and discipline. Taking that into part I need help as where I should go from here. 

I currently have in interest in going into web design, but no prior experience. Also I’m not sure if I should go into front end, back end, or full stack. I’m not big into art/design, which I think front end devs need. I’m mostly an introverted person as well but I want to step out my comfort zone. I want to be able have a good paying job and to have flexibility to be able to work from home and not always in an office setting.

But what I really want to know is should I continue with my cybersecurity degree, or take the route of doing a boot camp and building my certifications and getting real world experience. 
 
What steps would I need to take if I don’t continue with my degree to be successful in the future. Without college and a degree it seems harder to make connections, get internships, and get job opportunities that require a degree. Are there any boot camps that provides you with a mentor, and opportunities to make connections and get internships, etc? 

If someone has been down this path before or knows what I should do please let me know."

I’m now thinking about next steps, and am wondering which would be better: a masters in CS or a second bachelors in CS?

UBC in Canada offers a 2 year program to get a bachelors in CS if you’ve graduated from a non-CS degree. I think this would be a good way to get a CS degree, some potential internships, and it’d catch me up on everything I missed from not doing CS in school already.

There’s also the potential to do a Masters degree. This would also give me a CS degree and a chance of getting internships, but I’m worried it may leave me with some gaps in my knowledge. I do however think this would look better on my resume compared to the bachelors.

What I didn't know is that he (the host) gets an email every time I do because today I was bouncing around in zoom because I just wanted to check and he sent me a message on Microsoft teams. ""Are we meeting at 1 or 1:30?"" And I said 1:30 since it was already 1 and I wanted more time to work on stuff. 

But then he replied that he saw me in the zoom meetings so he thought I wanted to meet earlier and I don't know how to respond. So he probably got several emails for me clicking these links. And keep in mind I've done this multiple times...

I'm a rising senior in Computer Engineering at a top 50 University in the US with 2 past internships in software development (1st was fortune 50, second was big tech) and a co-op in controls/R&amp;D in electric vehicles. I'm interested in pursuing a Master's degree in Vision/Robotics at the best school I can go to. I have a 3.4 GPA and project work and course work on robotics/vision and embedded systems, but unfortunately, no research work. Is anyone able to generalize my outcomes without research?"
ob4stg,10,2021-06-30,What does agility say about fixing a team with bad teamwork?,Eloyas,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ob4stg/what_does_agility_say_about_fixing_a_team_with/,"I got my computer science degree this year. I did an internship at a credit union and while the organisation is huge, the team was nice and productive. Once my internship was over, they offered me a permanent job, which I accepted. Since teleworking will inevitably end at some point, I asked to switch team for one that's based in a city I want to move to.

The problems started when I joined the new team. There is a lot more red tape, the project owner and scrum master have no technical knowledge and are obsessed with doing agile perfectly. Each hour of work tracked, rigid planning, constant estimation of time remaining. They feel this is necessary because the team was consistently failing to reach their goals and agility is based on data. I'm pretty certain I'm losing 50% of my work hours in pointless meetings where I have no useful input and that don't concern me.

Then there are the other devs. There's no one with an ounce of leadership, yet they argue about every single detail endlessly. There's always one guy who wants to adopt the ""best practices in the industry""... which aren't applicable at all in our company. People are having flamewars in code reviews. There's so much turnover, you're considered senior with one year in the team. Also, the discussions are so slow because one of the guy has the habit of explaining everything tangentialy related to the subject before getting to the core issue. Feels like a rambling old man stuck in the body of a 30 years old.

So, decisions take ages because we need consensus and we can't appoint a leader because that goes against agility Every retrospective we complain about spending too much time in meetings, yet nothing changes. In fact, more meetings are called to find the root cause of the problem, but no one acts on it because no one is explicitely made responsible of implementing solutions.

This isn't what I signed in for. I feel miserable at work and I each time I suggest loosening up the processes, I get told this goes against agility policies and that it wasn't working in the past anyway. It's been two months since I joined that team and I completed 4 tasks... I just can't stand all that inefficiency. It's not even that the people are rude, they just have terrible work compatibility. Outside of work they're quite pleasant to talk to.

I don't know what to do. What are you supposed to do with people who nitpick everything and can't get to the point to save their life?"

This is my 2nd week as an intern in a cable manufacturing factory.

Here at 4 different stations, the operators gather 3 times a day (after each shift) to complete a very simple PRINTED form that was made in excel (date? was there any incident? what happened? what did you do to contain it? station leader name?).

I collect the forms from each station every day and compute the answers into an excel worksheet (with the same format as the form) which I'm having trouble with since the factory workers have atrocious hand writing

what my boss now wants me to do is to automate it, so that somehow they can fill the form with their cellphones (so it has to be mobile compatible) and it auto updates the excel worksheet by adding rows.

Is there a way to do that in a simple way? thank you so much in advance"

I am also planning to do a Master's Degree so narrowing down on one of these two track would guide me in my Master's research and specialization.

The reason I am struggling to decide is because I haven't had much experience in either area and how my career would look like if I picked a particular track. I like math and statistics and really enjoyed CS 348 (SQL, querying databases, etc.) which is why I thought Machine Intelligence would be an enjoyable track for me. But I am also very intrigued by ethical hacking and the Cryptography course (which I head is extremely hard!) that is part of the Security track.

I was wondering if anyone who is in or who completed the Machine Intelligence and/or Security track could give me a rundown of how the classes, internships, and/or career are in those fields. I want to know more about what types of jobs/job responsibilities I would probably have for either of these tracks as well. Thanks for the help + advice!"
